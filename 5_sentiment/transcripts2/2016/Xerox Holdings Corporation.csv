Today, we are announcing significant actions that will define the next chapter of our company. We'll spend much of the call today discussing our plans to separate into 2 strong, independent market-leading",1496,"Good morning, and thank you for joining our call. Today, we are announcing significant actions that will define the next chapter of our company. We'll spend much of the call today discussing our plans to separate into 2 strong, independent market-leading companies. We'll also discuss the multiyear strategic transformation program announced today. And of course, we'll discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results and 2016 guidance. Let me begin with our plan to dramatically change the way that we generate shareholder value. 
Today, we announced that the comprehensive structural review begun in October has been completed. The review has been a top priority for our Board of Directors and the executive team. We engaged outside advisers including independent advisers to the board in this process. It was a robust assessment of options for the company's portfolio and capital allocation that would best position the company to maximize shareholder value. It became clear through this analysis that the benefits of separation outweighed the benefits of maintaining containing the current structure. 
The board unanimously agreed that the optimal path forward for Xerox is to become 2 market-leading focused publicly-traded companies. We are confident this is the highest value creating opportunity for our shareholders, for our clients and employees. These companies will both be significant Fortune 500 scale companies and leaders in their markets. One comprising of Business Process Outsourcing business; the other, our Document Technology and Document Outsourcing business. Document Technology with 2015 revenue of $11 billion, will continue to lead the Document Management and Document Outsourcing market, leveraging its superior technology, solutions and innovation capabilities. 
BPO, with 2015 revenue of $7 billion, and already a leader in the growing market, will continue to pursue growth opportunities by capitalizing on its deep industry expertise, market-leading automation solutions and track record of global delivery excellence. I will discuss unique strengths, top line financial profile and growth opportunities of the 2 companies in more detail shortly. But first, let me talk about the compelling rationale that exists behind the decision to separate these companies. 
We have 2 strong businesses, each facing different market and client realities. Document Technology faces modest secular declines in its market while BPO participates in a growing, but rapidly evolving market. The businesses have distinct operating models and cash flow characteristics and very different growth drivers and competition. The Document Technology business is one in which operational discipline and a commitment to transformative productivity is vital to sustaining quality and managing costs, and increasingly interconnected digital world. 
Doing that right creates strong profitability and cash flow that can be returned to shareholders and invested in selected growth opportunities. BPO on the other hand, needs to be highly adaptive, able to innovate and adopt technology quickly and shift its portfolio to address the fast changing needs of its clients. We're seeing how new technologies like Software-as-a-Service and robotic process automation are changing the way that Services are delivered. Additionally, clients are requiring deep analytics for operational insight and greater personalization. The BPO market is growing at a greater than 5% rate and the majority of the revenue streams are recurring. 
Based on this, we concluded that these businesses will be stronger and able to create more value for shareholders, clients and employees as independent companies. We're creating 2 companies that will be market leaders, benefiting from enhanced strategic and operational focus, distinct and clear financial profiles and capital allocation policies can simplify organizational structures. As standalone companies, they will have compelling investment cases and be better positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities and expand margins and market share. 
We see the BPO company as one focused on revenue growth, margin expansion and disciplined investments in attractive growth markets. Document Technology will leverage its track record of market leadership and strong cash flow generation to a sustained and investment-grade rating and shareholder-friendly capital allocation plan. Now let's look at more closely at each company. 
The Document Technology company will be the global leader in a $90 billion document management and document outsourcing market with a presence in approximately 180 countries. We have a broad portfolio of products and are the equipment revenue market share leader. Our Managed Print Services offerings are widely recognized as best-of-breed by customers and industry analysts. Despite secular decline in the printing industry, our Document Technology business remains highly profitable with a newly driven revenue representing more than 70% of our sales. 
Through relentless cost discipline, this business generate strong and consistent cash flows that would allow us to make strategic investments to generate, to penetrate higher growth markets such as ink jet, high-end color printing, Managed Print Services and work flow. BPO is a leading enterprise for the next generation of Business Process Outsourcing with $7 billion in revenue. In this business, we enjoyed the #2 position in market share in an industry that is expanding by more than 5% annually. We're advantaged with differentiated capabilities to help clients improve their flow of work, to bring expertise in managing transaction, intensive business processes and are applying new innovations to automation solutions. 
We have market-leading positions in health care, transportation, public sector and a range of other industries. Our high recurring revenue and high renewal rates reinforce our confidence in our ability to grow market share and expand margins going forward. We are very excited about the opportunities ahead of us for these 2 businesses. With increased strategic focus, we can capitalize on their unique strength and capture the value creation opportunities that we see in each of them. In conjunction with the separation announcement, we have also launched a strategic transformation program, targeting incremental savings of $600 million over 3 years. This brings our total cumulative savings targets to $2.4 billion during this period, which includes ongoing productivity initiatives. 
In 2016, we expect a total of $700 million in annualized savings. The plan is company-wide and will include a thorough review of how we work and how we operate. Bottom line, we're not only optimizing our portfolio and capital structure, we're also driving a strategic transformation. This will improve our competitive position and help expand margins in both our businesses during the separation process and beyond. 
Our employees will benefit from working for industry leaders with streamlined structures and fast decision making. The companies will have greater flexibility to align employee incentives and rewards to business performance. For clients, each company will maintain it's leading service delivery and innovation excellence, but will be able to more quickly respond to market forces and client needs through focused and agility. And for investors, focus to companies with optimized capital structures and capital allocation policies to present distinct and compelling investment cases and will be well positioned to position value. 
Let me spend a moment on the separation process itself. We are committed to executing the strategic actions seamlessly and in the shortest possible timeframe. The separation is expected to be completed by the end of 2016, subject to customary conditions. We expect that the transaction to be U.S. federal tax reef for our shareholders. During the process, we will remain focused on our clients, partners, suppliers and employees and delivering strong financial results. There are of course, a series of key milestones that we will need to achieve in the upcoming months to complete the transaction and we will keep you updated on our progress. 
And as you read this morning, Xerox entered into an agreement with car like, related to the governance of the BPO company following the plan separation. Details are included in the 8-K that we filed today. Now let me make a few brief comments on the fourth quarter before turning over to Leslie for a detailed results discussion. 
We delivered strong performance in the face of challenging market conditions. Highlights were: revenue of $4.7 billion in the quarter, down 5% in constant currency year-over-year; annuity revenue was 83% of total revenue; adjusted EPS of $0.32, above our expectation and $0.27 on a GAAP basis; sequential increase in operating margin to 9.2%; strong cash flow generation of $878 million in the quarter and $1.6 billion for the full year. 
The changes we have made to the Services operating model are beginning to pay off as demonstrated by sequential margin improvement and double-digit year-over-year signings growth. Document Technology was the industry leader for the 24th consecutive quarter and through focus on performance and productivity, maintained its strong margins. Over the course of 2015, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders in the form of $1.3 billion in share buybacks and over $300 million in dividends. 
We have increased our annual dividends by 11% to $0.31 per share, the highest levels since 2000 beginning with a dividend payable April 2016. Leslie will discuss our 2016 guidance and some changes that we will make in our reporting. We expect 2016 to be a strong year for Xerox as well as a foundational year for the 2 companies. Now I'll turn it over to Leslie."
103599,321860379,923612,"Xerox Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by walking through our results and then covering 2016 guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. In summary, we delivered solid results in quarter 4. Services came in above our expectations",1934,"Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by walking through our results and then covering 2016 guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. In summary, we delivered solid results in quarter 4. Services came in above our expectations, driven by good sequential margin improvement. Document Technology revenue was weaker-than-anticipated, primarily, driven by lower supply sales, but margin remained in the middle of our range reflecting our ongoing cost discipline and business level flexibility. 
Q4 cash flow, as anticipated, was seasonally strong and drove $1.6 billion of full-year operating cash flow resulting in a healthy ending cash balance of $1.4 billion. During the year, we returned a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders with $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $326 million in dividends. Turning to the earnings slide, I'll walk through the income statement. 
Revenue in the quarter was down 8% of actual currency and 5% at constant currency. Currency cost us approximately $150 million on the top line. Services' top line was flat at constant currency, helped by solid 3% growth in Document Outsourcing, offsetting a 2% decline in BPO. Document Technology declined 10% at constant currency and drove the overall revenue decline. I'll speak more about the drivers when I review the segments. 
Gross margin of 31.3% was down 80 basis points year-over-year but up 40 basis points sequentially. Sequential improvement was driven by Services, while the year-over-year decline was, driven by Document Technology as well as a greater mix of services, which carries a lower gross margin. RD&E was lower by $5 million year-over-year and SAG was down $59 million or 6%. Good expense reduction in absolute terms but not sufficient to offset revenue declines, so operating margin of 9.2% was down 120 basis points year-over-year and operating profit declined 18%. 
Adjusted other net expense was down year-over-year, driven by lower restructuring costs as anticipated in our quarter 4 guidance. Equity income was $32 million in the quarter, down $9 million year-over-year, reflecting lower profits in Fuji Xerox driven in part by the continued negative impact of translation currency. Our quarter 4 adjusted tax rate of 21% was below our guidance of 25% to 27%, benefiting our earnings by about $0.02 and reflecting the impact of recent U.S. tax legislation that extends R&D tax credits. 
Bottom line, despite revenue headwinds, we delivered solid Q4 adjusted earnings of $0.32. Moving on to our Services results. While many of the headwinds we have highlighted in the past continue, the benefits of the new operating model are beginning to be realized. 
Services revenue declined 3% and was flat at constant currency, consistent with both Q3 and full-year performance. BPO was down 2% as a result of lower new contract ramp from softer signings in earlier quarters and our decision last quarter to reduce our financial risk and not fully complete the Health Enterprise Medicaid platform implementation in Montana and California. 
Good growth continues in Document Outsourcing, up 3%, driven by strong Xerox Partner Print Services growth as well as strong equipment revenue growth in enterprise accounts following continued good signings. In terms of the opportunity ahead, total signings in the quarter were up 26% year-over-year and 8% for the trailing 12 months. New business signings were up 22% year-over-year in quarter 4. This really strong growth includes the Florida tolling contract. We're pleased to close on this contract and begin implementing a comprehensive tolling solution that leverages our best-in-class proven Vector tolling platform. 
Excluding the Florida contract, new business signings were up 10% in quarter 4, so a very good signings quarter. Our renewal rate in the quarter was 78%, below our 85% to 90% target range and reflects in part, 1 larger loss renewal opportunity, which would have been financially unattractive. Services segment margin was 9.4%, down 40 basis points year-over-year but up 130 basis points sequentially and above our 9% Q4 margin expectation. The set of services decisions and actions we implemented last year are beginning to deliver better results. 
We recognize that we still have work to do. First, to continue the grow signings and translate that into revenue growth. Second, to improve our business mix with a greater portion of our revenue from higher value offerings. And finally, to capture additional efficiency, including streamlining and automating more of our delivery capabilities. I'll now turn to Document Technology. 
Revenue in the quarter was down 10% at constant currency with the additional quarter 4 weakness coming from lower U.S. supply sales, driven in large part by channel dynamics. For the full year, revenue was down 8%, below our initial 2015 expectation of a mid-single digit decline. The largest driver was the developing markets weakness throughout the year. 
The Document Technology revenue decline is almost half when the growth in Document Outsourcing is included along with Document Technology. Activity in the quarter was mixed with good growth in a number of colored segments, partially offset by the lapping of prior year product launches in areas such as entry production color. Overall, 2015 was a lighter product introduction year and we look forward to more launches in 2016 starting this quarter with a broad office product refresh following -- followed by a number of exciting product printing announcement we'll be making at, the printing trade shows, which occurs every 4 years in Germany. 
Document Technology margin of 11.8% was in line with our full year guidance of 11% to 13%. Ongoing discipline cost base management and the flexibility of our business model were able to partially offset the higher revenue decline, negative mix from lower supplies and higher pension expense. Moving to cash flow. We had a strong post to the year for operating cash flow and a very good full-year for free cash flow, which was $1.3 billion. This enables us to continue to invest in select growth opportunities and return value to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. 
Cash from operations was $878 million in the quarter and $1.6 billion for the year, in line with our full-year guidance. Q4 cash generation was roughly flat to the prior year and reflected higher working capital contribution, higher discretionary pension contribution and normal strong quarter 4 seasonality. Investing cash flows were at $19 million use with $80 million spent on CapEx and $9 million on acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from surplus property sales. 
Cash flow from financing was a $278 million use, including debt reduction of $199 million and $77 million for preferred and common stock dividends. Our cash balance at the end of quarter 4 was $1.4 billion, providing us with flexibility as we enter 2016. Turning to our capital structure. We ended quarter 4 with $7.4 billion in debt, a $200 million reduction in the fourth quarter and a $374 million reduction for the year, consistent with our expectations. 
Applying 7 to 1 [ph] leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of quarter 4 was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion. We continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit rating. Turning to capital allocation. 2015 was another year of strong capital returns to shareholders. We repurchased 1.3 billion in shares, resulting in almost 10% reduction in shares outstanding. We also delivered $326 million in dividends, which included a 12% per share increased to the common stock dividend. 
Over 4 years, we've almost doubled our common stock dividend when including the 11% increase we announced today. So in total, we've returned over $1.6 billion to our shareholders, greater than free cash flow of $1.3 billion with the incremental capital coming from part of the IPO sale proceeds. We are steadfast in our commitment to return capital to shareholders and be good stewards. And we have a strong track record to back up that commitment having returned greater than 50% of free cash flow to shareholders each year over the past 5 years. 
For 2016, we plan once again to deploy greater than 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase, while balancing our need to manage our debt to a level, which is consistent with our investment-grade credit rating. We also intend to support our longer-term growth objectives and plan to invest $100 million to $400 million on acquisitions with a focus continuing to be on expanding our capabilities in attractive markets. 
Before reviewing our 2016 guidance, I'd like to highlight a few reporting changes we'll be making beginning this year. These changes will bring our reporting and guidance practices more in line with our peers. I will briefly summarize the changes and note that we have a full explanation on Slide 25 in the appendix. We'll exclude 3 additional items from adjusted earnings to give a clearer picture of underlying operating performance. These items include restructuring expenses, certain retirement related costs and transaction costs from the planned separation and strategic transformation. 
Retirement related costs will also be adjusted out of our segment results and we're moving to student loan business that we are running off from the Services segment to the Other segment. Finally starting in 2016, we will include developing markets within our constant currency calculations to give a truer picture of our constant currency revenue performance. We have additional information on these reporting changes in the appendix, including revised results for 2015 that will provide a comparable basis for 2016. 
Moving to our 2016 guidance on this basis. We anticipate full-year constant currency revenue to decline 2% to 4% with flat to 3% growth in Services, more than offset by declines of 5% to 7% in Document Technology. At January 15 spot rates, we anticipate a negative currency impact on revenue of 1% to 2% for the full year with a higher impact in the first half than the second. Considering the uncertain macroenvironment, we don't expect our revenue to deviate from the trend but we do expect modest improvement in both segments as we move through the year and lap the onset of some headwinds in both Document Technology and Services. 
We expect Document Technology margin to be roughly in line with 2015, that's within a 12% to 14% range, excluding retirement related costs. We expect Services margin to improve and be in a range of 8% to 9.5%. Adjusted earnings guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 represents a 3% to 12% growth from 2015. 
Finally, we expect to generate operating cash flow of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion and invest $300 million in CapEx, yielding $1 billion to $1.2 billion in free cash flow. This guidance is below 2015 cash flow as it includes settlement outflows associated with our decision last quarter do not fully complete the Health Enterprise Medicaid platform implementations in Montana and California, as well as a higher than normal level of restructuring as we implement our strategic transformation program. 
Transactional related costs associated with the separation are still being estimated and aren't yet reflected in our cash flow or GAAP earnings guidance. For quarter 1, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $0.21 and $0.24. So to summarize for quarter 1 and full year 2016, we have set achievable objectives that reflect first, improvement in the business, highs in the investments and actions we've made over the past year. 
Second, prudent expectations given economic uncertainties and headwinds. And finally, continued investment in the business and implementation of the first year of strategic transformation activities that will further prepare the Document Technology and BPO businesses to be strong, stand-alone companies. With that, I'll hand it back to Ursula to wrap up."

There'll be a mix between both Services and the Technology business, not only in Services, for sure. The investment profile that we will -- that we have been making and will need to continue to make is to invest more in automation of our Services delivery infrastructure. That investment -- those investment needs obviously, compete with other investment needs in our tech business. And we would be able to actually focus those investments more -- and are pointedly more, it's a big focus of ours and if the market has changed, we've realized that we have to make more investments there, automation, cloud-based services, service as a service offerings et cetera. Second is on talent. Interestingly, this is both businesses. The dynamics of these 2 businesses, 1 growth, 1 doesn't grow that much, 1 throws off a lot more cash, the other 1 doesn't actually adds up -- leadership level will be able to have more refined incentive structures around the leadership of these 2 companies that align very well toward their dynamics and their growth profiles. And the third is around how we operate outside of the United States. It's one of the areas that we put a lot of energy in our Services business, trying to actually piggyback on the infrastructure of our tech business. That is probably one of the most difficult areas for us to break into. And now we'll be able to interestingly enough, focus back our tech business on taking care of the tech sector and be very selective in how we expand further outside the United States in our BPO business, 3 areas of difference."

So let me start first of all, by reminding everyone that unbundled supplies in Xerox represent just 20% of our Document Technology revenues, different from many of our competitors because we sell so much of our supplies as part of a bundled contract. With regard to the lower supply sales in quarter 4, it was in the U.S. and had to do with reseller stocking levels. So what we saw in quarter 4 was a lower level of stocking at the reseller level than we had in the year-ago period. And that typically reflects some combination of the following factors: lower end customer demand, given the fact that we had weaker equipment sales through that segment earlier this year; reseller cash management; and the level of competitive discounts that resellers choose to take advantage of versus the price discounts on the Xerox level. So it was unusually weak for us in quarter 4. We do expect better performance in quarter 1 and going forward. But we expect supplies revenue will continue to be pressured given the lower level of A4 equipment sales. Did you have another question, Shannon?"

And the margin in the Document Outsourcing portion of the Services segment is above the segment average, which means BPO is obviously, below. So that should give you some sense as to the profiles of the margins in the 2 business going forward. With regard to cash flow, I think you know that the Document Technology business and the Document Outsourcing businesses are very cash generative businesses. And the BPO business is less cash generative and is more in an investment and a ramp-up mode."

Let me start with the process. In October, actually before October, but in October, we spoke to you about undertaking a review -- a structural review that was focused on our portfolio of offerings and our capital allocation structure and process. That was in full swing by the end of October and included our Board -- the entire management team and our Board of Directors and some advisers that we had from the outside. And the intention there was to take a look at not only our internal business, but as importantly, the markets -- the trends in the markets, the trends in segments of the markets that we highly invested in health care, transportation, these areas. Very contemplative, steeped in fact in data -- facts in data and just a very good bottoms up process. That process lasted until just recently ended actually. And we made the decision at -- in the middle of January to separate into 2 companies and to do a separation. So that was it. We had no external process pressure on that, which had been reported a lot in the news. Actually, it was not engaged at all in the decision-making process. And -- so I'm pleased with that. We came up with this decision based on market trends, based on our strengths and weaknesses, based on the performance that we had in these 2 businesses, based on the current dynamics and thinking by shareholders, by our customers, et cetera. Shareholders, meaning how they value allocation methodologies. As far as management goes, one of the things I'll start with me, as we've gotten this a lot. One of the things that was removed from the process early as we went into this and I did with the board, was to move me out of this discussion. The decision about whether or not we split into 2 companies or what process we take on a go-forward basis can't be based on an individual with any worry about an individual. So literally, I said, let us go through this, kind of agnostic of individual and let's manage it from a process standpoint. Good news is that we did that, I have a great relationship with the board. My future will be contemplated. I'll make some recommendations to the board and my future will be contemplated as part of those recommendations. I am both confident and solid in that. And in the next year, by the way, we have to spend a lot of time doing 3 things. One is taking $600 million, $700 million annualized cost out of the business. We have to split the company into 2 and we have to deliver the 2016 plan. Not small activities. As far as Services leadership. If there is one thing that we will change from a structural standpoint today, that we know today, even though it's not implemented today is that the Services leadership will come from the outside. But I want to make sure that the BPO leadership will come from the outside. I have a President who runs the Services businesses today. He is a very valued member of our company. He does a good job and we expect, I hope that he continues to operate in the business on a go-forward basis, but the new CEO of the company will come from the outside. CFO, we put the CFO on the back burner. We didn't totally stop it, but we put the search on the back burner as we went into the structural review. This is a place where we will have strong internal candidates as well as some external candidates. It's just a good process to go through that and we will have one and then eventually 2 CFOs as we go forward. And I'm pretty comfortable with that process as well. I think I got all of the questions answered, I hope."

With that said, I'm not sure any things really changed. I'm curious what you really learned? In other words, why'd you buy it? And then secondarily, part of the strategy over the last couple of years within the broader context of Services has been M&A. And I think Xerox has been -- has not been able to generate the growth through inorganic means within the M&A side of Services. Is that a pricing issue or a structural issue? What's the process and as you're in -- going through the separation this year, will you have the ability to go ahead to engage in M&A even as you're trying to go through the separation?"

Let's start with the M&A piece. We have acquired in the first couple of years of our M&A during the year about $350 million worth of assets for a couple of years in a row, and the last 2 years have not been able to generate that same level of performance. We were always shooting for more. By the way, we have -- it's not, not seeing opportunities. The good news is that we do see some. We also have -- but we do have very specific requirements and high hurdles for accepting an M&A deal. I don't expect that those hurdles will go away at all. So we are guiding down as you can see, $100 million to $400 million in M&A because we do have -- as I said, it's a high hurdle. I think we'll be able to get somewhere in the middle of that range, maybe to the high end if we're a little bit lucky there. So no strategic change in M&A. No strategic change in our desire to acquire, a little bit narrow and we talked about being a little bit less diversified in our offers, definitely focusing on our Commercial Healthcare, definitely focusing on transportation and those assets. Focusing a little bit in those 2 areas and maybe others in going internationally, so -- but I don't think that there's a big change. We're not having a big change in our strategy for M&A and we're going to keep trying. As I keep saying, we have money to spend and hopefully, we can actually use it more frequently than we had in the past. As far as what has changed, 7 years ago, I said this a little bit earlier. 7 years in business is like 7 years in dog years. A lot has changed in 7 years. The health care market has changed, not only in how health care is provisioned and paid for, which is -- has a big effect on us. But in the provider area, how much consolidation there has been, literally buying and selling off very large customers. So companies saw a customer set has changed. International markets have slowed pretty significantly and the dollar has strengthened pretty significantly. There've been a lot of shifts in technology and et cetera. So a lot of things have changed in the markets around us. And all that has done, they haven't changed the fundamentals of the 2 business. But it has made it very, very clear that fitness and focus is at a premium right now. And that's where we've chosen to make our investments. Fitness and focused because we need to invest a little bit more in our Services business, particularly as the shift is happening in there and as a service and cost of automation, et cetera. And we have to be very pointed in our focus in Document Technology and make sure that we continue to drive efficiencies through that value chain, et cetera. So we didn't look back. We didn't spend a lot of time in our analysis looking back to what we did 7 years ago. We spent all of our time looking forward and we're very confident in our decision on a go-forward basis."

We haven't really looked at the specific growth rate and whether we can get the 5%. But I can tell you one thing and that's, that we can grow higher -- faster than what we could go today. There's no doubt about. Particularly as we mix our portfolio, we're heavenly mixed towards customer care. That business by the way, we can actually grow that business a little bit faster than we're growing it today, but that business doesn't have a margin profile that we actually want to expand too much further. So we are being very selective in how we go forward in customer care and picking our customer care accounts, and engagement that actually are broader than what we would call bare customer care. And in the rest of the business lines, transformation for sure and Commercial Healthcare, and even Government Healthcare, the core portion of it are growing at rates that can support a 5% rate. But we have to do some portfolio mixing to make sure that we can actually and -- mixing and timing to make sure that we can get there overtime. And you'll hear more about it as we do even deeper work in the separation process and looking at the BPO business. As far as -- I just want to also transition to this $2.4 billion and make sure that we're clear about what we're doing here. Normally Xerox, so every year in Xerox, we do a fair amount, as you know, of restructuring and remixing of how we spend the money. We get some productivity benefits from our vendors. And we get the rest of the productivity benefits from us. This $2.4 billion is foundational in 3 basic parts. One, we'll get some part of it on our normal interaction with our suppliers to make sure they actually drive some of their productivity and give that to us. We can get to be about $1 billion over the 3 years plus or minus -- give or take some. And we also get naturally, every year on a level of productivity from both our tech and services business foundational. And what we're explaining and what we're doing with the transformation, we're taking that first part and the second part and adding on top of it a $600 million additional savings program. And we're doing that by changing -- focusing on changing how we work. This is not -- we're kind of readying ourselves for the markets in the future and the business in the future and trying to actually shift out -- take out an additional $600 million as we go forward.

When Ursula was talking about customer care, it is clearly our objective to expand the customer care margin. It is not our objective to increase the proportion of customer care business inside of our BPO business. So we certainly want to grow customer care. We want to grow the other higher-value offers more quickly so that we can drive the BPO margin up. With regard to cost transformation, we save about -- we capture about $600 million a year, which is roughly 4% to 5% kind of annual productivity. In addition to that in 2016, we're expecting an annualized savings from the transformation program of about $100 million. And that will be captured from a variety of focus areas, things like the structure of the organization so we can start the 2 separate companies lien, which will include both layers of management as well as support functions and infrastructure. It will include labor productivity and taking advantage of automation and changing how we deliver services to our customers. So our expectation is that we will invest about $200 million in restructuring this year, in 2016. And since we will be doing the transformation throughout the year, we're really just starting. We expect the savings that we generate in 2016 will be probably around $50 million from the strategic -- from year 1 of that incremental program."

Today, we are announcing significant actions that will define the next chapter of our company. We'll spend much of the call today discussing our plans to separate into 2 strong, independent, market-leading companies. We'll also discuss the multiyear strategic transformation program announced today. And of course, we'll discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results and 2016 guidance. Let me begin with our plan to dramatically change the way that we generate shareholder value. 
Today, we announced that the comprehensive structural review begun in October has been completed. The review has been a top priority for our Board of Directors and the executive team. We engaged outside advisers, including independent advisers, to the Board in this process. It was a robust assessment of options for the company's portfolio and capital allocation that would best position the company to maximize shareholder value. 
It became clear through this analysis that the benefits of separation outweighed the benefits of maintaining the current structure.  The Board unanimously agreed that the optimal path forward for Xerox is to become 2 market-leading, focused, publicly-traded companies. We are confident this is the highest value-creating opportunity for our shareholders, for our clients and employees. These companies will both be significant Fortune 500 scale companies and leaders in their markets. One comprising of Business Process Outsourcing business; the other, our Document Technology and Document Outsourcing businesses. 
Document Technology, with 2015 revenue of $11 billion, will continue to lead the Document Management and Document Outsourcing market, leveraging its superior technology, solutions and innovation capabilities.  BPO, with 2015 revenue of $7 billion and already a leader in a growing market, will continue to pursue growth opportunities by capitalizing on its deep industry expertise, market-leading automation solutions and track record of global delivery excellence. I will discuss unique strengths, top line financial profile and growth opportunities of the 2 companies in more detail shortly. But first, let me talk about the compelling rationale that exists behind the decision to separate these companies. 
We have 2 strong businesses, each facing different market and client realities. Document Technology faces modest secular declines in its markets, while BPO participates in a growing, but rapidly evolving market. The businesses have distinct operating models and cash flow characteristics and very different growth drivers and competition. The Document Technology business is one in which operational discipline and a commitment to transformative productivity is vital to sustaining quality and managing costs in an increasingly interconnected digital world.  Doing that right creates strong profitability and cash flow that can be returned to shareholders and invested in selected growth opportunities. 
BPO on the other hand needs to be highly-adaptive, able to innovate and adopt technology quickly and shift its portfolio to address the fast-changing needs of its clients. We're seeing how new technologies like Software-as-a-Service and robotic process automation are changing the way that services are delivered. Additionally, clients are requiring deep analytics for operational insight and greater personalization. The BPO market is growing at a greater-than-5% rate and the majority of the revenue streams are recurring.  Based on this, we concluded that these businesses will be stronger and able to create more value for shareholders, clients and employees as independent companies. 
We're creating 2 companies that will be market leaders, benefiting from enhanced strategic and operational focus, distinct and clear financial profiles and capital allocation policies and simplified organizational structures. As standalone companies, they will have compelling investment cases and be better-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities and expand margins and market share. 
We see the BPO company as one focused on revenue growth, margin expansion and disciplined investments in attractive growing markets. Document Technology will leverage its track record of market leadership and strong cash flow generation to a sustained and investment-grade rating and shareholder-friendly capital allocation plan. Now let's look at -- more closely at each company. 
The Document Technology company will be the global leader in a $90 billion document management and document outsourcing market, with a presence in approximately 180 countries. We have a broad portfolio of products and are the equipment revenue market share leader. Our Managed Print Services offerings are widely recognized as best-of-breed by customers and industry analysts. Despite secular decline in the printing industry, our Document Technology business remains highly-profitable, with a annuity-driven revenue representing more than 70% of our sales.  Through relentless cost discipline, this business generates strong and consistent cash flows that allow us to make strategic investments to generate -- to penetrate higher growth markets such as aqueous inkjet, high-end color printing, managed print services and work flow. 
BPO is a leading enterprise for the next generation of Business Process Outsourcing, with $7 billion in revenue. In this business, we enjoy the #2 position in market share in an industry that is expanding by more than 5% annually. We're advantaged with differentiated capabilities to help clients improve their flow of work, to bring expertise in managing transaction, intensive business processes and are applying new innovations to automation solutions.  We have market-leading positions in healthcare, transportation, public sector and a range of other industries. Our high recurring revenue and high renewal rates reinforce our confidence in our ability to grow market share and expand margins going forward. We are very excited about the opportunities ahead of us for these 2 businesses. With increased strategic focus, we can capitalize on their unique strengths and capture the value creation opportunities that we see in each of them. 
In conjunction with the separation announcement, we have also launched a strategic transformation program, targeting incremental savings of $600 million over 3 years. This brings our total cumulative savings target to $2.4 billion during this period, which includes ongoing productivity initiatives.  In 2016, we expect a total of $700 million in annualized savings. The plan is company-wide and will include a thorough review of how we work and how we operate. Bottom line, we're not only optimizing our portfolio and capital structure, we're also driving a strategic transformation. This will improve our competitive position and help expand margins in both our businesses during the separation process and beyond. 
Our employees will benefit from working for industry leaders with streamlined structures and fast decision making. The companies will have greater flexibility to align employee incentives and rewards to business performance. For clients, each company will maintain it's leading service delivery and innovation excellence, but will be able to more quickly respond to market forces and client needs through focus and agility. And for investors, focused companies with optimized capital structures and capital allocation policies present distinct and compelling investment cases and will be well-positioned to deliver value. 
Let me spend a moment on the separation process itself. We are committed to executing the strategic actions seamlessly and in the shortest possible timeframe. The separation is expected to be completed by the end of 2016, subject to customary conditions. We expect that the transaction to be U.S. federal tax free for our shareholders. 
During the process, we will remain focused on our clients, partners, suppliers and employees and delivering strong financial results. There are, of course, a series of key milestones that we will need to achieve in the upcoming months to complete the transaction, and we'll keep you updated on our progress. 
And as you read this morning, Xerox entered into an agreement with Carl Icahn related to the governance of the BPO company following the planned separation. Details are included in the 8-K that we filed today. 
Now let me make a few brief comments on the fourth quarter before turning over to Leslie for a detailed results discussion. 
We delivered strong performance in the face of challenging market conditions. Highlights were: Revenue of $4.7 billion in the quarter, down 5% in constant currency year-over-year; annuity revenue was 83% of total revenue; adjusted EPS of $0.32, above our expectation, and $0.27 on a GAAP basis; sequential increase in operating margin to 9.2%; strong cash flow generation of $878 million in the quarter and $1.6 billion for the full year.  The changes we have made to the Services operating model are beginning to pay off, as demonstrated by sequential margin improvement and double-digit year-over-year signings growth. Document Technology was the industry leader for the 24th consecutive quarter, and through focus on performance and productivity, maintained its strong margins. Over the course of 2015, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders in the form of $1.3 billion in share buybacks and over $300 million in dividends.  We have increased our annual dividends by 11% to $0.31 per share, the highest levels since 2000, beginning with a dividend payable April 2016. Leslie will discuss our 2016 guidance and some changes that we will make in our reporting. We expect 2016 to be a strong year for Xerox, as well as a foundational year for the 2 companies. 
Now I'll turn it over to Leslie."
103599,321860379,923745,"Xerox Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by walking through our results and then covering 2016 guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. In summary, we delivered solid results in quarter 4. Services came in above our expectations",1925,"Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by walking through our results and then covering 2016 guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. In summary, we delivered solid results in quarter 4. Services came in above our expectations, driven by good sequential margin improvement. Document Technology revenue was weaker-than-anticipated, primarily driven by lower supply sales; but margin remained in the middle of our range, reflecting our ongoing cost discipline and business level flexibility. 
Q4 cash flow, as anticipated, was seasonally strong and drove $1.6 billion of full-year operating cash flow, resulting in a healthy ending cash balance of $1.4 billion. During the year, we returned a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders with $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $326 million in dividends. 
Turning to the earnings slide, I'll walk through the income statement. 
Revenue in the quarter was down 8% at actual currency and 5% at constant currency. Currency cost us approximately $150 million on the top line. Services' top line was flat at constant currency, helped by solid 3% growth in Document Outsourcing, offsetting a 2% decline in BPO. Document Technology declined 10% at constant currency and drove the overall revenue decline. I'll speak more about the drivers when I review the segments. 
Gross margin of 31.3% was down 80 basis points year-over-year, but up 40 basis points sequentially. Sequential improvement was driven by Services, while the year-over-year decline was driven by Document Technology as well as a greater mix of services which carries a lower gross margin. RD&E was lower by $5 million year-over-year and SAG was down $59 million or 6%. Good expense reduction in absolute terms, but not sufficient to offset revenue declines, so operating margin of 9.2% was down 120 basis points year-over-year and operating profit declined 18%. 
Adjusted other net expense was down year-over-year, driven by lower restructuring cost, as anticipated in our quarter 4 guidance. Equity income was $32 million in the quarter, down $9 million year-over-year, reflecting lower profits in Fuji Xerox, driven in part by the continued negative impact of translation currency. Our quarter 4 adjusted tax rate of 21% was below our guidance of 25% to 27%, benefiting our earnings by about $0.02 and reflecting the impact of recent U.S. tax legislation that extends R&D tax credits. 
Bottom line, despite revenue headwinds, we delivered solid Q4 adjusted earnings of $0.32. 
Moving on to our Services results. While many of the headwinds we have highlighted in the past continue, the benefits of the new operating model are beginning to be realized.  Services revenue declined 3% and was flat at constant currency, consistent with both Q3 and full-year performance. BPO was down 2% as a result of lower new contract ramp from softer signings in earlier quarters and our decision last quarter to reduce our financial risk and not fully complete the Health Enterprise Medicaid platform implementation in Montana and California. 
Good growth continues in Document Outsourcing, up 3%, driven by strong Xerox Partner Print Services growth, as well as strong equipment revenue growth in enterprise accounts following continued good signings. In terms of the opportunity ahead, total signings in the quarter were up 26% year-over-year and 8% for the trailing 12 months. New business signings were up 22% year-over-year in quarter 4. This really strong growth includes the Florida tolling contract. We're pleased to close on this contract and begin implementing a comprehensive tolling solution that leverages our best-in-class proven VECTOR tolling platform. 
Excluding the Florida contract, new business signings were up 10% in quarter 4, so a very good signings quarter. Our renewal rate in the quarter was 78%, below our 85% to 90% target range and reflects in part one larger loss renewal opportunity which would've been financially unattractive. Services segment margin was 9.4%, down 40 basis points year-over-year, but up 130 basis points sequentially and above our 9% Q4 margin expectation. The set of Services decisions and actions we implemented last year are beginning to deliver better results.  
We recognize that we still have work to do. First, to continue to grow signings and translate that into revenue growth. Second, to improve our business mix with a greater proportion of our revenue from higher value offerings. And finally, to capture additional efficiencies, including streamlining and automating more of our delivery capabilities. I'll now turn to Document Technology. 
Revenue in the quarter was down 10% at constant currency, with the additional quarter 4 weakness coming from lower U.S. supply sales, driven in large part by channel dynamics. For the full year, revenue was down 8%, below our initial 2015 expectation of a mid-single digit decline. The largest driver was the developing markets' weakness throughout the year.  
The Document Technology revenue decline is almost halved when the growth from Document Outsourcing is included along with Document Technology. 
Activity in the quarter was mixed, with good growth in a number of color segments, partially offset by the lapping of prior-year product launches in areas such as entry production color. Overall, 2015 was a lighter product introduction year and we look forward to more launches in 2016 starting this quarter with a broad office product refresh following -- followed by a number of exciting production printing announcements we'll be making at Drupa, the printing trade show which occurs every 4 years in Germany. 
Document Technology margin of 11.8% was in line with our full-year guidance of 11% to 13%. Ongoing discipline cost base management and the flexibility of our business model were able to partially offset the higher revenue decline, negative mix from lower supplies and higher pension expense. 
Moving to cash flow. We had a strong post to the year for operating cash flow and a very good full-year for free cash flow, which was $1.3 billion. This enables us to continue to invest in select growth opportunities and return value to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. 
Cash from operations was $878 million in the quarter and $1.6 billion for the year, in line with our full-year guidance. Q4 cash generation was roughly flat to the prior year and reflected higher working capital contribution, higher discretionary pension contribution and normal strong quarter 4 seasonality. Investing cash flows were $19 million use, with $80 million spent on CapEx and $9 million on acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from surplus property sales. 
Cash flow from financing was a $278 million use, including debt reduction of $199 million and $77 million for preferred and common stock dividends. Our cash balance at the end of quarter 4 was $1.4 billion, providing us with flexibility as we enter 2016. 
Turning to our capital structure. We ended quarter 4 with $7.4 billion in debt, a $200 million reduction in the fourth quarter and a $374 million reduction for the year, consistent with our expectations. 
Applying 7 to 1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of quarter 4 was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion. We continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit rating. 
Turning to capital allocation. 2015 was another year of strong capital returns to shareholders. We repurchased $1.3 billion in shares, resulting in almost 10% reduction in shares outstanding. We also delivered $326 million in dividends, which included a 12% per share increase to the common stock dividend.  Over 4 years, we've almost doubled our common stock dividend when including the 11% increase we announced today. So in total, we've returned over $1.6 billion to our shareholders, greater than free cash flow of $1.3 billion, with the incremental capital coming from part of the ITO sale proceeds. 
We are steadfast in our commitment to return capital to shareholders and be good stewards. And we have a strong track record to back up that commitment having returned greater than 50% of free cash flow to shareholders each year over the past 5 years. 
For 2016, we plan once again to deploy greater than 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase, while balancing our need to manage our debt to a level, which is consistent with our investment-grade credit rating. We also intend to support our longer-term growth objectives and plan to invest $100 million to $400 million on acquisitions with a focus continuing to be on expanding our capabilities in attractive markets. 
Before reviewing our 2016 guidance, I'd like to highlight a few reporting changes we'll be making beginning this year. These changes will bring our reporting and guidance practices more in line with our peers. I will briefly summarize the changes and note that we have a full explanation on Slide 25 in the appendix. We'll exclude 3 additional items from adjusted earnings to give a clearer picture of underlying operating performance. These items include restructuring expenses, certain retirement-related costs and transaction costs from the planned separation and strategic transformation.  Retirement-related costs will also be adjusted out of our segment results and we are moving the student loan business that we are running off from the Services segment to the Other segment. 
Finally, starting in 2016, we will include developing markets within our constant currency calculations to give a truer picture of our constant currency revenue performance. We have additional information on these reporting changes in the appendix, including revised results for 2015 that will provide a comparable basis for 2016. 
Moving to our 2016 guidance on this basis. We anticipate full-year constant currency revenue to decline 2% to 4%, with flat to 3% growth in Services, more than offset by declines of 5% to 7% in Document Technology. At January 15 spot rates, we anticipate a negative currency impact on revenue of 1% to 2% for the full year, with a higher impact in the first half than the second. Considering the uncertain macroenvironment, we don't expect our revenue to deviate substantially from trend, but we do expect modest improvement in both segments as we move through the year and lap the onset of some headwinds in both Document Technology and Services. 
We expect Document Technology margin to be roughly in line with 2015, that's within a 12% to 14% range, excluding retirement-related costs. We expect Services margin to improve and be in a range of 8% to 9.5%. Adjusted earnings guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 represents a 3% to 12% growth from 2015. 
Finally, we expect to generate operating cash flow of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion and invest $300 million in CapEx, yielding $1 billion to $1.2 billion in free cash flow. This guidance is below 2015 cash flow as it includes settlement outflows associated with our decision last quarter to not fully complete the Health Enterprise Medicaid platform implementations in Montana and California, as well as a higher-than-normal level of restructuring as we implement our strategic transformation program. 
Transaction-related costs associated with the separation are still being estimated and aren't yet reflected in our cash flow or GAAP earnings guidance. 
For quarter 1, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $0.21 and $0.24. 
So to summarize for quarter 1 and full year 2016, we have set achievable objectives that reflect, first, improvement in the business tied to the actions and investments we've made over the past year.  Second, prudent expectations given economic uncertainties and headwinds. And finally, continued investment in the business and implementation of the first year of strategic transformation activities that will further prepare the Document Technology and BPO businesses to be strong, stand-alone companies. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Ursula to wrap up."

Second, the plan to separate into 2 strong independent companies is the right step forward for Xerox as each company will benefit from enhanced focus, developed cost structure and an appropriate capital structure. Each will have the resources and focus needed to capitalize on unique growth opportunities, and an operating model and cash flow characteristics to create value and thrive in the sector.

And there'll be a mix between both Services and the Technology business, not only in Services, for sure. The investment profile that we will -- that we have been making and will need to continue to make is to invest more in automation of our Services delivery infrastructure. That investment -- those investment needs obviously compete with other investment needs in our tech business, and we would be able to actually focus those investments more -- pointedly more, just more. It's a big focus of ours. And as the market have changed, we've realized that we have to make more investments there, automation, cloud-based services, service as a service offerings, et cetera. Second is on talent. Interestingly, this is both businesses. The dynamics of these 2 businesses, one grows, one doesn't grow that much, one throws off a lot more cash, the other one doesn't, actually adds up -- leadership level will be able to actually have more refined incentive structures around the leadership of these 2 companies that align very well towards their dynamics and their growth profiles. And the third is around how we operate outside of the United States. It's one of the areas that we put a lot of energy in our Services business, trying to actually piggyback on the infrastructure of our tech business. That was probably one of the most difficult areas for us to break into. And now, we'll be able to, interestingly enough, focus back our tech business on taking care of the tech sector and be very selective in how we expand further outside the United States in our BPO business. 3 areas of difference."

So let me start, first of all, by reminding everyone that unbundled supplies in Xerox represent just 20% of our Document Technology revenues, different from many of our competitors because we sell so much of our supplies as part of a bundled contract. With regard to the lower supply sales in quarter 4, it was in the U.S. and had to do with reseller stocking levels. So what we saw in quarter 4 was a lower level of stocking at the reseller level than we had in the year-ago period. And that typically reflects some combination of the following factors: Lower end customer demand, given the fact that we've had weaker equipment sales through that segment earlier this year; reseller cash management; and the level of competitive discounts that resellers choose to take advantage of versus the price discounts on the Xerox level. So it was unusually weak for us in quarter 4. We do expect better performance in quarter 1 and going forward, but we expect supplies revenue will continue to be pressured given the lower level of A4  equipment sales. Did you have another question, Shannon?"

So Shannon, I'll start by saying that more of these details will become clear as we go through the process to separate during the year. So I don't -- I won't give you specific answers now. But I will remind you that the margin in the Document Technology segment is higher than the margin in the Services segment. And the margin in the Document Outsourcing portion of the Services segment is above the segment average, which means BPO is obviously below. So that should give you some sense as to the profiles of the margins in the 2 businesses going forward. With regard to cash flow, I think you know that the Document Technology business and the Document Outsourcing businesses are very cash-generative businesses. And the BPO business is less cash-generative and is more in an investment and a ramp-up growth mode."

Let me start with the process. In October -- actually before October, but in October, we spoke to you about undertaking a review -- a structural review that was focused on our portfolio of offerings and our capital allocation structure and process. That was in full swing by the end of October and included our Board -- the entire management team and our Board of Directors and some advisers that we had from the outside. And the intention there was to take a look at not only our internal business, but as importantly, the markets -- the trends in the markets -- the trends in segments of the markets that we are highly invested in, healthcare, transportation, these areas. Very contemplative, steeped, in fact, in data -- facts and data and just a very good bottoms up process. That process lasted until just recently ended, actually and we made the decision at -- in the middle of January to separate into 2 companies and to do a separation. So that was it. We had no external process pressure on that, which has been reported a lot in the news. Actually, it was not engaged at all in the decision-making process. And -- so I'm pleased with that. We came up with this decision based on market trends, based on our strengths and weaknesses, based on the performance that we had in these 2 businesses, based on the current dynamics and thinking by shareholders, by our customers, et cetera. Shareholders, meaning how they value allocation methodologies. As far as management goes, one of the things, I'll start with me. I've gotten this a lot. One of the things that was removed from the process early as we went into this, what I did with the Board was to move me out of this discussion. The decision about whether or not we split into 2 companies or what process we take on a go-forward basis can't be based on an individual or with any worry about an individual. So literally, I said, let us go through this kind of agnostic of individual and let's manage it from a process standpoint. Good news is that we did that. I have a great relationship with the Board. My future will be contemplated. I'll make some recommendations to the Board and my future will be contemplated as part of those recommendations. I am both confident and solid in that. And in the next year, by the way, we have to spend a lot of time doing 3 things. One is taking $600 million, $700 million annualized cost out of the business, we have to split the company into 2 and we have to deliver the 2016 plan. Not small activities. As far as Services leadership. If there is one thing that we will change from a structural standpoint today, that we know today, even though it's not implemented today, is that the Services leadership will come from the outside. But I want to make sure that we're clear. We have a -- the BPO leadership will come from the outside. I have a President who runs the Services businesses today. He is a very valued member of our company. Does a good job. We expect -- I hope that he continues to operate in the business on a go-forward basis, but the new CEO of the company will come from the outside. CFO, we put the CFO on the back burner. We didn't totally stop it, but we put the search on the back burner as we went into the structural review. This is a place where we will have strong internal candidates, as well as some external candidates. It's just a good process to go through that, and we will have one and then eventually 2 CFOs as we go forward. I'm pretty comfortable with that process as well. I think I got all of the questions answered, I hope."

It will likely -- it will have to be investment-grade. We're going to push hard for that to be the case and invest, and make sure that we set up the company that way because it has a financing business that's captured, as you know, and will benefit from the investment-grade rating.

And then secondarily, the part of the strategy over the last couple of years within the broader context of Services has been M&A.

We have acquired in the, first couple of years of our M&A during the year, about $350 million worth of assets for a couple of years in a row, and the last 2 years have not been able to generate that same level of performance. We were always shooting for more. By the way, we have -- it's not, not seeing opportunities. The good news is that we do see some. We also have -- but we do have very specific requirements and high hurdles for accepting an M&A deal. I don't expect that those hurdles will go away at all. So we are guiding down, as you can see, $100 million to $400 million in M&A because we do have -- as I said, a high hurdle. I think we'll be able to get somewhere in the middle of that range, maybe to the high end if we're a little bit lucky there. So no strategic change in M&A. No strategic change in our desire to acquire. A little bit narrow, and we talked about being a little bit less diversified in our offers, definitely focusing on our Commercial Healthcare, definitely focusing on transportation and those assets. Focusing a little bit in those 2 areas and maybe others in going internationally. So -- but I don't think that there's a big change. We're not having a big change in our strategy for M&A and we're going to keep trying. As I keep saying, I have money to spend. I'm hoping that we can actually use it more frequently than we have in the past. As far as what has changed, 7 years ago, I said this a little bit earlier. 7 years in business is like 7 years in dog years. A lot has changed in 7 years. The healthcare market has changed, not only in how healthcare is provisioned and paid for, which is -- has a big effect on us. But in the provider areas, how much consolidation there has been, literally buying and selling of very large customers. So companies saw our customer set has changed. International markets have slowed pretty significantly and the dollar has strengthened pretty significantly. There've been a lot of shifts in technology and et cetera. So a lot of things have changed in the markets around us. And all that has done, they haven't changed the fundamentals of the 2 business, but it has made it very, very clear that fitness and focus is at a premium right now. And that's where we've chosen to make our investments, fitness and focus. I need to invest a little bit more in our Services business, particularly as the shifts are happening in there in as-a-service and process automation, et cetera. And we have to be very pointed in our focus in Document Technology and make sure that we continue to drive efficiencies through that value chain, et cetera. So we didn't look back. We didn't spend a lot of time in our analysis looking back to what we did 7 years ago. We spent all of our time looking forward and we're very confident in our decision on a go-forward basis."

We haven't really looked at the specific growth rate and whether we can get to 5%. But I can tell you one thing, and that's that we can grow higher -- faster than we're growing today. There's no doubt about. Particularly as we remix our portfolio, we're heavenly mixed towards customer care. That business -- by the way, we can actually grow that business a little bit faster than we're growing it today, but that business doesn't have a margin profile that we actually want to expand too much further. So we are being very selective in how we go forward in customer care, in picking our customer care accounts and engagements that actually are broader than what we would call bare customer care. And the rest of the business lines, transformation, for sure, and Commercial Healthcare, and even Government Healthcare, the core portion of it are growing at rates that can support a 5% rate. But we have to do some portfolio mixing to make sure that we can actually -- and mixing and timing to make sure that we can get there over time. And you'll hear more about it as we do even deeper work in the separation process and looking at the BPO business. As far as -- I just want to also transition to this $2.4 billion and make sure that we're clear about what we're doing here. Normally in Xerox, so every year in Xerox, we do a fair amount, as you know, of restructuring and remixing of how we spend money. We get some productivity benefits from our vendors. And we get the rest of the productivity benefits from us. This $2.4 billion is foundational in 3 basic parts. One, we'll get some of it from our normal interactions with our suppliers to make sure they actually drive some of their productivity and give that to us. We think that'll be about $1 billion over the 3 years, plus or -- give or take some. And we also get, naturally every year, a level of productivity from both our tech and services business foundational. And what we're explaining and what we're doing with this transformation is taking that first part and the second part and adding on top of it a $600 million additional savings program. And we're doing that by changing -- focusing on changing how we work. This is not -- and it's a big -- we're kind of readying ourselves for the markets in the future and the business in the future and trying to actually shift out -- take out an additional $600 million as we go forward. And I'll have Leslie go through some of a little bit more line item here."

When Ursula was talking about customer care, it is clearly our objective to expand the customer care margin. It is not our objective to increase the proportion of customer care business inside of our BPO business. So we certainly want to grow customer care. We want to grow the other higher-value offers more quickly so that we can drive the BPO margin up. With regard to cost transformation, we save about -- we capture about $600 million a year, which is roughly 4% to 5% kind of annual productivity. In addition to that, in 2016, we're expecting an annualized savings from the transformation program of about $100 million, and that will be captured from a variety of focus areas, things like the structure of the organization so we can start the 2 separated companies lean, which will include both layers of management as well as support functions and infrastructure. It will include labor productivity and taking advantage of automation and changing how we deliver services to our customers. So our expectation is that we will invest about $200 million in restructuring this year, in 2016. And since we will be doing the transformation throughout the year, we're really just starting, we expect the savings that we generate in 2016 will be probably around $50 million from the strategic -- from year 1 of that incremental program."

Today, we are announcing significant actions that will define the next chapter of our company. We'll spend much of the call today discussing our plans to separate into 2 strong, independent, market-leading companies. We'll also discuss the multiyear strategic transformation program announced today. And of course, we'll discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 results and 2016 guidance. Let me begin with our plan to dramatically change the way that we generate shareholder value. 
Today, we announced that the comprehensive structural review begun in October has been completed. The review has been a top priority for our Board of Directors and the executive team. We engaged outside advisers, including independent advisers, to the board in this process. It was a robust assessment of options for the company's portfolio and capital allocation that would best position the company to maximize shareholder value. 
It became clear through this analysis that the benefits of separation outweighed the benefits of maintaining the current structure.  The board unanimously agreed that the optimal path forward for Xerox is to become 2 market-leading, focused, publicly-traded companies. We are confident this is the highest value-creating opportunity for our shareholders, for our clients and employees. These companies will both be significant Fortune 500 scale companies and leaders in their markets: one comprising our Business Process Outsourcing business; the other, our Document Technology and Document Outsourcing businesses. 
Document Technology, with 2015 revenue of $11 billion, will continue to lead the Document Management and Document Outsourcing market, leveraging its superior technology, solutions and innovation capabilities.  BPO, with 2015 revenue of $7 billion and already a leader in a growing market, will continue to pursue growth opportunities by capitalizing on its deep industry expertise, market-leading automation solutions and track record of global delivery excellence. I will discuss unique strengths, top line financial profiles and growth opportunities of the 2 companies in more detail shortly. But first, let me talk about the compelling rationale that exists behind the decision to separate these companies. 
We have 2 strong businesses, each facing different market and client realities. Document Technology faces modest secular declines in its markets, while BPO participates in a growing but rapidly evolving market. The businesses have distinct operating models and cash flow characteristics and very different growth drivers and competition. The Document Technology business is one in which operational discipline and a commitment to transformative productivity is vital to sustaining quality and managing costs in an increasingly interconnected digital world.  Doing that right creates strong profitability and cash flow that can be returned to shareholders and invested in selected growth opportunities. 
BPO on the other hand needs to be highly-adaptive, able to innovate and adopt technology quickly and shift its portfolio to address the fast-changing needs of its clients. We're seeing how new technologies like Software-as-a-Service and robotic process automation are changing the way that services are delivered. Additionally, clients are requiring deep analytics for operational insight and greater personalization. The BPO market is growing at a greater-than-5% rate and the majority of the revenue streams are recurring.  Based on this, we concluded that these businesses would be stronger and able to create more value for shareholders, clients and employees as independent companies. 
We're creating 2 companies that will be market leaders, benefiting from enhanced strategic and operational focus, distinct and clear financial profiles and capital allocation policies and simplified organization structures. As standalone companies, they will have compelling investment cases and be better-positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities and expand margins and market share. 
We see the BPO company as one focused on revenue growth, margin expansion and disciplined investments in attractive growing markets. Document Technology will leverage its track record of market leadership and strong cash flow generation to a sustained and investment-grade rating and shareholder-friendly capital allocation plan. Now let's look at -- more closely at each company. 
The Document Technology company will be the global leader in a $90 billion document management and document outsourcing market, with a presence in approximately 180 countries. We have a broad portfolio of products and are the equipment revenue market share leader. Our Managed Print Services offerings are widely recognized as best-of-breed by customers and industry analysts. Despite secular decline in the printing industry, our Document Technology business remains highly-profitable, with annuity-driven revenue representing more than 70% of our sales.  Through relentless cost discipline, this business generates strong and consistent cash flows that allow us to make strategic investments to generate -- to penetrate higher growth markets such as aqueous inkjet, high-end color printing, managed print services and work flow. 
BPO is a leading enterprise for the next generation of Business Process Outsourcing, with $7 billion in revenues. In this business, we enjoy the #2 position in market share in an industry that is expanding by more than 5% annually. We're advantaged with differentiated capabilities that help clients improve their flow of work. We bring expertise in managing transaction-intensive business processes and are applying new innovations to automation solutions.  We have market-leading positions in health care, transportation, public sector and a range of other industries. Our high recurring revenue and high renewal rates reinforce our confidence in our ability to grow market share and expand margins going forward. We are very excited about the opportunities ahead of us for these 2 businesses. With increased strategic focus, we can capitalize on their unique strengths and capture the value creation opportunities that we see in each of them. 
In conjunction with the separation announcement, we have also launched a strategic transformation program, targeting incremental savings of $600 million over 3 years. This brings our total cumulative savings target to $2.4 billion during this period, which includes ongoing productivity initiatives.  In 2016, we expect a total of $700 million in annualized savings. The plan is company-wide and will include a thorough review of how we work and how we operate. Bottom line, we're not only optimizing our portfolio and capital structure, we're also driving a strategic transformation. This will improve our competitive position and help expand margins in both our businesses during the separation process and beyond. 
Our employees will benefit from working for industry leaders with streamlined structures and fast decision making. The companies will have greater flexibility to align employee incentives and rewards to business performance. For clients, each company will maintain its leading service delivery and innovation excellence but will be able to more quickly respond to market forces and client needs through focus and agility. And for investors, focused companies with optimized capital structures and capital allocation policies present distinct and compelling investment cases and will be well-positioned to deliver value. 
Let me spend a moment on the separation process itself. We are committed to executing the strategic actions seamlessly and in the shortest possible time frame. The separation is expected to be completed by the end of 2016, subject to customary conditions. We expect that the transaction to be U.S. federal tax free for our shareholders. 
During the process, we will remain focused on our clients, partners, suppliers and employees and delivering strong financial results. There are, of course, a series of key milestones that we will need to achieve in the upcoming months to complete the transaction, and we'll keep you updated on our progress. 
And as you read this morning, Xerox entered into an agreement with Carl Icahn related to the governance of the BPO company following the planned separation. Details are included in the 8-K that we filed today. 
Now let me make a few brief comments on the fourth quarter before turning it over to Leslie for a detailed results discussion. 
We delivered strong performance in the face of challenging market conditions. Highlights were: revenue of $4.7 billion in the quarter, down 5% in constant currency year-over-year; annuity revenue was 83% of total revenue; adjusted EPS of $0.32, above our expectation, and $0.27 on a GAAP basis; sequential increase in operating margin to 9.2%; strong cash flow generation of $878 million in the quarter and $1.6 billion for the full year.  The changes we have made to the Services operating model are beginning to pay off, as demonstrated by sequential margin improvement and double-digit year-over-year signings growth. Document Technology was the industry leader for the 24th consecutive quarter, and through focus on performance and productivity, maintained its strong margins. Over the course of 2015, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders in the form of $1.3 billion in share buybacks and over $300 million in dividends.  We have increased our annual dividends by 11% to $0.31 per share, the highest level since 2000, beginning with a dividend payable April 2016. Leslie will discuss our 2016 guidance and some changes that we will make in our reporting. We expect 2016 to be a strong year for Xerox, as well as a foundational year for the 2 companies. 
Now I'll turn it over to Leslie."
103599,321860379,923813,"Xerox Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by walking through our results and then covering 2016 guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. In summary, we delivered solid results in quarter 4. Services came in above our expectations",1928,"Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by walking through our results and then covering 2016 guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. In summary, we delivered solid results in quarter 4. Services came in above our expectations, driven by good sequential margin improvement. Document Technology revenue was weaker-than-anticipated, primarily driven by lower supply sales; but margin remained in the middle of our range, reflecting our ongoing cost discipline and business model flexibility. 
Q4 cash flow, as anticipated, was seasonally strong and drove $1.6 billion of full year operating cash flow, resulting in a healthy ending cash balance of $1.4 billion. During the year, we returned a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders with $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $326 million in dividends. 
Turning to the earnings slide, I'll walk through the income statement. 
Revenue in the quarter was down 8% at actual currency and 5% at constant currency. Currency cost us approximately $150 million on the top line. Services' top line was flat at constant currency, helped by solid 3% growth in Document Outsourcing, offsetting a 2% decline in BPO. Document Technology declined 10% at constant currency and drove the overall revenue decline. I'll speak more about the drivers when I review the segments. 
Gross margin of 31.3% was down 80 basis points year-over-year, but up 40 basis points sequentially. Sequential improvement was driven by Services, while the year-over-year decline was driven by Document Technology as well as a greater mix of services which carries a lower gross margin. RD&E was lower by $5 million year-over-year and SAG was down $59 million or 6%. Good expense reductions in absolute terms, but not sufficient to offset revenue declines, so operating margin of 9.2% was down 120 basis points year-over-year and operating profit declined 18%. 
Adjusted other net expense was down year-over-year, driven by lower restructuring costs, as anticipated in our quarter 4 guidance. Equity income was $32 million in the quarter, down $9 million year-over-year, reflecting lower profits in Fuji Xerox, driven in part by the continued negative impact of translation currency. Our quarter 4 adjusted tax rate of 21% was below our guidance of 25% to 27%, benefiting our earnings by about $0.02 and reflecting the impact of recent U.S. tax legislation that extends R&D tax credits. 
Bottom line, despite the revenue headwinds, we delivered solid Q4 adjusted earnings of $0.32. 
Moving on to our Services results. While many of the headwinds we have highlighted in the past continue, the benefits of the new operating model are beginning to be realized.  Services revenue declined 3% and was flat at constant currency, consistent with both Q3 and full-year performance. BPO was down 2% as a result of lower new contract ramp from softer signings in earlier quarters and our decision last quarter to reduce our financial risk and not fully complete the Health Enterprise Medicaid platform implementations in Montana and California. 
Good growth continues in Document Outsourcing, up 3%, driven by strong Xerox Partner Print Services growth, as well as strong equipment revenue growth in the enterprise accounts following continued good signings. In terms of the opportunity ahead, total signings in the quarter were up 26% year-over-year and 8% for the trailing 12 months. New business signings were up 22% year-over-year in quarter 4. This really strong growth includes the Florida tolling contract. We're pleased to close on this contract and begin implementing a comprehensive tolling solution that leverages our best-in-class proven VECTOR tolling platform. 
Excluding the Florida contract, new business signings were up 10% in quarter 4, so a very good signings quarter. Our renewal rate in the quarter was 78%, below our 85% to 90% target range and reflects in part one larger lost renewal opportunity which would've been financially unattractive. Services segment margin was 9.4%, down 40 basis points year-over-year, but up 130 basis points sequentially and above our 9% Q4 margin expectation. The set of Services decisions and actions we implemented last year are beginning to deliver better results.  
We recognize that we still have work to do. First, to continue to grow signings and translate that into revenue growth. Second, to improve our business mix with a greater proportion of our revenue from higher value offerings. And finally, to capture additional efficiencies, including streamlining and automating more of our delivery capabilities. I'll now turn to Document Technology. 
Revenue in the quarter was down 10% at constant currency, with the additional quarter 4 weakness coming from lower U.S. supply sales, driven in large part by channel dynamics. For the full year, revenue was down 8%, below our initial 2015 expectation of a mid-single digit decline. The largest driver was the developing markets' weakness throughout the year.  
The Document Technology revenue decline is almost halved when the growth from Document Outsourcing is included along with Document Technology. 
Activity in the quarter was mixed, with good growth in a number of color segments, partially offset by the lapping of prior-year product launches in areas such as entry production color. Overall, 2015 was a lighter product introduction year and we look forward to more launches in 2016 starting this quarter with a broad office product refresh following -- followed by a number of exciting production printing announcements we'll be making at Drupa, the printing trade show which occurs every 4 years in Germany. 
Document Technology margin of 11.8% was in line with our full-year guidance of 11% to 13%. Ongoing discipline cost base management and the flexibility of our business model were able to partially offset the higher revenue decline, negative mix from lower supplies and higher pension expense. 
Moving to cash flow. We had a strong close to the year for operating cash flow and a very good full-year for free cash flow, which was $1.3 billion. This enables us to continue to invest in select growth opportunities and return value to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. 
Cash from operations was $878 million in the quarter and $1.6 billion for the year, in line with our full-year guidance. Q4 cash generation was roughly flat to the prior year and reflected higher working capital contribution, higher discretionary pension contribution and normal strong quarter 4 seasonality. Invested cash flows were a $19 million use, with $80 million spent on CapEx and $9 million on acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from surplus property sales. 
Cash flow from financing was a $278 million use, including debt reduction of $199 million and $77 million for preferred and common stock dividends. Our cash balance at the end of quarter 4 was $1.4 billion, providing us with flexibility as we enter 2016. 
Turning to our capital structure. We ended quarter 4 with $7.4 billion in debt, a $200 million reduction in the fourth quarter and a $374 million reduction for the year, consistent with our expectations. 
Applying 7-to-1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of quarter 4 was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion. We continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit rating. 
Turning to capital allocation. 2015 was another year of strong capital returns to shareholders. We repurchased $1.3 billion in shares, resulting in an almost 10% reduction in shares outstanding. We also delivered $326 million in dividends, which included a 12% per share increase to the common stock dividend.  Over 4 years, we've almost doubled our common stock dividend when including the 11% increase we announced today. So in total, we've returned over $1.6 billion to our shareholders, greater than free cash flow of $1.3 billion, with the incremental capital coming from part of the ITO sale proceeds. 
We are steadfast in our commitment to return capital to shareholders and be good stewards. And we have a strong track record to back up that commitment having returned greater than 50% of free cash flow to shareholders each year over the past 5 years. 
For 2016, we plan once again to deploy greater than 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase, while balancing our need to manage our debt to a level which is consistent with our investment-grade credit rating. We also intend to support our longer-term growth objectives and plan to invest $100 million to $400 million on acquisitions with a focus continuing to be on expanding our capabilities in attractive markets. 
Before reviewing our 2016 guidance, I'd like to highlight a few reporting changes we'll be making beginning this year. These changes will bring our reporting and guidance practices more in line with our peers. I will briefly summarize the changes and note that we have a full explanation on Slide 25 in the appendix. We'll exclude 3 additional items from adjusted earnings to give a clearer picture of underlying operating performance. These items include restructuring expenses, certain retirement-related costs and transaction costs from the planned separation and strategic transformation.  Retirement-related costs will also be adjusted out of our segment results and we are moving the student loan business that we are running off from the Services segment to the Other segment. 
Finally, starting in 2016, we will include developing markets within our constant currency calculations to give a truer picture of our constant currency revenue performance. We have additional information on these reporting changes in the appendix, including revised results for 2015 that will provide a comparable basis for 2016. 
Moving to our 2016 guidance on this basis. We anticipate full-year constant currency revenue to decline 2% to 4%, with flat to 3% growth in Services, more than offset by declines of 5% to 7% in Document Technology. At January 15 spot rates, we anticipate a negative currency impact on revenue of 1% to 2% for the full year, with a higher impact in the first half than the second. Considering the uncertain macroenvironment, we don't expect our revenue to deviate substantially from trend, but we do expect modest improvement in both segments as we move through the year and lap the onset of some headwinds in both Document Technology and Services. 
We expect Document Technology margin to be roughly in line with 2015, that's within a 12% to 14% range, excluding retirement-related costs. We expect Services margin to improve and be in a range of 8% to 9.5%. Adjusted earnings guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 represents a 3% to 12% growth from 2015. 
Finally, we expect to generate operating cash flow of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion and invest $300 million in CapEx, yielding $1 billion to $1.2 billion in free cash flow. This guidance is below 2015 cash flow as it includes settlement outflows associated with our decision last quarter to not fully complete the Health Enterprise Medicaid platform implementations in Montana and California, as well as a higher-than-normal level of restructuring as we implement our strategic transformation program. 
Transaction-related costs associated with the separation are still being estimated and aren't yet reflected in our cash flow or GAAP earnings guidance. 
For quarter 1, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $0.21 and $0.24. 
So to summarize for quarter 1 and full year 2016, we have set achievable objectives that reflect, first, improvement in the business tied to the actions and investments we've made over the past year.  Second, prudent expectations given economic uncertainties and headwinds. And finally, continued investment in the business and implementation of the first year of strategic transformation activities that will further prepare the Document Technology and BPO businesses to be strong, stand-alone companies. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Ursula to wrap up."

Second, the plan to separate into 2 strong independent companies is the right step forward for Xerox as each company will benefit from enhanced focus, a lower cost structure and an appropriate capital structure. Each will have the resources and focus needed to capitalize on unique growth opportunities, and an operating model and cash flow characteristics to create value and thrive in its sector.

And there'll be a mix between both Services and the Technology business, not only in Services, for sure. The investment profile that we will -- that we have been making and will need to continue to make is to invest more in automation of our Services delivery infrastructure. That investment -- those investment needs obviously compete with other investment needs in our tech business, and we would be able to actually focus those investments more -- pointedly more, just more. It's a big focus of ours. And as the market has changed, we've realized that we have to make more investments there: automation, cloud-based services, service as a service offerings, et cetera. Second is on talent. Interestingly, this is both businesses. The dynamics of these 2 businesses, one grows, one doesn't grow that much, one throws off a lot more cash, the other one doesn't, actually adds a -- leadership level will be able to actually have more refined incentive structures around the leadership of these 2 companies that align very well toward their dynamics and their growth profiles. And the third is around how we operate outside of the United States. It's one of the areas that we put a lot of energy in, in our Services business, trying to actually piggyback on the infrastructure of our tech business. That was probably one of the most difficult areas for us to break into. And now, we'll be able to, interestingly enough, focus back our tech business on taking care of the tech sector and be very selective in how we expand further outside the United States in our BPO business. Those are 3 areas of difference."

So let me start, first of all, by reminding everyone that unbundled supplies in Xerox represent just 20% of our Document Technology revenues, different from many of our competitors because we sell so much of our supplies as part of a bundled contract. With regard to the lower supply sales in quarter 4, it was in the U.S. and had to do with reseller stocking levels. So what we saw in quarter 4 was a lower level of stocking at the reseller level than we had in the year-ago period. And that typically reflects some combination of the following factors: lower end customer demand, given the fact that we've had weaker equipment sales through that segment earlier this year; reseller cash management; and the level of competitive discounts that resellers choose to take advantage of versus the price discounts on the Xerox level. So it was unusually weak for us in quarter 4. We do expect better performance in quarter 1 and going forward, but we expect supplies revenue will continue to be pressured given the lower level of A4 equipment sales. Did you have another question, Shannon?"

So Shannon, I'll start by saying that more of these details will become clear as we go through the process to separate during the year. So I don't -- I won't give you specific answers now. But I will remind you that the margin in the Document Technology segment is higher than the margin in the Services segment. And the margin in the Document Outsourcing portion of the Services segment is above the segment average, which means BPO is obviously below. So that should give you some sense as to the profiles of the margins in the 2 businesses going forward. With regard to cash flow, I think you know that the Document Technology business and the Document Outsourcing businesses are very cash-generative businesses. And the BPO business is less cash-generative and is more in an investment and a ramp-up growth mode."

Let me start with the process. In October -- actually before October, but in October, we spoke to you about undertaking a review -- a structural review that was focused on our portfolio of offerings and our capital allocation structure and process. That was in full swing by the end of October and included our board -- the entire management team and our Board of Directors and some advisers that we had from the outside. And the intention there was to take a look at not only our internal business, but as importantly, the markets -- the trends in the markets -- the trends in segments of the markets that we are highly invested in, health care, transportation, these areas. Very contemplative, steeped, in fact, in data -- facts and data and just a very good bottoms up process. That process lasted until -- just recently ended, actually, and we made the decision in the middle of January to separate into 2 companies and to do a separation. So that was it. We had no external process pressure on that, which has been reported a lot in the news. Actually, it was not engaged at all in the decision-making process. And -- so I'm pleased with that. We came up with this decision based on market trends, based on our strengths and weaknesses, based on the performance that we had in these 2 businesses, based on the current dynamics and thinking by shareholders, by our customers, et cetera. Shareholders, meaning how they value allocation methodologies. As far as management goes, one of the things -- I'll start with me. I've gotten this a lot. One of the things that was removed from the process early as we went into this, that I did with the board was to move me out of this discussion. The decision about whether or not we split into 2 companies or what process we take on a go-forward basis can't be based on an individual or with any worry about an individual. So literally, I said, let us go through this kind of agnostic of individual and let's manage it from a process standpoint. Good news is that we did that. I have a great relationship with the board. My future will be contemplated. I'll make some recommendations to the board and my future will be contemplated as part of those recommendations. I am both confident and solid in that. And in the next year, by the way, we have to spend a lot of time doing 3 things. One is taking $600 million, $700 million annualized cost out of the business, we have to split the company into 2 and we have to deliver the 2016 plan. Not small activities. As far as Services leadership. If there is one thing that we will change from a structural standpoint today, that we know today, even though it's not implemented today, is that the Services leadership will come from the outside. But I want to make sure that we're clear. We have a -- the BPO leadership will come from the outside. I have a president who runs the Services businesses today. He is a very valued member of our company. Does a good job. We expect -- I hope that he continues to operate in the business on a go-forward basis, but the new CEO of the company will come from the outside. CFO, we put the CFO on the back burner. We didn't totally stop it, but we put the search on the back burner as we went into the structural review. This is a place where we will have strong internal candidates, as well as some external candidates. It's just a good process to go through that, and we will have 1 and then eventually 2 CFOs as we go forward. I'm pretty comfortable with that process as well. I think I got all of the questions answered, I hope."

And then secondarily, the part of the strategy over the last couple of years within the broader context of Services has been M&A. And I think Xerox has been -- has not been able to generate the growth through inorganic means within the M&A side of Services. Is that a pricing issue or a structural issue? What's the process?

We have acquired in the first couple of years of our M&A, during the year, about $350 million worth of assets for a couple of years in a row, and the last 2 years have not been able to generate that same level of performance. We were always shooting for more. By the way, we have -- it's not, not seeing opportunities. The good news is that we do see some. We also have -- but we do have very specific requirements and high hurdles for accepting an M&A deal. I don't expect that those hurdles will go away at all. So we are guiding down, as you can see, $100 million to $400 million in M&A because we do have -- as I said, a high hurdle. I think we'll be able to get somewhere in the middle of that range, maybe to the high end if we're a little bit lucky there. So no strategic change in M&A. No strategic change in our desire to acquire. A little bit narrow, and we talked about being a little bit less diversified in our offers, definitely focusing on Commercial Healthcare, definitely focusing on transportation and those assets. Focusing a little bit in those 2 areas and maybe others in going internationally. So -- but I don't think that there's a big change. We're not having a big change in our strategy for M&A and we're going to keep trying. As I keep saying, I have money to spend. I'm hoping that we can actually use it more frequently than we have in the past. As far as what has changed, 7 years ago, I said this a little bit earlier. 7 years in business is like 7 years in dog years. A lot has changed in 7 years. The health care market has changed, not only in how health care is provisioned and paid for, which is -- has a big effect on us. But in the provider areas, how much consolidation there has been, literally buying and selling of very large customers. So companies -- so our customer set has changed. International markets have slowed pretty significantly and the dollar has strengthened pretty significantly. There've been a lot of shifts in technology and et cetera. So a lot of things have changed in the markets around us. And all that has done, they haven't changed the fundamentals of the 2 business, but it has made it very, very clear that fitness and focus is at a premium right now. And that's where we've chosen to make our investments, fitness and focus. I need to invest a little bit more in our Services business, particularly as the shifts are happening in there in as-a-service and process automation, et cetera. And we have to be very pointed in our focus in Document Technology and make sure that we continue to drive efficiencies through that value chain, et cetera. So we didn't look back. We didn't spend a lot of time in our analysis looking back to what we did 7 years ago. We spent all of our time looking forward and we're very confident in our decision on a go-forward basis."

We haven't really looked at the specific growth rate and whether we can get to 5%. But I can tell you one thing, and that's that we can grow higher -- faster than we're growing today. There's no doubt about. Particularly as we remix our portfolio, we're heavenly mixed towards customer care. That business -- by the way, we can actually grow that business a little bit faster than we're growing it today, but that business doesn't have a margin profile that we actually want to expand too much further. So we are being very selective in how we go forward in customer care and picking our customer care accounts and engagements that actually are broader than what we would call bare customer care. And the rest of the business lines, transportation, for sure, and Commercial Healthcare, and even Government Healthcare, the core portion of it are growing at rates that can support a 5% rate. But we have to do some portfolio mixing to make sure that we can actually -- and mixing and timing to make sure that we can get there over time. And you'll hear more about it as we do even deeper work in the separation process and looking at the BPO business. As far as -- I just want to also transition to this $2.4 billion and make sure that we're clear about what we're doing here. Normally in Xerox, so every year in Xerox, we do a fair amount, as you know, of restructuring and remixing of how we spend money. We get some productivity benefits from our vendors. And we get the rest of the productivity benefits from us. This $2.4 billion is foundational in 3 basic parts. One, we'll get some of it from our normal interactions with our suppliers to make sure they actually drive some of their productivity and give that to us. We think that'll be about $1 billion over the 3 years, plus or -- give or take some. And we also get, naturally every year, a level of productivity from both our tech and services business foundational. And what we're explaining and what we're doing with this transformation is taking that first part and the second part and adding on top of it a $600 million additional savings program. And we're doing that by changing -- focusing on changing how we work. This is not -- and it's a big -- we're kind of readying ourselves for the markets in the future and the business in the future and trying to actually shift out -- take out an additional $600 million as we go forward.

When Ursula was talking about customer care, it is clearly our objective to expand the customer care margin. It is not our objective to increase the proportion of customer care business inside of our BPO business. So we certainly want to grow customer care. We want to grow the other higher-value offers more quickly so that we can drive the BPO margin up. With regard to cost transformation, we save about -- we capture about $600 million a year, which is roughly 4% to 5% kind of annual productivity. In addition to that, in 2016, we're expecting an annualized savings from the transformation program of about $100 million, and that will be captured from a variety of focus areas, things like the structure of the organization so we can start the 2 separated companies lean, which will include both layers of management as well as support functions and infrastructure. It will include labor productivity and taking advantage of automation and changing how we deliver services to our customers. So our expectation is that we will invest about $200 million in restructuring this year, in 2016. And since we will be doing the transformation throughout the year, we're really just starting, we expect the savings that we generate in 2016 will be probably around $50 million from the strategic -- from year 1 of that incremental program."

But in some of the areas that you're poking about -- poking at, there has not been a whole lot of integration in, for instance, IT between the ACS acquisition back then and the legacy Xerox. So we'll talk more about dissynergies as we go forward, but we certainly expect the benefits of the separation and inclusive of the strategic transformation to more than offset any of the dissynergies."

I am pleased to report that at the end of the first quarter, we are on track to deliver on our 3 commitments for the year: meeting our guidance, reaching the first year target for our strategic transformation program and completing our separation into 2 companies. I'll begin with an update on our progress on the new path forward for Xerox before turning to first quarter results. 
In January, we announced plans to separate into 2 independent publicly-traded companies, one comprising our Document Technology and Document Outsourcing businesses, and the other our Business Process Outsourcing business. Both will be Fortune 500 scale companies that are leaders in their respective industry. 
Further demonstrating our commitment to driving shareholder value, we concurrently announced a strategic transformation program to deliver $2.4 billion in cumulative savings over 3 years, which includes both ongoing and incremental initiatives to enhance productivity and efficiency. We are looking at all aspects of our business to make them more agile and competitive and expect to achieve $700 million in annualized savings this year. Together, these actions will create 2 focused companies that have strategies, talent and the organizational and capital structures needed to compete in their markets. 
We are making progress on both of these initiatives and I am confident that we're making the right steps to best position each company for the future. We've had positive feedback on our plans. Over the last few months, we've been talking to employees, clients and partners regularly about the benefits of the separation and what it means for them. Our clients see the benefits of increased focus and responsiveness to the market. 
In fact, I met with the executive teams of 2 major clients in the past couple of weeks, both in the top 75 of the Fortune 500 and both expressed their positive view and our employees tell us they are excited to be part of the journey and to work for that are innovative and leading in their industries. 
During the last 3 months, we have made substantial progress in building strong operational and financial foundations for both companies. We formed a program management office or PMO, that is driving the separation and strategic transformation initiatives, reporting to an executive steering committee that I lead. The PMO working with the business teams is designing operating models and organizational structures. It is also responsible for structuring the separation transaction and a designing the optimal capital and legal structures. We are also taking a close look at the business strategies for both Document Technology and BPO to ensure they are fully optimized. 
We have identified a number of ways to sharpen each business strategy and improve execution. We are completing this analysis and we'll develop detailed action plans to capture the highest value opportunities. Some of that implementation will begin this year with more to come postseparation. 
Many of you have asked about milestone decisions regarding leadership and financials. These are critical decisions that require a thoughtful process. While I can't answer all of your questions at this stage, I can share a few insights on where we stand. With regards to the leadership of the 2 companies, our search is well underway and we have high-quality candidates for each key executive role. While the timing for completing the hiring process for various senior roles is very difficult to predict, we're targeting to fulfill the top roles by mid year. 
In addition to management teams, we are reviewing candidates to fill the additional boards created as a result of the separation. On financials. The big milestone is the filing of our initial Form 10 registration statement with the SEC. We are on track to do that in July in line with our goal of completing the separation by year-end. We've decided that the optimal yay to execute the separation is through our tax-free spin-off of our BPO business. The Form 10 will describe the transaction in detail and provide more information on the BPO company. 
We have also quantified the cost associated with the separation and the first year of the strategic transformation program. We expect to incur onetime separation costs of $200 million to $250 million and restructuring costs of $300 million. Leslie will provide further details on this shortly. So all in all, very good progress on these initiatives. We're on track to launch 2 companies at year-end that will have the right strategies, the right structures and the right leaders. 
With that said, I want to emphasize that we are managing these programs to ensure our executive team and employees remain focused on serving our clients with excellence and delivering our 2016 plans. So let's talk about how we're doing on that front. 
In the first quarter of 2015, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.22 within our guidance range, GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.03. Total revenue of $4.3 billion was down 4% or 3% in constant currency, reflecting growth in our Document Outsourcing and BPO business offset by continued revenue pressures in our Document Technology segment. Operating margin of 7.2% declined 130 basis points year-over-year. 
In Services revenue, growth improved and margin increased modestly compared to last year. Document Technology revenue continues to be impacted by the weakness in developing markets and currency negatively impacted Doc Tech margin. As a result of these factors, we have accelerated our cost-reduction initiatives resulting in a sizable restructuring charge. We expect to realize the benefits of these actions beginning in the second quarter. 
During the quarter, we also continue to strengthen our portfolio with new products and offerings that showcase our innovation. Here are a few examples. In the healthcare market, we launched Xerox health outcomes solutions, a full of livestock cycle population health management solution, designed to help providers adapt to value-based contracts. 
The centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have set a requirement that by 2018, 50% of all payments must be value-based, meaning providers are compensated for a healthy outcome rather than each service provided. According to a survey that we had sponsored, healthcare providers and payers need to significantly accelerate their efforts to adapt to this standard. So we see a big opportunity for this product. 
Our transportation team introduced the Go Denver and Go LA mobile app to help residents and tourists make transportation choices more easily and effectively. Commuters in Denver and Los Angeles can use Xerox-powered apps to search for the cheapest, fastest and most sustainable way to move around these cities. We expanded the capabilities of our ConnectKey platform targeting the large office market. This new and refreshed collection of apps and tools boosts workplace productivity by tightly integrating our 14 ConnectKey multifunction devices with Cloud-hosted services and mobile communication technologies. It is innovative -- innovations like these that enable us to maintain our #1 market share position in MPS. 
And for our Graphic Communications customers. We introduced 2 new next-generation inkjet presses, the Xerox Brenda HBU production and the Xerox 2400 inkjet press. These represent the first of a new series of innovative inkjet products that will enhance our high-end printing offerings. We look forward to ramping up sales later this year.
Looking to cash flow. We used $25 million in our cash from operations, which is in line with seasonality and ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $1.2 billion. Bottom line, we met our guidance and are confident that we're taking the right steps to achieve full year objectives. Some of our underlying results were mixed and we are pulling all levers within our control to successfully navigate in a challenging market environment and best position our business for the future. 
I will turn it over to Leslie, who will provide more detail on our financial results and 2016 guidance."

I'll start by walking through the income statement and then discuss guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. Before I get started, I'll remind you that the information I'm sharing reflects the reporting revisions we announced last quarter. 
Total revenue of $4.3 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.22 were within our expectations. Services delivered modest profit growth while Document Technology declined due to revenue and transaction currency headwind and cost reduction timing. Revenues in the quarter were down 4% at actual currency and 3% at constant currency, an improvement from the 5% constant currency decline in quarter 4. Services' top line was up 2% at constant currency with growth in both the growth Document Outsourcing and BPO. Document Technology declined 9% at constant currency and drove the overall revenue decline. I'll speak more about both segments in a moment.
Gross margin of 30.3% was down 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by declines in Document Technology and a greater mix of Services, which structurally has a lower gross margin. Our D&E was lower by $8 million year-over-year and SAG was down $35 million or 4%. Good expense reduction in absolute terms but not sufficient to offset growth in gross margin declines resulting in operating margin of 7.2%, down 130 basis points year-over-year and an 18% operating profit decline. 
Adjusted other net expense was higher by $8 million year-over-year, driven by higher litigation reserves while equity income of $37 million in the quarter was up $3 million year-over-year. Our first quarter adjusted tax rate of 22.5% was below our guidance range of 26% to 28%, benefiting our earnings by about $0.01, and reflecting higher foreign tax credits as well as the geographic mix of topics. Bottom line, adjusted earnings of $0.22 was within our guidance of $0.20 $0.01 at $0.24 and was $0.02 lower, driven by Document Technology. 
Taking a closer look at Services. Results in the quarter were largely in line with expectations. Good top line growth continued in Document Outsourcing and BPO was up slightly. Margin improved modestly year-over-year. Together, those 2 drove 2% segment profit growth. Services revenue grew 1% or 2% at constant currency. BPO was up 1% at constant currency as growth from acquisitions and new contract ramp, particularly in healthcare, more than half said headwinds in commercial from volumes declined in lost business. Our decision and subsequent agreements with California and Montana not to complete the Health Enterprise Medicaid platform implementation was a revenue headwind but was partially offset by last year's first quarter California Health Enterprise adjustments. 
Good growth continues in Document Outsourcing, up 5% at constant currency, driven by strong Xerox Partner Print Services growth as well as strong equipment revenue growth in large enterprise accounts following strong 2015 signings.
Total signings in the quarter were down 11% year-over-year but up 9% for the trailing 12 months. The year-over-year decline was driven by fewer renewal opportunities this quarter. The Total Contract Value of our new business signings was up 6% year-over-year, driven by good growth in public sector. 
Our renewal rate in the quarter was quite strong in 89% so at the high-end at our 85% to 90% range. Services segment margin was 7.7%, up 10 basis points year-over-year. Improvements in Government Healthcare, including the Health Enterprise decisions we made last year, were, partially offset by margin declines, driven in part by customer care where we have operational and efficiency opportunities. We've hired 2 well respected leaders from the industry and they're beginning to implement changes to drive improved results. 
Document Outsourcing margins were down modestly in the quarter remained strong and well above the Services margin. So good progress on growth and we're taking additional action to drive further margin improvement. I'll now turn to Document Technology.
This was a challenging quarter for the Document Technology business with economic currency and product cycle headwinds. Revenue was down 9% at constant currency in line with quarter 4. Equipment revenue was down 14% year-over-year, including much higher declines in developing markets, especially the Middle East and Russia. Supplies revenue was down 7% year-over-year, much better than quarter 4 as channel inventory returned to more normalized levels. 
When we include Document Outsourcing with Document Technology, the revenue decline continued at about 5%, which largely reflects the current revenue profile of the new Document Technology company postseparation. Turning to activity. Within entry, A4 color MSD growth was up 1%, but overall results were pressured by developing markets. Mid-range color MSPs also grew 1%, driven by growth in Document Outsourcing. We're expecting the new I series products launched in March to result in better mid-range growth as we move through 2016. 
High-end was the strongest performing product area with color installs up 56%, including strong growth in the entry production color product in iGen and we're looking forward to the upcoming group of printing trade show in early June, where we'll be highlighting a number of new exciting production printing products especially in production inkjets. 
Document Technology margins of 10.2% was down 250 basis points year-over-year. As you know, quarter 1 is seasonally weak. Approximately 100 basis points of the year-over-year decline was driven by transaction currency. At March 31 rates, we expect very modest transaction currency impacts in quarter 2 and for the balance of the year. The equipment price declines in the quarter remained within our historic range of 5% to 10%. 
The quarter 1 margin also reflects productivity, only partially offsetting the impact of revenue declines. Following lower restructuring in the second half of 2015, we significantly ramped up restructuring in quarter 1 and expect to capture incremental benefits from the strategic transformation program as we move through the year. Despite the first quarter challenges, we're confident that trend in both revenue and margin will improve, benefiting from recent product launches and cost actions. 
Moving to cash flow. Operating cash flow with the use of $25 million in the quarter and in line with our expectations, reflecting lower net income, a Health Enterprise settlement payment, and normal working capital seasonality following a strong close to 2015. Investing cash flows were a use of $125 million and included $72 million spent on CapEx, a $52 million payment to Atos for the final working capital work adjustment for 2015 ITO divestiture and $18 million invested for a small technology acquisition. 
Cash flow from financing was a $42 million use and include $77 million for preferred and common stock dividend. In the quarter, we retired a $700 million senior note and refinanced it with a senior unsecured bank loan. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion and continues to provide us flexibility as we move through 2016. 
Turning to our capital structure and capital allocation. We ended quarter 1 with $7.4 billion of debt, roughly in line with our year-end debt level. Applying 7 to 1 leverage to our customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of Q1 was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion. We continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit rating. 
Now to touch on capital allocation. We have a strong shareholder returns track record, having returned over 70% of free cash flow to our shareholders since 2011. Building on this, we announced last quarter an 11% increase to our common dividend effective with the dividend payable on April 29 of this year. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. 
Turning to the next slide, I'll share with you our second quarter earnings expectations and update date our full-year guidance to incorporate the separation related costs and higher restructuring, which Ursula just discussed earlier. For the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings in the range of $0.24 to $0.26 and GAAP earnings of $0.06 to $0.08. For the full year, we are reaffirming our revenue guidance of a 2% to 4% constant currency decline and adjusted earnings guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 per share. 
We are maintain in our segment revenue growth and margin segment changes for both Services and Technology. We're adjusting our full-year GAAP guidance to incorporate the $200 million to $250 million of separation costs that Ursula previously discussed. Separation costs include professional fees, transaction costs and operational separation investment. We haven't yet included any tax charges to prepare for the separation. We plan to share additional separation details in July after we file the initial Form 10.
As Ursula mentioned, we're accelerating our strategic transformation initiative and therefore, expect to incur higher restructuring and related costs. We now expect to spend $300 million for the full year, $100 million more than we previously guided. And in quarter 2, we expect to incur about $100 million in the restructuring costs. Including the separation costs and the higher restructuring costs, we now expect full-year GAAP EPS of $0.45 to $0.55 per share. 
We're adjusting our cash flow guidance to reflect both the cash separation costs and higher restructuring. We began this year with operating cash flow guidance of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. We indicated at the time that our guidance included $200 million of restructuring costs, but did not yet contemplate separation costs. Factoring in cash separation costs of $200 million to $250 million and the $100 million higher restructuring costs, we now expect operating cash flow of $950 million to $1.2 billion. 
We are also modestly increasing our CapEx guidance to $350 million to incorporate expenditures resulting in updated free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $850 million. This is an unusual year with separation-related investment pressuring cash flow well below normal levels. We're revising our capital allocation expectations to reflect our updated free cash flow guidance. 
Dividends will be approximately $350 million for the year and reflect the 11% increase. We expect acquisition investments will approximate $100 million and we'll use the remainder of our free cash flow to reduced debt as we seek to optimize the capital structures of the 2 companies. Share repurchases have been a significant part of our capital deployment during the past few years, including $1.3 billion last year as we returned to shareholders a large portion of our strong cash flow, including the ITO divestiture proceeds. This year, given the separation, we don't plan to repurchase any shares. 
So in summary, a mixed quarter but we met our guidance and remain committed to delivering our full-year objectives with accelerated strategic transformation benefits to protect the bottom line. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Ursula to wrap up."

And I'll answer the question from the combined company perspective, that's the best way to address it and we'll talk about the split companies when we get further in the year. Our ability to generate cash and to have it available to operate the business in 2016 is identical, nearly identical to what our ability to generate cash and have it available in 2015. It's really important that we understand that -- let you understand that about $1.6 billion operating cash flow in the year in 2016. We have to spend more on restructuring which we talked about. I think that's a good investment, a very solid investment in '16 and we'll benefit some in 2016 and we'll definitely benefit the 2 companies as we separate. We have separation costs, which are unique and -- in '16, we'll have some in 2017, but a very small amount, a very, very small amount. We have normal CapEx of about $300 million. We have an additional $50 million of CapEx for associated with separation that is also unique in 2016 that give us a cash a balance, a new free cash flow of somewhat [indiscernible] $600 million and $850 million. But most of that $850 million -- the $600 million, the reason why we're there is because of things that we don't expect to repeat in 2017. So as we flow into 2017 or at least 2016, we'll have the a cash ability, generating ability of the 2 new companies that will be circa $1.6 billion just like it is this year without these onetime costs associated with the separation and with the big restructuring that we're taking. So we don't say that we don't view that a lot has changed over the last 4 months that we talked to you at all. We're getting more clear, which we expect to do. We get more clear as we speak to you throughout the year, but it is important that you keep an eye on the fact that fundamental cash flow and fundamental operation of the business has not changed that much."

On a full-year basis, Doc Tech margin, Doc Tech revenue, we are reiterating our guidance and confident that we'll be able to get there. So no debate there. As far as the margins go and the revenue in the first quarter, they were a little bit lighter than we would've expected but not anything that would allow us that would cause us, as I said, to change our guidance. Think about -- if you think about what we did in the second half of last year and actually, in the first quarter so far of this year, the second half of last year we took no restructuring in the Doc Tech business. We did all of our restructuring in the Services segment. So we knew that we would have pressure in margins in the first quarter because we had literally no restructuring to offset the revenue declines. We've doubled up on restructuring in the first quarter. We have even more to do and we've announced the additional $100 million in the second quarter. And we'll top the year at $300 million to restructuring, which is why we are confident that we will be able to actually hit the margin range for the full company that we've talked about, the EPS that we talked about and the adjusted EPS at the talked about. And the revenue shouldn't change that much. So it's the way of the business is slowing, no restructuring second half of the year, big restructuring this year help us to maintain and drive the margin range that we talked about in Doc Tech and in Services and no, we're not moving away from focusing in the market and will be able to actually the revenue guidance that we hit as well."

I am pleased to report that at the end of the first quarter, we are on track to deliver on our 3 commitments for the year: meeting our guidance, reaching the first year target for our strategic transformation pr",1302,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to report that at the end of the first quarter, we are on track to deliver on our 3 commitments for the year: meeting our guidance, reaching the first year target for our strategic transformation program and completing our separation into 2 companies. I'll begin with an update on our progress on the new path forward for Xerox before turning to first quarter results. 
In January, we announced plans to separate into 2 independent publicly-traded companies, one comprising our Document Technology and Document Outsourcing businesses and the other, our Business Process Outsourcing business. Both will be Fortune 500 scale companies that are leaders in their respective industries. 
Further demonstrating our commitment to driving shareholder value, we concurrently announced a strategic transformation program to deliver $2.4 billion in cumulative savings over 3 years, which includes both ongoing and incremental initiatives to enhance productivity and efficiency. We are looking at all aspects of our business to make them more agile and competitive and expect to achieve $700 million in annualized savings this year. Together, these actions will create 2 focused companies that have strategies, talent and the organizational and capital structures needed to compete in their markets. 
We are making progress on both of these initiatives, and I am confident that we're making the right steps to best position each company for the future. We've had positive feedback on our plans. Over the last few months, we've been talking to employees, clients and partners regularly about the benefits of the separation and what it means for them. Our clients see the benefits of increased focus and responsiveness to the market. 
In fact, I met with the executive teams of 2 major clients in the past couple of weeks, both in the top 75 of the Fortune 500 and both expressed their positive view, and our employees tell us they are excited to be part of the journey and to work for companies that are innovative and leading their industries. 
During the last 3 months, we have made substantial progress in building strong operational and financial foundations for both companies. We formed a program management office, or PMO, that is driving the separation and strategic transformation initiatives, reporting to an executive steering committee that I lead. The PMO working with the business teams is designing operating models and organizational structures. It is also responsible for structuring the separation transaction and designing the optimal capital and legal structures. We are also taking a close look at the business strategies for both Document Technology and BPO to ensure they are fully optimized. We have identified a number of ways to sharpen each business strategy and improve execution. We are completing this analysis, and we'll develop detailed action plans to capture the highest value opportunities. Some of that implementation will begin this year with more to come post-separation. 
Many of you have asked about milestone decisions regarding leadership and financials. These are critical decisions that require a thoughtful process. While I can't answer all of your questions at this stage, I can share a few insights on where we stand. With regards to the leadership of the 2 companies, our searches are well underway, and we have high-quality candidates for each key executive role. While the timing for completing the hiring process for various senior roles is difficult to predict. We are targeting to fill the top roles by mid-year. 
In addition to management teams, we are reviewing candidates to fill the additional board seats created as a result of the separation. 
On financials, the big milestone is the filing of our initial Form 10 registration statement with the SEC. We are on track to do that in July in line with our goal of completing the separation by year-end. We've decided that the optimal way to execute the separation is through a tax-free spinoff of our BPO business. The Form 10 will describe the transaction in detail and provide more information on the BPO company. 
We have also quantified the costs associated with the separation and the first year of the strategic transformation program. We expect to incur onetime separation cost of $200 million to $250 million and restructuring cost of $300 million. Leslie will provide further details on this shortly. 
So all in all, very good progress on these initiatives. We're on track to launch 2 companies at year-end that will have the right strategies, the right structures and the right leaders. 
With that said, I want to emphasize that we are managing these programs to ensure our executive team and employees remain focused on serving our clients with excellence and delivering our 2016 plans. So let's talk about how we're doing on that front. 
In the first quarter of 2016, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.22 within our guidance range. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.03. Total revenue of $4.3 billion was down 4% or 3% in constant currency, reflecting growth in our Document Outsourcing and BPO businesses, offset by continued revenue pressures in our Document Technology segment. Operating margin of 7.2% declined 130 basis points year-over-year. 
In Services revenue, growth improved and margin increased modestly compared to last year. Document Technology revenue continues to be impacted by the weakness in developing markets, and currency negatively impacted Doc Tech margin. As a result of these factors, we have accelerated our cost-reduction initiatives resulting in a sizable restructuring charge. We expect to realize the benefits of these actions beginning in the second quarter. 
During the quarter, we also continue to strengthen our portfolio with new products and offerings that showcase our innovation. Here are a few examples. In the health care market, we launched Xerox Health Outcomes Solutions, a full life cycle population health management solution designed to help providers adapt to value-based contracts. The centers for Medicare and Medicaid services have set a requirement that by 2018, 50% of all payments must be value-based, meaning providers are compensated for healthy outcome rather than each service provided. According to a survey that we sponsored, health care providers and payers need to significantly accelerate their efforts to adapt to this standard. So we see a big opportunity for this product. 
Our transportation team introduced the Go Denver and Go LA mobile app to help residents and tourists make transportation choices more easily and effectively. Commuters in Denver and Los Angeles can use Xerox-powered apps to search for the cheapest, fastest and most sustainable way to move around these cities. We expanded the capabilities of our ConnectKey platform, targeting the large office market. This new and refreshed collection of apps and tools boosts workplace productivity by tightly integrating our 14 ConnectKey iSeries multifunction devices with Cloud-hosted services and mobile communications technologies. It is innovative -- innovations like these that enable us to maintain our #1 market share position in MPS. 
And for our Graphic Communications customers. We introduced 2 new next-generation inkjet presses, the Xerox Brenda HD Production Inkjet and the Xerox Trivor 2400 Inkjet Press. These represent the first of a new series of innovative inkjet products that will enhance our high-end printing offerings. We look forward to ramping up sales later this year.
Looking to cash flow. We used $25 million in our cash from operations, is in line with seasonality and ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $1.2 billion. Bottom line, we met our guidance and are confident that we're taking the right steps to achieve full year objectives. Some of our underlying results were mixed, and we are pulling all levers within our control to successfully navigate in a challenging market environment and best position our businesses for the future. 
I will turn it over to Leslie, who will provide more detail on our financial results and 2016 guidance."

Before I get started, I'll remind you that the information I'm sharing reflects the reporting revisions we announced last quarter. 
Total revenue of $4.3 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.22 were within our expectations. Services delivered modest profit growth, while Document Technology declined due to revenue and transaction currency headwinds and cost-reduction timing. Revenues in the quarter were down -- was down 4% at actual currency and 3% at constant currency, an improvement from the 5% constant currency decline in quarter 4. Services' top line was up 2% at constant currency with growth in both the growth Document Outsourcing and BPO. Document Technology declined 9% at constant currency and drove the overall revenue decline. I'll speak more about both segments in a moment.
Gross margin of 30.3% was down 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by declines in Document Technology and a greater mix of Services, which structurally has a lower gross margin. RD&E was lower by $8 million year-over-year, and SAG was down $35 million or 4%. Good expense reduction in absolute terms, but not sufficient to offset gross margin declines resulting in operating margin of 7.2%, down 130 basis points year-over-year and an 18% operating profit decline. 
Adjusted other net expense was higher by $8 million year-over-year, driven by higher litigation reserves, while equity income of $37 million in the quarter was up $3 million year-over-year. 
Our first quarter adjusted tax rate of 22.5% was below our guidance range of 26% to 28%, benefiting our earnings by about $0.01 and reflecting higher foreign tax credits as well as the geographic mix of profits. Bottom line, adjusted earnings of $0.22 was within our guidance of $0.21 to $0.24 and was $0.02 lower, driven by Document Technology. 
Taking a closer look at Services, results in the quarter were largely in line with expectations. Good top line growth continued in Document Outsourcing and BPO was up slightly. Margin improved modestly year-over-year. Together, those 2 drove 2% segment profit growth. Services' revenue grew 1% or 2% at constant currency. BPO was up 1% at constant currency as growth from acquisitions and new contract ramp, particularly in health care, more than offset headwinds in commercial from volume decline to most business. Our decision and subsequent agreements with California and Montana, not to complete the Health Enterprise Medicaid platform implementation, was a revenue headwind, but was partially offset by last year's first quarter California Health Enterprise adjustments. 
Good growth continues in Document Outsourcing, up 5% at constant currency, driven by strong Xerox Partner Print Services growth as well as strong equipment revenue growth in large enterprise accounts following strong 2015 signings.
Total signings in the quarter were down 11% year-over-year, but up 9% for the trailing 12 months. The year-over-year decline was driven by fewer renewal opportunities this quarter. The total contract value of our new business signings was up 6% year-over-year, driven by good growth in public sector. 
Our renewal rate in the quarter was quite strong in 89%, so at the high-end at our 85% to 90% range. Services segment margin was 7.7%, up 10 basis points year-over-year. Improvements in government healthcare, including the Health Enterprise decisions we made last year, were partially offset by margin declines, driven in part by customer care where we have operational and efficiency opportunities. We've hired 2 well-respected leaders from the industry, and they're beginning to implement changes to drive improved result.
Document Outsourcing margins were down modestly in the quarter remained strong and well above the overall Services margin. So good progress on growth, and we're taking additional action to drive further margin improvement. 
I'll now turn to Document Technology. This was a challenging quarter for the Document Technology business with economic, currency and product cycle headwinds. Revenue was down 9% at constant currency in line with quarter 4. Equipment revenue was down 14% year-over-year, including much higher declines in developing markets, especially the Middle East and Russia. Supplies revenue was down 7% year-over-year, much better than quarter 4 as channel inventory returned to more normalized levels. When we include Document Outsourcing with Document Technology, the revenue decline continued at about 5%, which largely reflects the current revenue profile of the new Document Technology company post-separation. 
Turning to activity. Within entry, A4 Color MFD growth was up 1%, but overall results were pressured by developing markets. Mid-range color MFDs also grew 1%, driven by growth in Document Outsourcing. We're expecting the new iSeries products launched in March to result in better mid-range growth as we move through 2016. 
High-end was the strongest performing product area with color installs up 56%, including strong growth in the entry production color products in iGen. And we're looking forward to the upcoming group of printing trade show in early June, where we'll be highlighting a number of new exciting production printing products, especially in production inkjet. 
Document Technology margins of 10.2% was down 250 basis points year-over-year. As you know, quarter 1 is seasonally weak. Approximately 100 basis points of the year-over-year decline was driven by transaction currency. At March 31 rates, we expect very modest transaction currency impacts in quarter 2 and for the balance of the year. Equipment price declines in the quarter remained within our historic range of 5% to 10%. 
The quarter 1 margin also reflects productivity, only partially offsetting the impact of revenue declines. Following lower restructuring in the second half of 2015, we significantly ramped up restructuring in quarter 1 and expect to capture incremental benefits from the strategic transformation program as we move through the year. Despite the first quarter challenges, we're confident that trend in both revenue and margin will improve, benefiting from recent product launches and cost actions. 
Moving to cash flow. Operating cash flow with the use of $25 million in the quarter and in line with our expectations, reflecting lower net income, a Health Enterprise settlement payment and normal working capital seasonality, following a strong close to 2015. Investing cash flows were a use of $125 million and included $72 million spends on CapEx, a $52 million payment to Atos for the final working capital work adjustments for 2015 ITO divestiture and $18 million invested for a small technology acquisition. 
Cash flow from financing was a $42 million use and include $77 million for preferred and common stock dividends. In the quarter, we retired a $700 million senior note and refinanced it with a senior unsecured bank loan. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion and continues to provide us flexibility as we move through 2016. 
Turning to our capital structure and capital allocation. We ended quarter 1 with $7.4 billion of debt, roughly in line with our year-end debt level. Applying 7:1 leverage to our customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of Q1 was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion. We continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit rating. 
Now to touch on capital allocation. We have a strong shareholder returns track record, having returned over 70% of free cash flow to our shareholders since 2011. Building on this, we announced last quarter an 11% increase to our common dividend effective with the dividend payable on April 29 of this year. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. 
Turning to the next slide, I'll share with you our second quarter earnings expectations and update our full year guidance to incorporate the separation-related costs and higher restructuring, which Ursula just discussed earlier. 
For the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings in the range of $0.24 to $0.26 and GAAP earnings of $0.06 to $0.08. For the full year, we are reaffirming our revenue guidance of a 2% to 4% constant currency decline and adjusted earnings guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 per share. 
We are maintaining our segment revenue growth and margin guidance ranges for both Services and Document Technology. We're adjusting our full year GAAP guidance to incorporate the $200 million to $250 million of separation costs that Ursula previously discussed. Separation costs include professional fees, transaction costs and operational separation investment. We haven't yet included any tax charges to prepare for the separation. We plan to share additional separation details in July after we file the initial Form 10.
As Ursula mentioned, we're accelerating our strategic transformation initiative and therefore, expect to incur higher restructuring in related costs. We now expect to spend $300 million for the full year, $100 million more than we previously guided. And in quarter 2, we expect to incur about $100 million in restructuring costs. Including the separation costs and the higher restructuring costs, we now expect full year GAAP EPS of $0.45 to $0.55 per share. 
We're adjusting our cash flow guidance to reflect both the cash separation cost and higher restructuring. We began this year with operating cash flow guidance of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. We indicated at the time that our guidance included $200 million of restructuring cost, but did not yet contemplate separation cost. Factoring in cash separation cost of $200 million to $250 million and the $100 million higher-restructuring cost, we now expect operating cash flow of $950 million to $1.2 billion. 
We are also modestly increasing our CapEx guidance to $350 million to incorporate separation expenditures resulting in updated free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $850 million. This is an unusual year with separation-related investments pressuring cash flow well below normal levels. We're revising our capital allocation expectations to reflect our updated free cash flow guidance. 
Dividends will be approximately $350 million for the year and reflect the 11% increase. We expect acquisition investments will approximate $100 million, and we'll use the remainder of our free cash flow to reduce debt as we seek to optimize the capital structures of the 2 companies. Share repurchases have been a significant part of our capital deployment during the past few years, including $1.3 billion last year as we returned to shareholders a large portion of our strong cash flow, including the ITO divestiture proceeds. This year, given the separation, we don't plan to repurchase any shares. 
So in summary, a mixed quarter, but we met our guidance and remain committed to delivering our full year objectives with accelerated strategic transformation benefits to protect the bottom line. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Ursula to wrap up."

And I'll answer the question from the combined company perspective, that's the best way to address it and we'll talk about the split companies when we get further in the year. Our ability to generate cash and to have it available to operate the business in 2016 is identical, nearly identical to what would our ability to generate cash and have it available in 2015. It's really important that we understand that -- that you'll understand that. About $1.6 billion operating cash flow in the year in 2016. We have to spend more on restructuring, which we talked about. I think that's a good investment, a very solid investment in '16, and we'll benefit some in '16. And we'll definitely benefit the 2 companies as we separate. We have separation costs, which are unique in '16. We'll have some in 2017, but a very small amount, a very, very small amount. We have normal CapEx of about $300 million. We have an additional $50 million of CapEx for -- associated with separation that is also unique in 2016 that give us a cash a balance, a new free cash flow of somewhat we view, $600 million and $850 million. But most of that $850 million to $600 million, the reason why we're there is because of things that we don't expect to repeat in 2017. So as we flow into 2017 or at least 2016, we'll have the a cash ability, generating ability of the 2 new companies that will be circa $1.6 billion, just like it is this year without these onetime costs associated with the separation and with the big restructuring that we're taking. So we don't say that we don't view that a lot has changed over the last 4 months that we've talked to you at all. We're getting more clear, which we expect to do. We get more clear as we speak to you throughout the year, but it is important that you keep an eye on the fact that the fundamental cash flow and fundamental operations of the business hasn't changed that much."

So M&A, $100 million towards the lower end of the range we're doing there. Share repurchases, Leslie will talk about it. But we've moved share repurchase off the table, did $1.3 billion last year, a very, very large amount of share repurchase last year. And we don't think that we'll do any this year, which we focus on debt reduction."

We did all of our restructuring in the Services segment, so we knew that we would have pressure in margins in the first quarter because we had literally no restructuring to offset the revenue declines. We've doubled up on restructuring in the first quarter. We have even more to do, and we've announced the additional $100 million in the second quarter.

I am pleased to report that at the end of the first quarter, we are on track to deliver on our 3 commitments for the year: meeting our guidance, reaching the first year target for our strategic transformation program and completing our separation into 2 companies. I'll begin with an update on our progress on the new path forward for Xerox before turning to first quarter results. 
In January, we announced plans to separate into 2 independent publicly traded companies, one comprising our Document Technology and Document Outsourcing businesses and the other, our Business Process Outsourcing business. Both will be Fortune 500 scale companies that are leaders in their respective industries. 
Further demonstrating our commitment to driving shareholder value, we concurrently announced a strategic transformation program to deliver $2.4 billion in cumulative savings over 3 years, which includes both ongoing and incremental initiatives to enhance productivity and efficiency. We are looking at all aspects of our business to make them more agile and competitive and expect to achieve $700 million in annualized savings this year. Together, these actions will create 2 focused companies that have strategies, talent and the organizational and capital structures needed to compete in their markets. 
We are making progress on both of these initiatives, and I am confident that we're making the right steps to best position each company for the future. We've had positive feedback on our plans. Over the last few months, we've been talking to employees, clients and partners regularly about the benefits of the separation and what it means for them. Our clients see the benefits of increased focus and responsiveness to the market. 
In fact, I met with the executive teams of 2 major clients in the past couple of weeks, both in the top 75 of the Fortune 500 and both expressed their positive view, and our employees tell us they are excited to be part of the journey and to work for companies that are innovative and leading their industries. 
During the last 3 months, we have made substantial progress in building strong operational and financial foundations for both companies. We formed a program management office, or PMO, that is driving the separation and strategic transformation initiatives, reporting to an executive steering committee that I lead. The PMO working with the business teams is designing operating models and organizational structures. It is also responsible for structuring the separation transaction and designing the optimal capital and legal structures. We are also taking a close look at the business strategies for both Document Technology and BPO to ensure they are fully optimized. We have identified a number of ways to sharpen each business strategy and improve execution. We are completing this analysis, and will develop detailed action plans to capture the highest value opportunities. Some of that implementation will begin this year with more to come post-separation. 
Many of you have asked about milestone decisions regarding leadership and financials. These are critical decisions that require a thoughtful process. While I can't answer all of your questions at this stage, I can share a few insights on where we stand. With regards to the leadership of the 2 companies, our searches are well underway, and we have high-quality candidates for each key executive role. While the timing for completing the hiring process for various senior roles is difficult to predict, we are targeting to fill the top roles by mid-year. 
In addition to management teams, we are reviewing candidates to fill the additional board seats created as a result of the separation. 
On financials, the big milestone is the filing of our initial Form 10 registration statement with the SEC. We are on track to do that in July in line with our goal of completing the separation by year-end. We've decided that the optimal way to execute the separation is through a tax-free spinoff of our BPO business. The Form 10 will describe the transaction in detail and provide more information on the BPO company. 
We have also quantified the costs associated with the separation and the first year of the strategic transformation program. We expect to incur onetime separation cost of $200 million to $250 million and restructuring cost of $300 million. Leslie will provide further details on this shortly. 
So all in all, very good progress on these initiatives. We're on track to launch 2 companies at year-end that will have the right strategies, the right structures and the right leaders. 
With that said, I want to emphasize that we are managing these programs to ensure our executive team and employees remain focused on serving our clients with excellence and delivering our 2016 plans. So let's talk about how we're doing on that front. 
In the first quarter of 2016, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.22 within our guidance range. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.03. Total revenue of $4.3 billion was down 4% or 3% in constant currency, reflecting growth in our Document Outsourcing and BPO businesses, offset by continued revenue pressures in our Document Technology segment. Operating margin of 7.2% declined 130 basis points year-over-year. 
In Services revenue, growth improved and margin increased modestly compared to last year. Document Technology revenue continues to be impacted by the weakness in developing markets, and currency negatively impacted Doc Tech margin. As a result of these factors, we have accelerated our cost-reduction initiatives resulting in a sizable restructuring charge. We expect to realize the benefits of these actions beginning in the second quarter. 
During the quarter, we also continue to strengthen our portfolio with new products and offerings that showcase our innovation. Here are a few examples. In the health care market, we launched Xerox Health Outcomes Solutions, a full life cycle population health management solution designed to help providers adapt to value-based contracts. The centers for Medicare and Medicaid services have set a requirement that by 2018, 50% of all payments must be value-based, meaning providers are compensated for healthy outcome rather than each service provided. According to a survey that we sponsored, health care providers and payers need to significantly accelerate their efforts to adapt to this standard. So we see a big opportunity for this product. 
Our transportation team introduced the Go Denver and Go LA mobile app to help residents and tourists make transportation choices more easily and effectively. Commuters in Denver and Los Angeles can use Xerox-powered apps to search for the cheapest, fastest and most sustainable ways to move around these cities. We expanded the capabilities of our ConnectKey platform, targeting the large office market. This new and refreshed collection of apps and tools boosts workplace productivity by tightly integrating our 14 ConnectKey iSeries multifunction devices with Cloud-hosted services and mobile communications technologies. It is innovative -- innovations like these that enable us to maintain our #1 market share position in MPS. 
And for our Graphic Communications customers. We introduced 2 new next-generation inkjet presses, the Xerox Brenva HD Production Inkjet and the Xerox Trivor 2400 Inkjet Press. These represent the first of a new series of innovative inkjet products that will enhance our high-end printing offerings. We look forward to ramping up sales later this year.
Looking to cash flow. We use $25 million in our cash from operations, is in line with seasonality and ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $1.2 billion. Bottom line, we met our guidance and are confident that we're taking the right steps to achieve full year objectives. Some of our underlying results were mixed, and we are pulling all levers within our control to successfully navigate in a challenging market environment and best position our businesses for the future. 
I will turn it over to Leslie, who will provide more detail on our financial results and 2016 guidance."

I'll start by walking through the income statement and then discuss guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. Before I get started, I'll remind you that the information I'm sharing reflects the reporting revisions we announced last quarter. 
Total revenue of $4.3 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.22 were within our expectations. Services delivered modest profit growth, while Document Technology declined due to revenue and transaction currency headwinds and cost-reduction timing. Revenues in the quarter were down -- was down 4% at actual currency and 3% at constant currency, an improvement from the 5% constant currency decline in quarter 4. Services' top line was up 2% at constant currency with growth in both Document Outsourcing and BPO. Document Technology declined 9% at constant currency and drove the overall revenue decline. I'll speak more about both segments in a moment.
Gross margin of 30.3% was down 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by declines in Document Technology and a greater mix of Services, which structurally has a lower gross margin. RD&E was lower by $8 million year-over-year, and SAG was down $35 million or 4%. Good expense reduction in absolute terms, but not sufficient to offset gross margin declines resulting in operating margin of 7.2%, down 130 basis points year-over-year and an 18% operating profit decline. 
Adjusted other net expense was higher by $8 million year-over-year, driven by higher litigation reserves, while equity income of $37 million in the quarter was up $3 million year-over-year. 
Our first quarter adjusted tax rate of 22.5% was below our guidance range of 26% to 28%, benefiting our earnings by about $0.01 and reflecting higher foreign tax credits as well as the geographic mix of profits. Bottom line, adjusted earnings of $0.22 was within our guidance of $0.21 to $0.24 and was $0.02 lower, driven by Document Technology. 
Taking a closer look at Services, results in the quarter were largely in line with expectations. Good top line growth continued in Document Outsourcing and BPO was up slightly. Margin improved modestly year-over-year. Together, those 2 drove 2% segment profit growth. Services' revenue grew 1% or 2% at constant currency. BPO was up 1% at constant currency as growth from acquisitions and new contract ramp, particularly in health care, more than offset headwinds in commercial from volume declines and lost business. Our decision and subsequent agreements with California and Montana not to complete the Health Enterprise Medicaid platform implementation was a revenue headwind, but was partially offset by last year's first quarter California Health Enterprise adjustments. 
Good growth continues in Document Outsourcing, up 5% at constant currency, driven by strong Xerox Partner Print Services growth as well as strong equipment revenue growth in large enterprise accounts following strong 2015 signings.
Total signings in the quarter were down 11% year-over-year, but up 9% for the trailing 12 months. The year-over-year decline was driven by fewer renewal opportunities this quarter. The total contract value of our new business signings was up 6% year-over-year, driven by good growth in public sector. 
Our renewal rate in the quarter was quite strong at 89%, so at the high-end at our 85% to 90% range. Services segment margin was 7.7%, up 10 basis points year-over-year. Improvements in government healthcare, including the Health Enterprise decisions we made last year, were partially offset by margin declines, driven in part by customer care where we have operational and efficiency opportunities. We've hired 2 well-respected leaders from the industry, and they're beginning to implement changes to drive improved results.
Document Outsourcing margins, while down modestly in the quarter, remains strong and well above the overall Services margin. So good progress on growth, and we're taking additional action to drive further margin improvement. 
I'll now turn to Document Technology. This was a challenging quarter for the Document Technology business with economic, currency and product cycle headwinds. Revenue was down 9% at constant currency in line with quarter 4. Equipment revenue was down 14% year-over-year, including much higher declines in developing markets, especially the Middle East and Russia. Supplies revenue was down 7% year-over-year, much better than quarter 4 as channel inventory returned to more normalized levels. When we include Document Outsourcing with Document Technology, the revenue decline continued at about 5%, which largely reflects the current revenue profile of the new Document Technology company post-separation. 
Turning to activity. Within entry, A4 Color MFD growth was up 1%, but overall results were pressured by developing markets. Mid-range color MFDs also grew 1%, driven by growth in Document Outsourcing. We're expecting the new iSeries products launched in March to result in better mid-range growth as we move through 2016. 
High-end was the strongest performing product area with color installs up 56%, including strong growth in the entry production color products in iGen. And we're looking forward to the upcoming Drupa printing trade show in early June, where we'll be highlighting a number of exciting new production printing products, especially in production inkjet. 
Document Technology margin of 10.2% was down 250 basis points year-over-year. As you know, quarter 1 is seasonally weak. Approximately 100 basis points of the year-over-year decline was driven by transaction currency. At March 31 rates, we expect very modest transaction currency impacts in quarter 2 and for the balance of the year. Equipment price declines in the quarter remained within our historic range of 5% to 10%. 
The quarter 1 margin also reflects productivity, only partially offsetting the impact of revenue declines. Following lower restructuring in the second half of 2015, we significantly ramped up restructuring in quarter 1 and expect to capture incremental benefits from the strategic transformation program as we move through the year. Despite the first quarter challenges, we're confident that trend in both revenue and margin will improve, benefiting from recent product launches and cost actions. 
Moving to cash flow. Operating cash flow with the use of $25 million in the quarter and in line with our expectations, reflecting lower net income, a Health Enterprise settlement payment and normal working capital seasonality, following a strong close to 2015. Investing cash flows were a use of $125 million and included $72 million spent on CapEx, a $52 million payment to Atos for the final working capital adjustments for 2015 ITO divestiture and $18 million invested for a small technology acquisition. 
Cash flow from financing was a $42 million use and include $77 million for preferred and common stock dividends. In the quarter, we retired a $700 million senior note and refinanced it with a senior unsecured bank loan. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion and continues to provide us flexibility as we move through 2016. 
Turning to our capital structure and capital allocation. We ended quarter 1 with $7.4 billion of debt, roughly in line with our year-end debt level. Applying 7:1 leverage to our customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of Q1 was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion. We continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit rating. 
Now to touch on capital allocation. We have a strong shareholder returns track record, having returned over 70% of free cash flow to our shareholders since 2011. Building on this, we announced last quarter an 11% increase to our common dividend effective with the dividend payable on April 29 of this year. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter. 
Turning to the next slide, I'll share with you our second quarter earnings expectations and update our full year guidance to incorporate the separation-related costs and higher restructuring, which Ursula just discussed earlier. 
For the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings in the range of $0.24 to $0.26 and GAAP earnings of $0.06 to $0.08. For the full year, we are reaffirming our revenue guidance of a 2% to 4% constant currency decline and adjusted earnings guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 per share. 
We are maintaining our segment revenue growth and margin guidance ranges for both Services and Document Technology. We're adjusting our full year GAAP guidance to incorporate the $200 million to $250 million of separation costs that Ursula previously discussed. Separation costs include professional fees, transaction costs and operational separation investment. We haven't yet included any tax charges to prepare for the separation. We plan to share additional separation details in July after we file the initial Form 10.
As Ursula mentioned, we're accelerating our strategic transformation initiative and therefore, expect to incur higher restructuring and related costs. We now expect to spend $300 million for the full year, $100 million more than we previously guided. And in quarter 2, we expect to incur about $100 million in restructuring costs. Including the separation costs and the higher restructuring costs, we now expect full year GAAP EPS of $0.45 to $0.55 per share. 
We're adjusting our cash flow guidance to reflect both the cash separation cost and higher restructuring. We began this year with operating cash flow guidance of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. We indicated at the time that our guidance included $200 million of restructuring cost, but did not yet contemplate separation cost. Factoring in cash separation cost of $200 million to $250 million and the $100 million higher-restructuring cost, we now expect operating cash flow of $950 million to $1.2 billion. 
We are also modestly increasing our CapEx guidance to $350 million to incorporate separation expenditures resulting in updated free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $850 million. This is an unusual year with separation-related investments pressuring cash flow well below normal levels. We're revising our capital allocation expectations to reflect our updated free cash flow guidance. 
Dividends will be approximately $350 million for the year and reflect the 11% increase. We expect acquisition investments will approximate $100 million, and we'll use the remainder of our free cash flow to reduce debt as we seek to optimize the capital structures of the 2 companies. Share repurchases have been a significant part of our capital deployment during the past few years, including $1.3 billion last year as we returned to shareholders a large portion of our strong cash flow, including the ITO divestiture proceeds. This year, given the separation, we don't plan to repurchase any shares. 
So in summary, a mixed quarter, but we met our guidance and remain committed to delivering our full year objectives with accelerated strategic transformation benefits to protect the bottom line. 
With that, I'll hand it back to Ursula to wrap up."

And I'll answer the question from the combined company perspective, that's the best way to address it and we'll talk about the split companies when we get further in the year. Our ability to generate cash and to have it available to operate the business in 2016 is identical, nearly identical to what would our ability to generate cash and have it available in 2015. It's really important that we understand that -- that you understand that. About $1.6 billion operating cash flow in the year in 2016. We have to spend more on restructuring, which we talked about. I think that's a good investment, a very solid investment in '16, and we'll benefit some in '16. And we'll definitely benefit the 2 companies as we separate. We have separation costs, which are unique in '16. We'll have some in 2017, but a very small amount, a very, very small amount. We have normal CapEx of about $300 million. We have an additional $50 million of CapEx for -- associated with separation that is also unique in 2016 that give us a cash balance, a new free cash flow of somewhere between $600 million and $850 million. But most of that $850 million to $600 million, the reason why we're there is because of things that we don't expect to repeat in 2017. So as we flow into 2017 or at least 2016, we'll have a cash ability, generating ability of the 2 new companies that will be circa $1.6 billion, just like it is this year without these onetime costs associated with the separation and with the big restructuring that we're taking. So we don't say that we don't view that a lot has changed over the last 4 months that we've talked to at all. We're getting more clear, which we expect to do. We get more clear as we speak to you throughout the year, but it is important that you keep an eye on the fact that the fundamental cash flow and fundamental operations of the business hasn't changed that much."

On a full year basis, Doc Tech margins, Doc Tech revenue, we are reiterating our guidance and confidence that we'll be able to get there. So no debate there. As far as the margins go and the revenue in the first quarter, they were a little bit lighter than we would have expected, but not anything that would allow us, that would cause us, as I said, to change our guidance. Think about -- if you think about what we did in the second half of last year and actually in the first quarter so far of this year but in the second half of last year, we took the -- no restructuring in the Doc Tech business. We did all of our restructuring in the Services segment, so we knew that we would have pressure in margins in the first quarter because we had literally no restructuring to offset the revenue declines. We've doubled up on restructuring in the first quarter. We have even more to do, and we've announced the additional $100 million in the second quarter. And we'll top the year at $300 million of restructuring, which is why we are confident that we'll be able to actually hit the margin range for the full company that we talked about, the EPS that we talked about and the adjusted EPS that we talked about. And the revenue shouldn't change that much. So it's the way of the business is flowing, no restructuring second half of the year, big restructuring this year, help us to do -- help us to maintain and drive the margin range that we talked about in Doc Tech and in Services. And no, we're not moving away from focusing on the market and we'll be able to actually hit the revenue guidance that we've given as well."

Welcome to Xerox's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On our first quarter earnings call, I made our 3 priorities for the year: achieving our 2016 financial plan, implementing our strategic transformation and executing the separation of the company. I also committed to you that we were pulling all the available levers and taking decisive actions to achieve this objective. 
Today, I am pleased to report strong second quarter results and significant progress on all of our priorities. We delivered substantial EPS growth, adjusted EPS above our guidance and margin expansion in both of our business segments, putting us on track to achieve our full year guidance. We also reached the major milestones in our separation process, and for our strategic transformation program and remain on-track to meet our targets for both initiatives. I am more confident than ever in our ability to create 2 companies better positioned to compete in their respective markets and capture opportunities to enhance shareholder value. 
Today, I will begin the call with an update on our separation and strategic transformation before moving to the quarter's financial and operating performance. As you know, in January, we outlined a two-part plan to create shareholder value and best position our businesses for the future, which we call our new path forward. The plan includes separating into 2 Fortune 500 scale, independent publicly-traded companies by year-end and implementing a 3-year strategic transformation program to deliver $2.4 billion in total cost savings from ongoing and incremental productivity and cost-reduction initiatives across our businesses. 
During the second quarter, we took important steps toward both the separation and our strategic transformation program targets. As a recap and starting with the separation, we named the 2 companies that will be created through the separation. The Business Process Outsourcing company will be named Conduent Incorporated, and the Document Technology company will retain the Xerox name. We also identified the CEOs that will lead the 2 new businesses after the separation. [indiscernible] who officially joined us at the beginning of this month will become the CEO of Conduent. Comes with a successful background in the industry and experience in leading corporate transformations. Jeff Jacobson, whom most of you know from his invaluable work as the President of our Technology business will become the CEO of Xerox. Both are exceptional leaders with highly levels in expertise that will be critical to executing the go-forward strategy for each company. You will hear more from them as we approach the separation, and I look forward to working closely with both of them as we continue to build the foundations of the 2 companies and prepare them for standalone. 
With future leaders of the companies in place, we have intensified our CFO searches for each company and Arshak [ph] and Jeff are in the process of identifying the rest of their leadership teams. At the end of June, we filed our initial Form 10 registration statement for Conduent with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This is a major step in the transaction that will separate the companies. The filing or review process with the SEC and we expect to update the file later in the coming months with additional information. 
We have now spoke all costs associated with the separation and are providing additional detail. We are lowering our pretax onetime separation cost estimate to $175 million to $200 million. This is a credit to good cost management by our team, executing the separation process, and we have quantified onetime tax-related costs associated with the separation and expect them to be in the $40 million to $50 million range. Finally, we estimate dyssynergy cost to total $40 million to $50 million. We expect those costs to be more than offset by savings from our strategic transformation program, which I will discuss now. 
We remain on track to deliver $700 million in annualized savings in 2016 and $2.4 billion in total cost savings over 3 years from ongoing and incremental productivity and cost-reduction initiatives across our businesses. We are already seeing benefits as some of the margin expansion we realized in the second quarter was a direct result of these activities. All in all, we made a great deal of progress on the company's new path forward during the quarter and I want to thank the strategic transformation and separation process leaders along with the Xerox management team for their efforts. 
Now I'll provide a high-level overview of our second quarter results before I pass it over to Leslie for additional details. In the second quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.30, representing a 30% year-over-year increase and coming in well above our guidance range of $0.24 to $0.26. GAAP EPS from continuing operations were $0.15, up $0.06 compared to prior year quarter. Year-over-year EPS growth reflects fewer shares and lower tax rate and higher operating profit. 
Total revenue of $4.4 billion was down 4% with minimum currency impact, reflecting a modest revenue decline in Services and improvement in Technology business revenue trend. Operating margin expanded 80 basis points year-over-year to 9.3% led by a 240-basis-point improvement in our Services business. Margin gains reflect sequential cost and productivity improvement across our businesses, including benefits from our strategic transformation program. We generated cash flow from operation of $177 million during the second quarter and ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $1.2 billion. 
So during the quarter, we also had exciting wins in our business and bought several innovations to market. This was an important quarter for our Technology business with Drupa, the biggest printing industry trade show, which occurs every 4 years taking place this June. We reported strong sales in the Production Equipment showcased at the event. In addition, we shared details of our partnership with Koenig and Bauer Chief Solutions group, which we believe will be a game changer for digital carton printing, a growing area of the printing market. 
On the Document Outsourcing side, the Xerox Managed Print Services business was named the Services Quality Supplier of the Year on CS Chrysler Automobiles U.S. based on the success of the global MPS program we implemented for the automaker over the past year. We also launched 15 new automated workflow solutions for the manufacturing retail and higher education industries. In our Services business. Everest Group ranked us as the Top Business Process Services Provider in its BPS Top 50 report just this week. The group also named our contact center outsourcing business an industry leader for the fourth year in a row. Analyst firm HfS Research also recognized Xerox, placing us in the high performance category for contact center operations and finance and accounting as a service and the just this week, we were named to the HfS winner circle, the human resource operations aftermarket survey. 
In transportation. Our work for Septa, Philadelphia area mass transit system went live last month. The program, which runs on a new platform developed by Xerox is a major undertaking, bringing transit riders a new modern payment system. The first phase offers 10,000 riders the opportunity to buy cards for weekly or monthly rides on the subway, trolley and buses. Our healthcare services business introduced a new offering, virtual health solutions, allowing providers to integrate a comprehensive telehealth strategy within their mainstream care delivery system. And Xerox Litigation Services introduced a new analytics-as-a-service-platform. The analytics hub provided corporate counsel and law firms real-time visibility into the Big Data that they manage every day. 
As you can tell, our industry experts are hard at work, building next-generation solutions and capabilities and successfully implementing businesses -- business that we have won. 
So I will now turn it over to Leslie, who will provide more detail on our financial results and 2016 guidance."
103599,369245326,1017224,"Xerox Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the earnings slide and cover the rest of the financials as well as our guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. Overall, quarter 2 was strong. Operating profit and earnings both grew",1771,"Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the earnings slide and cover the rest of the financials as well as our guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. Overall, quarter 2 was strong. Operating profit and earnings both grew with EPS above our guidance range. Doc Tech trends improve and we're building momentum in our cost initiatives. We have more work to do to capture greater productivity and turn around the revenue trajectory as we prepare to separate our 2 businesses. But quarter 2 was a very positive proof point and keeps us on track for the year. 
Total revenue of $4.4 billion was down 4% at both actual and constant currency, benefiting from a market improvement in Document Technology revenue, which was down 6% in constant currency while Services revenue declined 1%. I'll speak more about both segments in a moment. Adjusted gross margin of 31.4% was up 20 basis points year-over-year, driven by improvements in both segments, partially offset by a greater mix of services, which structurally has a lower gross margin. Adjusted RD&E was lower by $19 million year-over-year and adjusted SAG was down $53 million or 6%. These expense reductions, combined with the gross margin improvement, resulted in operating margin of 9.3%, up 80 basis points year-over-year and a 5% operating profit growth. 
Adjusted other net expense was better by $15 million year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense while equity income of $22 million in the quarter was down $7 million year-over-year. Our second quarter adjusted tax rate of 17.8% was below our guidance range of 26% to 28%, benefiting our earnings by $0.025 due to higher foreign tax credits and the successful resolution of several audits. Bottom line, adjusted earnings of $0.30 was well above our guidance range of $0.24 to $0.26 and was $0.07 higher year-over-year, driven by the lower tax rate, fewer shares and higher operating profit. 
Turning to Services. Segment profit was up $55 million or 30% year-over-year as significant margin improvement more than offset revenue pressure. Services revenue was down 2% at actual currency and 1% at constant currency. Document Outsourcing grew 2% year-over-year and reflects continued good growth in Xerox Partner Print Services. BPO declined 3%, driven by known headwinds, including the impact from last year's Health Enterprise strategy change as well as lower volumes and lost business as we continue to focus on turning around some underperforming areas. 
Our drive to improve profitability also factored into a lower than target renewal rate of 82%, reflecting our decision not to renew several underperforming contracts. Total findings in the quarter were down 7% year-over-year, but up 2% for the trailing 12 months. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower new business signings, which reflects a tough compare due to last year's New York MMIS signing. We've strengthened our signings criteria, setting the bar higher on price, margin and deal term, particularly in customer care. 
Margin and related improvement actions have been an area of intense focus and we were really pleased with the 9.6% segment margin. That's a considerable improvement of 190 basis points sequentially and 240 basis points year-over-year. Benefits from restructuring and cost actions flowed through and we saw a good contribution to the margin increase across both business areas, including Document Outsourcing where margins are similar to document pathology. These areas of improvement more than offset continued revenue and margin pressure from customer care where we are taking action to turn around the set of capability. 
So key takeaways on Services. Document Outsourcing performance continues to be solid on both the top and bottom line. The set of strategic decisions we made in BPO last year, combined with our strategic transformation initiative, are beginning to be reflected in our results, yielding improved profitability. This has impacted revenue growth. We'll continue to focus on improving our operational foundation and cost structure and then begin to put in place growth initiative for the BPO business. 
I'll now turn to Document Technology. Document Technology had a very strong quarter with both revenue trend and margin improvement. Revenue was down 7% at actual currency and 6% at constant currency, with equipment and annuity each down 6%. The equipment revenue trend improved, driven by mid-range, reflecting new product launches as well as better sales to small- and medium-sized businesses. Supplies revenue was down 6% year-over-year, slightly better than quarter 1 results. 
When we include Document Outsourcing with Document Technology, revenue declined 3%, a significant improvement from quarter 1. This largely reflects the current revenue profile of the new Document Technology company post separation. Turning to Technology within entry, A4 color MSB installs were down 9%, driven by declines in developing markets. Mid-range color MFD grew 6%, driven by the UI series products launched in March. High-end color was up 14%, driven by growth in entry production color products. 
Following a very successful showing at Drupa, we expect a greater weighting towards higher end production presence in the second half. This doesn't necessarily translate to better in-store growth as it will drive fewer units, but at higher-value, which should result in good revenue and annuity growth over time. Document Technology margin of 12.6% was up 10 basis points year-over-year and 240 basis points sequentially. This is in line with our historical and full-year margin expectation. We knew that quarter 1 was an anomaly, resulting from the lack of restructuring in the second half of last year, exacerbated by the transaction currency headwinds. 
Quarter 2 margin reflected the initial benefits of the restructuring actions we ramped over the last 2 quarters and more modest transaction currency impact as well as equipment price declines at the lower end of our historical 5% to 10% range. So overall a very good quarter for Document Technology. We're maintaining our strategic cost transformation focus and we expect continued good profitability in both Document Technology and in Services as we capture additional savings moving through the year. 
Moving next to cash flow. We generated $177 million of operating cash in the quarter, reflecting net income and the strong underlying cash generation profile of our business model. Year-over-year, cash flow was lower, driven by working capital usage due to a reduction in payables related to lower purchases and payment timing. A $62 million Health Enterprise settlement payment, resulting from last year's strategy change, initial separation-related payments as well as higher restructuring payments and approximately $50 million due to last year's ITO divestiture. 
It's important to note that quarter 2 and first half cash generation are consistent with typical seasonality and position us to deliver our full year expectations. Investing cash flows were a use of $67 million and included $73 million spent on CapEx. Cash flow from financing was an $87 million use and includes $84 million for preferred and common stock dividends. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion and continues to provide us flexibility as we move through 2016. 
Turning to our capital structure and capital allocation. We ended quarter 2 with $7.4 billion of debt, roughly in line with our year-end debt level. Applying 7:1 leverage to our customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of quarter 2 was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion. We continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit rating.
While it's premature to discuss the capital structure of the 2 future companies, all the financing assets and financing debt will go to the new Xerox company while the core debt will be split with Conduent. We'll share with you more about the capital structure and capital allocation strategies of Conduent and the new Xerox as we approach the separation. You should expect a continued focus on driving long-term shareholder returns with the strong alignment to each companies financial profile and market opportunities. 
And to touch on capital allocation. We have a strong shareholder returns track record. And in April, we increased our common dividend by 11%. As we prepare our separation later this year and as we've said previously, we're not planning to repurchase shares as we focus on launching the 2 companies with the most optimal capital structures. Before I move to guidance on the next slide, I want to mention that while we're not planning to preview the Q2 Conduent results today, we will be filing them in a few weeks as part of the Form 10 amendment. I'd note that Conduent carveouts financials will also reflect margin improvement although not to the same degree as the Services segment. 
Conduent results include the student loan business, which resides in our Other segment. That business is in run-off [ph] and declined profit year-over-year as anticipated. I'll now share with you our quarter 3 and our full year expectation. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings in the range of $0.26 to $0.28 and GAAP earnings of $0.14 to $0.16. We're reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 and our revenue guidance of a 2% to 4% constant currency decline. We're maintaining our segment revenue growth and margin guidance ranges for both Services and Document Technology, and anticipate for Services that we'll be at the high-end of the segment margin range and at the low end of the revenue range. 
For the full year, we continue to expect GAAP earnings of $0.45 to $0.55. We continue to anticipate full-year restructuring of $300 million, including approximately $40 million in quarter 3. Last quarter, we told you that we expected pretax separation cost would be in the range of $200 million to $250 million. We're deploying the same cost discipline in this area as we do across of rest of the business and have therefore, refined our range down by $25 million to $50 million. We now expect to spend $175 million to $200 million in pretax separation costs. 
We've also now scoped the tax related friction costs associated with reorganizing our domestic and international legal entities to affect the separation and estimate them to be between $40 million and $50 million. Turning to cash flow. We're maintaining our full year expectations of $950 million to $1.2 billion for operating cash flow and $600 million to $850 [ph] million for free cash flow. This anticipates both our second half net income acceleration and the strong quarter 4 working capital performance we've historically delivered. And finally, our capital allocation expectations remain the same. So in summary, quarter 2 solidly puts us on track to deliver our full year guidance and we're confident on our trajectory entering the second half."

So Matt, you know we have stopped giving quarterly revenue and margin guidance. We stick to full year guidance at the segment level. Although we do continue to provide earnings guidance in the quarter. I think what you saw in quarter 2, and I'll start with Doc Tech, is an important improvement in botheration in the rate of revenue declined both for the Technology segment down 6% versus down 9% in the last -- in the earlier 2 quarters. And importantly as well, down 3%, including Document Outsourcing, which is an indication of what the new Xerox will look like going forward. We continue to expect that revenue trends for the second half of the year will enable us to be in line with the full year expectation for the tech segment the down 5 to 7. On the margin front, you saw important improvement in the margin in quarter 2 when you saw margin that's in line with our full year expectation of 12% to 14%. And that's what has underscored our confidence in reiterating the full year margin. On the Services side. We've said that we expect margin will be towards the high-end of the 8% to 9.5% range. But revenue will be somewhat more muted. In the first half, revenues are flat at constant currency. Our full year range for the Services segment is flat-to-up modestly. And we said we'd be at the low end of the range. So we believe that quarter 2 was an important proof point. And you will see continued progress in quarter 3 and for sure in quarter 4, which is typically our seasonally strongest quarter."

That margin pressure in quarter 2 was much, much more modest. It was about 20 basis points. And I think you recognize that in terms of the yen, we have both the currency risk sharing arrangement with Fuji Xerox.

So a big piece of our margin turnaround for the commercial customer because it really is the customer site that buys a portfolio of offering and is really around a driving customer care for the exceptional leaders. We got a big team over this. And we think it's not going to be an immediate that next month, we go from 0% to 10% margins. But we think we got a set of actions in place that we will really lift the margin profile of that component of commercial. We are honestly kind of last year. We got a great client set. We were ranked in the top quartile. So our problem is more our internal. So we have got the cost management crisp enough, but it's a business that we're able to win in and we've got the set of actions. And we do believe that we can then elevate back to reasonable margins in the commercial component of our BPO. Not as high as we get in public or healthcare where we got a lot of separate industry based IP and solutions. But reasonable within the portfolio of BPO co-work Conduent going forward."

We don't disclose utilization mostly because it's different in every business. The targets between customer care and transaction processing and HR outsourcing. But a big component of our strategic costs transformation play is around robotic process automation and trying to leverage Technology to then increase that utilization rate. So we're managing -- we're really, really trying to be very, very disciplined on headcount management. And that will clearly be a component of the ongoing margin lift that we need to drive both in Xerox Services and then downstream in Conduent. Relative to what proportion of the contracts are below water. We've really gotten a lot more sophisticated in looking at fully allocated P&Ls, which has helped us kind of identify something that may be would not have look back from a contribution margin standpoint. We really need to do even better on. I wouldn't want to give you a hard figure, but it's not a high proportion of the contract. It's not as though out of our -- out the follow-up our contracts that there is a big number of them that are below what there.

Welcome to Xerox's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On our first quarter earnings call, I made our 3 priorities for the year: achieving our 2016 financial plan, implementing our strategic transformation and executing the separation of the company. I also committed to you that we were pulling all the available levers and taking decisive action to achieve these objectives. 
Today, I am pleased to report strong second quarter results and significant progress on all of our priorities. We delivered substantial EPS growth, adjusted EPS above our guidance and margin expansion in both our business segments, putting us on track to achieve our full year guidance. We also reached the major milestones in our separation process, and for our strategic transformation program and remain on-track to meet our targets for both initiatives. I am more confident than ever in our ability to create 2 companies better positioned to compete in their respective markets and capture opportunities to enhance shareholder value. 
Today, I will begin the call with an update on our separation and strategic transformation before moving to the quarter's financial and operating performance. As you know, in January, we outlined a two-part plan to create shareholder value and best position our businesses for the future, which we call our new path forward. The plan includes separating into 2 Fortune 500 scale, independent publicly-traded companies by year-end and implementing a 3-year strategic transformation program to deliver $2.4 billion in total cost savings from ongoing and incremental productivity and cost-reduction initiatives across our businesses. 
During the second quarter, we took important steps toward both the separation and our strategic transformation program targets. As a recap and starting with the separation, we named the 2 companies that will be created through the separation. The Business Process Outsourcing company will be named Conduent Inc., and the Document Technology company will retain the Xerox name. We also identified the CEOs that will lead the 2 new businesses after the separation. Ashok Vemuri, who officially joined us at the beginning of this month, will become the CEO of Conduent. Ashok comes with a successful background in the industry and experience in leading corporate transformations. Jeff Jacobson, who most of you know from his invaluable work as the President of our Technology business will become the CEO of Xerox. Both are exceptional leaders with highly relevant expertise that will be critical to executing the go-forward strategy for each company. You will hear more from them as we approach the separation, and I look forward to working closely with both of them as we continue to build the foundations of the 2 companies and prepare them for standalone. 
With future leaders of the companies in place, we have intensified our CFO searches for each company and Ashok and Jeff are in the process of identifying the rest of their leadership teams. At the end of June, we filed our initial Form 10 registration statement for Conduent with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This is a major step in the transaction that will separate the companies. The filing kicked off review process with the SEC and we expect to update the filing in the coming months with additional information. 
We have now scoped all costs associated with the separation and are providing additional detail. We are lowering our pretax onetime separation cost estimate to $175 million to $200 million. This is a credit to good cost management by our team, executing the separation process, and we have quantified onetime tax-related costs associated with the separation and expect them to be in the $40 million to $50 million range. Finally, we estimate this synergy cost to total $40 million to $50 million. We expect those costs to be more than offset by savings from our strategic transformation program, which I will discuss now. 
We remain on track to deliver $700 million in annualized savings in 2016 and $2.4 billion in total cost savings over 3 years from ongoing and incremental productivity and cost-reduction initiatives across our businesses. We are already seeing benefits as some of the margin expansion we realized in the second quarter was a direct result of these activities. All in all, we made a great deal of progress on the company's new path forward during the quarter and I want to thank the strategic transformation and separation process leaders, along with the Xerox management team, for their efforts. 
Now I'll provide a high-level overview of our second quarter results before I pass it over to Leslie for additional details. In the second quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.30, representing a 30% year-over-year increase and coming in well above our guidance range of $0.24 to $0.26. GAAP EPS from continuing operations were $0.15, up $0.06 compared to prior year quarter. Year-over-year EPS growth reflects fewer shares and lower tax rate and higher operating profit. 
Total revenue of $4.4 billion was down 4% with minimum currency impact, reflecting a modest revenue decline in Services and improvement in Technology business revenue trend. Operating margin expanded 80 basis points year-over-year to 9.3%, led by a 240-basis-point improvement in our Services business. Margin gains reflect sequential cost and productivity improvement across our businesses, including benefits from our strategic transformation program. We generated cash flow from operations of $177 million during the second quarter and ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $1.2 billion. 
So during the quarter, we also had exciting wins in our businesses and brought several innovations to market. This was an important quarter for our Technology business with drupa, the biggest printing industry trade show, which occurs every 4 years taking place this June. We recorded strong sales in the production equipment showcased at the event. In addition, we shared details of our partnership with Koenig & Bauer Sheetfed Solutions Group, which we believe will be a game changer for digital carton printing, a growing area of the printing market. 
On the Document Outsourcing side, the Xerox Managed Print Services business was named the Services Quality Supplier of the Year by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles U.S. based on the success of the global MPS program we implemented for the automaker over the past year. We also launched 15 new automated workflow solutions for the manufacturing retail and higher education industries. 
In our Services business. Everest Group ranked us as the top Business Process Services provider in its BPS Top 50 report just this week. The group also named our contact center outsourcing business an industry leader for the fourth year in a row. Analyst firm HfS Research also recognized Xerox, placing us in the high performance category for contact center operations and Finance & Accounting-as-a-Service. And the just this week, we were named to the HfS winner circle, the Human Resource Operations-as-a-Service. 
In transportation. Our work for SEPTA, the Philadelphia area mass transit system, went live last month. The program, which runs on a new platform developed by Xerox, is a major undertaking, bringing transit riders a new modern payment system. The first phase offers 10,000 riders the opportunity to buy cards for weekly or monthly rides on the subway, trolley and buses. Our healthcare services business introduced a new offering, virtual health solutions, allowing providers to integrate a comprehensive telehealth strategy within their mainstream care delivery system. And Xerox Litigation Services introduced a new analytics-as-a-service platform. The analytics hub provided corporate counsel and law firms real-time visibility into the Big Data that they manage every day. 
As you can tell, our industry experts are hard at work, building next-generation solutions and capabilities and successfully implementing businesses -- business that we have won. 
I will now turn it over to Leslie, who will provide more detail on our financial results and 2016 guidance."
103599,369245326,1017647,"Xerox Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the earnings slide and cover the rest of the financials as well as our guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. Overall, quarter 2 was strong. Operating profit and earnings both grew",1763,"Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the earnings slide and cover the rest of the financials as well as our guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. Overall, quarter 2 was strong. Operating profit and earnings both grew with EPS above our guidance range. Doc Tech trends improve and we're building momentum in our cost initiatives. We have more work to do to capture greater productivity and turn around the revenue trajectory as we prepare to separate our 2 businesses, but quarter 2 was a very positive proof point and keeps us on track for the year. 
Total revenue of $4.4 billion was down 4% at both actual and constant currency, benefiting from a market improvement in Document Technology revenue, which was down 6% in constant currency, while Services revenue declined 1%. I'll speak more about both segments in a moment. Adjusted gross margin of 31.4% was up 20 basis points year-over-year, driven by improvements in both segments, partially offset by a greater mix of services, which structurally has a lower gross margin. Adjusted RD&E was lower by $19 million year-over-year and adjusted SAG was down $53 million or 6%. These expense reductions, combined with the gross margin improvement, resulted in operating margin of 9.3%, up 80 basis points year-over-year and a 5% operating profit growth. 
Adjusted other net expense was better by $15 million year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense, while equity income of $22 million in the quarter was down $7 million year-over-year. Our second quarter adjusted tax rate of 17.8% was below guidance range of 26% to 28%, benefiting our earnings by $0.025 due to higher foreign tax credits and the successful resolution of several audits. Bottom line, adjusted earnings of $0.30 was well above our guidance range of $0.24 to $0.26, and was $0.07 higher year-over-year, driven by the lower tax rate, fewer shares and higher operating profit. 
Turning to Services. Segment profit was up $55 million or 30% year-over-year as significant margin improvement more than offset revenue pressure. Services revenue was down 2% at actual currency and 1% at constant currency. Document Outsourcing grew 2% year-over-year and reflects continued good growth in Xerox Partner Print Services. BPO declined 3%, driven by known headwinds, including the impact from last year's Health Enterprise strategy change as well as lower volumes and lost business as we continue to focus on turning around some underperforming areas. 
Our drive to improve profitability also factored into a lower-than-target renewal rate of 82%, reflecting our decision not to renew several underperforming contracts. Total signings in the quarter were down 7% year-over-year, but up 2% for the trailing 12 months. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower new business signings, which reflects a tough compare due to last year's New York MMIS signing. We've strengthened our signings criteria, setting the bar higher on price, margin and deal term, particularly in customer care. 
Margin and related improvement actions have been an area of intense focus and we were really pleased with the 9.6% segment margin. That's a considerable improvement of 190 basis points sequentially and 240 basis points year-over-year. Benefits from restructuring and cost actions flowed through and we saw a good contribution to the margin increase across most business areas, including Document Outsourcing, where margins are similar to document pathology. These areas of improvement more than offset continued revenue and margin pressure from customer care, where we are taking action to turn around this set of capabilities. 
So key takeaways on Services. Document Outsourcing performance continues to be solid on both the top and bottom line. The set of strategic decisions we made in BPO last year, combined with our strategic transformation initiative, are beginning to be reflected in our results, yielding improved profitability. This has impacted revenue growth. We'll continue to focus on improving our operational foundation and cost structure and then begin to put in place growth initiatives for the BPO business. 
I'll now turn to Document Technology. Document Technology had a very strong quarter with both revenue trend and margin improvement. Revenue was down 7% at actual currency and 6% at constant currency, with equipment and annuity each down 6%. The equipment revenue trend improved, driven by mid-range, reflecting new product launches as well as better sales to small- and medium-sized businesses. Supplies revenue was down 6% year-over-year, slightly better than quarter 1 results. 
When we include Document Outsourcing with Document Technology, revenue declined 3%, a significant improvement from quarter 1. This largely reflects the current revenue profile of the new Document Technology company post-separation. Turning to Technology within entry, A4 Color MFP installs were down 9%, driven by declines in developing markets. Mid-range Color MFPs grew 6%, driven by the new i-Series products launched in March. High-end color was up 14%, driven by growth in entry production color products. 
Following a very successful showing at drupa, we expect a greater weighting towards higher-end production presence in the second half. This doesn't necessarily translate to better install growth as it will drive fewer units, but at higher-value, which should result in good revenue and annuity growth over time. Document Technology margin of 12.6% was up 10 basis points year-over-year and 240 basis points sequentially. This is in line with our historical and full year margin expectation. We knew that quarter 1 was an anomaly, resulting from the lack of restructuring in the second half of last year, exacerbated by transaction currency headwinds. 
Quarter 2 margin reflected the initial benefits of the restructuring actions we ramped over the last 2 quarters and more modest transaction currency impact as well as equipment price declines at the lower end of our historical 5% to 10% range. So overall, a very good quarter for Document Technology. We're maintaining our strategic cost transformation focus and we expect continued good profitability in both Document Technology and in Services as we capture additional savings moving through the year. 
Moving next to cash flow. We generated $177 million of operating cash in the quarter, reflecting net income and the strong underlying cash generation profile of our business model. Year-over-year, cash flow was lower, driven by working capital usage due to a reduction in payables related to lower purchases and payment timing. A $62 million Health Enterprise settlement payment, resulting from last year's strategy change, initial separation-related payments as well as higher restructuring payments and approximately $50 million due to last year's ITO divestiture. 
It's important to note that quarter 2 and first half cash generation are consistent with typical seasonality and position us to deliver our full year expectations. Investing cash flows were a use of $67 million and included $73 million spent on CapEx. Cash flow from financing was an $87 million use and includes $84 million for preferred and common stock dividends. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion and continues to provide us flexibility as we move through 2016. 
Turning to our capital structure and capital allocation. We ended quarter 2 with $7.4 billion of debt, roughly in line with our year-end debt level. Applying 7:1 leverage to our customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of quarter 2 was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion. We continued to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit rating.
While it's premature to discuss the capital structure of the 2 future companies, all the financing assets and financing debt will go to the new Xerox company while the core debt will be split with Conduent. We'll share with you more about the capital structure and capital allocation strategies of Conduent and the new Xerox as we approach the separation. You should expect a continued focus on driving long-term shareholder returns with a strong alignment to each company's financial profile and market opportunities. 
And to touch on capital allocation. We have a strong shareholder returns track record. And in April, we increased our common dividend by 11%. As we prepare our separation later this year, and as we've said previously, we're not planning to repurchase shares as we focus on launching the 2 companies with the most optimal capital structures. Before I move to guidance on the next slide, I want to mention that while we're not planning to preview the Q2 Conduent results today, we will be filing them in a few weeks as part of the Form 10 amendment. I'd note that Conduent carveout financials will also reflect margin improvement although not to the same degree as the Services segment. Conduent results include the student loan business, which resides in our Other segment. That business is in runoff and decline profit year-over-year as anticipated. 
 
I'll now share with you our quarter 3 and our full year expectation. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings in the range of $0.26 to $0.28 and GAAP earnings of $0.14 to $0.16. We're reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 and our revenue guidance of a 2% to 4% constant currency decline. We're maintaining our segment revenue growth and margin guidance ranges for both Services and Document Technology, and anticipate for Services that we'll be at the high-end of the segment margin range and at the low end of the revenue range. 
For the full year, we continue to expect GAAP earnings of $0.45 to $0.55. We continue to anticipate full-year restructuring of $300 million, including approximately $40 million in quarter 3. Last quarter, we told you that we expected pretax separation cost would be in the range of $200 million to $250 million. We're deploying the same cost discipline in this area as we do across of rest of the business and have, therefore, refined our range down by $25 million to $50 million. We now expect to spend $175 million to $200 million in pretax separation costs. 
We've also now scoped the tax-related friction costs associated with reorganizing our domestic and international legal entities to affect the separation and estimate them to be between $40 million and $50 million. Turning to cash flow. We're maintaining our full year expectations of $950 million to $1.2 billion for operating cash flow and $600 million to $850 million for free cash flow. This anticipates both our second half net income acceleration and the strong quarter 4 working capital performance we've historically delivered. And finally, our capital allocation expectations remain the same. So in summary, quarter 2 solidly puts us on track to deliver our full year guidance and we're confident on our trajectory entering the second half."

And importantly as well, down 3%, including Document Outsourcing, which is an indication of what the new Xerox will look like going forward. We continue to expect that revenue trends for the second half of the year will enable us to be in line with the full year expectation for the Tech segment of down 5% to 7%. On the margin front, you saw important improvement in the margin in quarter 2 when you saw margin that's in line with our full year expectation of 12% to 14%. And that's what has underscored our confidence in reiterating the full year margin. On the Services side. We've said that we expect margin will be towards the high end of the 8% to 9.5% range, but revenue will be somewhat more muted. In the first half, revenues were flat at constant currency. Our full year range for the Services segment is flat to up modestly, and we said we'd be at the low end of the range. So we believe that quarter 2 was an important proof point. And you will see continued progress in quarter 3 and for sure in quarter 4, which is typically our seasonally strongest quarter."

I'll ask them at the same time. First on the lower renewal rate. It sounds like some of your prepared comments that it was a decision not to go after lower profitability of work. Should we expect that to continue? And is that kind of one of the main reasons why the service profitability is underperforming so much? It's just a legacy of bidding too low or going after too low of products or contracts? Or is it more that your costs are misaligned or things like that? And the second question is, you just mentioned an extension of some deals did not close in the June quarter. Did they close in early July? It kind of seems hard to believe that someone would wait to close it based upon the new name of the Xerox or from the new CEO is. And if that's the case, it seems like there's a risk that they maybe actually went away to a competitor. So did they close or did they go away?"

Welcome to Xerox's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On our first quarter earnings call, I made our 3 priorities for the year: achieving our 2016 financial plan, implementing our strategic transformation and executing the separation of the company. I also committed to you that we were pulling all the available levers and taking decisive action to achieve these objectives. 
Today, I am pleased to report strong second quarter results and significant progress on all of our priorities. We delivered substantial EPS growth, adjusted EPS above our guidance and margin expansion in both our business segments, putting us on track to achieve our full year guidance. We also reached the major milestones in our separation process  and for our strategic transformation program and remain on-track to meet our targets for both initiatives. I am more confident than ever in our ability to create 2 companies better positioned to compete in their respective markets and capture opportunities to enhance shareholder value. 
Today, I will begin the call with an update on our separation and strategic transformation before moving to the quarter's financial and operating performance. As you know, in January, we outlined a two-part plan to create shareholder value and best position our businesses for the future, which we call our new path forward. The plan includes separating into 2 Fortune 500 scale, independent, publicly-traded companies by year-end and implementing a 3-year strategic transformation program to deliver $2.4 billion in total cost savings from ongoing and incremental productivity and cost-reduction initiatives across our businesses. 
During the second quarter, we took important steps toward both the separation and our strategic transformation program targets. As a recap and starting with the separation, we named the 2 companies that will be created through the separation. The Business Process Outsourcing company will be named Conduent Inc., and the Document Technology company will retain the Xerox name. We also identified the CEOs that will lead the 2 new businesses after the separation. Ashok Vemuri, who officially joined us at the beginning of this month, will become the CEO of Conduent. Ashok comes with a successful background in the industry and experience in leading corporate transformations. Jeff Jacobson, who most of you know from his invaluable work as the President of our Technology business, will become the CEO of Xerox. Both are exceptional leaders with highly relevant expertise that will be critical to executing the go-forward strategy for each company. You will hear more from them as we approach the separation, and I look forward to working closely with both of them as we continue to build the foundations of the 2 companies and prepare them for standalone. 
With future leaders of the companies in place, we have intensified our CFO searches for each company and Ashok and Jeff are in the process of identifying the rest of their leadership teams. At the end of June, we filed our initial Form 10 registration statement for Conduent with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This is a major step in the transaction that will separate the companies. The filing kicked off a review process with the SEC and we expect to update the filing in the coming months with additional information. 
We have now scoped all costs associated with the separation and are providing additional detail. We are lowering our pretax onetime separation cost estimate to $175 million to $200 million. This is a credit to good cost management by our team, executing the separation process, and we have quantified onetime tax-related costs associated with the separation and expect them to be in the $40 million to $50 million range. Finally, we estimate this synergy cost to total $40 million to $50 million. We expect those costs to be more than offset by savings from our strategic transformation program, which I will discuss now. 
We remain on track to deliver $700 million in annualized savings in 2016 and $2.4 billion in total cost savings over 3 years from ongoing and incremental productivity and cost-reduction initiatives across our businesses. We are already seeing benefits as some of the margin expansion we realized in the second quarter was a direct result of these activities. All in all, we made a great deal of progress on the company's new path forward during the quarter, and I want to thank the strategic transformation and separation process leaders, along with the Xerox management team, for their efforts. 
Now I'll provide a high-level overview of our second quarter results before I pass it over to Leslie for additional details. In the second quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.30, representing a 30% year-over-year increase and coming in well above our guidance range of $0.24 to $0.26. GAAP EPS from continuing operations were $0.15, up $0.06 compared to prior year quarter. Year-over-year EPS growth reflects fewer shares and lower tax rate and higher operating profit. 
Total revenue of $4.4 billion was down 4% with minimal  currency impact, reflecting a modest revenue decline in Services and improvement in Technology business revenue trend. Operating margin expanded 80 basis points year-over-year to 9.3%, led by a 240-basis-point improvement in our Services business. Margin gains reflect sequential cost and productivity improvement across our businesses, including benefits from our strategic transformation program. We generated cash flow from operations of $177 million during the second quarter and ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $1.2 billion. 
So during the quarter, we also had exciting wins in our businesses and brought several innovations to market. This was an important quarter for our Technology business with drupa, the biggest printing industry trade show, which occurs every 4 years, taking place this June. We recorded strong sales in the production equipment showcased at the event. In addition, we shared details of our partnership with Koenig & Bauer Sheetfed Solutions Group, which we believe will be a game changer for digital carton printing, a growing area of the printing market. 
On the Document Outsourcing side, the Xerox Managed Print Services business was named the Services Quality Supplier of the Year by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles U.S. based on the success of the global MPS program we implemented for the automaker over the past year. We also launched 15 new automated workflow solutions for the manufacturing retail and higher education industries. 
In our Services business. Everest Group ranked us as the top Business Process Services provider in its BPS Top 50 report just this week. The group also named our contact center outsourcing business an industry leader for the fourth year in a row. Analyst firm HfS Research also recognized Xerox, placing us in the high performance category for contact center operations and Finance & Accounting-as-a-Service. And just this week, we were named to the HfS winner circle, the Human Resource Operations-as-a-Service. 
In transportation. Our work for SEPTA, the Philadelphia area mass transit system, went live last month. The program, which runs on a new platform developed by Xerox, is a major undertaking, bringing transit riders a new, modern payment system. The first phase offers 10,000 riders the opportunity to buy cards for weekly or monthly rides on the subway, trolley and buses. Our healthcare services business introduced a new offering, virtual health solutions, allowing providers to integrate a comprehensive telehealth strategy within their mainstream care delivery system. And Xerox Litigation Services introduced a new analytics-as-a-service platform. The analytics hub provided corporate counsel and law firms real-time visibility into the Big Data that they manage every day. 
As you can tell, our industry experts are hard at work, building next-generation solutions and capabilities and successfully implementing businesses -- business that we have won. 
I will now turn it over to Leslie, who will provide more detail on our financial results and 2016 guidance."

I'll start with the earnings slide and cover the rest of the financials as well as our guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. 
Overall, quarter 2 was strong. Operating profit and earnings both grew with EPS above our guidance range. Doc Tech trends improved and we're building momentum in our cost initiatives. We have more work to do to capture greater productivity and turn around the revenue trajectory as we prepare to separate our 2 businesses, but quarter 2 was a very positive proof point and keeps us on track for the year. 
Total revenue of $4.4 billion was down 4% at both actual and constant currency, benefiting from a market improvement in Document Technology revenue, which was down 6% in constant currency, while Services revenue declined 1%. I'll speak more about both segments in a moment. Adjusted gross margin of 31.4% was up 20 basis points year-over-year, driven by improvements in both segments, partially offset by a greater mix of services, which structurally has a lower gross margin. Adjusted RD&E was lower by $19 million year-over-year and adjusted SAG was down $53 million or 6%. These expense reductions, combined with the gross margin improvement, resulted in operating margin of 9.3%, up 80 basis points year-over-year and a 5% operating profit growth. 
Adjusted other net expense was better by $15 million year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense, while equity income of $22 million in the quarter was down $7 million year-over-year. Our second quarter adjusted tax rate of 17.8% was below guidance range of 26% to 28%, benefiting our earnings by $0.025 due to higher foreign tax credits and the successful resolution of several audits. Bottom line, adjusted earnings of $0.30 was well above our guidance range of $0.24 to $0.26, and was $0.07 higher year-over-year, driven by the lower tax rate, fewer shares and higher operating profit. 
Turning to Services. Segment profit was up $55 million or 30% year-over-year as significant margin improvement more than offset revenue pressure. Services revenue was down 2% at actual currency and 1% at constant currency. Document Outsourcing grew 2% year-over-year and reflects continued good growth in Xerox Partner Print Services. BPO declined 3%, driven by known headwinds, including the impact from last year's Health Enterprise strategy change as well as lower volumes and lost business as we continue to focus on turning around some underperforming areas. 
Our drive to improve profitability also factored into a lower-than-target renewal rate of 82%, reflecting our decision not to renew several underperforming contracts. Total signings in the quarter were down 7% year-over-year, but up 2% for the trailing 12 months. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower new business signings, which reflects a tough compare due to last year's New York MMIS signing. We've strengthened our signings criteria, setting the bar higher on price, margin and deal term, particularly in customer care. 
Margin and related improvement actions have been an area of intense focus and we were really pleased with the 9.6% segment margin. That's a considerable improvement of 190 basis points sequentially and 240 basis points year-over-year. Benefits from restructuring and cost action  flowed through and we saw a good contribution to the margin increase across most business areas, including Document Outsourcing, where margins are similar to document technology.  These areas of improvement more than offset continued revenue and margin pressure from customer care, where we are taking action to turn around this set of capabilities. 
So key takeaways on Services. Document Outsourcing performance continues to be solid on both the top and bottom line. The set of strategic decisions we made in BPO last year, combined with our strategic transformation initiatives, are beginning to be reflected in our results, yielding improved profitability. This has impacted revenue growth. We'll continue to focus on improving our operational foundation and cost structure and then begin to put in place growth initiatives for the BPO business. 
I'll now turn to Document Technology. Document Technology had a very strong quarter with both revenue trend and margin improvement. Revenue was down 7% at actual currency and 6% at constant currency, with equipment and annuity each down 6%. The equipment revenue trend improved, driven by mid-range, reflecting new product launches as well as better sales to small- and medium-sized businesses. Supplies revenue was down 6% year-over-year, slightly better than quarter 1 results. 
When we include Document Outsourcing with Document Technology, revenue declined 3%, a significant improvement from quarter 1. This largely reflects the current revenue profile of the new Document Technology company post-separation. Turning to Technology within entry, A4 Color MFP installs were down 9%, driven by declines in developing markets. Mid-range Color MFPs grew 6%, driven by the new i-Series products launched in March. High-end color was up 14%, driven by growth in entry production color products. 
Following a very successful showing at drupa, we expect a greater weighting towards higher-end production presses in the second half. This doesn't necessarily translate to better install growth as it will drive fewer units, but at higher-value, which should result in good revenue and annuity growth over time. Document Technology margin of 12.6% was up 10 basis points year-over-year and 240 basis points sequentially. This is in line with our historical and full year margin expectation. We knew that quarter 1 was an anomaly, resulting from the lack of restructuring in the second half of last year, exacerbated by transaction currency headwinds. 
Quarter 2 margin reflected the initial benefits of the restructuring actions we ramped over the last 2 quarters and more modest transaction currency impact as well as equipment price declines at the lower end of our historical 5% to 10% range. So overall, a very good quarter for Document Technology. We're maintaining our strategic cost transformation focus and we expect continued good profitability in both Document Technology and in Services as we capture additional savings moving through the year. 
Moving next to cash flow. We generated $177 million of operating cash in the quarter, reflecting net income and the strong underlying cash generation profile of our business model. Year-over-year, cash flow was lower, driven by working capital usage due to a reduction in payables related to lower purchases and payment timing. A $62 million Health Enterprise settlement payment, resulting from last year's strategy change, initial separation-related payments as well as higher restructuring payments and approximately $50 million due to last year's ITO divestiture. 
It's important to note that quarter 2 and first half cash generation are consistent with typical seasonality and position us to deliver our full year expectations. Investing cash flows were a use of $67 million and included $73 million spent on CapEx. Cash flow from financing was an $87 million use and includes $84 million for preferred and common stock dividends. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion and continues to provide us flexibility as we move through 2016. 
Turning to our capital structure and capital allocation. We ended quarter 2 with $7.4 billion of debt, roughly in line with our year-end debt level. Applying 7:1 leverage to our customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of quarter 2 was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion. We continued to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit rating.
While it's premature to discuss the capital structure of the 2 future companies, all the financing assets and financing debt will go to the new Xerox company, while the core debt will be split with Conduent. We'll share with you more about the capital structure and capital allocation strategies of Conduent and the new Xerox as we approach the separation. You should expect a continued focus on driving long-term shareholder returns with a strong alignment to each company's financial profile and market opportunities. 
And to touch on capital allocation. We have a strong shareholder returns track record. And in April, we increased our common dividend by 11%. As we prepare for our separation later this year, and as we've said previously, we're not planning to repurchase shares as we focus on launching the 2 companies with the most optimal capital structures. Before I move to guidance on the next slide, I want to mention that while we're not planning to preview the Q2 Conduent results today, we will be filing them in a few weeks as part of the Form 10 amendment. I'd note that Conduent carve-out financials will also reflect margin improvement, although not to the same degree as the Services segment. Conduent results include the student loan business, which resides in our Other segment. That business is in runoff and decline profit year-over-year as anticipated. 
 
I'll now share with you our quarter 3 and our full year expectation. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings in the range of $0.26 to $0.28 and GAAP earnings of $0.14 to $0.16. We're reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 and our revenue guidance of a 2% to 4% constant currency decline. We're maintaining our segment revenue growth and margin guidance ranges for both Services and Document Technology, and anticipate for Services that will be at the high-end of the segment margin range and at the low end of the revenue range. 
For the full year, we continue to expect GAAP earnings of $0.45 to $0.55. We continue to anticipate full-year restructuring of $300 million, including approximately $40 million in quarter 3. Last quarter, we told you that we expected pretax separation cost would be in the range of $200 million to $250 million. We're deploying the same cost discipline in this area as we do across the rest of the business and have, therefore, refined our range down by $25 million to $50 million. We now expect to spend $175 million to $200 million in pretax separation costs. 
We've also now scoped the tax-related friction costs associated with reorganizing our domestic and international legal entities to affect the separation and estimate them to be between $40 million and $50 million. 
Turning to cash flow. We're maintaining our full year expectations of $950 million to $1.2 billion for operating cash flow and $600 million to $850 million for free cash flow. This anticipates both our second half net income acceleration and the strong quarter 4 working capital performance we've historically delivered. And finally, our capital allocation expectations remain the same. 
So in summary, quarter 2 solidly puts us on track to deliver our full year guidance and we're confident on our trajectory entering the second half."

So Matt, we -- you know we have stopped giving quarterly revenue and margin guidance. We stick to full year guidance at the segment level, although we do continue to provide earnings guidance in the quarter. I think what you saw in quarter 2, and I'll start with Doc Tech, is an important improvement and moderation in the rate of revenue decline, both for the Technology segment down 6% versus the down 9% in the last -- in the earlier 2 quarters. And importantly as well, down 3%, including Document Outsourcing, which is an indication of what the new Xerox will look like going forward. We continue to expect that revenue trends for the second half of the year will enable us to be in line with the full year expectation for the Tech segment of down 5% to 7%. 
On the margin front, you saw important improvement in the margin in quarter 2 when you saw a margin that's in line with our full year expectation of 12% to 14%. And that's what has underscored our confidence in reiterating the full year margin. 
On the Services side, we've said that we expect margin will be toward the high end of the 8% to 9.5% range, but revenue will be somewhat more muted. In the first half, revenues were flat at constant currency. Our full year range for the Services segment is flat to up modestly, and we've said we'd be at the low end of the range. So we believe that quarter 2 was an important proof point. And you will see continued progress in quarter 3 and for sure in quarter 4, which is typically our seasonally strongest quarter."

That margin pressure in quarter 2 was much, much more modest. It was about 20 basis points. And I think you recognize that in terms of the yen, we have both the currency risk sharing arrangement with Fuji Xerox.

On commercial, as you know, the kind of the largest component from an offering standpoint of our commercial business is customer care. The other components, HR outsourcing, learning, litigation, F&A, are largely making good progress and are reasonable from a margin standpoint.

We've got a big team over this and we think it's not going to be an immediate that next month we go from 0% to 10% margins, but we think we've got a set of actions in place that will really lift the margin profile of that component of commercial.

You're right to notice that our headcount dynamics have turned favorable. That is related not only to utilization. Honestly, we probably got more of the headcount reduction out of non-production workers, more in the way of middle management, if you will, than just purely on the production worker component. We don't disclose utilization mostly because it's different in every business; the targets between customer care and transaction processing and HR outsourcing. But a big component of our strategic cost transformation play is around robotic process automation and trying to leverage technology to then increase that utilization rate. So we're managing -- we're really, really trying to be very, very disciplined on headcount management. And that will clearly be a component of the ongoing margin lift that we need to drive, both in Xerox Services and then downstream in Conduent. 
Relative to what proportion of the contracts are below water, we've really gotten a lot more sophisticated in looking at fully allocated P&Ls, which has helped us in kind of identifying something that maybe didn't look so bad from a contribution margin standpoint, we really need to do even better on. I wouldn't want to give you a hard figure, but it's not a high proportion of the contract. It's not as though out of our -- out of all of our contracts that there's a big number of them that are below water. And the ones that are we're on kind of very aggressive active recovery plans."

Welcome to Xerox's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. On our first quarter earnings call, I made our 3 priorities for the year: achieving our 2016 financial plan, implementing our strategic transformation and executing the separation of the company. I also committed to you that we were pulling all the available levers and taking decisive action to achieve these objectives. 
Today, I am pleased to report strong second quarter results and significant progress on all of our priorities. We delivered substantial EPS growth, adjusted EPS above our guidance and margin expansion in both our business segments, putting us on track to achieve our full year guidance. We also reached the major milestones in our separation process and for our strategic transformation program and remain on-track to meet our targets for both initiatives. I am more confident than ever in our ability to create 2 companies better positioned to compete in their respective markets and capture opportunities to enhance shareholder value. 
Today, I will begin the call with an update on our separation and strategic transformation before moving to the quarter's financial and operating performance. As you know, in January, we outlined a two-part plan to create shareholder value and best position our businesses for the future, which we call our new path forward. The plan includes separating into 2 Fortune 500 scale, independent, publicly-traded companies by year-end and implementing a 3-year strategic transformation program to deliver $2.4 billion in total cost savings from ongoing and incremental productivity and cost-reduction initiatives across our businesses. 
During the second quarter, we took important steps toward both the separation and our strategic transformation program targets. As a recap and starting with the separation, we named the 2 companies that will be created through the separation. The Business Process Outsourcing company will be named Conduent Inc., and the Document Technology company will retain the Xerox name. We also identified the CEOs that will lead the 2 new businesses after the separation. Ashok Vemuri, who officially joined us at the beginning of this month, will become the CEO of Conduent. Ashok comes with a successful background in the industry and experience in leading corporate transformations. Jeff Jacobson, who most of you know from his invaluable work as the President of our Technology business, will become the CEO of Xerox. Both are exceptional leaders with highly relevant expertise that will be critical to executing the go-forward strategy for each company. You will hear more from them as we approach the separation, and I look forward to working closely with both of them as we continue to build the foundations of the 2 companies and prepare them for standalone. 
With future leaders of the companies in place, we have intensified our CFO searches for each company and Ashok and Jeff are in the process of identifying the rest of their leadership teams. At the end of June, we filed our initial Form 10 registration statement for Conduent with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This is a major step in the transaction that will separate the companies. The filing kicked off a review process with the SEC and we expect to update the filing in the coming months with additional information. 
We have now scoped all costs associated with the separation and are providing additional detail. We are lowering our pretax onetime separation cost estimate to $175 million to $200 million. This is a credit to good cost management by our team, executing the separation process, and we have quantified onetime tax-related costs associated with the separation and expect them to be in the $40 million to $50 million range. Finally, we estimate this synergy cost to total $40 million to $50 million. We expect those costs to be more than offset by savings from our strategic transformation program, which I will discuss now. 
We remain on track to deliver $700 million in annualized savings in 2016 and $2.4 billion in total cost savings over 3 years from ongoing and incremental productivity and cost-reduction initiatives across our businesses. We are already seeing benefits as some of the margin expansion we realized in the second quarter was a direct result of these activities. All in all, we made a great deal of progress on the company's new path forward during the quarter, and I want to thank the strategic transformation and separation process leaders, along with the Xerox management team, for their efforts. 
Now I'll provide a high-level overview of our second quarter results before I pass it over to Leslie for additional details. In the second quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.30, representing a 30% year-over-year increase and coming in well above our guidance range of $0.24 to $0.26. GAAP EPS from continuing operations were $0.15, up $0.06 compared to prior year quarter. Year-over-year EPS growth reflects fewer shares and lower tax rate and higher operating profit. 
Total revenue of $4.4 billion was down 4% with minimal currency impact, reflecting a modest revenue decline in Services and improvement in Technology business revenue trend. Operating margin expanded 80 basis points year-over-year to 9.3%, led by a 240-basis-point improvement in our Services business. Margin gains reflect sequential cost and productivity improvement across our businesses, including benefits from our strategic transformation program. We generated cash flow from operations of $177 million during the second quarter and ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $1.2 billion. 
So during the quarter, we also had exciting wins in our businesses and brought several innovations to market. This was an important quarter for our Technology business with drupa, the biggest printing industry trade show, which occurs every 4 years, taking place this June. We recorded strong sales in the production equipment showcased at the event. In addition, we shared details of our partnership with Koenig & Bauer Sheetfed Solutions Group, which we believe will be a game changer for digital carton printing, a growing area of the printing market. 
On the Document Outsourcing side, the Xerox Managed Print Services business was named the Services Quality Supplier of the Year by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles U.S. based on the success of the global MPS program we implemented for the automaker over the past year. We also launched 15 new automated workflow solutions for the manufacturing retail and higher education industries. 
In our Services business. Everest Group ranked us as the top Business Process Services provider in its BPS Top 50 report just this week. The group also named our contact center outsourcing business an industry leader for the fourth year in a row. Analyst firm HfS Research also recognized Xerox, placing us in the high performance category for contact center operations and Finance & Accounting-as-a-Service. And just this week, we were named to the HfS winner circle, the Human Resource Operations-as-a-Service. 
In transportation. Our work for SEPTA, the Philadelphia area mass transit system, went live last month. The program, which runs on a new platform developed by Xerox, is a major undertaking, bringing transit riders a new, modern payment system. The first phase offers 10,000 riders the opportunity to buy cards for weekly or monthly rides on the subway, trolley and buses. Our healthcare services business introduced a new offering, virtual health solutions, allowing providers to integrate a comprehensive telehealth strategy within their mainstream care delivery system. And Xerox Litigation Services introduced a new analytics-as-a-service platform. The analytics hub provided corporate counsel and law firms real-time visibility into the Big Data that they manage every day. 
As you can tell, our industry experts are hard at work, building next-generation solutions and capabilities and successfully implementing businesses -- business that we have won. 
I will now turn it over to Leslie, who will provide more detail on our financial results and 2016 guidance."
103599,369245326,1018541,"Xerox Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the earnings slide and cover the rest of the financials as well as our guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. Overall, quarter 2 was strong. Operating profit and earnings both gr",1764,"Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the earnings slide and cover the rest of the financials as well as our guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. 
Overall, quarter 2 was strong. Operating profit and earnings both grew with EPS above our guidance range. Doc Tech trends improved and we're building momentum in our cost initiatives. We have more work to do to capture greater productivity and turn around the revenue trajectory as we prepare to separate our 2 businesses, but quarter 2 was a very positive proof point and keeps us on track for the year. 
Total revenue of $4.4 billion was down 4% at both actual and constant currency, benefiting from a market improvement in Document Technology revenue, which was down 6% in constant currency, while Services revenue declined 1%. I'll speak more about both segments in a moment. Adjusted gross margin of 31.4% was up 20 basis points year-over-year, driven by improvements in both segments, partially offset by a greater mix of services, which structurally has a lower gross margin. Adjusted RD&E was lower by $19 million year-over-year and adjusted SAG was down $53 million or 6%. These expense reductions, combined with the gross margin improvement, resulted in operating margin of 9.3%, up 80 basis points year-over-year and a 5% operating profit growth. 
Adjusted other net expense was better by $15 million year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense, while equity income of $22 million in the quarter was down $7 million year-over-year. Our second quarter adjusted tax rate of 17.8% was below guidance range of 26% to 28%, benefiting our earnings by $0.025 due to higher foreign tax credits and the successful resolution of several audits. Bottom line, adjusted earnings of $0.30 was well above our guidance range of $0.24 to $0.26, and was $0.07 higher year-over-year, driven by the lower tax rate, fewer shares and higher operating profit. 
Turning to Services. Segment profit was up $55 million or 30% year-over-year as significant margin improvement more than offset revenue pressure. Services revenue was down 2% at actual currency and 1% at constant currency. Document Outsourcing grew 2% year-over-year and reflects continued good growth in Xerox Partner Print Services. BPO declined 3%, driven by known headwinds, including the impact from last year's Health Enterprise strategy change as well as lower volumes and lost business as we continue to focus on turning around some underperforming areas. 
Our drive to improve profitability also factored into a lower-than-target renewal rate of 82%, reflecting our decision not to renew several underperforming contracts. Total signings in the quarter were down 7% year-over-year, but up 2% for the trailing 12 months. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower new business signings, which reflects a tough compare due to last year's New York MMIS signing. We've strengthened our signings criteria, setting the bar higher on price, margin and deal term, particularly in customer care. 
Margin and related improvement actions have been an area of intense focus and we were really pleased with the 9.6% segment margin. That's a considerable improvement of 190 basis points sequentially and 240 basis points year-over-year. Benefits from restructuring and cost action flowed through and we saw a good contribution to the margin increase across most business areas, including Document Outsourcing, where margins are similar to document technology. These areas of improvement more than offset continued revenue and margin pressure from customer care, where we are taking action to turn around this set of capabilities. 
So key takeaways on Services. Document Outsourcing performance continues to be solid on both the top and bottom line. The set of strategic decisions we made in BPO last year, combined with our strategic transformation initiatives, are beginning to be reflected in our results, yielding improved profitability. This has impacted revenue growth. We'll continue to focus on improving our operational foundation and cost structure and then begin to put in place growth initiatives for the BPO business. 
I'll now turn to Document Technology. Document Technology had a very strong quarter with both revenue trend and margin improvement. Revenue was down 7% at actual currency and 6% at constant currency, with equipment and annuity each down 6%. The equipment revenue trend improved, driven by mid-range, reflecting new product launches as well as better sales to small- and medium-sized businesses. Supplies revenue was down 6% year-over-year, slightly better than quarter 1 results. 
When we include Document Outsourcing with Document Technology, revenue declined 3%, a significant improvement from quarter 1. This largely reflects the current revenue profile of the new Document Technology company post-separation. Turning to Technology within entry, A4 Color MFP installs were down 9%, driven by declines in developing markets. Mid-range Color MFPs grew 6%, driven by the new i-Series products launched in March. High-end color was up 14%, driven by growth in entry production color products. 
Following a very successful showing at drupa, we expect a greater weighting towards higher-end production presses in the second half. This doesn't necessarily translate to better install growth as it will drive fewer units, but at higher-value, which should result in good revenue and annuity growth over time. Document Technology margin of 12.6% was up 10 basis points year-over-year and 240 basis points sequentially. This is in line with our historical and full year margin expectation. We knew that quarter 1 was an anomaly, resulting from the lack of restructuring in the second half of last year, exacerbated by transaction currency headwinds. 
Quarter 2 margin reflected the initial benefits of the restructuring actions we ramped over the last 2 quarters and more modest transaction currency impact as well as equipment price declines at the lower end of our historical 5% to 10% range. So overall, a very good quarter for Document Technology. We're maintaining our strategic cost transformation focus and we expect continued good profitability in both Document Technology and in Services as we capture additional savings moving through the year. 
Moving next to cash flow. We generated $177 million of operating cash in the quarter, reflecting net income and the strong underlying cash generation profile of our business model. Year-over-year, cash flow was lower, driven by working capital usage due to a reduction in payables related to lower purchases and payment timing. A $62 million Health Enterprise settlement payment, resulting from last year's strategy change, initial separation-related payments as well as higher restructuring payments and approximately $50 million due to last year's ITO divestiture. 
It's important to note that quarter 2 and first half cash generation are consistent with typical seasonality and position us to deliver our full year expectations. Investing cash flows were a use of $67 million and included $73 million spent on CapEx. Cash flow from financing was an $87 million use and includes $84 million for preferred and common stock dividends. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion and continues to provide us flexibility as we move through 2016. 
Turning to our capital structure and capital allocation. We ended quarter 2 with $7.4 billion of debt, roughly in line with our year-end debt level. Applying 7:1 leverage to our customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of quarter 2 was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion. We continued to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit rating.
While it's premature to discuss the capital structure of the 2 future companies, all the financing assets and financing debt will go to the new Xerox company, while the core debt will be split with Conduent. We'll share with you more about the capital structure and capital allocation strategies of Conduent and the new Xerox as we approach the separation. You should expect a continued focus on driving long-term shareholder returns with a strong alignment to each company's financial profile and market opportunities. 
And to touch on capital allocation. We have a strong shareholder returns track record. And in April, we increased our common dividend by 11%. As we prepare for our separation later this year, and as we've said previously, we're not planning to repurchase shares as we focus on launching the 2 companies with the most optimal capital structures. Before I move to guidance on the next slide, I want to mention that while we're not planning to preview the Q2 Conduent results today, we will be filing them in a few weeks as part of the Form 10 amendment. I'd note that Conduent carve-out financials will also reflect margin improvement, although not to the same degree as the Services segment. Conduent results include the student loan business, which resides in our Other segment. That business is in runoff and decline profit year-over-year as anticipated. 
 
I'll now share with you our quarter 3 and our full year expectation. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings in the range of $0.26 to $0.28 and GAAP earnings of $0.14 to $0.16. We're reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 and our revenue guidance of a 2% to 4% constant currency decline. We're maintaining our segment revenue growth and margin guidance ranges for both Services and Document Technology, and anticipate for Services that will be at the high-end of the segment margin range and at the low end of the revenue range. 
For the full year, we continue to expect GAAP earnings of $0.45 to $0.55. We continue to anticipate full-year restructuring of $300 million, including approximately $40 million in quarter 3. Last quarter, we told you that we expected pretax separation cost would be in the range of $200 million to $250 million. We're deploying the same cost discipline in this area as we do across the rest of the business and have, therefore, refined our range down by $25 million to $50 million. We now expect to spend $175 million to $200 million in pretax separation costs. 
We've also now scoped the tax-related friction costs associated with reorganizing our domestic and international legal entities to affect the separation and estimate them to be between $40 million and $50 million. 
Turning to cash flow. We're maintaining our full year expectations of $950 million to $1.2 billion for operating cash flow and $600 million to $850 million for free cash flow. This anticipates both our second half net income acceleration and the strong quarter 4 working capital performance we've historically delivered. And finally, our capital allocation expectations remain the same. 
So in summary, quarter 2 solidly puts us on track to deliver our full year guidance and we're confident on our trajectory entering the second half."

In summary, we are very pleased with our second quarter performance, which demonstrates our focus on execution and provides good momentum as we enter the second half. We exceeded our adjusted EPS guidance, made progress on margins and reaffirmed our full year targets, all while executing our separation and strategic transformation, which will together strengthen Xerox and the post-separation companies. 
Moving to the second half of the year, our priorities remain unchanged. We will deliver our 2016 guidance, successfully complete our separation by year end and meet our cost savings target for 2016 for our strategic transformation program.

So Matt, we -- you know we have stopped giving quarterly revenue and margin guidance. We stick to full year guidance at the segment level, although we do continue to provide earnings guidance in the quarter. I think what you saw in quarter 2, and I'll start with Doc Tech, is an important improvement and moderation in the rate of revenue decline, both for the Technology segment down 6% versus the down 9% in the last -- in the earlier 2 quarters. And importantly as well, down 3%, including Document Outsourcing, which is an indication of what the new Xerox will look like going forward. We continue to expect that revenue trends for the second half of the year will enable us to be in line with the full year expectation for the Tech segment of down 5% to 7%. 
On the margin front, you saw important improvement in the margin in quarter 2 when you saw a margin that's in line with our full year expectation of 12% to 14%. And that's what has underscored our confidence in reiterating the full year margin. 
On the Services side, we've said that we expect margin will be toward the high end of the 8% to 9.5% range, but revenue will be somewhat more muted. In the first half, revenues were flat at constant currency. Our full year range for the Services segment is flat to up modestly, and we've said we'd be at the low end of the range. So we believe that quarter 2 was an important proof point. And you will see continued progress in quarter 3 and for sure in quarter 4, which is typically our seasonally strongest quarter."

That margin pressure in quarter 2 was much, much more modest. It was about 20 basis points. And I think you recognize that in terms of the yen, we have both the currency risk sharing arrangement with Fuji Xerox. So it means that we see more modest impact as we go through the year, both when the yen strengthens as well as when it weakens.

On commercial, as you know, the kind of the largest component from an offering standpoint of our commercial business is customer care. The other components, HR outsourcing, learning, litigation, F&A, are largely making good progress and are reasonable from a margin standpoint. So a big piece of our margin turnaround for the commercial customer set, because it really is a customer set that buys a portfolio of offerings, is really around the recovery plan that we're driving in customer care. We brought in from the outside a couple of exceptional leaders. We've got a big team over this and we think it's not going to be an immediate that next month we go from 0% to 10% margins, but we think we've got a set of actions in place that will really lift the margin profile of that component of commercial. We are honestly kind of blessed here. We got a great client set. We are ranked in the top quartile. So our problem is more our internals. Have we got the cost management crisp enough, but it's -- that's a business that we're able to win in and we've got a set of actions.

You're right to notice that our headcount dynamics have turned favorable. That is related not only to utilization. Honestly, we probably got more of the headcount reduction out of non-production workers, more in the way of middle management, if you will, than just purely on the production worker component. We don't disclose utilization mostly because it's different in every business; the targets between customer care and transaction processing and HR outsourcing. But a big component of our strategic cost transformation play is around robotic process automation and trying to leverage technology to then increase that utilization rate. So we're managing -- we're really, really trying to be very, very disciplined on headcount management. And that will clearly be a component of the ongoing margin lift that we need to drive, both in Xerox Services and then downstream in Conduent. 
Relative to what proportion of the contracts are below water, we've really gotten a lot more sophisticated in looking at fully allocated P&Ls, which has helped us in kind of identifying something that maybe didn't look so bad from a contribution margin standpoint, we really need to do even better on. I wouldn't want to give you a hard figure, but it's not a high proportion of the contract.

Welcome to Xerox's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At the beginning of the year, we committed to an ambitious agenda that included delivering one of our [ph] financial goals for 2015 while creating a new path forward that will make our businesses more agile, focused and competitive. I'm pleased to report that we are on track to meet all of these commitments and that we achieved solid financial results this quarter.
Our third quarter EPS was within our guidance range. Cash flow generation was strong and we realized solid margins in both segments despite a challenging global market environment. At the same time, our strategic transformation and separation activities have accelerated significantly. I want to emphasize that these actions are not just about delivering for the quarter or the year. Our strategic transformation program and separation are designed to fundamentally strengthen our businesses and align them closely with the demands of our clients and opportunities in the market. We're embedding productivity and cost efficiency into all areas of our business, which will benefit us for years to come.
We're driving operational excellence and innovation to meet our clients' evolving needs. And we're establishing the new company with talent, business strategies and operating models that will enable them to become more profitable and drive growth over the long term. You will hear much more about these initiatives and the strategies, structures and financial plans of the 2 post separation companies at their investor event in December. But I'm pleased to have the leaders of our new companies, Jeff Jacobson and Ashok Vemuri, here with me today to answer questions about results in their respective businesses during the Q&A.
Before we turn to financial results, let me share some highlights of our progress towards the separation. So with 2 months to go before we complete the separation, we've passed a number of major milestones in the process. The rating agencies released updates on Xerox's credit rating, which will continue to be investment grade, Conduent and corporate is expected to be a high noninvestment-grade-rated company following the separation. These ratings are in line with our expectations.
Upon completion of the spin, Conduent will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange where Xerox will continue to trade. Additionally, we were excited to introduce Conduent's new logo and brand identity. Ashok selected Brian Walsh as the CFO of Conduent. Brian has 20 years of experience in Xerox's finance organization, spanning both operating and corporate roles, and he is currently the CFO of Xerox Services. He is a great fit for the role. And last week, we announced 7 of the 9 directors that will serve on Conduent's board as well as Conduent's named executive officers. With that, the majority of Conduent's leadership team and Board of Directors is in place. We're in the process of filling the remaining 2 board seats, and we'll make those announcements as they become available. 
All of these information about Conduent, along with updated information on its expected capitalization, pro forma financials, compensation plans and governance [ph] was included in several amendments to Conduent's Form-10 registration statements.
For Xerox, Jeff is implementing a new more streamlined operating model and has identified the operation's leaders for the stand-alone company, building on our strong, well-established infrastructure and executive team. Jeff continues to focus on filling the remaining executive roles and strengthening the bench, including identifying the right, high-quality individual for the CFO role.
In the interim, Leslie Varon continues to provide strong leadership to our finance organization and will remain in her current role until we have a new CFO in place.
I should point out that beyond senior executive appointments, both Jeff and Ashok have put in place the necessary leadership teams for the major corporate functions. We are now just days away from what we call our soft separation phase. This involves separating our corporate function, business infrastructure and IT systems into discrete capabilities for each company. It's a test run of operating independently for the new companies that will help us ensure a smooth day 1 launch.
In short, we're moving rapidly toward our separation and remain on schedule to complete it by year-end. The benefits of our 3-year strategic transformation program also continued to ramp across both businesses and can clearly be seen in our third quarter performance. We remain on track to deliver $700 million in annualized savings from productivity and cost initiatives this financial year.
With that, I will move to our third quarter results.
As I said, this was a good quarter. We delivered adjusted earnings of $0.27 per share, which was within our guidance range and in line with the same period last year. Total revenue of $4.2 billion showed a 3% decline year-over-year or 4% on an adjusted constant currency basis, which excludes the 2015 charge related to our Health Enterprise strategy change. Operating margin was solid at 9.2%. We saw strong year-over-year margin expansion in our Services segment driven by gains across our BPO businesses, while Document Technology margins remained strong.
Cash flow from operations was $370 million, reflecting a $99 million increase from prior year, and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.4 billion as a result. Overall, our underlying results demonstrated ongoing progress in our productivity and cost savings initiatives and our ability to generate strong cash flow. In addition, we continue to innovate, to deepen our client relationships and extend our capabilities.
Let me highlight a few of our achievements during the quarter.
Starting with our Services segment, which had a number of business wins and high-profile recognitions across the portfolio. We were honored to receive Outstanding Corporate Innovator Award from the Product Development and Management Association for automation, analytics and personalization capabilities. Another notable recognition was by HfS, which named Xerox health care to its winner circle, the highest ranking in its report on business services for health care payers and providers.
In the public sector, the state of Tennessee selected Xerox to provide EMV-enhanced benefit cards to over 120,000 citizens receiving child support, unemployment compensation and state pension payments. Our Document Outsourcing business secured a 10-year contract worth $110 million with the USDA for Managed Print Services. We will be installing and supporting up to 16,000 Xerox ConnectKey-enabled printers and multifunction devices at more than 3,000 USDA locations around the world. Document Outsourcing was also recognized for its market-leading offering by prominent industry analysts groups, including leadership positions in Quocirca's MPS market landscape report and IDC's MarketScape's document workflow services assessment.
Now turning to our Document Technology business. In September, we showcased our portfolio of the latest printing technologies, workflow solutions and business development resources at Graph Expo 2016. This is North America's largest graphic arts trade show. We also brought a number of innovative products for small and midsized businesses to market as we continue to expand our offerings in the space.
At the corporate level, I am proud to share that Xerox released its 2016 global citizenship report, highlighting our approach to social responsibility. Our citizenship efforts continue to be widely recognized. And during the quarter, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America and Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens.
I'll now turn it over to Leslie who will provide more detail on our third quarter results and 2016 guidance."

I'll start with the earnings slide and cover the rest of the financials as well as our guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up.Our third quarter results reflect operational discipline and good pro",1860,"Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the earnings slide and cover the rest of the financials as well as our guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up.
Our third quarter results reflect operational discipline and good progress in key areas that will set the foundation for the 2 companies post-separation. These include cost and productivity progress from our strategic transformation, resulting in broad-based margin improvement in BPO and solid margins in Document Technology; overall services signings growth as we renewed 86% in the quarter with high renewal opportunities, reflecting the continued confidence our customers have in us; strong operating cash generation, reflective of the durability of our annuity-based business model. So while revenues in both businesses were a bit soft, we delivered overall good results in a somewhat volatile macro environment.
Total revenue of $4.2 billion was down 3% at actual currency and down 4% on an adjusted constant currency basis, including 1 point of negative currency. I'll be discussing our results on an adjusted basis when making comparisons against the prior year as the third quarter 2015 included the $389 million pretax charge, including a revenue reduction of $116 million related to our Health Enterprise strategy change.
Adjusted gross margin of 31.3% was up 10 basis points year-over-year, driven by improvements in both segments, partially offset by a greater mix of Services, which structurally has a lower gross margin. There was a modest negative transaction currency impacting quarter 3, reflecting yen strength against the euro, pound and U.S. dollar, partially mitigated by our hedging and currency risk sharing with Fuji Xerox. At current rates, we are expecting some additional pressure in quarter 4.
Adjusted RD&E was down $10 million year-over-year and adjusted SAG was down $28 million, driven by productivity and cost initiatives, which were partially offset by higher expenses related to prior year compensation and benefits reduction. Overall flow-through from our strategic transformation action resulted in good margins in both segments and a solid 9.2% total company operating margin. Adjusted other net expense was down $17 million year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense. Equity income of $39 million in the quarter was down slightly year-over-year.
Our third quarter adjusted tax rate of 25.3% was 1.8 points below last year and just under our guidance range of 26% to 28%, reflecting the geographic mix of our profits. Bottom line, adjusted earnings of $0.27 was in the middle of our guidance range and flat year-over-year.
Turning to Services. We had another quarter of very good operating profit growth, up $33 million or 17% year-over-year, a significant margin improvement, more than offset modest revenue declines. Services revenue was up 1% at actual currency, down 2% at constant currency and adjusting for the prior year Health Enterprise charge. Document Outsourcing grew 1% year-over-year with growth continuing to be driven by Xerox Partner Print Services. 
BPO declined 4% on an adjusted basis, reflecting our continued focus on profitability, very modest inorganic contribution as well as foregone revenue associated with the Health Enterprise strategy change. Within BPO, public sector revenue grew 3% as our transportation business continues to perform well and is benefiting from ramping new business, while commercial industries and health care declined driven by headwinds as we prioritize profitability, and therefore, have stepped away from some unprofitable contracts.
Total signings in the quarter were up 17% year-over-year and are up 6% for the trailing 12 months. The increase in quarter 3 was driven by strong renewal, a reflection of both high renewal opportunity as well as a good renewal rate of 86%, confirming the value we provide our customers. Over the past year, we have renewed 8 of our 10 top BPO clients. New business signings have been lower over the past year as we have strengthened our signings criteria, setting the bar higher on price, margin and deal terms. An important measure of our progress this year is services margin. This has been an area of intense focus, and the team delivered a quarter 3 margin of 9.4%, at the high-end of our 8% to 9.5% full year range. This strong performance reflects broad contribution across BPO, a result of both our strategic cost transformation initiatives and increased operating discipline by the team. And as we've said before, Document Outsourcing margin generally is in line with the Document Technology segment margin.
So key takeaways from Services are consistent with what we said in quarter 2. While revenue was a bit soft, Document Outsourcing remains a good performer; and in BPO, we're making steady progress improving profitability. There's been a near-term trade-off between revenue growth and margin. But overall, it has resulted in strong profit growth and will provide a solid foundation for our businesses as we prepare to separate.
Document Technology delivered strong margins in the face of ongoing revenue pressures within a tough market environment. Revenue was down 9% at actual currency and 7% at constant currency, with equipment down 13% and annuity down 5%. Annuity was an improvement from quarter 2 driven by supplies.
Within equipment, trends improved in both entry and high end, reflecting new product introduction, but mid-range lagged due to lower large account sales in the U.S. When we include Document Outsourcing with Document Technology, revenue declined 5% in the third quarter and is down 4% year-to-date. Overall, we continue to maintain our equipment revenue market share leadership.
Turning to activity. We delivered good growth across all color activity segments with particular strength in high end due in part to the recent drupa trade show. Entry results benefited from better performance in developing markets where we've lapped economic weakness in some geographies. Mid-range had a mixed quarter with continued good growth from the i-Series products launched earlier this year but weakness elsewhere.
Document Technology margin of 13.1% was quite strong, up 50 basis points sequentially, reflecting strategic transformation benefit and within the middle of our full year range. Year-over-year, margin was down 80 basis points as gross margin improvements were not enough to offset a higher SAG ratio. The third quarter 2015 results included materially lower compensation and benefits expense, which we did not expect would repeat. Transaction currency in the quarter was a relatively modest 30 basis point headwind to margin and at current rate could be about twice that level in quarter 4.
So overall for Document Technology, we continued to manage the impact of revenue decline through ongoing productivity actions resulting in strong segment margins and cash generation.
And as I wrap up on the segments, I'll repeat what I said last quarter: we will manage our strategic transformation focus, and we expect continued good profitability in both Document Technology and in services as we prepare to separate.
Moving to cash flow. Operating cash generation of $370 million was strong, up $99 million year-over-year and reflects the underlying cash generative profile of our business model. From a year-over-year perspective, good working capital performance and solid net income more than offset the impact of this year's unique Health Enterprise settlement and separation payment, which were $39 million and $21 million, respectively, in the quarter.
We've generated $522 million of operating cash during the first 3 quarters of the year, with all 2016 Health Enterprise settlement payments now behind us. Therefore, we enter quarter 4, our seasonally strongest cash flow quarter, well positioned to deliver on our guidance of $950 million to $1.2 billion for the full year. Investing cash flows were a use of $69 million and included $73 million spent on CapEx. Cash flow from financing was an $84 million use and includes $85 million for preferred and common stock dividends. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.4 billion and continues to provide us flexibility as we move into quarter 4 and prepare for separation.
Turning to our capital structure and capital allocation. We ended quarter 3 with $7.4 billion, of debt, a level we've been at all year. Applying 7 to 1 [ph] leverage to our customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of the quarter was $3.8 billion, leaving core debt at $3.6 billion. We continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit rating. On October 11, we filed an amendment to the Conduent Form-10 that included details of its anticipated post-separation capital structure. We indicated that Conduent expected to be capitalized with approximately $2.4 billion of debt and $400 million of cash and to transfer $2.05 billion of proceeds to Xerox, which we intend to use to reduce Xerox debt.
Consistent with our expectation, Xerox credit ratings remain investment grade, and we expect that the Conduent capital structure would result in a high noninvestment-grade rating.
And to touch on capital allocation. We've paid $79 million in common stock dividends in quarter 3. We completed a $13 million dealer acquisition earlier this month, consistent with our strategy to expand our U.S. Global Imaging business. And as we've said previously, as we prepare for our separation later this year, we're not planning to repurchase any shares.
Before I move to guidance on the next slide, I want to mention that Conduent will be filing its third quarter results in the next few weeks. The Conduent carve-out financials will reflect margin improvement, although not to the same degree as the Services segment since Conduent results include the student loan business, which resides in our Other segment. That business is in runoff and decline profit year-over-year as anticipated. 
I'll now share with you our fourth quarter and full year expectations. For quarter 4, we expect adjusted earnings in the range of $0.32 to $0.35 and GAAP earnings of $0.11 to $0.14. For the full year, we continue to expect total revenues to decline 2% to 4% at constant currency. We're narrowing our adjusted earnings guidance range to $1.11 to $1.14, which incorporates our fourth quarter expectation. In Services, we expect full year revenue will be flat to down 1% and margin will be at the very high-end of the 8% to 9.5% range. We expect Document Technology revenues will be at the lower end of the full year range, and that margin will be in line with our 12% to 14% expectation. We expect full year GAAP earnings of $0.45 to $0.48. We continue to anticipate full-year restructuring of about $300 million, including approximately $70 million in the fourth quarter and our estimate of pretax separation costs remains $175 million to $200 million and $40 million to $50 million in tax-related friction costs. 
Turning to cash flow. As I mentioned earlier, our year-to-date performance positions us well for the full year and we are maintaining our expectations of $950 million to $1.2 billion for operating cash flow and $600 million to $850 million for free cash flow. And finally, our capital allocation expectations remain largely unchanged although we now expect to spend about $30 million to $50 million on acquisition. 
So in summary, despite a somewhat challenging macro backdrop, we're on track and remain committed to delivering our overall revenue, earnings and cash flow guidance. With that, Ursula, I'll turn it back to you."

So the globe macro environment continues to be challenging. As you mentioned, Shannon, there are uncertainties with currencies fluctuating in the yen and the pound, certainly these uncertainty of the presidential election in the U.S., the Brexit adds a certain degree of uncertainty in the U.K. in Europe. But these complexities are obviously, what we deal with all the time and the important thing are the counter measures, so what we're doing is we're very aggressive on the productivity measures to drive down our total delivered cost and enhance the operating margins. As you know, what we've done over the last couple of years have been pretty aggressive on productivity and we're taking that to the next level. We're very focused on innovation and in defending our market share and we're focused on the growth areas. So specific to this quarter, what I'd say, our revenue was in line and was stable in this challenging market environment. You're correct that we were pressured on the equipment side and some of that was more in the high end and government bids due to these uncertainties. But we're also pleased with the Annuity business driven by supplies and we're also pleased on the high-end. We saw the impact of DRUPA, which will benefit us for the next couple of quarters and then at the end of September, we obviously have in the U.S. and we think that will benefit us.

What we want to do now is take this to a totally another level, so that we can reinvest back in the business, bring some back down to the bottom line and invest in some of the growth areas we see certainly in Document Outsourcing, Graphic Communications and being able to invest a little more into entry. And we'll talk a little bit more about that in Investor Day. In terms of the strategic transformation, we're driving it very hard, looking at things such as supply chain optimization, technical service excellence with remote call assist, remote connectivity, real estate optimization, how we can design our products with more efficiency and then delayering and simplifying the organization. So we have a pretty detailed plan, we're tracking very well towards it, and we're pleased with where we are right now."

First one, on the transition and inventory and how we're looking at that. We're entering something I talked about this in my prepared remarks, phase that we call soft separation. And the reason why that's important for investors is that it's a time that we can essentially practice, do a phased implementation of all of the complex separation activities and make sure that we don't stumble on when we're actually independent, including things like the inventory management system. Independent of the soft separation, we would have very little problem with this area, but I think the soft separation, makes it such that we can actually double and triple check there. So we're not managing inventory any differently than we normally would at the end of the year. All we're doing is making sure that as we do the separation, we don't have any fumbles which we don't expect. As far as costs and the impact of health care costs, the impact of ACA or any potential changes to ACA on our internal cost in the marketplace, we actually just don't see any. Internal costs, we will manage our internal health care costs in the most efficient way possible. I mean we are a good health care provider, payer of services for our clients. Our customers haven't changed and as far as the marketplace out there, we're not really seeing a big set of headwinds or change in the market dynamics because of any potential changes for ACA.

Welcome to Xerox's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At the beginning of the year, we committed to an ambitious agenda that included delivering on our financial goals for 2015 while creating a new path forward that will make our businesses more agile, focused and competitive. I'm pleased to report that we are on track to meet all of these commitments and that we achieved solid financial results this quarter.
Our third quarter EPS was within our guidance range. Cash flow generation was strong and we realized solid margins in both segments despite a challenging global market environment. At the same time, our strategic transformation and separation activities have accelerated significantly. I want to emphasize that these actions are not just about delivering for the quarter or the year. Our strategic transformation program and separation are designed to fundamentally strengthen our businesses and align them closely with the demands of our clients and opportunities in the market. We're embedding productivity and cost efficiency into all areas of our business, which will benefit us for years to come.
We're driving operational excellence and innovation to meet our clients' evolving needs. And we're establishing the new company with talent, business strategies and operating models that will enable them to become more profitable and drive growth over the long term. You will hear much more about these initiatives and the strategies, structures and financial plans of the 2 post separation companies at their investor event in December. But I'm pleased to have the leaders of our new companies, Jeff Jacobson and Ashok Vemuri, here with me today to answer questions about results in their respective businesses during the Q&A.
Before we turn to financial results, let me share some highlights of our progress towards the separation. So with 2 months to go before we complete the separation, we've passed a number of major milestones in the process. The rating agencies released updates on Xerox's credit rating, which will continue to be investment grade, Conduent and corporate is expected to be a high noninvestment-grade-rated company following the separation. These ratings are in line with our expectations.
Upon completion of the spin, Conduent will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange where Xerox will continue to trade. Additionally, we were excited to introduce Conduent's new logo and brand identity. Ashok selected Brian Walsh as the CFO of Conduent. Brian has 20 years of experience in Xerox's finance organization, spanning both operating and corporate roles, and he is currently the CFO of Xerox Services. He is a great fit for the role. And last week, we announced 7 of the 9 directors that will serve on Conduent's board as well as Conduent's named executive officers. With that, the majority of Conduent's leadership team and Board of Directors is in place. We're in the process of filling the remaining 2 board seats, and we'll make those announcements as they become available. 
All of these information about Conduent, along with updated information on its expected capitalization, pro forma financials, compensation plans and governance was included in several amendments to Conduent's Form 10 registration statements.
For Xerox, Jeff is implementing a new more streamlined operating model and has identified the operation's leaders for the stand-alone company, building on our strong, well-established infrastructure and executive team. Jeff continues to focus on filling the remaining executive roles and strengthening the bench, including identifying the right, high-quality individual for the CFO role.
In the interim, Leslie Varon continues to provide strong leadership to our finance organization and will remain in her current role until we have a new CFO in place.
I should point out that beyond senior executive appointments, both Jeff and Ashok have put in place the necessary leadership teams for the major corporate functions. We are now just days away from what we call our soft separation phase. This involves separating our corporate function, business infrastructure and IT systems into discrete capabilities for each company. It's a test run of operating independently for the new companies that will help us ensure a smooth day 1 launch.
In short, we're moving rapidly toward our separation and remain on schedule to complete it by year-end. The benefits of our 3-year strategic transformation program also continued to ramp across both businesses and can clearly be seen in our third quarter performance. We remain on track to deliver $700 million in annualized savings from productivity and cost initiatives this financial year.
With that, I will move to our third quarter results.
As I said, this was a good quarter. We delivered adjusted earnings of $0.27 per share, which was within our guidance range and in line with the same period last year. Total revenue of $4.2 billion showed a 3% decline year-over-year or 4% on an adjusted constant currency basis, which excludes the 2015 charge related to our Health Enterprise strategy change. Operating margin was solid at 9.2%. We saw strong year-over-year margin expansion in our Services segment driven by gains across our BPO businesses, while Document Technology margins remained strong.
Cash flow from operations was $370 million, reflecting a $99 million increase from prior year, and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.4 billion as a result. Overall, our underlying results demonstrated ongoing progress in our productivity and cost savings initiatives and our ability to generate strong cash flow. In addition, we continue to innovate, to deepen our client relationships and extend our capabilities.
Let me highlight a few of our achievements during the quarter.
Starting with our Services segment, which had a number of business wins and high-profile recognitions across the portfolio. We were honored to receive Outstanding Corporate Innovator Award from the Product Development and Management Association for automation, analytics and personalization capabilities. Another notable recognition was by HfS, which named Xerox health care to its winner circle, the highest ranking in its report on business services for health care payers and providers.
In the public sector, the state of Tennessee selected Xerox to provide EMV-enhanced benefit cards to over 120,000 citizens receiving child support, unemployment compensation and state pension payments. Our Document Outsourcing business secured a 10-year contract worth $110 million with the USDA for Managed Print Services. We will be installing and supporting up to 16,000 Xerox ConnectKey-enabled printers and multifunction devices at more than 3,000 USDA locations around the world. Document Outsourcing was also recognized for its market-leading offering by prominent industry analysts groups, including leadership positions in Quocirca's MPS market landscape report and IDC's MarketScape's document workflow services assessment.
Now turning to our Document Technology business. In September, we showcased our portfolio of the latest printing technologies, workflow solutions and business development resources at Graph Expo 2016. This is North America's largest graphic arts trade show. We also brought a number of innovative products for small and midsized businesses to market as we continue to expand our offerings in the space.
At the corporate level, I am proud to share that Xerox released its 2016 global citizenship report, highlighting our approach to social responsibility. Our citizenship efforts continue to be widely recognized. And during the quarter, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America and Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens.
I'll now turn it over to Leslie who will provide more detail on our third quarter results and 2016 guidance."

I'll start with the earnings slide and cover the rest of the financials as well as our guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up.Our third quarter results reflect operational discipline and good pro",1861,"Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the earnings slide and cover the rest of the financials as well as our guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up.
Our third quarter results reflect operational discipline and good progress in key areas that will set the foundation for the 2 companies post-separation. These include cost and productivity progress from our strategic transformation, resulting in broad-based margin improvement in BPO and solid margins in Document Technology; overall services signings growth as we renewed 86% in the quarter with high renewal opportunities, reflecting the continued confidence our customers have in us; strong operating cash generation, reflective of the durability of our annuity-based business model. So while revenues in both businesses were a bit soft, we delivered overall good results in a somewhat volatile macro environment.
Total revenue of $4.2 billion was down 3% at actual currency and down 4% on an adjusted constant currency basis, including 1 point of negative currency. I'll be discussing our results on an adjusted basis when making comparisons against the prior year as the third quarter 2015 included the $389 million pretax charge, including a revenue reduction of $116 million related to our Health Enterprise strategy change.
Adjusted gross margin of 31.3% was up 10 basis points year-over-year, driven by improvements in both segments, partially offset by a greater mix of Services, which structurally has a lower gross margin. There was a modest negative transaction currency impacting quarter 3, reflecting yen strength against the euro, pound and U.S. dollar, partially mitigated by our hedging and currency risk sharing with Fuji Xerox. At current rates, we are expecting some additional pressure in quarter 4.
Adjusted RD&E was down $10 million year-over-year and adjusted SAG was down $28 million, driven by productivity and cost initiatives, which were partially offset by higher expenses related to prior year compensation and benefits reduction. Overall flow-through from our strategic transformation action resulted in good margins in both segments and a solid 9.2% total company operating margin. Adjusted other net expense was down $17 million year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense. Equity income of $39 million in the quarter was down slightly year-over-year.
Our third quarter adjusted tax rate of 25.3% was 1.8 points below last year and just under our guidance range of 26% to 28%, reflecting the geographic mix of our profits. Bottom line, adjusted earnings of $0.27 was in the middle of our guidance range and flat year-over-year.
Turning to Services. We had another quarter of very good operating profit growth, up $33 million or 17% year-over-year, a significant margin improvement, more than offset modest revenue declines. Services revenue was up 1% at actual currency, down 2% at constant currency and adjusting for the prior year Health Enterprise charge. Document Outsourcing grew 1% year-over-year with growth continuing to be driven by Xerox Partner Print Services. 
BPO declined 4% on an adjusted basis, reflecting our continued focus on profitability, very modest inorganic contribution as well as foregone revenue associated with the Health Enterprise strategy change. Within BPO, public sector revenue grew 3% as our transportation business continues to perform well and is benefiting from ramping new business, while commercial industries and health care declined driven by headwinds as we prioritize profitability, and therefore, have stepped away from some unprofitable contracts.
Total signings in the quarter were up 17% year-over-year and are up 6% for the trailing 12 months. The increase in quarter 3 was driven by strong renewal, a reflection of both high renewal opportunity as well as a good renewal rate of 86%, confirming the value we provide our customers. Over the past year, we have renewed 8 of our 10 top BPO clients. New business signings have been lower over the past year as we have strengthened our signings criteria, setting the bar higher on price, margin and deal terms. An important measure of our progress this year is services margin. This has been an area of intense focus, and the team delivered a quarter 3 margin of 9.4%, at the high-end of our 8% to 9.5% full year range. This strong performance reflects broad contribution across BPO, a result of both our strategic cost transformation initiatives and increased operating discipline by the team. And as we've said before, Document Outsourcing margin generally is in line with the Document Technology segment margin.
So key takeaways from Services are consistent with what we said in quarter 2. While revenue was a bit soft, Document Outsourcing remains a good performer; and in BPO, we're making steady progress improving profitability. There's been a near-term trade-off between revenue growth and margin. But overall, it has resulted in strong profit growth and will provide a solid foundation for our businesses as we prepare to separate.
Document Technology delivered strong margins in the face of ongoing revenue pressures within a tough market environment. Revenue was down 9% at actual currency and 7% at constant currency, with equipment down 13% and annuity down 5%. Annuity was an improvement from quarter 2 driven by supplies.
Within equipment, trends improved in both entry and high end, reflecting new product introduction, but mid-range lagged due to lower large account sales in the U.S. When we include Document Outsourcing with Document Technology, revenue declined 5% in the third quarter and is down 4% year-to-date. Overall, we continue to maintain our equipment revenue market share leadership.
Turning to activity. We delivered good growth across all color activity segments with particular strength in high end due in part to the recent drupa trade show. Entry results benefited from better performance in developing markets where we've lapped economic weakness in some geographies. Mid-range had a mixed quarter with continued good growth from the i-Series products launched earlier this year but weakness elsewhere.
Document Technology margin of 13.1% was quite strong, up 50 basis points sequentially, reflecting strategic transformation benefit and within the middle of our full year range. Year-over-year, margin was down 80 basis points as gross margin improvements were not enough to offset a higher SAG ratio. The third quarter 2015 results included materially lower compensation and benefits expense, which we did not expect would repeat. Transaction currency in the quarter was a relatively modest 30 basis point headwind to margin and at current rate could be about twice that level in quarter 4.
So overall for Document Technology, we continued to manage the impact of revenue decline through ongoing productivity actions resulting in strong segment margins and cash generation.
And as I wrap up on the segments, I'll repeat what I said last quarter: we will manage our strategic transformation focus, and we expect continued good profitability in both Document Technology and in services as we prepare to separate.
Moving to cash flow. Operating cash generation of $370 million was strong, up $99 million year-over-year and reflects the underlying cash generative profile of our business model. From a year-over-year perspective, good working capital performance and solid net income more than offset the impact of this year's unique Health Enterprise settlement and separation payment, which were $39 million and $21 million, respectively, in the quarter.
We've generated $522 million of operating cash during the first 3 quarters of the year, with all 2016 Health Enterprise settlement payments now behind us. Therefore, we enter quarter 4, our seasonally strongest cash flow quarter, well positioned to deliver on our guidance of $950 million to $1.2 billion for the full year. Investing cash flows were a use of $69 million and included $73 million spent on CapEx. Cash flow from financing was an $84 million use and includes $85 million for preferred and common stock dividends. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.4 billion and continues to provide us flexibility as we move into quarter 4 and prepare for separation.
Turning to our capital structure and capital allocation. We ended quarter 3 with $7.4 billion, of debt, a level we've been at all year. Applying 7:1 leverage to our customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of the quarter was $3.8 billion, leaving core debt at $3.6 billion. We continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit rating. On October 11, we filed an amendment to the Conduent Form 10 that included details of its anticipated post-separation capital structure. We indicated that Conduent expected to be capitalized with approximately $2.4 billion of debt and $400 million of cash and to transfer $2.05 billion of proceeds to Xerox, which we intend to use to reduce Xerox debt.
Consistent with our expectation, Xerox credit ratings remain investment grade, and we expect that the Conduent capital structure would result in a high noninvestment-grade rating.
And to touch on capital allocation. We've paid $79 million in common stock dividends in quarter 3. We completed a $13 million dealer acquisition earlier this month, consistent with our strategy to expand our U.S. Global Imaging business. And as we've said previously, as we prepare for our separation later this year, we're not planning to repurchase any shares.
Before I move to guidance on the next slide, I want to mention that Conduent will be filing its third quarter results in the next few weeks. The Conduent carve-out financials will reflect margin improvement, although not to the same degree as the Services segment since Conduent results include the student loan business, which resides in our Other segment. That business is in runoff and decline profit year-over-year as anticipated.
I'll now share with you our fourth quarter and full year expectations. For quarter 4, we expect adjusted earnings in the range of $0.32 to $0.35 and GAAP earnings of $0.11 to $0.14. For the full year, we continue to expect total revenues to decline 2% to 4% at constant currency. We're narrowing our adjusted earnings guidance range to $1.11 to $1.14, which incorporates our fourth quarter expectation.
In Services, we expect full year revenue will be flat to down 1% and margin will be at the very high end of the 8% to 9.5% range. We expect Document Technology revenues will be at the lower end of the full year range and that margin will be in line with our 12% to 14% expectation.
We expect full year GAAP earnings of $0.45 to $0.48. We continue to anticipate full year restructuring of about $300 million, including approximately $70 million in the fourth quarter and our estimate of pretax separation costs remains $175 million to $200 million and $40 million to $50 million in tax-related friction costs.
Turning to cash flow. As I mentioned earlier, our year-to-date performance positions us well for the full year and we are maintaining our expectations of $950 million to $1.2 billion for operating cash flow and $600 million to $850 million for free cash flow.
And finally, our capital allocation expectations remain largely unchanged, although we now expect to spend about $30 million to $50 million on acquisition.
So in summary, despite a somewhat challenging macro backdrop, we are on track and remain committed to delivering our overall revenue, earnings and cash flow guidance.
With that, Ursula, I'll turn it back to you."

So the global market environment continues to be challenging. As you mentioned, Shannon, there are uncertainties with currencies fluctuating in the yen and the pound. Certainly, these -- the uncertainty of the presidential election in the U.S., the Brexit adds a certain degree of uncertainty in the U.K. and Europe. But these complexities are obviously what we deal with all the time. And the important thing are the counter measures. So what we're doing is we're very aggressive on the productivity measures to drive down our total delivered costs and enhance the operating margins. As you know, what we've done over the last couple of years have been pretty aggressive on productivity, and we're taking that to the next level. We're very focused on innovation and defending our market share. And we're focused on the growth areas. So specific to this quarter, what I'd say, our revenue was in line and was stable in this challenging market environment. You're correct that we were pressured on the equipment side, and some of that was more in the high end and government bids due to these uncertainties. But we're also pleased with the annuity business driven by supplies, and we're also pleased on the high end. We saw the impact of drupa, which will benefit us for the next couple of quarters. And then at the end of September, we obviously had Graph Expo in the U.S. and we think that will benefit us. So overall, in line, good color installs and pressure more on the mono side as we're moving more sort of color in the macro environment."

And certainly, we'll cover a lot more of the details at the investor conference.

So we -- the linchpin to our strategy is driving that strategic transformation very hard. And the reason is this: In past years, basically, we've offset the headwinds of annuity, price erosion and done just enough. What we want to do now is take this to a totally another level, so that we can reinvest back in the business, bring some back down to the bottom line and invest in some of the growth areas we see, certainly, in Document Outsourcing, Graphic Communications and being able to invest a little more into entry. And we'll talk a little bit more about that at Investor Day. In terms of the strategic transformation, we're driving it very hard. We're looking at things such as supply chain optimization, technical service excellence with remote call assist, remote connectivity, real estate optimization, how we can design our products with more efficiency and then delayering and simplifying the organization. So we have a pretty detailed plan, we're tracking very well towards it, and we're pleased with where we are right now."

First one, on the transition and inventory and how we're looking at that. We're entering something, I talked about this in my prepared remarks, a phase that we call soft separation. And the reason why that's important for investors is that it's a time that we can essentially practice, do a phased implementation of all of the complex separation activities and make sure that we don't stumble on -- when we're actually independent, including things like the inventory management system. Independent of the soft separation, we would have very little problem with this area. But I think the soft separation makes it such that we can actually double and triple check there. So I wouldn't -- we don't -- we're not managing inventory any differently than we normally would at the end of the year. All we're doing is making sure that as we do a separation, we don't have any fumbles, which we don't expect. As far as costs and the impact -- health care costs, the impact of ACA or any potential changes to ACA on our internal cost and the marketplace, we actually just don't see any. Internal costs, we will manage our internal health care costs in the most efficient way possible. I mean, we are a good health care provider, payer of services for our clients. Our customers haven't changed. And as far as the marketplace out there, we're not really seeing a big set of headwinds or change in the market dynamics because of any potential changes for ACA.

Welcome to Xerox's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At the beginning of the year, we committed to an ambitious agenda that included delivering on our financial goals for 2015 while creating a new path forward that will make our businesses more agile, focused and competitive. I'm pleased to report that we are on track to meet all of these commitments and that we achieved solid financial results this quarter.
Our third quarter EPS was within our guidance range. Cash flow generation was strong and we realized solid margins in both segments despite a challenging global market environment. At the same time, our strategic transformation and separation activities have accelerated significantly. I want to emphasize that these actions are not just about delivering for the quarter or the year. Our strategic transformation program and separation are designed to fundamentally strengthen our businesses and align them closely with the demands of our clients and opportunities in the market. We're embedding productivity and cost efficiency into all areas of our business, which will benefit us for years to come.
We're driving operational excellence and innovation to meet our clients' evolving needs. And we're establishing the new company with talent, business strategies and operating models that will enable them to become more profitable and drive growth over the long term. You will hear much more about these initiatives and the strategies, structures and financial plans of the 2 post-separation companies at their investor event in December. But I'm pleased to have the leaders of our new companies, Jeff Jacobson and Ashok Vemuri, here with me today to answer questions about results in their respective businesses during the Q&A.
Before we turn to financial results, let me share some highlights of our progress towards the separation. So with 2 months to go before we complete the separation, we've passed a number of major milestones in the process. The rating agencies released updates on Xerox's credit rating, which will continue to be investment grade, Conduent Inc. is expected to be a high noninvestment-grade-rated company following the separation. These ratings are in line with our expectations.
Upon completion of the spin, Conduent will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange where Xerox will continue to trade. Additionally, we were excited to introduce Conduent's new logo and brand identity. Ashok selected Brian Walsh as the CFO of Conduent. Brian has 20 years of experience in Xerox's finance organization, spanning both operating and corporate roles, and he is currently the CFO of Xerox Services. He is a great fit for the role. And last week, we announced 7 of the 9 directors that will serve on Conduent's board as well as Conduent's named executive officers. With that, the majority of Conduent's leadership team and Board of Directors is in place. We're in the process of filling the remaining 2 board seats, and we'll make those announcements as they become available. 
All of this information about Conduent, along with updated information on its expected capitalization, pro forma financials, compensation plans and governance was included in several amendments to Conduent's Form 10 registration statements.
For Xerox, Jeff is implementing a new, more streamlined operating model and has identified the operation's leaders for the stand-alone company, building on our strong, well-established infrastructure and executive team. Jeff continues to focus on filling the remaining executive roles and strengthening the bench, including identifying the right, high-quality individual for the CFO role.
In the interim, Leslie Varon continues to provide strong leadership to our finance organization and will remain in her current role until we have a new CFO in place.
I should point out that beyond senior executive appointments, both Jeff and Ashok have put in place the necessary leadership teams for the major corporate functions. We are now just days away from what we call our soft separation phase. This involves separating our corporate function, business infrastructure and IT systems into discrete capabilities for each company. It's a test run at operating independently for the new companies that will help us ensure a smooth day one launch.
In short, we're moving rapidly toward our separation and remain on schedule to complete it by year-end. The benefits of our 3-year strategic transformation program also continued to ramp across both businesses and can clearly be seen in our third quarter performance. We remain on track to deliver $700 million in annualized savings from productivity and cost initiatives this financial year.
With that, I will move to our third quarter results.
As I said, this was a good quarter. We delivered adjusted earnings of $0.27 per share, which was within our guidance range and in line with the same period last year. Total revenue of $4.2 billion showed a 3% decline year-over-year or 4% on an adjusted constant currency basis, which excludes the 2015 charge related to our Health Enterprise strategy change. Operating margin was solid at 9.2%. We saw strong year-over-year margin expansion in our Services segment driven by gains across our BPO businesses, while Document Technology margins remained strong.
Cash flow from operations was $370 million, reflecting a $99 million increase from prior year, and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.4 billion as a result. Overall, our underlying results demonstrated ongoing progress in our productivity and cost savings initiatives and our ability to generate strong cash flow. In addition, we continue to innovate, to deepen our client relationships and extend our capabilities.
Let me highlight a few of our achievements during the quarter.
Starting with our Services segment, which had a number of business wins and high-profile recognitions across the portfolio. We were honored to receive Outstanding Corporate Innovator Award from the Product Development and Management Association for automation, analytics and personalization capabilities. Another notable recognition was by HfS, which named Xerox health care to its winner circle, the highest ranking in its report on business services for health care payers and providers.
In the public sector, the state of Tennessee selected Xerox to provide EMV-enhanced benefit cards to over 120,000 citizens receiving child support, unemployment compensation and state pension payments. Our Document Outsourcing business secured a 10-year contract worth $110 million with the USDA for Managed Print Services. We will be installing and supporting up to 16,000 Xerox ConnectKey-enabled printers and multifunction devices at more than 3,000 USDA locations around the world. Document Outsourcing was also recognized for its market-leading offering by prominent industry analysts groups, including leadership positions in Quocirca's MPS market landscape report and IDC's MarketScape's document workflow services assessment.
Now turning to our Document Technology business. In September, we showcased our portfolio of the latest printing technologies, workflow solutions and business development resources at Graph Expo 2016. This is North America's largest graphic arts trade show. We also brought a number of innovative products for small and midsized businesses to market as we continue to expand our offerings in this space.
At the corporate level, I am proud to share that Xerox released its 2016 global citizenship report, highlighting our approach to social responsibility. Our citizenship efforts continue to be widely recognized. And during the quarter, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America and Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens.
I'll now turn it over to Leslie who will provide more detail on our third quarter results and 2016 guidance."
103599,403644781,1065576,"Xerox Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Xerox Holdings Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the earnings slide and cover the rest of the financials as well as our guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up.Our third quarter results reflect operational discipline and good pro",1861,"Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the earnings slide and cover the rest of the financials as well as our guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up.
Our third quarter results reflect operational discipline and good progress in key areas that will set the foundation for the 2 companies post-separation. These include cost and productivity progress from our strategic transformation, resulting in broad-based margin improvement in BPO and solid margins in Document Technology; overall services signings growth as we renewed 86% in the quarter with high renewal opportunities, reflecting the continued confidence our customers have in us; strong operating cash generation, reflective of the durability of our annuity-based business model. So while revenues in both businesses were a bit soft, we delivered overall good results in a somewhat volatile macro environment.
Total revenue of $4.2 billion was down 3% at actual currency and down 4% on an adjusted constant currency basis, including 1 point of negative currency. I'll be discussing our results on an adjusted basis when making comparisons against the prior year as the third quarter 2015 included the $389 million pretax charge, including a revenue reduction of $116 million related to our Health Enterprise strategy change.
Adjusted gross margin of 31.3% was up 10 basis points year-over-year, driven by improvements in both segments, partially offset by a greater mix of Services, which structurally has a lower gross margin. There was a modest negative transaction currency impacting quarter 3, reflecting yen strength against the euro, pound and U.S. dollar, partially mitigated by our hedging and currency risk sharing with Fuji Xerox. At current rates, we are expecting some additional pressure in quarter 4.
Adjusted RD&E was down $10 million year-over-year and adjusted SAG was down $28 million, driven by productivity and cost initiatives, which were partially offset by higher expenses related to prior year compensation and benefits reduction. Overall flow-through from our strategic transformation action resulted in good margins in both segments and a solid 9.2% total company operating margin. Adjusted other net expense was down $17 million year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense. Equity income of $39 million in the quarter was down slightly year-over-year.
Our third quarter adjusted tax rate of 25.3% was 1.8 points below last year and just under our guidance range of 26% to 28%, reflecting the geographic mix of our profits. Bottom line, adjusted earnings of $0.27 was in the middle of our guidance range and flat year-over-year.
Turning to Services. We had another quarter of very good operating profit growth, up $33 million or 17% year-over-year, a significant margin improvement, more than offset modest revenue declines. Services revenue was up 1% at actual currency, down 2% at constant currency and adjusting for the prior year Health Enterprise charge. Document Outsourcing grew 1% year-over-year with growth continuing to be driven by Xerox Partner Print Services. 
BPO declined 4% on an adjusted basis, reflecting our continued focus on profitability, very modest inorganic contribution as well as foregone revenue associated with the Health Enterprise strategy change. Within BPO, public sector revenue grew 3% as our transportation business continues to perform well and is benefiting from ramping new business, while commercial industries and health care declined driven by headwinds as we prioritize profitability, and therefore, have stepped away from some unprofitable contracts.
Total signings in the quarter were up 17% year-over-year and are up 6% for the trailing 12 months. The increase in quarter 3 was driven by strong renewal, a reflection of both high renewal opportunity as well as a good renewal rate of 86%, confirming the value we provide our customers. Over the past year, we have renewed 8 of our 10 top BPO clients. New business signings have been lower over the past year as we have strengthened our signings criteria, setting the bar higher on price, margin and deal terms. An important measure of our progress this year is services margin. This has been an area of intense focus, and the team delivered a quarter 3 margin of 9.4%, at the high-end of our 8% to 9.5% full year range. This strong performance reflects broad contribution across BPO, a result of both our strategic cost transformation initiatives and increased operating discipline by the team. And as we've said before, Document Outsourcing margin generally is in line with the Document Technology segment margin.
So key takeaways from Services are consistent with what we said in quarter 2. While revenue was a bit soft, Document Outsourcing remains a good performer; and in BPO, we're making steady progress improving profitability. There's been a near-term trade-off between revenue growth and margin. But overall, it has resulted in strong profit growth and will provide a solid foundation for our businesses as we prepare to separate.
Document Technology delivered strong margins in the face of ongoing revenue pressures within a tough market environment. Revenue was down 9% at actual currency and 7% at constant currency, with equipment down 13% and annuity down 5%. Annuity was an improvement from quarter 2 driven by supplies.
Within equipment, trends improved in both entry and high end, reflecting new product introduction, but mid-range lagged due to lower large account sales in the U.S. When we include Document Outsourcing with Document Technology, revenue declined 5% in the third quarter and is down 4% year-to-date. Overall, we continue to maintain our equipment revenue market share leadership.
Turning to activity. We delivered good growth across all color activity segments with particular strength in high end due in part to the recent drupa trade show. Entry results benefited from better performance in developing markets where we've lapped economic weakness in some geographies. Mid-range had a mixed quarter with continued good growth from the i-Series products launched earlier this year but weakness elsewhere.
Document Technology margin of 13.1% was quite strong, up 50 basis points sequentially, reflecting strategic transformation benefit and within the middle of our full year range. Year-over-year, margin was down 80 basis points as gross margin improvements were not enough to offset a higher SAG ratio. The third quarter 2015 results included materially lower compensation and benefits expense, which we did not expect would repeat. Transaction currency in the quarter was a relatively modest 30 basis point headwind to margin and at current rate could be about twice that level in quarter 4.
So overall for Document Technology, we continued to manage the impact of revenue decline through ongoing productivity actions resulting in strong segment margins and cash generation.
And as I wrap up on the segments, I'll repeat what I said last quarter: we will manage our strategic transformation focus, and we expect continued good profitability in both Document Technology and in services as we prepare to separate.
Moving to cash flow. Operating cash generation of $370 million was strong, up $99 million year-over-year, and reflects the underlying cash generative profile of our business model. From a year-over-year perspective, good working capital performance and solid net income more than offset the impact of this year's unique Health Enterprise settlement and separation payment, which were $39 million and $21 million, respectively, in the quarter.
We've generated $522 million of operating cash during the first 3 quarters of the year, with all 2016 Health Enterprise settlement payments now behind us. Therefore, we enter quarter 4, our seasonally strongest cash flow quarter, well positioned to deliver on our guidance of $950 million to $1.2 billion for the full year. Investing cash flows were a use of $69 million and included $73 million spent on CapEx. Cash flow from financing was an $84 million use and includes $85 million for preferred and common stock dividends. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.4 billion and continues to provide us flexibility as we move into quarter 4 and prepare for separation.
Turning to our capital structure and capital allocation. We ended quarter 3 with $7.4 billion, of debt, a level we've been at all year. Applying 7:1 leverage to our customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of the quarter was $3.8 billion, leaving core debt at $3.6 billion. We continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit rating. On October 11, we filed an amendment to the Conduent Form 10 that included details of its anticipated post-separation capital structure. We indicated that Conduent expected to be capitalized with approximately $2.4 billion of debt and $400 million of cash and to transfer $2.05 billion of proceeds to Xerox, which we intend to use to reduce Xerox debt.
Consistent with our expectation, Xerox credit ratings remain investment grade, and we expect that the Conduent capital structure would result in a high noninvestment-grade rating.
And to touch on capital allocation. We've paid $79 million in common stock dividends in quarter 3. We completed a $13 million dealer acquisition earlier this month, consistent with our strategy to expand our U.S. Global Imaging business. And as we've said previously, as we prepare for our separation later this year, we're not planning to repurchase any shares.
Before I move to guidance on the next slide, I want to mention that Conduent will be filing its third quarter results in the next few weeks. The Conduent carve-out financials will reflect margin improvement, although not to the same degree as the Services segment since Conduent results include the student loan business, which resides in our Other segment. That business is in runoff and declined profit year-over-year as anticipated.
I'll now share with you our fourth quarter and full year expectations. For quarter 4, we expect adjusted earnings in the range of $0.32 to $0.35 and GAAP earnings of $0.11 to $0.14. For the full year, we continue to expect total revenues to decline 2% to 4% at constant currency. We're narrowing our adjusted earnings guidance range to $1.11 to $1.14, which incorporates our fourth quarter expectation.
In Services, we expect full year revenue will be flat to down 1% and margin will be at the very high end of the 8% to 9.5% range. We expect Document Technology revenues will be at the lower end of the full year range and that margin will be in line with our 12% to 14% expectation.
We expect full year GAAP earnings of $0.45 to $0.48. We continue to anticipate full year restructuring of about $300 million, including approximately $70 million in the fourth quarter and our estimate of pretax separation costs remains $175 million to $200 million and $40 million to $50 million in tax-related friction costs.
Turning to cash flow. As I mentioned earlier, our year-to-date performance positions us well for the full year and we are maintaining our expectations of $950 million to $1.2 billion for operating cash flow and $600 million to $850 million for free cash flow.
And finally, our capital allocation expectations remain largely unchanged, although we now expect to spend about $30 million to $50 million on acquisition.
So in summary, despite a somewhat challenging macro backdrop, we are on track and remain committed to delivering our overall revenue, earnings and cash flow guidance.
With that, Ursula, I'll turn it back to you."

So the global market environment continues to be challenging. As you mentioned, Shannon, there are uncertainties with currencies fluctuating in the yen and the pound. Certainly, these -- the uncertainty of the presidential election in the U.S., the Brexit adds a certain degree of uncertainty in the U.K. and Europe. But these complexities are obviously what we deal with all the time. And the important thing are the counter measures. So what we're doing is we're very aggressive on the productivity measures to drive down our total delivered costs and enhance the operating margins. As you know, what we've done over the last couple of years has been pretty aggressive on productivity, and we're taking that to the next level. We're very focused on innovation and defending our market share. And we're focused on the growth areas. So specific to this quarter, what I'd say, our revenue was in line and was stable in this challenging market environment. You're correct that we were pressured on the equipment side, and some of that was more in the high-end and government bids due to these uncertainties. But we're also pleased with the annuity business driven by supplies, and we're also pleased on the high end. We saw the impact of drupa, which will benefit us for the next couple of quarters. And then at the end of September, we obviously had Graph Expo in the U.S. and we think that will benefit us. So overall, in line, good color installs and pressure on more the mono side as we're moving more sort of color in the macro environment."

So I think what we have seen in terms of the margin improvement is clearly the flow-through of all the strategic transformation activities that we've been doing. There's a higher degree of discipline that we have driven. We have balanced some of the revenue reduction because we are being much more selective in terms of the deals we are doing. Deal qualification has improved. The bars that we have put in terms of pricing and the kind of deals that we want to do, we've raised that. So margins, as I've said, in answer to the previous question, is extremely important for us. So we need to balance that by also driving revenue growth."

And the reason is this: In past years, basically, we've offset the headwinds of annuity, price erosion and done just enough. What we want to do now is take this to a totally another level, so that we can reinvest back in the business, bring some back down to the bottom line and invest in some of the growth areas we see, certainly, in Document Outsourcing, Graphic Communications and being able to invest a little more into entry. And we'll talk a little bit more about that at Investor Day. In terms of the strategic transformation, we're driving it very hard.

First one, on the transition and inventory and how we're looking at that. We're entering something, I talked about this in my prepared remarks, a phase that we call soft separation. And the reason why that's important for investors is that it's a time that we can essentially practice, do a phased implementation of all of the complex separation activities and make sure that we don't stumble on -- when we're actually independent, including things like the inventory management system. Independent of the soft separation, we would have very little problem with this area. But I think the soft separation makes it such that we can actually double and triple check there. So I wouldn't -- we don't -- we're not managing inventory any differently than we normally would at the end of the year. All we're doing is making sure that as we do a separation, we don't have any fumbles, which we don't expect. As far as costs and the impact -- health care costs, the impact of ACA or any potential changes to ACA on our internal cost and the marketplace, we actually just don't see any. Internal costs, we will manage our internal health care costs in the most efficient way possible. I mean, we are a good health care provider, payer of services for our clients. Our customers haven't changed. And as far as the marketplace out there, we're not really seeing a big set of headwinds or change in the market dynamics because of any potential changes for ACA.

Welcome to Xerox's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At the beginning of the year, we committed to an ambitious agenda that included delivering on our financial goals for 2015 while creating a new path forward that will make our businesses more agile, focused and competitive. I'm pleased to report that we are on track to meet all of these commitments and that we achieved solid financial results this quarter.
Our third quarter EPS was within our guidance range. Cash flow generation was strong and we realized solid margins in both segments despite a challenging global market environment. At the same time, our strategic transformation and separation activities have accelerated significantly. I want to emphasize that these actions are not just about delivering for the quarter or the year. Our strategic transformation program and separation are designed to fundamentally strengthen our businesses and align them closely with the demands of our clients and opportunities in the market. We're embedding productivity and cost efficiency into all areas of our business, which will benefit us for years to come.
We're driving operational excellence and innovation to meet our clients' evolving needs. And we're establishing the new company with talent, business strategies and operating models that will enable them to become more profitable and drive growth over the long term. You will hear much more about these initiatives and the strategies, structures and financial plans of the 2 post-separation companies at their investor event in December. But I'm pleased to have the leaders of our new companies, Jeff Jacobson and Ashok Vemuri, here with me today to answer questions about results in their respective businesses during the Q&A.
Before we turn to financial results, let me share some highlights of our progress towards the separation. So with 2 months to go before we complete the separation, we've passed a number of major milestones in the process. The rating agencies released updates on Xerox's credit rating, which will continue to be investment grade, Conduent Inc. is expected to be a high noninvestment-grade-rated company following the separation. These ratings are in line with our expectations.
Upon completion of the spin, Conduent will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange where Xerox will continue to trade. Additionally, we were excited to introduce Conduent's new logo and brand identity. Ashok selected Brian Walsh as the CFO of Conduent. Brian has 20 years of experience in Xerox's finance organization, spanning both operating and corporate roles, and he is currently the CFO of Xerox Services. He is a great fit for the role. And last week, we announced 7 of the 9 directors that will serve on Conduent's board as well as Conduent's named executive officers. With that, the majority of Conduent's leadership team and Board of Directors is in place. We're in the process of filling the remaining 2 board seats, and we'll make those announcements as they become available. 
All of this information about Conduent, along with updated information on its expected capitalization, pro forma financials, compensation plans and governance was included in several amendments to Conduent's Form 10 registration statements.
For Xerox, Jeff is implementing a new, more streamlined operating model and has identified the operation's leaders for the stand-alone company, building on our strong, well-established infrastructure and executive team. Jeff continues to focus on filling the remaining executive roles and strengthening the bench, including identifying the right, high-quality individual for the CFO role.
In the interim, Leslie Varon continues to provide strong leadership to our finance organization and will remain in her current role until we have a new CFO in place.
I should point out that beyond senior executive appointments, both Jeff and Ashok have put in place the necessary leadership teams for the major corporate functions. We are now just days away from what we call our soft separation phase. This involves separating our corporate function, business infrastructure and IT systems into discrete capabilities for each company. It's a test run at operating independently for the new companies that will help us ensure a smooth day 1 launch.
In short, we're moving rapidly toward our separation and remain on schedule to complete it by year-end. The benefits of our 3-year strategic transformation program also continued to ramp across both businesses and can clearly be seen in our third quarter performance. We remain on track to deliver $700 million in annualized savings from productivity and cost initiatives this financial year.
With that, I will move to our third quarter results.
As I said, this was a good quarter. We delivered adjusted earnings of $0.27 per share, which was within our guidance range and in line with the same period last year. Total revenue of $4.2 billion showed a 3% decline year-over-year or 4% on an adjusted constant currency basis, which excludes the 2015 charge related to our Health Enterprise strategy change. Operating margin was solid at 9.2%. We saw strong year-over-year margin expansion in our Services segment driven by gains across our BPO businesses, while Document Technology margins remained strong.
Cash flow from operations was $370 million, reflecting a $99 million increase from prior year, and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.4 billion as a result. Overall, our underlying results demonstrated ongoing progress in our productivity and cost savings initiatives and our ability to generate strong cash flow. In addition, we continue to innovate, to deepen our client relationships and extend our capabilities.
Let me highlight a few of our achievements during the quarter.
Starting with our Services segment, which had a number of business wins and high-profile recognitions across the portfolio. We were honored to receive Outstanding Corporate Innovator Award from the Product Development and Management Association for automation, analytics and personalization capabilities. Another notable recognition was by HfS, which named Xerox health care to its winner circle, the highest ranking in its report on business services for health care payers and providers.
In the public sector, the state of Tennessee selected Xerox to provide EMV-enhanced benefit cards to over 120,000 citizens receiving child support, unemployment compensation and state pension payments. Our Document Outsourcing business secured a 10-year contract worth $110 million with the USDA for Managed Print Services. We will be installing and supporting up to 16,000 Xerox ConnectKey-enabled printers and multifunction devices at more than 3,000 USDA locations around the world. Document Outsourcing was also recognized for its market-leading offering by prominent industry analysts groups, including leadership positions in Quocirca's MPS market landscape report and IDC's MarketScape's document workflow services assessment.
Now turning to our Document Technology business. In September, we showcased our portfolio of the latest printing technologies, workflow solutions and business development resources at Graph Expo 2016. This is North America's largest graphic arts trade show. We also brought a number of innovative products for small and midsized businesses to market as we continue to expand our offerings in this space.
At the corporate level, I am proud to share that Xerox released its 2016 global citizenship report, highlighting our approach to social responsibility. Our citizenship efforts continue to be widely recognized. And during the quarter, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America and Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens.
I'll now turn it over to Leslie who will provide more detail on our third quarter results and 2016 guidance."

I'll start with the earnings slide and cover the rest of the financials as well as our guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up.Our third quarter results reflect operational discipline and good pro",1861,"Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the earnings slide and cover the rest of the financials as well as our guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up.
Our third quarter results reflect operational discipline and good progress in key areas that will set the foundation for the 2 companies post-separation. These include cost and productivity progress from our strategic transformation, resulting in broad-based margin improvement in BPO and solid margins in Document Technology; overall services signings growth as we renewed 86% in the quarter with high renewal opportunities, reflecting the continued confidence our customers have in us; strong operating cash generation, reflective of the durability of our annuity-based business model. So while revenues in both businesses were a bit soft, we delivered overall good results in a somewhat volatile macro environment.
Total revenue of $4.2 billion was down 3% at actual currency and down 4% on an adjusted constant currency basis, including 1 point of negative currency. I'll be discussing our results on an adjusted basis when making comparisons against the prior year as the third quarter 2015 included the $389 million pretax charge, including a revenue reduction of $116 million related to our Health Enterprise strategy change.
Adjusted gross margin of 31.3% was up 10 basis points year-over-year, driven by improvements in both segments, partially offset by a greater mix of Services, which structurally has a lower gross margin. There was a modest negative transaction currency impacting quarter 3, reflecting yen strength against the euro, pound and U.S. dollar, partially mitigated by our hedging and currency risk sharing with Fuji Xerox. At current rates, we are expecting some additional pressure in quarter 4.
Adjusted RD&E was down $10 million year-over-year and adjusted SAG was down $28 million, driven by productivity and cost initiatives, which were partially offset by higher expenses related to prior year compensation and benefits reduction. Overall flow-through from our strategic transformation action resulted in good margins in both segments and a solid 9.2% total company operating margin. Adjusted other net expense was down $17 million year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense. Equity income of $39 million in the quarter was down slightly year-over-year.
Our third quarter adjusted tax rate of 25.3% was 1.8 points below last year and just under our guidance range of 26% to 28%, reflecting the geographic mix of our profits. Bottom line, adjusted earnings of $0.27 was in the middle of our guidance range and flat year-over-year.
Turning to Services. We had another quarter of very good operating profit growth, up $33 million or 17% year-over-year, a significant margin improvement, more than offset modest revenue declines. Services revenue was up 1% at actual currency, down 2% at constant currency and adjusting for the prior year Health Enterprise charge. Document Outsourcing grew 1% year-over-year with growth continuing to be driven by Xerox Partner Print Services. 
BPO declined 4% on an adjusted basis, reflecting our continued focus on profitability, very modest inorganic contribution as well as foregone revenue associated with the Health Enterprise strategy change. Within BPO, public sector revenue grew 3% as our transportation business continues to perform well and is benefiting from ramping new business, while commercial industries and health care declined driven by headwinds as we prioritize profitability, and therefore, have stepped away from some unprofitable contracts.
Total signings in the quarter were up 17% year-over-year and are up 6% for the trailing 12 months. The increase in quarter 3 was driven by strong renewal, a reflection of both high renewal opportunity as well as a good renewal rate of 86%, confirming the value we provide our customers. Over the past year, we have renewed 8 of our 10 top BPO clients. New business signings have been lower over the past year as we have strengthened our signings criteria, setting the bar higher on price, margin and deal terms. An important measure of our progress this year is services margin. This has been an area of intense focus, and the team delivered a quarter 3 margin of 9.4%, at the high-end of our 8% to 9.5% full year range. This strong performance reflects broad contribution across BPO, a result of both our strategic cost transformation initiatives and increased operating discipline by the team. And as we've said before, Document Outsourcing margin generally is in line with the Document Technology segment margin.
So key takeaways from Services are consistent with what we said in quarter 2. While revenue was a bit soft, Document Outsourcing remains a good performer; and in BPO, we're making steady progress improving profitability. There's been a near-term trade-off between revenue growth and margin. But overall, it has resulted in strong profit growth and will provide a solid foundation for our businesses as we prepare to separate.
Document Technology delivered strong margins in the face of ongoing revenue pressures within a tough market environment. Revenue was down 9% at actual currency and 7% at constant currency, with equipment down 13% and annuity down 5%. Annuity was an improvement from quarter 2 driven by supplies.
Within equipment, trends improved in both entry and high end, reflecting new product introduction, but mid-range lagged due to lower large account sales in the U.S. When we include Document Outsourcing with Document Technology, revenue declined 5% in the third quarter and is down 4% year-to-date. Overall, we continue to maintain our equipment revenue market share leadership.
Turning to activity. We delivered good growth across all color activity segments with particular strength in high end due in part to the recent drupa trade show. Entry results benefited from better performance in developing markets where we've lapped economic weakness in some geographies. Mid-range had a mixed quarter with continued good growth from the i-Series products launched earlier this year but weakness elsewhere.
Document Technology margin of 13.1% was quite strong, up 50 basis points sequentially, reflecting strategic transformation benefit and within the middle of our full year range. Year-over-year, margin was down 80 basis points as gross margin improvements were not enough to offset a higher SAG ratio. The third quarter 2015 results included materially lower compensation and benefits expense, which we did not expect would repeat. Transaction currency in the quarter was a relatively modest 30 basis point headwind to margin and at current rate could be about twice that level in quarter 4.
So overall for Document Technology, we continued to manage the impact of revenue decline through ongoing productivity actions resulting in strong segment margins and cash generation.
And as I wrap up on the segments, I'll repeat what I said last quarter: we will manage our strategic transformation focus, and we expect continued good profitability in both Document Technology and in services as we prepare to separate.
Moving to cash flow. Operating cash generation of $370 million was strong, up $99 million year-over-year, and reflects the underlying cash generative profile of our business model. From a year-over-year perspective, good working capital performance and solid net income more than offset the impact of this year's unique Health Enterprise settlement and separation payment, which were $39 million and $21 million, respectively, in the quarter.
We've generated $522 million of operating cash during the first 3 quarters of the year, with all 2016 Health Enterprise settlement payments now behind us. Therefore, we enter quarter 4, our seasonally strongest cash flow quarter, well positioned to deliver on our guidance of $950 million to $1.2 billion for the full year. Investing cash flows were a use of $69 million and included $73 million spent on CapEx. Cash flow from financing was an $84 million use and includes $85 million for preferred and common stock dividends. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.4 billion and continues to provide us flexibility as we move into quarter 4 and prepare for separation.
Turning to our capital structure and capital allocation. We ended quarter 3 with $7.4 billion, of debt, a level we've been at all year. Applying 7:1 leverage to our customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of the quarter was $3.8 billion, leaving core debt at $3.6 billion. We continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit rating. On October 11, we filed an amendment to the Conduent Form 10 that included details of its anticipated post-separation capital structure. We indicated that Conduent expected to be capitalized with approximately $2.4 billion of debt and $400 million of cash and to transfer $2.05 billion of proceeds to Xerox, which we intend to use to reduce Xerox debt.
Consistent with our expectation, Xerox credit ratings remain investment grade, and we expect that the Conduent capital structure would result in a high noninvestment-grade rating.
And to touch on capital allocation. We've paid $79 million in common stock dividends in quarter 3. We completed a $13 million dealer acquisition earlier this month, consistent with our strategy to expand our U.S. Global Imaging business. And as we've said previously, as we prepare for our separation later this year, we're not planning to repurchase any shares.
Before I move to guidance on the next slide, I want to mention that Conduent will be filing its third quarter results in the next few weeks. The Conduent carve-out financials will reflect margin improvement, although not to the same degree as the Services segment since Conduent results include the student loan business, which resides in our Other segment. That business is in runoff and declined profit year-over-year as anticipated.
I'll now share with you our fourth quarter and full year expectations. For quarter 4, we expect adjusted earnings in the range of $0.32 to $0.35 and GAAP earnings of $0.11 to $0.14. For the full year, we continue to expect total revenues to decline 2% to 4% at constant currency. We're narrowing our adjusted earnings guidance range to $1.11 to $1.14, which incorporates our fourth quarter expectation.
In Services, we expect full year revenue will be flat to down 1% and margin will be at the very high end of the 8% to 9.5% range. We expect Document Technology revenues will be at the lower end of the full year range and that margin will be in line with our 12% to 14% expectation.
We expect full year GAAP earnings of $0.45 to $0.48. We continue to anticipate full year restructuring of about $300 million, including approximately $70 million in the fourth quarter and our estimate of pretax separation costs remains $175 million to $200 million and $40 million to $50 million in tax-related friction costs.
Turning to cash flow. As I mentioned earlier, our year-to-date performance positions us well for the full year and we are maintaining our expectations of $950 million to $1.2 billion for operating cash flow and $600 million to $850 million for free cash flow.
And finally, our capital allocation expectations remain largely unchanged, although we now expect to spend about $30 million to $50 million on acquisition.
So in summary, despite a somewhat challenging macro backdrop, we are on track and remain committed to delivering our overall revenue, earnings and cash flow guidance.
With that, Ursula, I'll turn it back to you."

So the global market environment continues to be challenging. As you mentioned, Shannon, there are uncertainties with currencies fluctuating in the yen and the pound. Certainly, these -- the uncertainty of the presidential election in the U.S., the Brexit adds a certain degree of uncertainty in the U.K. and Europe. But these complexities are obviously what we deal with all the time. And the important thing are the counter measures. So what we're doing is we're very aggressive on the productivity measures to drive down our total delivered costs and enhance the operating margins. As you know, what we've done over the last couple of years has been pretty aggressive on productivity, and we're taking that to the next level. We're very focused on innovation and defending our market share. And we're focused on the growth areas. So specific to this quarter, what I'd say, our revenue was in line and was stable in this challenging market environment. You're correct that we were pressured on the equipment side, and some of that was more in the high-end and government bids due to these uncertainties. But we're also pleased with the annuity business driven by supplies, and we're also pleased on the high end. We saw the impact of drupa, which will benefit us for the next couple of quarters. And then at the end of September, we obviously had Graph Expo in the U.S. and we think that will benefit us. So overall, in line, good color installs and pressure on more the mono side as we're moving more sort of color in the macro environment."

Revenue growth is important in order to demonstrate that the investments are in the right place and we are continuing to provide value to our clients. Margin is an indicator of 2 things for me. One is the value that our clients perceive that we are bringing to the table and are willing to pay for it. And secondly, it's a report card on our -- on management's ability to effectively and efficiently run a business. So both of these are important for the reasons I just described. And I think even though there's a certain degree of elasticity between them, it is important to manage that elasticity in a way that we see growth on both fronts."

So I think what we have seen in terms of the margin improvement is clearly the flow-through of all the strategic transformation activities that we've been doing.

First one, on the transition and inventory and how we're looking at that. We're entering something, I talked about this in my prepared remarks, a phase that we call soft separation. And the reason why that's important for investors is that it's a time that we can essentially practice, do a phased implementation of all of the complex separation activities and make sure that we don't stumble on -- when we're actually independent, including things like the inventory management system. Independent of the soft separation, we would have very little problem with this area. But I think the soft separation makes it such that we can actually double and triple check there. So I wouldn't -- we don't -- we're not managing inventory any differently than we normally would at the end of the year. All we're doing is making sure that as we do a separation, we don't have any fumbles, which we don't expect. As far as costs and the impact -- health care costs, the impact of ACA or any potential changes to ACA on our internal cost and the marketplace, we actually just don't see any. Internal costs, we will manage our internal health care costs in the most efficient way possible. I mean, we are a good health care provider, payer of services for our clients. Our customers haven't changed. And as far as the marketplace out there, we're not really seeing a big set of headwinds or change in the market dynamics because of any potential changes for ACA.
