Our business was stable in Q4 and we delivered solid results as we continue to reposition our business amidst the backdrop of a competitive holiday retail environment. Overall, total GMV and revenue were both",1114,"Thanks, Selim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our business was stable in Q4 and we delivered solid results as we continue to reposition our business amidst the backdrop of a competitive holiday retail environment. 
Overall, total GMV and revenue were both up 5% for the quarter, and we also grew active buyers 5% year-over-year to 162 million. GMV on our marketplace platform grew at 4% year-over-year. And underlying this growth, our B2C business, which is the best analog for other retailers and marketplaces, grew at 8%.
We also saw particular strength in our StubHub and classifieds platforms, which grew revenue at 34% and 15%, respectively. Looking deeper at our marketplace platform, we continue to see an impact on traffic and new user acquisition, along with continued near-term pressure from some of our strategic longer-term initiatives, which curtailed growth in the quarter.
6 months ago, we began a series of platform inventory and policy changes, which we believe are critical to make our business more competitive over the long term. While we're making steady progress on these strategic initiatives, we don't expect to see material benefit from them for some time to come.
With our structured data initiative, we increased the percentage of listings processed to 37% of relevant listings in Q4, up from 28% in the prior quarter, while adding 79 million unique products to our catalog. And we recently announced that the next phase of required product identifiers will go into effect at the end  February. This phase will add more categories and countries to increase coverage to approximately 60% of relevant listings on our platform.
Historically, as a listings based marketplace, providing users with features such as product reviews and pricing data was extremely challenging. As we have begun converting more of the site to structured data, we're starting to leverage these features and are seeing good results. 
In Q4, our users waited nearly 1 million product reviews, up twentyfold from the prior quarters. Over time, this is the type of user generated content that will help us to improve discoverability and conversion. We're also starting to use our data to enable price trending and comparisons, as well as better merchandising capabilities. Early results show we're picking up conversion rate improvements, which is a clear signal that we're on the right track here. You can see some of these examples in the slides accompanying my commentary. 
Another key area of focus for us is mobile. While reviews of the mobile experience we launch and September have significantly improved, it's not yet delivering results on par with the prior version. We're aggressively iterating it to enhance the user experience and to drive adoption and usage. And our new platform is enabling us to get new releases in front of our users more rapidly and efficiently than we have in the past. Despite those challenges, we still grew mobile GMV 21% on a year-over-year basis.
Finally, we continue to make progress in other areas, such as social and promoted listings. Our social traffic continues to grow at strong double-digits, driven by our presence now across 4 -- 14 key channels. And with promoted listings we opened the service to all store subscribers, and we expanded placements in committing you categories in Q4.
As I've discussed previously, we believe StubHub and Classifieds are important complements to eBay. And we continue to see strong overlap across each user base. Over the past 6 months, many of you have indicated that they would like to better understand the scale of these platforms relative to our marketplace platforms. In an effort to increase transparency and disclosure across our portfolio, we will disclose volume and revenue for StubHub and revenue for Classifieds moving forward, which mirrors how we manage them internally.
Our StubHub platform continues to be a strong partner to sports leagues, teams and artists. We saw significant growth acceleration in the quarter driven by the product changes we made in August and aided by a strong sports landscape and high demand for concert tickets.
And our Classifieds platform saw a particular strength on eBay in Germany, along with Gumtree in the U.K, resulting in accelerating year-over-year growth. We also continue to grow our U.S. Classifieds presence via our Close5 mobile app, where total downloads approached 6 million, more than doubling where we end at Q3.
Now I want to step back and put Q4 in the context of our first 6 months post separation from PayPal. 6 months ago, we indicated that our key strategic priorities were to create a robust commerce platform, a vibrant marketplace and enhanced product and brand experiences and reposition our business to better compete over the long term. We also set expectations and executing on the strategy will take time and that we prioritize repositioning our business over near-term growth opportunities.
Lastly, during this period of time, we said we'd be disciplined with our investments while returning capital to shareholders. Over the past 6 months, we've made progress against our key priorities while delivering on the higher end of the growth expectations that we indicated. And the investments we're making have been largely paid for by the restructuring we undertook in the first quarter of last year.
Additionally, we've shed nonstrategic assets while returning over $1.1 billion in capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. In short, we're on plan, and we will continue to execute on the strategy as we head into 2016.
Looking forward, we believe we can create a customer experience and a brand message that will sharpen the focus on what is unique about eBay. This year, I will be focused on stepping up our efforts to drive the best choice, the most relevant and a powerful selling platform, in addition to further clarifying what our brand stands for. 
Having made many foundational investments, we expect to deliver significantly improved experiences for buyers and sellers across multiple dimensions of this year. We'll do this by improving discoverability both on and off our site. We'll give buyers more choice, but also more data to facilitate better comparisons. And we'll provide sellers with more effective tools, better service and fairer policies to enhance their eBay businesses, incenting them to provide their best inventory and competitive prices on our platform.
Finally, we intend to innovate and improve upon our C2C experience to reaccelerate our sell-to-buy flywheel. In summary, we exit the year on plan and executing on the strategy and the financial framework we laid out 6 months ago. We're looking forward to a year of significant progress. 
Now let me turn it over to Scott to provide more details on our fourth quarter and full year results and 2016 guidance."
27862,321623495,921792,"eBay Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Devin. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 12. Our business was stable in Q4 as we made progress against our key objectives. We generated $2.3 billion of total revenue, $0.50 of non-GAAP EPS, $1 billio",2072,"Thanks, Devin. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 12. Our business was stable in Q4 as we made progress against our key objectives. We generated $2.3 billion of total revenue, $0.50 of non-GAAP EPS, $1 billion in free cash flow and we repurchased $550 million of our stock.
On Slide 13, let's start at the top of the funnel with Q4 active buyers. In the quarter, we added 3 million new buyers, increasing the total active buyer base to 162 million, trailing 12-month growth rate was stable at 5% in Q4.
Turning to Slide 14. In Q4, we enabled 22 million of GMV, growing 5% versus last year. By geography, the U.S. generated 9 billion of GMV, up 4%. While international delivered 13 billion of GMV, up 6%. I'll discuss these results in more detail later. Sold items grew 4% in Q4, a 3-point deceleration versus prior quarter. Sold item growth continues to be influenced by our product, geographic and seller mix. In Q4, we saw an increase in the mix of higher ASV electronic sold during the holiday.
Moving to Slide 15. We delivered net revenues of $2.3 billion, up 5% versus last year, growing at the same rate as GMV. We continue to expense currency headwinds in translation, negatively impacting growth by 5 points and resulting in Q4 revenue, which was flat year-over-year on an as-reported basis. We generated $1.8 billion of transaction revenue, up 3% versus last year, and $500 million of marketing services revenue, up 12% versus last year. On the next 3 slides, I'll take you through a bit more detail on our market place, StubHub and Classifieds platforms.
Let's start with the marketplace platform on Slide 16. This platform is one of the world's largest online marketplaces with extensive product inventory that combines unique and interesting items with great deals and what shoppers want and love. We build connections between buyers and sellers across the world with product experience that are fast, mobile, secure and backed eBay money back guarantee. Our flagship brand, eBay.com, has localized site in Germany, U.K. and Australia, amongst others. We operate other brands as well, Such as IEC and G Market in Korea and getting giddy in Turkey. 
Over the years, our marketplace has shifted from used goods and auctions to new goods in fixed price. In Q4, 80% of the sold items were new and 85% of GMV was fixed price. Additionally, 63% of orders shipped for free and 60% of orders were delivered in 3 days or less.
Turning to Q4 results. Marketplace GMV grew 4% year-over-year, decelerating 1 point versus Q3. This performance reflects the ongoing challenges of SEO, the impact of the new mobile experience launched in Q3 and continued pressure on our C2C business. Total revenue for the marketplace platform grew 1%, 2 points lower than the prior quarter. This deceleration was primarily driven by transaction revenue, which was flat year-over-year and 2 points lower versus Q3.
Transaction revenue was impacted by volume, in addition to seller and category mix, which showed an overall lower take rate. We also saw modestly increase revenue spent on coupons and seller insensitive, shifting marketing spend away from operating expense. Marketing services revenue grew 9%, accelerating 3 points over Q3. This revenue stream is comprised of advertising our vehicle's vertical and the PayPal operating agreement, amongst others. As a reminder, the PayPal operating agreement with an ambition to the MSNL revenue starting in Q3 and then contributed to the Q4 acceleration in growth.
Moving to Slide 17. Our StubHub platform is the largest ticket market place in the U.S. We enable fans to buy and sell tens of thousands of tickets daily for sports, concerts, performing arts and other events. Throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom and Germany, StubHub provides a special place to get experience custom-built for fans. StubHub is our tickets vertical experience, much like fashion or electronics that you can find on our marketplace platform. 
We continue to see strong overlap between the marketplace and StubHub visitor bases. We encourage all of our customers to use StubHub and their tickets marketplace to take advantage of the tailor-made experience for fans and the security offered by StubHub's fan protect guarantee, assuring fans that they will make it to their event or we will make it right.
StubHub ended the year on a high note, delivering Q4 GMV growth of 30%, up 20 points versus Q3. Q4 revenue grew 34%, accelerating 17 points versus Q3. StubHub's standout performance was driven by a full quarter of product improvements launched in August, including pricing display changes and our updated mobile app, plus strength in both sports and concerts in Q4. Q4 capped off a strong finish to 2015. For the full year, StubHub generated $3.6 billion of GMV and $725 million in revenue, up 15% versus prior year.
Now turning to Classifieds on Slide 18. We operate 12 brands in our Classifieds portfolio with the presence in 17 countries. eBay is the Classifieds leader in 10 markets and attracts approximately 250 million unique monthly visitors. Some of our well-known brands include some tree, Kijiji and eBay Classifieds, to name a few. Classifieds provide eBay another way to serve the online C2C market, which often represents the same customer with items better suited to a local transaction.
We intend to continue investing in our growth markets mobile only experience and strong local presence. Turning to Q4 results. Classifieds delivered another strong quarter of growth, up 15% year-over-year, accelerating 1 point versus Q3. The strong performance in Q4 was driven by our developed markets, most notably, eBay in Germany and Gumtree in the U.K. Q4 contributed to a strong performance by Classifieds in 2015, generating over $700 million in revenue for the full year, growing 15% versus prior year.
Now moving to expenses on Slide 19. I'd like to take a moment to touch on the impact of foreign exchange in our expense lines. While nearly 60% of our revenue is international, our cost base is weighted to the U.S. dollar. As a result, when the U.S. dollar strengthens, we experienced some loss of leverage on a percent of revenue basis costing us 80 point, basis points in Q4. We will continue to feel the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar for some time to come. And with this in mind, I will focus of the rest of my expense commentary on operation and drivers.
Cost of revenue increased 220 basis points year-over-year with the primary driver being the addition of PayPal processing cost. In Q4, we also increased investment in structured data and security efforts. And looking at operating expense, as we've mentioned in the prior 2 quarters, we undertook a reduction in workforce in Q1, which continues to drive year-over-year leverage across each expense line item.
Outside of that, let me touch on some additional operating expense drivers. Q4 sales and marketing expense is down 120 basis points year-over-year. This is primarily driven by the shift from marketing expense to contract revenue that I mentioned earlier in addition to lapping last year's significant brand spend. Product development is relatively flat year-over-year on a percent of revenue basis, as we reinvest operational leverage and do initiatives such as structured data. G&A increased 110 basis points year-over-year with standup cost more than offsetting the benefit from the reduction in workforce. We will see a similar year-over-year impact of standup cost and G&A during the first half of 2016.
Moving to Slide 20. In Q4, we delivered $0.50 in non-GAAP EPS, down 10% year-over-year, as revenue growth, operating leverage and the impact of share repurchases were more than offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, a higher tax rate and standup cost. The impact of the strong U.S. dollar alone cost us 7 points of EPS growth.
Turning to free cash flow. Our ability to generate strong cash flow based on our low capital intensity and profitable business model continues. In Q4, we generated free cash flow of $1 billion, bringing the full year to $2.2 billion. In Q4, CapEx was 6% of revenue, 6 points lower than prior quarter, as separation-related spending them down and the timing of some of our plan spend pushed into 2016.
For the full year, CapEx was 8% of revenue. Moving to slide 22. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $8.5 billion, including $1.5 billion in the U.S. As a reminder, our capital allocation policy is designed to manage in the capital structure in a way that optimizes our financial flexibility, access to debt and our cost of capital to drive long-term shareholder value.
In Q4, we repurchased 19.9 million shares at an average price of $27.62 a share. This brings our total repurchases in the second half of 2015 to over $1.1 billion or just under 42 million shares. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. We continue to be disciplined in how we manage our investments. And in Q4, we closed the divestiture of eBay Enterprise and received cash proceeds of $925 million.
In 2015, we repaid $850 million of debt that matured. As a reminder, we have an average investment grade credit rating of BBB+, which allows the growth said to EBITDA ratio of up to approximately 3.5x, providing us the capacity to take an additional $3 billion to $4 billion of debt. As we look at our capital structure in 2016, we may seek additional outside financing to replace 2016 maturities and to provide additional financial flexibility.
I'd like to take a moment to share how we're thinking about capital allocation for 2016. Subject to market conditions, we expect to continue buying our own shares throughout 2016 at or above the rate of our second half 2015 repurchases. This would be in addition to offsetting dilution. To this end, we have incorporated share repurchases into our 2016 guidance, which I will cover shortly. And consistent with what we said before, we will continue to be an acquisitive, disciplinary approach and seeking the best opportunities to create long-term value.
Moving to full year guidance on Slide 23. We are projecting 2016 revenue between $8.5 billion and $8.8 billion, growing 2% to 5% versus last year. Our projected growth is in line with what we discussed previously and relatively stable with 2015, as we continue to execute our long-term strategic initiatives in the phase of near-term headwinds. On an as-reported basis, growth ranges from a 1% decline to a 2% increase as foreign exchange negatively impacts growth by 3 points.
We expect operating margin of 31% to 33% for the year. As compared to 2015, we are losing roughly 1 point of margin due to the impact of foreign exchange and 50 basis points due to a full year of separation cost. Despite these factors, our margins is in line with expectations set ladies and gentlemen, and we are utilizing leverage in cost savings to fund our investments. We are projecting non-GAAP EPS of $1.82 to $1.97 [ph] per share, down 1% year-over-year at the low end of the range and up 2% at the high end. The impact of the stronger U.S. dollar cost us roughly 5 points of EPS growth.
Finally, we expect non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19.5% to 20.5%, CapEx of 79% of revenue and free cash flow of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. Moving to Q1 guidance on Slide 24. 
For Q1, we are projecting revenue between $2.05 billion and $2.1 billion, growing 3% to 5% versus last year. We expect to non-GAAP EPS of $0.43 to $0.45 a share, representing a decline of 6% to 10%. The decline is due to a stronger U.S. dollar and impact of the synergies, which cost us 10 points of EPS year-over-year. This impact will be more pronounced in the first half of 2016.
In closing, we end the year with financial commitment on plan, a year, a clear and disciplined approach to capital allocation and executing on our strategy. In the upcoming year, we will increase our efforts to drive the best choice, the most relevant and a powerful selling platform while driving increased clarity on what our brand stands for it. And we remain focused on positioning eBay for long-term success.

I would say that there are 2 things to note. The first is that the strong dollar, as Scott pointed out, obviously, has a translation effect, but any has an operating effect. We have a strong cross-border business. The continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar has really impact of the exports of U.S. goods, which was one of our biggest export corridors. So the strong dollar is both a translation impact than it certainly, underlying an operating impact. And our trade close are not purely balanced. So it's helped our China business somewhat paradoxically in some of our import corridors, making those goods seem cheap, but it doesn't net out to 0. In fact, it's been quite a significant headwind starting last year when the dollar started to strengthen. Vis-à-vis, just the overall macroeconomic situation, I guess what I would say is right now, we don't -- we're watching it very carefully. It's hard not to watch it, given what we've seen out of both earnings and out of the market. I would say that in the fourth quarter, we were very happy with the holiday. We had a very strong cyber 5. And we started to see some small signs of softening in December. We're not assuming any significant change in the macro economic environment, but it's obviously, we -- every company is watching it very, very carefully. So I'd say right now, FX is a much bigger operating impact than overall market softening. We don't have very much of the domestic China business, for instance. But we're certainly watching that carefully as I think every company is right now."

As it relates to our hedging strategy, as I've discussed previously, we're unable to hedge revenue in the [indiscernible]. As such, our top line is heavily exposed to currency fluctuations. But as I explained back in Q2 and a bit in Q3, we do utilize now different to economically protect net income. And that program is designed to protect as much net commence we can. And the intent is to have minimal variation versus guidance pre EPS due to foreign exchange. But that doesn't eliminate the effect of FX on a year-over-year basis, particularly for revenues, as I called out. And as rates change, we feel the effect of that FX when comparing year-over-year."

And that's implicit in this guidance. I think we'll see growth in marketing services, but it's a relatively small part of the portfolio compared to transaction revenue. And I would expect to continue to see reasonable growth from the components. But it's not -- there's no major mix shift going on in 2016. I think you should assume that it will follow the path in terms of the components that have followed in 2015, roughly. Second part of the question, sorry? Listings restructuring, yes. Sorry, Mark. Look, I -- this is a major effort and with a data-driven business. So we don't do anything without measuring it and ensuring that we're on the right path. And this is consistent with what we've been saying, which is where we are organizing data, adding content to it, where we are exposing it in a new way. We're seeing better traffic. We're seeing better conversion. It's just very small today in our echo system and it will take time. But we all believe we're on the right path. And I think we measure, just to be clear, in data from the top of the funnel to the bottom, we measure in coming users, new and existing. We measure their conversion through the mid-points of the funnel. And we measure ultimately their conversion to a transaction. And all of that we watch literally on a daily basis. So if you think about the scale of what we've done, it's still very foundational. We've made a lot of progress on the foundation. But its manifestation through the pages that you're seeing in the accompanying slides is really small. But where we've done that, we're seeing better results. That's why we really believe that as this scales and moves out, we're going to drive leverage across the business."

And ultimately, does that traffic convert to active buyers? And we like what we see so far. We believe we are on the right path. And it's intuitive.

I just come back to this is exactly what's happening with our business is remarkably like what we said over the summer and 6 months ago, which was we're going to focus our strategy. We're going to move away from commodity towards what's unique about eBay. We're going to make catch-up investments that probably historically should have been made before not in order to better compete over the long run, and we're going to hold -- we're going to try to hold our growth to mid to -- to low to mid single-digits while keeping our margin and cash flow high and returning capital to shareholders. All three things -- 3 of those things are still true. And the reality is that, as we've said, many of these investments are not quick investments. We are re-platforming eBay. 60% of coverage of listings is the first part of the equation, not the end of the question. If that's of the raw material and the foundation to allow us to build product expenses and it's of those product expenses exchange traffic and conversion. So I would say that right now, and we watch it carefully. I don't assume that the world will continue exactly the way you that it is. We watch everything very carefully. But right now, the plan that we laid out very quickly, I think, 6 months ago, we believe it's working and we believe we're on that plan.

As I said in my remarks, I'm really excited about this year because I do believe that would some of these foundational investments in place. You're going to see the product evolve relatively quickly for buyers and sellers. So the products never, it's never static, it's always evolving. But I think this will be  year's of particular innovation for us. We have a very exciting pipeline. Based on all the things that we've been talking about, based on our ability to now understand product and persistence, we believe we can generate a really differentiated experience that shows our customers what's unique about eBay. It doesn't talk about it, but chose to them. So I do think this will be year of rapid innovation in the product experience. Second is sales and marketing. There's no -- a couple of things. First is we are going to start almost immediately pivoting some of our spend up to the funnel to what we would call a more traditional brand spend. That doesn't mean television. It just means instead of selling you an iPhone or a sweater, we're going to talk more about eBay and the brand. Whether or not we ultimately spend more in that will depend on what we learned from doing that. We do believe that brand is more important, that we have more shortly defined our brand in an increasingly crowded environment. And you'll see us start to do that. There are no plans to significantly change our spend. But how we spent will begin to change. And in fact, that already is changing. Final comment is on contra. There's no -- we are very disciplined about concert revenue. I would say that we spend a bit more on that versus a little less on marketing in the fourth quarter because holidays become very deals driven. And this holiday, we participated in deals aggressively across electronics, fashion, home and garden. And we got good results. But that does cost some mix shift in spending more in contract. I would expect those numbers to go back to historical averages. There's no break from trend other than we plus up in the fourth quarter because that's the way shoppers are shopping."

I think what you could expect in product development is a continued pace of investment in line with the percentages of revenue that we've shown over the last, let's call it, 12 to 18 months, but certainly, the last 6. In sales and marketing, I would call out to the pacing and refer back to the earlier response around contra. In some quarters, we may decide based on the returns that we think we can get or the strategy that we're deploying on marketing, that some more marketing ends up in out of the expense line and into contra in other countries that may be the opposite. But I think within the range is that we talked about last year, I would expect that to be not larger to Devin's point that what we're seeing so far."

Just to note, I've said this before but I think its important. We have playbook on Contra. And we try not to deviate from it, which is we spent on acquiring customers when it makes sense to spend on acquiring customers. I'm not sure all companies in this environment play that same playbook. But we could -- have but another point or 2 of growth. Just don't do that because we don't think it creates value over the long term. So for us, Contra is one of the weapons we deployed, but we do it carefully. Because it's easy to show growth, but it's not easy to create value, and those are 2 different things. On marketing efficiency, there's couple of puts and takes. So every year, we try to pick up marketing efficiency. I target my marketing teams with significant basis point improvement in efficiency of the way we spend our significant marketing expenditure. Our most efficient marketing spend on an ROI basis paid was paid search. But that we don't believe over the long run, we can be tied only to paid search. So we are spending into less efficient channels to build new channels in the future. And I point to social is a great example. We're on 14 channels. None of them today is as efficient as paid search, but it's diversifying our traffic mix, and were making to making it more efficient over time. We think it's the right thing to do even though it's making us less efficient in the short term as a mixed effects. The other thing I'd say is we watch of the competitive landscape really carefully. It's really important that we maintain eBay's share of voice. And in the last couple of years, it hasn't gotten less competitive, it's gotten more. So while we pick up some gains in efficiencies, I don't see a lot of leverage coming from marketing. I suspect we'll want to spend more over time as our product experience improves, and we want to bring more and more people to a better eBay experience. So those are some of the puts and takes and that being I don't expect in '16 to see a lot of leverage on the marketing line."

Our guidance includes the fact that we expect to be buying back about at the same rate as the last 2 quarters each quarter. And we expect to also be buying back the dilution offset. And so it's maybe in the range of what you're talking about. We have a $1.8 billion remaining in our existing authorization. There's nothing precluding us from asking for more. Look, we have a limitation in the first 2 years to protect the tax-free nature of the spin of about 20%, little bit less than 20% in that range. And that would be our guardrail for the first 2 years."

It's much more choppy than  eBay just because it sort of depends what the matchup is and the Super Bowl and what the event land scape is and it was a very strong events landscape.

But Q-over-Q basis and in the growth perspective, it didn't have a material impact this quarter. Last quarter, we called out, it helped a bit. This quarter, didn't necessarily accelerate further. The way I could think about active buyer growth is, it's been massively impacted by 2 things over the last 2 years. One was faster, I think that's largely behind us. And I think the others SEO. SEO as explained in many different forums, has a over indexing impact on acquiring new users. And thus, as the press of the top of our funnel and reduce our overall active buyer growth over the last couple of years. And that's why the structured data and SEO initiative is so important because it'll work only back up on that metric. Unsold items, sold items -- of the change in this quarter was just driven primarily on a higher mix of the child sold during the holiday. This tends to go up and down depending on everything from country and seller mix to hot items. So it's relatively difficult to predict and correlate.

Our business was stable in Q4 and we delivered solid results as we continue to reposition our business amidst the backdrop of a competitive holiday retail environment. Overall, total GMV and revenue were both",1113,"Thanks, Selim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our business was stable in Q4 and we delivered solid results as we continue to reposition our business amidst the backdrop of a competitive holiday retail environment. 
Overall, total GMV and revenue were both up 5% for the quarter, and we also grew active buyers 5% year-over-year to 162 million. GMV on our marketplace platform grew at 4% year-over-year. And underlying this growth, our B2C business, which is the best analog for other retailers and marketplaces, grew at 8%.
We also saw particular strength in our StubHub and classifieds platforms, which grew revenue at 34% and 15%, respectively. Looking deeper at our marketplace platform, we continue to see an impact on traffic and new user acquisition, along with continued near-term pressure from some of our strategic longer-term initiatives, which curtailed growth in the quarter.
6 months ago, we began a series of platform inventory and policy changes, which we believe are critical to make our business more competitive over the long term. While we're making steady progress on these strategic initiatives, we don't expect to see material benefit from them for some time to come.
With our structured data initiative, we increased the percentage of listings processed to 37% of relevant listings in Q4, up from 28% in the prior quarter, while adding 79 million unique products to our catalog. And we recently announced that the next phase of required product identifiers would go into effect at the end of February. This phase will add more categories and countries to increase coverage to approximately 60% of relevant listings on our platform.
Historically, as a listings based marketplace, providing users with features such as product reviews and pricing data was extremely challenging. As we have begun converting more of the site to structured data, we're starting to leverage these features and are seeing good results. 
In Q4, our users created nearly 1 million product reviews, up twentyfolds from the prior quarters. Over time, this is the type of user generated content that will help us to improve discoverability and conversion. We're also starting to use our data to enable price trending and comparisons as well as better merchandising capabilities. Early results show we're picking up conversion rate improvements, which is a clear signal that we're on the right track here. You can see some of these examples in the slides accompanying my commentary. 
Another key area of focus for us is mobile. While reviews of the mobile experience we launched in September have significantly improved, it's not yet delivering results on par with the prior version. We're aggressively iterating it to enhance the user experience and to drive adoption and usage. And our new platform is enabling us to get new releases in front of our users more rapidly and efficiently than we have in the past. Despite those challenges, we still grew mobile GMV 21% on a year-over-year basis.
Finally, we continue to make progress in other areas, such as social and promoted listings. Our social traffic continues to grow at strong double-digits, driven by our presence now across 4 -- 14 key channels. And with promoted listings we opened the service to all store subscribers, and we expanded placements and committing new categories in Q4.
As I've discussed previously, we believe StubHub and Classifieds are important complements to eBay. And we continue to see strong overlap across each user base. Over the past 6 months, many of you have indicated that you would like to better understand the scale of these platforms relative to our marketplace platform. In an effort to increase transparency and disclosure across our portfolio, we will disclose volume and revenue for StubHub and revenue for Classifieds moving forward, which mirrors how we manage them internally.
Our StubHub platform continues to be a strong partner to sports leagues, teams and artists. We saw significant growth acceleration in the quarter driven by the product changes we made in August and aided by a strong sports landscape and high demand for concert tickets.
And our Classifieds platform saw particular strength on eBay Kleinanzeigen, in Germany, along with Gumtree in the U.K, resulting in accelerating year-over-year growth. We also continue to grow our U.S. Classifieds presence via our Close5 mobile app, where total downloads approached 6 million, more than doubling where we ended Q3.
Now I want to step back and put Q4 in the context of our first 6 months post separation from PayPal. 6 months ago, we indicated that our key strategic priorities were to create a robust commerce platform, a vibrant marketplace and enhanced product and brand experiences and reposition our business to better compete over the long term. We also set expectations at executing on this strategy would take time and that we prioritize repositioning our business over near-term growth opportunities.
Lastly, during this period of time, we said we'd be disciplined with our investments while returning capital to shareholders. Over the past 6 months, we've made progress against our key priorities while delivering on the higher end of the growth expectations that we indicated. And the investments we're making have been largely paid for by the restructuring we undertook in the first quarter of last year.
Additionally, we've shed nonstrategic assets while returning over $1.1 billion in capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. In short, we're on plan, and we will continue to execute on the strategy as we head into 2016.
Looking forward, we believe we can create a customer experience and a brand message that will sharpen the focus on what is unique about eBay. This year, I will be focused on stepping up our efforts to drive the best choice, the most relevant and a powerful selling platform, in addition to further clarifying what our brand stands for. 
Having made many foundational investments, we expect to deliver significantly improved experiences for buyers and sellers across multiple dimensions this year. We'll do this by improving discoverability both on and off our site. We'll give buyers more choice, but also more data to facilitate better comparisons. And we'll provide sellers with more effective tools, better service and fairer policies to enhance their eBay businesses, incenting them to provide their best inventory and competitive prices on our platform.
Finally, we intend to innovate and improve upon our C2C experience to reaccelerate our sell-to-buy flywheel. In summary, we exit the year on plan and executing on the strategy and the financial framework we laid out 6 months ago. We're looking forward to a year of significant progress. 
Now let me turn it over to, Scott, to provide more details on our fourth quarter and full year results and 2016 guidance."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 12. Our business was stable in Q4 as we made progress against our key objectives. We generated $2.3 billion of total revenue, $0.50 of non-GAAP EPS, $1 billio",2060,"Thanks, Devin. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 12. Our business was stable in Q4 as we made progress against our key objectives. We generated $2.3 billion of total revenue, $0.50 of non-GAAP EPS, $1 billion in free cash flow and we repurchased $550 million of our stock.
On Slide 13, let's start at the top of the funnel with Q4 active buyers. In the quarter, we added 3 million new buyers, increasing the total active buyer base to 162 million, trailing 12-month growth rate was stable at 5% in Q4.
Turning to Slide 14. In Q4, we enabled 22 billion of GMV, growing 5% versus last year. By geography, the U.S. generated 9 billion of GMV, up 4%. While international delivered 13 billion of GMV, up 6%. I'll discuss these results in more detail later. Sold items grew 4% in Q4, a 3-point deceleration versus prior quarter. Sold item growth continues to be influenced by our product, geographic and seller mix. In Q4, we saw an increase in the mix of higher ASV electronic sold during the holiday.
Moving to Slide 15. We delivered net revenues of $2.3 billion, up 5% versus last year, growing at the same rate as GMV. We continue to experience currency headwinds in translation, negatively impacting growth by 5 points and resulting in Q4 revenue, which was flat year-over-year on an as-reported basis. We generated $1.8 billion of transaction revenue, up 3% versus last year, and $500 million of marketing services revenue, up 12% versus last year. On the next 3 slides, I'll take you through a bit more detail on our market place, StubHub and Classifieds platforms.
Let's start with the marketplace platform on Slide 16. This platform is one of the world's largest online marketplaces with extensive product inventory that combines unique and interesting items with great deals and what shoppers want and love. We build connections between buyers and sellers across the world with product experience that are fast, mobile, secure and backed by eBay money back guarantee. Our flagship brand, eBay.com, has localized sites in Germany, U.K. and Australia, amongst others. We operate other brands as well, Such as IAC and Gmarket in Korea and GittiGidiyor in Turkey. 
Over the years, our marketplace has shifted from used goods and auctions to new goods in fixed price. In Q4, 80% of the sold items were new and 85% of GMV was fixed price. Additionally, 63% of orders shipped for free and 60% of orders were delivered in 3 days or less.
Turning to Q4 results. Marketplace GMV grew 4% year-over-year, decelerating 1 point versus Q3. This performance reflects the ongoing challenges of SEO, the impact of the new mobile experience launched in Q3 and continued pressure on our C2C business. Total revenue for the marketplace platform grew 1%, 2 points lower than the prior quarter. This deceleration was primarily driven by transaction revenue, which was flat year-over-year and 2 points lower versus Q3.
Transaction revenue was impacted by volume, in addition to seller and category mix, which showed an overall lower take rate. We also modestly increased contra revenue spend on coupons and seller incentives, shifting marketing spend away from operating expense. Marketing services revenue grew 9%, accelerating 3 points over Q3. This revenue stream is comprised of advertising our vehicle's vertical and the PayPal operating agreement, amongst others. As a reminder, the PayPal operating agreement was an addition to the MFNL revenue starting in Q3 and then contributed to the Q4 acceleration in growth.
Moving to Slide 17. Our StubHub platform is the largest ticket market place in the U.S. We enable fans to buy and sell tens of thousands of tickets daily for sports, concerts, performing arts and other events. Throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany, StubHub provides a specialized experience custom-built for fans. StubHub is our tickets vertical experience, much like fashion or electronics that you can find on our marketplace platform. 
We continue to see strong overlap between the marketplace and StubHub visitor bases. We encourage all of our customers to use StubHub as their tickets marketplace to take advantage of the tailor-made experience for fans and the security offered by StubHub's fan protect guarantee, assuring fans that they will make it to their event or we will make it right.
StubHub ended the year on a high note, delivering Q4 GMV growth of 30%, up 20 points versus Q3. Q4 revenue grew 34%, accelerating 17 points versus Q3. StubHub's standout performance was driven by a full quarter of product improvements launched in August, including pricing display changes and our updated mobile app, plus strength in both sports and concerts in Q4. Q4 capped off a strong finish to 2015. For the full year, StubHub generated $3.6 billion of GMV and $725 million in revenue, up 15% versus prior year.
Now turning to Classifieds on Slide 18. We operate 12 brands in our Classifieds portfolio with the presence in 17 countries. eBay is the Classifieds leader in 10 markets and attracts approximately 250 million unique monthly visitors. Some of our well-known brands include Gumtree, Kijiji and eBay Classifieds, to name a few. Classifieds provide eBay another way to serve the online C2C market, which often represents the same customer with items better suited to a local transaction.
We intend to continue investing in our growth markets mobile-only experience and strong local presence. Turning to Q4 results. Classifieds delivered another strong quarter of growth, up 15% year-over-year, accelerating 1 point versus Q3. The strong performance in Q4 was driven by our developed markets, most notably, eBay Kleinanzeigen, in Germany and Gumtree in the U.K. Q4 contributed to a strong performance by Classifieds in 2015, generating over $700 million in revenue for the full year, growing 15% versus prior year.
Now moving to expenses on Slide 19. I'd like to take a moment to touch on the impact of foreign exchange on our expense lines. While nearly 60% of our revenue is international, our cost base is weighted to the U.S. dollar. As a result, when U.S. dollar strengthens, we experience some loss of leverage on a percent of revenue basis costing us 80 point, basis points in Q4. We will continue to feel the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar for some time to come. And with this in mind, I will focus the rest of my expense commentary on operational drivers.
Cost of revenue increased 220 basis points year-over-year with the primary driver being the addition of PayPal processing cost. In Q4, we also increased investment in structured data and security efforts. And looking at operating expense, as we've mentioned in the prior 2 quarters, we undertook a reduction in workforce in Q1, which continues to drive year-over-year leverage across each expense line item.
Outside of that, let me touch on some additional operating expense drivers. Q4 sales and marketing expense is down 120 basis points year-over-year. This is primarily driven by the shift from marketing expense to contra revenue that I mentioned earlier in addition to lapping last year's significant brand spend. Product development is relatively flat year-over-year on a percent of revenue basis, as we reinvest operational leverage and do initiatives such as structured data. G&A increased 110 basis points year-over-year with standup cost more than offsetting the benefit from the reduction in workforce. We will see a similar year-over-year impact of standup cost and G&A during the first half of 2016.
Moving to Slide 20. In Q4, we delivered $0.50 in non-GAAP EPS, down 10% year-over-year, as revenue growth, operating leverage and the impact of share repurchases were more than offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, a higher tax rate and standup cost. The impact of the strong U.S. dollar alone cost us 7 points of EPS growth.
Turning to free cash flow. Our ability to generate strong cash flow based on our low capital intensity and profitable business model continues. In Q4, we generated free cash flow of $1 billion, bringing the full year to $2.2 billion. In Q4, CapEx was 6% of revenue, 6 points lower than prior quarter as separation-related spending ramp down and the timing of some of our planned spend pushed into 2016.
For the full year, CapEx was 8% of revenue. Moving to slide 22. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $8.5 billion, including $1.5 billion in the U.S. As a reminder, our capital allocation policy is designed to manage the capital structure in a way that optimizes our financial flexibility, access to debt and our cost of capital to drive long-term shareholder value.
In Q4, we repurchased 19.9 million shares at an average price of $27.62 a share. This brings our total repurchases in the second half of 2015 to over $1.1 billion or just under 42 million shares. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. We continue to be disciplined in how we manage our investments. And in Q4, we closed the divestiture of eBay Enterprise and received cash proceeds of $925 million.
In 2015, we repaid $850 million of debt that matured. As a reminder, we have an average investment credit rating of BBB+, which allows a gross debt to EBITDA ratio of up to approximately 3.5x, providing us the capacity to take an additional $3 billion to $4 billion of debt. As we look at our capital structure in 2016, we may seek additional outside financing to replace 2016 maturity and to provide additional financial flexibility.
I'd like to take a moment to share how we're thinking about capital allocation for 2016. Subject to market conditions, we expect to continue buying our own shares throughout 2016 at or above the rate of our second half 2015 repurchases. This would be in addition to offsetting dilution. To this end, we have incorporated share repurchases into our 2016 guidance, which I will cover shortly. And consistent with what we said before, we will continue to be an acquisitive company, disciplinary approach and seeking the best opportunities to create long-term value.
Moving to full year guidance on Slide 23. We are projecting 2016 revenue between $8.5 billion and $8.8 billion, growing 2% to 5% versus last year. Our projected growth is in line with what we discussed previously and relatively stable with 2015, as we continue to execute our long-term strategic initiatives in the phase of near-term headwinds. On an as-reported basis, growth ranges from a 1% decline to a 2% increase as foreign exchange negatively impacts growth by 3 points.
We expect operating margin of 31% to 33% for the year. As compared to 2015, we are losing roughly 1 point of margin due to the impact of foreign exchange and 50 basis points due to a full year of separation cost. Despite these factors, our margin is in line with expectations set last June, and we are utilizing leverage in cost savings to fund our investments. We are projecting non-GAAP EPS of $1.82 to $1.87 per share, down 1% year-over-year at the low end of the range and up 2% at the high end. The impact of the stronger U.S. dollar costs us roughly 5 points of EPS growth.
Finally, we expect non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19.5% to 20.5%, CapEx of 7% to 9% of revenue and free cash flow of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. Moving to Q1 guidance on Slide 24. 
For Q1, we are projecting revenue between $2.05 billion and $2.1 billion, growing 3% to 5% versus last year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.43 to $0.45 a share, representing a decline of 6% to 10%. The decline is due to the stronger U.S. dollar and impact of the synergies, which cost us 10 points of EPS year-over-year. This impact will be more pronounced in the first half of 2016.
In closing, we end the year with financial commitments on plan, a year, a clear and disciplined approach to capital allocation and executing on our strategy. In the upcoming year, we will increase our efforts to drive the best choice, the most relevant and a powerful selling platform while driving increased clarity on what our brand stands for. And we'll remain focused on positioning eBay for long-term success.

I would say that there are 2 things to note. The first is that the strong dollar, as Scott pointed out, obviously, has a translation effect, but it equally has an operating effect. We have a strong cross-border business. The continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar has really impacted the exports of U.S. goods, which was one of our biggest export corridors. So the strong dollar is both a translation impact and it certainly, underlying not an operating impact. And our trade flows are not purely balanced. So it has helped our China business somewhat paradoxically in some of our import corridors, making those goods seem cheap, but it doesn't net out to 0. In fact, it's been quite a significant headwind starting last year when the dollar started to strengthen. Vis-à-vis, just the overall macroeconomic situation, I guess what I would say is right now, we don't -- we're watching it very carefully. It's hard not to watch it, given what we've seen out of both earnings and out of the market. I would say that in the fourth quarter, we were very happy with the holiday. We had a very strong cyber 5. And we started to see some small signs of softening in December. We're not assuming any significant change in the macro economic environment, but it's obviously, we -- every company is watching it very, very carefully. So I'd say right now, FX is a much bigger operating impact than overall market softening. We don't have very much of a domestic China business, for instance. But we're certainly watching that carefully as I think every company is right now."

And Richard, maybe for the benefit of everyone on the phone, its probably be a follow-up question anyway. Roughly speaking, as you know, 60% of our business is international with most of our exposure in euro, pound, Aussie dollar and Korean won. And as we look to 2016 versus today's rates on an average, that would be about a 6% decrease across that basket of currencies for 2016, which would have about a 3% impact on our top line. So that's how the top line anyway is architected and impacted given our foreign exchange translation exposure. And then, maybe just to go one more step further. As it relates to our hedging strategy, as I've discussed previously, we're unable to hedge revenue in the New Year. As such, our top line is heavily exposed to currency fluctuations. But as I explained back in Q2 and a bit in Q3, we do utilize now different hedging instruments to economically protect net income. And that program is designed to protect as much net income as we can. And the intent is to have minimal variation versus guidance per EPS due to foreign exchange. But that doesn't eliminate the effect of FX on a year-over-year basis, particularly for revenues, I called out. And as rates change, we'll feel the effect of FX when comparing year-over-year."

And I would expect to continue to see reasonable growth from the components. But it's not -- there's no major mix shift going on in 2016. I think you should assume that it will follow the path in terms of the components that are followed in 2015, roughly. Second part of the question, sorry? Listings restructuring, yes. Sorry, Mark. Look, I -- this is a major effort and we're a data-driven business. So we don't do anything without measuring it and ensuring that we're on the right path. And this is consistent with what we've been saying, which is where we are organizing data, adding content to it, where we are exposing it in a new way. We're seeing better traffic. We're seeing better conversion. It's just very small today in our echo system and it will take time. But we all believe we're on the right path. And I think we measure, just to be clear, in data from the top of the funnel to the bottom, we measure incoming users, new and existing. We measure their conversion through the mid-points of the funnel. And we measure ultimately their conversion to a transaction. And all of that we watch literally on a daily basis. So if you think about the scale of what we've done, it's still very foundational. We've made a lot of progress on the foundation. But its manifestation through the pages that you're seeing in the accompanying slides is really small. But where we've done that, we're seeing better results.

I'd say nothing fundamentally has changed. But our strategy is different. Our investments are different. We're making a major transition of the business. So we don't point a finger at any one event. I just come back to, this is exactly what's happening with our business, is remarkably like what we said over the summer and 6 months ago, which was, we're going to focus our strategy. We're going to move away from commodity towards what's unique about eBay. We're going to make catch-up investments that probably historically should have been made but were not in order to better compete over the long run, and we're going to hold -- we're going to try to hold our growth to mid to -- to low to mid single-digits while keeping our margin and cash flow high and returning capital to shareholders. All 3 things -- 3 of those things are still true. And the reality is that, as we've said, many of these investments are not quick hit investments. We are re-platforming eBay. 60% of coverage of listings is the first part of the equation, not the end of the equation. That's the raw material and the foundation to allow us to build product experiences and it's those product experiences which change traffic and conversion. So I would say that right now, and we watch it carefully. I don't assume that the world will continue exactly the way it is. We watch everything very carefully. But right now, the plan that we laid out really clearly, I think, 6 months ago, we believe it's working and we believe we're on that plan.

Let me take them in turn. So first of all, on the product. As I said in my remarks, I'm really excited about this year because I do believe that with some of these foundational investments in place you're going to see the product evolve relatively quickly for buyers and sellers. So the products never, it's never static, it's always evolving. But I think this will be a year of particular innovation for us. We have a very exciting pipeline based on all the things that we've been talking about, based on our ability to now understand products and persistence, we believe we can generate a really differentiated experience that shows our customers what's unique about eBay. It doesn't talk about it, but shows them. So I do think this will be a year of rapid innovation in the product experience. Second is sales and marketing. There's no -- a couple of things. First is, we are going to start almost immediately pivoting some of our spend up the funnel to what we would call more traditional brand spend. That doesn't mean television. It just means instead of selling you an iPhone or a sweater, we're going to talk more about eBay and the brand. Whether or not we ultimately spend more in that will depend on what we learned from doing that. We do believe that brand is more important, that we have to more sharply define our brand in an increasingly crowded environment. And you'll see us start to do that. There are no plans to significantly change our spend. But how we spend will begin to change. And in fact, it already is changing. Final comment is on contra. There's no -- we are very disciplined about contra revenue. I would say that we spent a bit more on that versus a little less on marketing in the fourth quarter because holidays become very deals driven. And this holiday, we participated in deals aggressively across electronics, fashion, home and garden. And we got good results. But that does cost some mix shift in spending more in contra. I would expect those numbers to go back to historical averages. There's no break from trend other than we plus up in the fourth quarter because that's the way shoppers are shopping."

I think what you could expect in product development is a continued pace of investment in line with the percentages of revenue that we've shown over the last, let's call it, 12 to 18 months, but certainly, the last 6. In sales and marketing, I would call out the pacing and refer back to the earlier response around contra. In some quarters, we may decide based on the returns that we think we can get or the strategy that we're deploying on marketing, that some more marketing ends up in out of the expense line and in the contra, in other quarters it may be the opposite.

Just to note, I've said this before but I think its important. We have a playbook on contra. And we try not to deviate from it, which is we spend on acquiring customers when it makes sense to spend on acquiring customers. I'm not sure all companies in this environment play that same playbook. But we could have bought another point or 2 of growth. We just don't do that because we don't think it creates value over the long term. So for us, contra is one of the weapons we deployed, but we do it carefully. Because it's easy to show growth, but it's not easy to create value, and those are 2 different things. On marketing efficiency, there's couple of puts and takes. So every year, we try to pick up marketing efficiency. I target my marketing teams with significant basis point improvement in efficiency of the way we spend our significant marketing expenditure. Our most efficient marketing spend on an ROI basis is paid search. But, that we don't believe over the long run, we can be tied only to paid search. So we are spending into less efficient channels to build new channels in the future. And I point to social as a great example. We're on 14 channels. None of them today is as efficient as paid search, but it's diversifying our traffic mix, and we're working on making them more efficient over time. We think it's the right thing to do even though it's making us less efficient in the short term as a mix effect. The other thing I'd say is we watch the competitive landscape really carefully. It's really important that we maintain eBay's share of voice. And in the last couple of years, it hasn't gotten less competitive, it's gotten more. So while we pick up some gains and efficiency, I don't see a lot of leverage coming from marketing. I suspect we'll want to spend more over time as our product experience improves, and we want to bring more and more people to a better eBay experience. So those are some of the puts and takes, the net being I don't expect in '16 to see a lot of leverage on the marketing line."

It's much more choppy than eBay just because it sort of depends what the matchup is in the Super Bowl and what the events landscape is, and it was a very strong events landscape. So I would expect StubHub to keep growing. I'm not sure I'd expect it to keep growing at this rate.

But on a Q-over-Q basis and in the growth perspective, it didn't have a material impact this quarter. Last quarter, we called out, it helped a bit. This quarter, it didn't necessarily accelerate further. The way I think about active buyer growth is, it's been massively impacted by 2 things over the last 2 years. One was password reset, and I think that's largely behind us. And I think the other is SEO. SEO, as explained in many different forums, has a over indexing impact on acquiring new users. And thus, as its depressed at the top of our funnel and reduced our overall active buyer growth over the last couple of years. And that's why the structured data and SEO initiative is so important because it'll work our way back up on that metric. On sold items, sold items -- the change this quarter was just driven primarily by the higher mix of electronics sold during the holiday. This tends to go up and down depending on everything from country and seller mix to hot items. So it's relatively difficult to predict and correlate. And just to explain it for Q4, it was high degree of electronic items."

Our business was stable in Q4 and we delivered solid results as we continue to reposition our business amidst the backdrop of a competitive holiday retail environment. Overall, total GMV and revenue were both",1112,"Thanks, Selim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our business was stable in Q4 and we delivered solid results as we continue to reposition our business amidst the backdrop of a competitive holiday retail environment. 
Overall, total GMV and revenue were both up 5% for the quarter, and we also grew active buyers 5% year-over-year to 162 million. GMV on our marketplace platform grew at 4% year-over-year. And underlying this growth, our B2C business, which is the best analog for other retailers and marketplaces, grew at 8%.
We also saw particular strength in our StubHub and classifieds platforms, which grew revenue at 34% and 15%, respectively. Looking deeper at our marketplace platform, we continue to see an impact on traffic and new user acquisition, along with continued near-term pressure from some of our strategic longer-term initiatives, which curtailed growth in the quarter.
6 months ago, we began a series of platform, inventory and policy changes, which we believe are critical to make our business more competitive over the long term. While we're making steady progress on these strategic initiatives, we don't expect to see material benefit from them for some time to come.
With our structured data initiative, we increased the percentage of listings processed to 37% of relevant listings in Q4, up from 28% in the prior quarter, while adding 79 million unique products to our catalog. And we recently announced that the next phase of required product identifiers would go into effect at the end of February. This phase will add more categories and countries to increase coverage to approximately 60% of relevant listings on our platform.
Historically, as a listings-based marketplace, providing users with features such as product reviews and pricing data was extremely challenging. As we have begun converting more of the site to structured data, we're starting to leverage these features and are seeing good results. 
In Q4, our users created nearly 1 million product reviews, up twentyfold from the prior quarters. Over time, this is the type of user generated content that will help us to improve discoverability and conversion. We're also starting to use our data to enable price trending and comparisons as well as better merchandising capabilities. Early results show we're picking up conversion rate improvements, which is a clear signal that we're on the right track here. You can see some of these examples in the slides accompanying my commentary. 
Another key area of focus for us is mobile. While reviews of the mobile experience we launched in September have significantly improved, it's not yet delivering results on par with the prior version. We're aggressively iterating it to enhance the user experience and to drive adoption and usage. And our new platform is enabling us to get new releases in front of our users more rapidly and efficiently than we have in the past. Despite those challenges, we still grew mobile GMV 21% on a year-over-year basis.
Finally, we continue to make progress in other areas, such as social and promoted listings. Our social traffic continues to grow at strong double-digits, driven by our presence now across 4 -- 14 key channels. And with promoted listings we opened the service to all store subscribers, and we expanded placements into many new categories in Q4.
As I've discussed previously, we believe StubHub and Classifieds are important complements to eBay. And we continue to see strong overlap across each user base. Over the past 6 months, many of you have indicated that you would like to better understand the scale of these platforms relative to our marketplace platform. In an effort to increase transparency and disclosure across our portfolio, we will disclose volume and revenue for StubHub and revenue for Classifieds moving forward, which mirrors how we manage them internally.
Our StubHub platform continues to be a strong partner to sports leagues, teams and artists. We saw significant growth acceleration in the quarter driven by the product changes we made in August and aided by a strong sports landscape and high demand for concert tickets.
And our Classifieds platform saw particular strength on eBay Kleinanzeigen, in Germany, along with Gumtree in the U.K., resulting in accelerating year-over-year growth. We also continue to grow our U.S. Classifieds presence via our Close5 mobile app, where total downloads approached 6 million, more than doubling where we ended Q3.
Now I want to step back and put Q4 in the context of our first 6 months post separation from PayPal. 6 months ago, we indicated that our key strategic priorities were to create a robust commerce platform, a vibrant marketplace and enhanced product and brand experiences and reposition our business to better compete over the long term. We also set expectations that executing on this strategy would take time and that we prioritize repositioning our business over near-term growth opportunities.
Lastly, during this period of time, we said we'd be disciplined with our investments while returning capital to shareholders. Over the past 6 months, we've made progress against our key priorities while delivering on the higher end of the growth expectations that we indicated. And the investments we're making have been largely paid for by the restructuring we undertook in the first quarter of last year.
Additionally, we've shed nonstrategic assets while returning over $1.1 billion in capital to shareholders through our share repurchase program. In short, we're on plan, and we will continue to execute on this strategy as we head into 2016.
Looking forward, we believe we can create a customer experience and a brand message that will sharpen the focus on what is unique about eBay. This year, I will be focused on stepping up our efforts to drive the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform, in addition to further clarifying what our brand stands for. 
Having made many foundational investments, we expect to deliver significantly improved experiences for buyers and sellers across multiple dimensions this year. We'll do this by improving discoverability both on and off our site. We'll give buyers more choice, but also more data to facilitate better comparisons. And we'll provide sellers with more effective tools, better service and fairer policies to enhance their eBay businesses, incenting them to provide their best inventory and competitive prices on our platform.
Finally, we intend to innovate and improve upon our C2C experience to reaccelerate our sell-to-buy flywheel. In summary, we exit the year on plan and executing on the strategy and the financial framework we laid out 6 months ago. We're looking forward to a year of significant progress. 
Now let me turn it over to Scott, to provide more details on our fourth quarter and full year results and 2016 guidance."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 12. Our business was stable in Q4 as we made progress against our key objectives. We generated $2.3 billion of total revenue, $0.50 of non-GAAP EPS, $1 billio",2063,"Thanks, Devin. During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 12. Our business was stable in Q4 as we made progress against our key objectives. We generated $2.3 billion of total revenue, $0.50 of non-GAAP EPS, $1 billion in free cash flow and we repurchased $550 million of our stock.
On Slide 13, let's start at the top of the funnel with Q4 active buyers. In the quarter, we added 3 million new buyers, increasing the total active buyer base to 162 million, trailing 12-month growth rate was stable at 5% in Q4.
Turning to Slide 14. In Q4, we enabled 22 billion of GMV, growing 5% versus last year. By geography, the U.S. generated 9 billion of GMV, up 4%. While international delivered 13 billion of GMV, up 6%. I'll discuss these results in more detail later. Sold items grew 4% in Q4, a 3-point deceleration versus prior quarter. Sold item growth continues to be influenced by our product, geographic and seller mix. In Q4, we saw an increase in the mix of higher ASV electronic sold during the holidays.
Moving to Slide 15. We delivered net revenues of $2.3 billion, up 5% versus last year, growing at the same rate as GMV. We continue to experience currency headwinds in translation, negatively impacting growth by 5 points and resulting in Q4 revenue, which was flat year-over-year on an as-reported basis. We generated $1.8 billion of transaction revenue, up 3% versus last year, and $500 million of marketing services revenue, up 12% versus last year. On the next 3 slides, I'll take you through a bit more detail on our market place, StubHub and Classifieds platforms.
Let's start with the marketplace platform on Slide 16. This platform is one of the world's largest online marketplaces with extensive product inventory that combines unique and interesting items with great deals on what shoppers want and love. We build connections between buyers and sellers across the world with product experiences that are fast, mobile, secure and backed by the eBay money back guarantee. Our flagship brand, eBay.com, has localized sites in Germany, U.K. and Australia, amongst others. We operate other brands as well, Such as IAC and Gmarket in Korea and GittiGidiyor in Turkey. 
Over the years, our marketplace has shifted from used goods and auctions to new goods and fixed price. In Q4, 80% of the sold items were new and 85% of GMV was fixed price. Additionally, 63% of orders shipped for free and 60% of orders were delivered in 3 days or less.
Turning to Q4 results. Marketplace GMV grew 4% year-over-year, decelerating 1 point versus Q3. This performance reflects the ongoing challenges of SEO, the impact of the new mobile experience launched in Q3 and continued pressure on our C2C business. Total revenue for the marketplace platform grew 1%, 2 points lower than the prior quarter. This deceleration was primarily driven by transaction revenue, which was flat year-over-year and 2 points lower versus Q3.
Transaction revenue was impacted by volume, in addition to seller and category mix, which shows an overall lower take rate. We also modestly increased contra revenue spend on coupons and seller incentives, shifting marketing spend away from operating expense. Marketing services revenue grew 9%, accelerating 3 points over Q3. This revenue stream is comprised of advertising our vehicle's vertical and the PayPal operating agreement, amongst others. As a reminder, the PayPal operating agreement was an addition to the MS&O revenue starting in Q3 and it contributed to the Q4 acceleration in growth.
Moving to Slide 17. Our StubHub platform is the largest ticket market place in the U.S. We enable fans to buy and sell tens of thousands of tickets daily for sports, concerts, performing arts and other events. Throughout the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany, StubHub provides a specialized tickets experience custom-built for fans. StubHub is our tickets vertical experience, much like fashion or electronics that you can find on our marketplace platform. 
We continue to see strong overlap between the marketplace and StubHub visitor bases. We encourage all of our customers to use StubHub as their tickets marketplace to take advantage of the tailor-made experience for fans and the security offered by StubHub's fan protect guarantee, assuring fans that they will make it to their event or we will make it right.
StubHub ended the year on a high note, delivering Q4 GMV growth of 30%, up 20 points versus Q3. Q4 revenue grew 34%, accelerating 17 points versus Q3. StubHub's standout performance was driven by a full quarter of product improvements launched in August, including pricing display changes and our updated mobile app, plus strength in both sports and concerts in Q4. Q4 capped off a strong finish to 2015. For the full year, StubHub generated $3.6 billion of GMV and $725 million in revenue, up 15% versus prior year.
Now turning to Classifieds on Slide 18. We operate 12 brands in our Classifieds portfolio with the presence in 17 countries. eBay is the Classifieds leader in 10 markets and attracts approximately 250 million unique monthly visitors. Some of our well-known brands include Gumtree, Kijiji and eBay Classifieds, to name a few. Classifieds provides eBay another way to serve the online C2C market, which often represents the same customer with items better suited to a local transaction.
We intend to continue investing in our growth markets mobile-only experience and strong local presence. Turning to Q4 results. Classifieds delivered another strong quarter of growth, up 15% year-over-year, accelerating 1 point versus Q3. The strong performance in Q4 was driven by our developed markets, most notably, eBay Kleinanzeigen, in Germany and Gumtree in the U.K. Q4 contributed to a strong performance by Classifieds in 2015, generating over $700 million in revenue for the full year, growing 15% versus prior year.
Now moving to expenses on Slide 19. I'd like to take a moment to touch on the impact of foreign exchange on our expense lines. While nearly 60% of our revenue is international, our cost base is weighted to the U.S. dollar. As a result, when the U.S. dollar strengthens, we experience some loss of leverage on a percent of revenue basis costing us 80 point, basis points in Q4. We will continue to feel the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar for some time to come. And with this in mind, I will focus the rest of my expense commentary on operational drivers.
Cost of revenue increased 220 basis points year-over-year with the primary driver being the addition of PayPal processing cost. In Q4, we also increased investment in structured data and security efforts. In looking at operating expense, as we've mentioned in the prior 2 quarters, we undertook a reduction in workforce in Q1, which continues to drive year-over-year leverage across each expense line item.
Outside of that, let me touch on some additional operating expense drivers. Q4 sales and marketing expense is down 120 basis points year-over-year. This is primarily driven by the shift from marketing expense to contra revenue that I mentioned earlier in addition to lapping last year's significant brand spend. Product development is relatively flat year-over-year on a percent of revenue basis, as we reinvest operational leverage and do initiatives such as structured data. G&A increased 110 basis points year-over-year with standup cost more than offsetting the benefit from the reduction in workforce. We will see a similar year-over-year impact of standup cost and G&A during the first half of 2016.
Moving to Slide 20. In Q4, we delivered $0.50 in non-GAAP EPS, down 10% year-over-year, as revenue growth, operating leverage and the impact of share repurchases were more than offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, a higher tax rate and standup cost. The impact of the strong U.S. dollar alone cost us 7 points of EPS growth.
Turning to free cash flow. Our ability to generate strong cash flow based on our low capital intensity and profitable business model continues. In Q4, we generated free cash flow of $1 billion, bringing the full year to $2.2 billion. In Q4, CapEx was 6% of revenue, 6 points lower than prior quarter as separation-related spending ramped down and the timing of some of our planned spend pushed into 2016.
For the full year, CapEx was 8% of revenue. Moving to Slide 22. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $8.5 billion, including $1.5 billion in the U.S. As a reminder, our capital allocation policy is designed to manage the capital structure in a way that optimizes our financial flexibility, access to debt and our cost of capital to drive long-term shareholder value.
In Q4, we repurchased 19.9 million shares at an average price of $27.62 a share. This brings our total repurchases in the second half of 2015 to over $1.1 billion or just under 42 million shares. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining. We continue to be disciplined in how we manage our investments. And in Q4, we closed the divestiture of eBay Enterprise and received cash proceeds of $925 million.
In 2015, we repaid $850 million of debt that matured. As a reminder, we have an average investment grade rating of BBB+, which allows a gross debt to EBITDA ratio of up to approximately 3.5x, providing us the capacity to take an additional $3 billion to $4 billion of debt. As we look at our capital structure in 2016, we may seek additional outside financing to replace 2016 maturities and to provide additional financial flexibility.
I'd like to take a moment to share how we're thinking about capital allocation for 2016. Subject to market conditions, we expect to continue buying our own shares throughout 2016 at or above the rate of our second half 2015 repurchases. This would be in addition to offsetting dilution. To this end, we have incorporated share repurchases into our 2016 guidance, which I will cover shortly. And consistent with what we said before, we will continue to be an acquisitive company, disciplinary approach and seeking the best opportunities to create long-term value.
Moving to full year guidance on Slide 23. We are projecting 2016 revenue between $8.5 billion and $8.8 billion, growing 2% to 5% versus last year. Our projected growth is in line with what we discussed previously and relatively stable with 2015, as we continue to execute our long-term strategic initiatives in the face of near-term headwinds. On an as-reported basis, growth ranges from a 1% decline to a 2% increase as foreign exchange negatively impacts growth by 3 points.
We expect operating margin of 31% to 33% for the year. As compared to 2015, we are losing roughly 1 point of margin due to the impact of foreign exchange and 50 basis points due to a full year of separation cost. Despite these factors, our margin is in line with expectations set last June, and we are utilizing leverage in cost savings to fund our investments. We are projecting non-GAAP EPS of $1.82 to $1.87 per share, down 1% year-over-year at the low end of the range and up 2% at the high end. The impact of the stronger U.S. dollar costs us roughly 5 points of EPS growth.
Finally, we expect non-GAAP effective tax rate of 19.5% to 20.5%, CapEx of 7% to 9% of revenue and free cash flow of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. Moving to Q1 guidance on Slide 24. 
For Q1, we are projecting revenue between $2.05 billion and $2.1 billion, growing 3% to 5% versus last year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.43 to $0.45 a share, representing a decline of 6% to 10%. The decline is due to the stronger U.S. dollar and impact of the synergies, which cost us 10 points of EPS year-over-year. This impact will be more pronounced in the first half of 2016.
In closing, we end the year with financial commitments on plan, a year, a clear and disciplined approach to capital allocation and executing on our strategy. In the upcoming year, we will increase our efforts to drive the best choice, the most relevant and a powerful selling platform while driving increased clarity on what our brand stands for. And we'll remain focused on positioning eBay for long-term success.

I would say that there are 2 things to note. The first is that the strong dollar, as Scott pointed out, obviously, has a translation effect, but it equally has an operating effect. We have a strong cross-border business. The continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar has really impacted the exports of U.S. goods, which was one of our biggest export corridors. So the strong dollar is both a translation impact and it certainly, underlying that, an operating impact. And our trade flows are not purely balanced. So it has helped our China business somewhat paradoxically in some of our import corridors, making those goods seem cheap, but it doesn't net out to 0. In fact, it's been quite a significant headwind starting last year when the dollar started to strengthen. Vis-à-vis, just the overall macroeconomic situation, I guess what I would say is right now, we don't -- we're watching it very carefully. It's hard not to watch it, given what we've seen out of both earnings and out of the market. I would say that in the fourth quarter, we were very happy with the holiday. We had a very strong cyber 5. And we started to see some small signs of softening in December. We're not assuming any significant change in the macro economic environment, but it's obviously, we -- and every company is watching it very, very carefully. So I'd say right now, FX is a much bigger operating impact than overall market softening. We don't have very much of a domestic China business, for instance. But we're certainly watching that carefully as I think every company is right now."

Roughly speaking, as you know, 60% of our business is international with most of our exposure in euro, pound, Aussie dollar and Korean won.

So that's how the top line anyway is architected and impacted given our foreign exchange translation exposure. And then, maybe just to go one more step further. As it relates to our hedging strategy, as I've discussed previously, we're unable to hedge revenue in the new [indiscernible] . As such, our top line is heavily exposed to currency fluctuations. But as I explained back in Q2 and a bit in Q3, we do utilize now different hedging instruments to economically protect net income. And that program is designed to protect as much net income as we can. And the intent is to have minimal variation versus guidance for EPS due to foreign exchange. But that doesn't eliminate the effect of FX on a year-over-year basis, particularly for revenues, as I called out. And as rates change, we'll feel the effect of FX when comparing year-over-year."

But I guess, what I'd say is I would expect -- our business is heavily skewed towards transaction revenue. Obviously, it's the core business and its take rate on transactions.

And I would expect to continue to see reasonable growth from the components. But it's not -- there's no major mix shift going on in 2016. I think you should assume that it will follow the path in terms of the components that are followed in 2015, roughly. Second part of the question, sorry? Listings restructuring, yes. Sorry, Mark. Look, I -- this is a major effort and we're a data-driven business. So we don't do anything without measuring it and ensuring that we're on the right path. And this is consistent with what we've been saying, which is where we are organizing data, adding content to it, where we are exposing it in a new way. We're seeing better traffic. We're seeing better conversion. It's just very small today in our echo system and it will take time. But we all believe we're on the right path. And I think we measure, just to be clear, in data from the top of the funnel to the bottom, we measure incoming users, new and existing. We measure their conversion through the mid-points of the funnel. And we measure ultimately their conversion to a transaction. And all of that we watch literally on a daily basis. So if you think about the scale of what we've done, it's still very foundational. We've made a lot of progress on the foundation. But its manifestation through the pages that you're seeing in the accompanying slides is really small. But where we've done that, we're seeing better results.

So we don't point the finger at any one event. I'd just come back to, this is exactly what's happening with our business, is remarkably like what we said over the summer and 6 months ago, which was, we're going to focus our strategy. We're going to move away from commodity towards what's unique about eBay. We're going to make catch-up investments that probably historically should have been made but were not in order to better compete over the long run, and we're going to hold -- we're going to try to hold our growth to mid to -- to low to mid-single-digits while keeping our margin and cash flow high and returning capital to shareholders. All 3 things -- 3 of those things are still true. And the reality is that, as we've said, many of these investments are not quick hit investments. We are re-platforming eBay. 60% of coverage of listings is the first part of the equation, not the end of the equation. That's the raw material and the foundation to allow us to build product experiences and it's those product experiences which change traffic and conversion.

Let me take them in turn. So first of all, on the product. As I said in my remarks, I'm really excited about this year because I do believe that with some of these foundational investments in place you're going to see the product evolve relatively quickly for buyers and sellers. So the products never, it's never static, it's always evolving. But I think this will be a year of particular innovation for us. We have a very exciting pipeline based on all the things that we've been talking about, based on our ability to now understand products and persistence, we believe we can generate a really differentiated experience that shows our customers what's unique about eBay. It doesn't talk about it, but shows them. So I do think this will be a year of rapid innovation in the product experience. Second is sales and marketing. There's no -- a couple of things. First is, we are going to start almost immediately pivoting some of our spend up the funnel to what we would call more traditional brand spend. That doesn't mean television. It just means instead of selling you an iPhone or a sweater, we're going to talk more about eBay and the brand. Whether or not we ultimately spend more in that will depend on what we learn from doing that. We do believe that brand is more important, that we have to more sharply define our brand in an increasingly crowded environment. And you'll see us start to do that. There are no plans to significantly change our spend. But how we spend will begin to change. And in fact, it already is changing. Final comment is on contra. There's no -- we are very disciplined about contra revenue. I would say that we spent a bit more on that versus a little less on marketing in the fourth quarter because holidays become very deals driven. And this holiday, we participated in deals aggressively across electronics, fashion, home and garden. And we got good results. But that does cost some mix shift in spending more in contra. I would expect those numbers to go back to historical averages. There's no break from trend other than we plus up in the fourth quarter because that's the way shoppers are shopping."

How do you think about the cadence of investments as we move through the year first half versus second half, and whether we might see more leverage against investments in the second half of the year. Or really, should we be prepared for a full year impact on the leverage side from investments. And I guess, for Devin, one on marketing efficiency long-term. You've talked a lot tonight about traffic sources and improved channels even referenced social. Have you learned anything as you continue to evolve the platform about how marketing efficiency might evolve for eBay long term?"

I'd say the one cadence aspect I would call out maybe a couple. First off, within our G&A cost bucket, we're going to have 2 more quarters of essentially no year-on-year comps in the baseline for standout costs. And so there's going to be, before we see productivity in G&A, we're going to have relatively difficult comps as we've stood up to the company and without any baseline comparisons. I think what you could expect in product development is a continued pace of investment in line with the percentages of revenue that we've shown over the last, let's call it, 12 to 18 months, but certainly, the last 6. In sales and marketing, I would call out the pacing and refer back to the earlier response around contra. In some quarters, we may decide based on the returns that we think we can get or the strategy that we're deploying on marketing, that some more marketing ends up in out of the expense line and into contra, in other quarters it may be the opposite. But I think within the ranges that we talked about last year, I would expect that to be not larger to, Devin's point than what we've seen so far."

Just to note, I've said this before but I think it's important. We have a playbook on contra. And we try not to deviate from it, which is we spend on acquiring customers when it makes sense to spend on acquiring customers. I'm not sure all companies in this environment play that same playbook. But we could have bought another point or 2 of growth. We just don't do that because we don't think it creates value over the long term. So for us, contra is one of the weapons we deployed, but we do it carefully. Because it's easy to show growth, but it's not easy to create value, and those are 2 different things. On marketing efficiency, there's a couple of puts and takes. So every year, we try to pick up marketing efficiency. I target my marketing teams with significant basis point improvement in efficiency of the way we spend our significant marketing expenditure. Our most efficient marketing spend on an ROI basis is paid search. But, that we don't believe over the long run, we can be tied only to paid search. So we are spending into less efficient channels to build new channels in the future. And I point to social as a great example. We're on 14 channels. None of them today is as efficient as paid search, but it's diversifying our traffic mix, and we're working on making them more efficient over time. We think it's the right thing to do even though it's making us less efficient in the short term as a mix effect. The other thing I'd say is we watch the competitive landscape really carefully. It's really important that we maintain eBay's share of voice. And in the last couple of years, it hasn't gotten less competitive, it's gotten more. So while we pick up some gains in efficiency, I don't see a lot of leverage coming from marketing. I suspect we'll want to spend more over time as our product experience improves, and we want to bring more and more people to a better eBay experience. So those are some of the puts and takes, the net being I don't expect in '16 to see a lot of leverage on the marketing line."

But on a Q-over-Q basis and in the growth perspective, it didn't have a material impact this quarter. Last quarter, we called out, it helped a bit.

One was password reset, and I think that's largely behind us. And I think the other is SEO. SEO, as explained in many different forums, has a over indexing impact on acquiring new users. And thus, as it depressed the top of our funnel and reduced our overall active buyer growth over the last couple of years. And that's why the structured data and SEO initiative is so important because it'll work our way back up on that metric. On sold items, sold items -- the change this quarter was just driven primarily by the -- a higher mix of electronics sold during the holiday. This tends to go up and down depending on everything from country and seller mix to hot items. So it's relatively difficult to predict and correlate.

Our business continues to consistently grow while we make progress against our key strategic objectives. Overall total GMV was up 5% for the quarter while revenue is up 6%. We grew active buyers 4% year-over-year, with adding 6 million buyers to our platforms over the past year. GMV on our Marketplace platform grew 4% year-over-year, and StubHub and Classifieds both had strong performances, growing revenue at 34% and 17%, respectively.
Finally, we continue to be good capital stewards repurchasing $1 billion worth of our stock at attractive prices and acquiring new technology and talent to bolster our motors vertical. Repositioning our business for long-term success is a multiyear journey, and my focus is to drive the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform while deliver growth and opportunistically returning capital to shareholders. Three quarters into our new strategy and one quarter into 2016, we are making progress on executing our plan.
First, our effort to drive the best choice is about providing the greatest selection of inventory for our consumers. This encompasses new everyday items to rare and unique goods, with incredible deals you can only find on eBay. We've outlined our regional organizations more closely against our key verticals, which in turn enables them to think and act more like merchants. In Q1, we continue to increase the inventory available on our platform, with over 900 million life listings available at anytime. We're also working to be even more unique and differentiated inventory by acquiring new small-business sellers and brands. In Q1, we announced integration partnerships with BIG commerce and In Frog [ph], enabling sellers to more easily list their inventory directly on eBay and access our enormous global buyer base. We also launched brands like Vince Komodo and Samsonite on our U.S. platform and I'm excited to announce we just signed a partnership with Adidas to open showrooms on eBay across our key European markets later this year. In addition to these efforts, you can expect several exciting new category launches soon.
Next, having the most relevance means the shopping experience that is simple, data-driven and personalized. We intend to deliver a differentiated eBay shopping experience that enables buyers to find, compare and purchase items they need and want and to clearly understand the unique value that eBay brings. One of the key foundational changes we're making to our Marketplace platform to drive the most relevance is to shift to be more product-based. This initiative, which we call structured data, is how we're organizing our vast inventory and beginning to better aggregate insight into supply and demand. This is ultimately the foundation on which we'll build better user experiences and improve discoverability on and off eBay.
In Q1, we rolled out the second phase of our mandate for sellers to provide product data when selling on our platform, going live in France, Italy and Spain for the first time while also increasing coverage to 8 more categories. This brings our mandate coverage to find us the percentage of addressable life listings where product identifiers require to approximately 60%. We've also continued to make progress in our data processing efforts. However, that effort does tend to trail the expansion of mandate by a quarter or 2. In Q1, we added 16 million unique products to our catalog in addition to 1.6 million new user product reviews. Now, while most of our early efforts with this initiative have focused primarily on our sellers and our inventory, enabling improved buyer experiences is what will ultimately drive value in our ecosystem. It also takes the longest to get right but we're making progress in some really use cases that give us confidence that we're on the right track.
Browsing on eBay is one example of where we started to change our shopping experience in ways that we have not been previously able to. We recently launched an entirely new browse experience, which takes advantage of our structured data catalog, enabling us to instantly surface products with great savings, best-selling items and more. In this experience, consumers can easily navigate to shop by brand or see our best deals. This is a great example of how eBay is enabling people to find their version of perfect, the right product at a great price, one click away. Search on eBay is also starting to benefit from our efforts in this area. We recently launched the ability for users to search on eBay using a product identifier directly in the search bar, quickly returning relevant items.
Finally, we're making progress on building new product and search pages, which is starting to drive healthy SEO traffic for search engines. While SEO traffic from unstructured data pages continues to decline, we've been able to offset much of that decline by shifting traffic to these new pages, which now represents 10% of total of SEO traffic with higher overall conversion rates.
Mobile's another key area of focus for us. Our mobile team has been hard at work on the new mobile release, which is currently testing. We'll roll this out more broadly to customers soon and we'll rapidly iterate that to get our mobile experience back on strong track. Looking forward, you will see us adopt a more consistent cadence of iteration on mobile throughout the course of 2016.
Having the most relevance also means ensuring that we're present where buyers are spending time online. As part of this, we continue to build upon our efforts to diversify our traffic and leverage social channels more heavily. We recently became the first brand to test an audience match campaign on Snapchat, and we've seen great engagement thus far amongst Snapchat's large, active community. And we just announced the pilot integration that enables eBay users to receive activity notifications through Facebook Messenger.
Finally, the third main area of focus for us this year is to deliver the most powerful selling platform, enabling a simple selling experience for our business and consumer sellers. In Q1, we rolled out a new seller standards that were announced last fall. And we recently announced our spring seller update, with a significant investment into our anchor store benefits and planned improvements later this year to our suite of APIs and the availability of eBay-branded shipping supplies. Over 25,000 sellers are now using our new Seller Hub data to manage their businesses, providing them with the tools and data needed to solve manage their selling activities in one convenient place. We'll be rolling Seller Hub out to all our sellers this summer. We also continue to scale our eBay Valet service to enable consumer sellers with a simple yet powerful way to approach selling on eBay. And we expanded our partnership with Shift in Q1, further simplifying the selling experience on eBay by enabling your sold items to be picked up at your home and packed and shipped for you.
Elsewhere in our business, StubHub is enjoying strong growth while driving innovative user experiences. StubHub continues to benefit from product experience changes we made in Q3 last year in addition to having a strong concert and sports landscape in Q1. We also made several enhancements to the StubHub user experience in the quarter, including a new recommendation engine, which enables users to quickly determine the best value for their tickets. And we recently launched a test of virtual reality technology, which enables fans to get an immersive view from available seats.
Our Classifieds platform saw accelerating growth, primarily driven by strength across our portfolio in Germany and with Gumtree in the U.K. In Germany, the acquisition last year of the leading European motors enthusiast community, Motor Talk, has enabled us to further enhance our market-leading presence in the motor's vertical. In the U.K., we launched the complete redesign of the Gumtree experience in Q1.
In summary, we are making progress on our strategy and on the financial framework we laid out in January. The product experience flywheel is clicking into gear and over the next 2 quarters, we expect to make significant progress on launching new user experiences. I look forward to updating you along the way as we continue to reposition eBay's business for long-term growth and success.

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 10.
As Devin summarized, our focus is to drive the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform while delivering on our financial commitment and positioning eBay for long-term success. When I reflect on the last 9 months of executing our new strategy, I feel good about the progress we are making and the stability we are seeing in the business. At the same time, it is important to keep in mind our progress due to the scale of our global Marketplace, it will take time for the green shoots we are seeking to start materially impacting the business.
While we execute our plan, we will continue to deliver what we promised. In Q1, we generated $2.1 billion of total revenue, $0.47 of non-GAAP EPS, $483 million in free cash flow and we repurchased $1 billion of our stock.
Let's start at the top of the funnel with Q1 active buyers on Slide 11. We added over 800,000 active buyers in Q1, growing trailing 12-month active buyers by 4%. As we discussed, we look at active buyers in 3 cohorts: retain, reactivated, and new. Growth in retained and reactivated buyers remain stable as we utilized marketing programs and promotions to drive engagement in retention. However, SEO headwinds continue impacting new buyer acquisition, driving 1 point of deceleration versus Q4.
On Slide 12, we enabled $20.5 billion of GMV in Q1, growing 5% versus last year. By geography, the U.S. generated $8.5 billion of GMV, up 3%, while international delivered $12 billion of GMV, up 6%.
Moving to revenue. We delivered net revenues of $2.1 billion, up 6% versus last year and accelerating 1 point versus Q4. We generated $1.7 billion of transaction revenue, up 3%, and $460 million of marketing services revenue, up 19%.
Transitioning to our Marketplaces platform on Slide 14, Q1 GMV grew 4% year-over-year in line with the prior quarter. While we face the ongoing challenges of SEO, the continued impact of mobile headwinds and the pressure on our C2C business, we are encouraged by delivering stable quarter-over-quarter growth. Total revenue for Marketplaces platform grew 3%, accelerating 2 points versus Q4. Transaction revenue grew 1%, up 1 point sequentially driven by international acceleration. 
In the U.S., we invested more heavily contra revenue this quarter as we continuously experiment with a wide variety of promotions to see what is most effective in driving customer lifetime value. However, our global transaction take rate was flat versus Q4, as the increase in U.S. contra revenue was offset by a decrease internationally.
Marketing services revenue grew 19%, accelerating 10 points over Q4. U.S. advertising contributed to the strong quarter as a result of growing our mobile ad placements and improving yield in programmatic display ads. In addition, the PayPal operating agreement is included in our MS&O revenue stream, adding 10 points of growth year-over-year.
Moving to Slide 15. Q1 was another standout quarter for StubHub. We delivered GMV growth of 29% and we grew revenue by 34%. We had a strong quarter in sports and concerts in addition to launching a number of product innovations like ticket recommendations, which helped fans find the best value for the tickets they want.
In addition we be continue to see the impact of the product improvements launched last August, including pricing display changes and our updated mobile app. While we're very excited about the direction StubHub is headed, it's important to keep in mind we will start lapping the favorable comps from some of those changes in Q3.
In Q1, Classifieds delivered a strong quarter of growth, up 17% year-over-year, accelerating 3 points versus Q4. The strong performance in Q1 was driven by our sites in developed markets such as eBay -- and Mobile in Germany and Gumtree in the U.K. In addition, we launched in-app chat for our mobile experience, allowing buyers and sellers to message each other and facilitate even easier, faster buying experience.
We also further extended our vertical experience in -- Canada with motors and housing. Finally, we continue to deepen the connection between our Marketplace and Classifieds platforms. We were piloting a number of different programs regionally, including exposing listings from eBay [indiscernible] properties and providing tools for C2C sellers to identify which platform can help them realize the best price.
Turning to Slide 17 and major cost drivers. Cost of revenue increased 240 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by the addition of PayPal processing cost and increased investment insight availability. Q1 sales and marketing expense was relatively flat year-over-year, while product development increased 50 basis points, driven by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.
G&A was flat year-over-year, and standup costs were offset by a one-time insurance recovery. Pulling all of that together, we delivered a Q1 operating margin of 33.4%, down 220 basis points versus last year. Operating leverage in transaction losses in the insurance recoveries were more than offset by the increase in cost of revenue as well as the impact of foreign exchange and standup cost, which has cost us roughly 140 and 100 basis points, respectively. I'd like to take a moment to update you on our hedging strategy.
On our Q2 earnings call last July, I explained that our revenue was fully exposed to movements in currency, and that for 2015, we had implemented hedging strategies to economically protect our full year net income, some of which left us exposed to potential volatility in our quarterly results.
In 2016, our revenue remain fully exposed to movements in currency. We have implemented a hedging strategy that allowed us to limit the potential quarterly volatility and minimize the effects of FX in our current year earnings. Based on how those strategies are accounted for, we will see the impact of hedging cost -- hedging gains and losses in operating margin and OI&E while net income is economically protected.
Moving to Slide 18. In Q1, we delivered $0.47 in non-GAAP EPS, down $0.01 versus Q1 2015, as revenue growth, the impact of shareholder -- share repurchases and cost control were more than offset by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and standup cost. The impact of the strongest U.S. dollar cost us roughly $0.03 of EPS and stand-up cost an additional $0.01.
On Slide 19. In Q1, we generated free cash flow of $483 million, up 19%, largely due to higher cash earnings driven by an increase in revenue and lapping separation-related cost incurred last year. CapEx was 7% of revenue in Q1 and our full year CapEx guidance remains 7% to 9%.
Moving to Slide 20. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $10.3 billion, including $3.4 billion in the U.S. As a reminder, our capital allocation policy is designed to manage the capital structure that optimizes our financial flexibility, access to debt and our cost of capital to drive long-term shareholder value. After retiring $850 million of debt last year, we accessed the debt markets in Q1, raising $2.2 billion in debt. We plan to use the debt for general corporate purposes as well as share repurchases and M&A activity. We remain a strong BBB credit rated company with a gross debt to EBITDA ratio of below 3x. And we believe we are well capitalized with the means to deliver our current plans.
We will continue to be in an acquisitive company, disciplined in our approach, utilizing M&A for geographical expansion and tech and talent acquisition. Over the last 9 months, we have made a few small acquisitions that fall under these categories, the most recent being the acquisition of Car GG [ph], a great addition to our eBay motors platform.
In Q1, we repurchased 42.3 million shares at an average price of $23.67 per share, amounting to $1 billion in repurchases. We ended the quarter with $800 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. We remain on track with our full year plans for share repurchases as I laid out in our last earnings call.
Moving to guidance on Slide 21. For Q2, we are projecting revenue between $2.14 billion and $2.19 billion using today's spot rates, growing 4% to 6% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.40 to $0.42 per share, representing negative 5% to 0% growth year-over-year. EPS growth is impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar, which in Q2 will cost us $0.02 of EPS, and stand-up costs, which cost an additional $0.01. For the full year, we are raising the low end of revenue guidance to 3%, bringing our new guidance range to 3% to 5% or $8.6 billion to $8.8 billion as reported. While the U.S. dollar has weakened since we provided guidance last quarter, we have not assumed the entire benefit in our full year guidance. A relatively small movement in rate can have a significant impact on our second half revenue and given the recent volatility and catalysts that could generate more movement, we felt the best approach is not to count on the upside at this time. If recent spot rates do hold for the rest of the year, we estimate that all else equal, there will be roughly $80 million of upside to our second half and thus, full year revenue. All other full year guidance remains the same.
In closing, we are executing the plans we discussed for our Marketplace platform. It will take time but we're encouraged by some of the green shoots we are experiencing -- we are beginning to see. StubHub is bringing new, differentiated experiences to fans. Classifies continues to grow, launching new experiences and testing innovative ways to connect buyers and sellers, and there is more innovation coming. Financially, Q1 was a solid start to 2016 as we delivered on our commitments with revenue and EPS above guidance. We're on target with a full year plans to return capital to shareholders, and we are being disciplined in our use of capital and debt while architecting for the long term. And have firmed up our full year outlook.
Underpinning all of these efforts is our focus to drive the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform as we position eBay for long-term success. And now, we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator?"

With regard to structured data, let me just take the opportunity to remind you what we're doing. There are 3 phases to structured data. There is collecting product identifiers, there's processing those identifiers and then there's building user experiences. With regard to collecting product data, we've now expanded that mandate to 60% of our listings. With regard to what we process. That has lagged the 60% because it takes a bit longer and our mandate only expanded in the middle of the quarter, so that's at 38%. And we're beginning to build the product experiences that ultimately are what matter to consumers and sellers and it will drive better business performance. We measure everything rigorously, so I gave a couple of examples on this. All of the experiences that we're already building. One example is we are beginning to move our non-structured data enabled SEO pages to structured data enabled pages. Those pages are now stable to slightly growing at better conversion rates than the 90% of pages that we haven't moved yet, which have been declining for the better part of 18 months. In addition, if you look at our browse pass, these are entirely new experiences, which we're really excited about, not just because it makes for a simpler eBay experience but because I think we're beginning to show what's unique about eBay. When we talk about unique inventory and great deals, historically, they've been hard to find to go and I think what structured data enables us to do is to really surface those in a way that hits consumers right between the eyes so they can see why shop eBay. Just back to your question more directly. I'll say what I always had which is this is a long-term process. There isn't a moment where it's all fixed and everything jumps up. In fact, I think I consistently said that he probably wouldn't be able to really see these experiences until towards the end of this year. So this is a slow process, which will take time but we are definitely seeing progress on that journey. And I say it's going about exactly the way we've explained for the better part of 6 months."

Let me start with mobile. Let me remind you that we did something very substantial, which was for our long-term success last September, and that was to replatform our mobile experience so that we didn't have multiple groups developing for multiple mobile operating systems. We're now on a common platform where we can speed up and scale. With that said, we did disrupt our ecosystem a bit as we signaled on the last couple of quarters, and we're pretty clear about why that happen. It was a couple of different issues. There were a couple of UI changes. There was a bit of speed decline in the app itself, and we've been iterating on that and we've been in testing, as I said in my remarks, and you can expect a significant new app release very soon. With that said, this isn't going to get solved and it's not a one-shot deal. The fact that we're on that common platform means we'll iterate quickly. But I say we have growing confidence that we'll get back to a really strong track on mobile soon. With regard to the second part of your question, it actually has nothing to do with Google's right rail changes. We were an early adopter of PLAs so their changes on the right rail don't impact us at all. The SEO challenge really stem all the way back to May of '14 when if you remember without a structured data underpinning, our pages that we exposed to search engines, not just Google but all search engines, were not really attached to our Marketplace. And there was a significant penalty that really has continued for the better part of 18 months. In many ways, that was the impetus to move to re-platforming the business so that the new pages that we put on, which now represents 10% of traffic, are on a much more stable foundation. So for us, SEO is -- I mean I don't think it's just the day-in and day-out challenges. There's a major challenge, we should we are addressing head-on with a long re-platforming around structured data and it will take time. But we are seeing progress there."

And then as he moved down the tail, you get things that aren't just version unique, you get things that are completely unique like collectibles and rare items, and that's an important part of who we are. So obviously, we're going to sell a lot of different things and we will sell commoditized items. But the reality to the question before about competition is not all competition is the same. Where it is commoditized items obviously that's where competition is the greatest, we still sell a lot of it but that's where the competitive environment impacts us the most. In many ways, that's why we want to move to being sharply different and moving to being distinct and moving to doing the things that only be can do, and that's our strategy.

Look, I don't -- we don't wake up in the morning and declare that we're a growth or profitability company. Our job is to grow value for shareholders, right, growing over time the free cash flow the business. We want to grow faster. We are not managing to a lower growth rate. What we're doing is making investments that we think are really important for the long-term of the business like the re-platforming. The hope obviously is that when we get that done, we can push the efficient frontier of growth and profitability out. In other words we can grow faster and maintain reasonable margins. I don't look at it as black and white. I think where we see good opportunities, we should invest in them. That doesn't mean I think -- we have 3 to 4 quarters now under our belt, people understand we're not simply going to collapse the financial architecture and swing wildly at things and grow at all costs. But I also want to be clear that I'll invest in opportunities where we see them. We're running the company not for a quarter or a year. We're running the company to both the next 20 years of eBay. So that means being disciplined but also investing in opportunities that expand what we do and grow the business. With regard to the structured data part of your question, I -- yes, I appreciate you saying this because we have been very consistent saying it will take time and it will be gradual. I think today, if you look at our prepared remarks, I just wanted to broaden that lens a little bit. Structured data gets a lot of press but it's not the only thing we're doing. We're actually making a substantial number of changes for the company from the way we're organized to the way we acquire inventory to the way we replatform to the way to expose that inventory in the product. I think you'll see parts of the eBay shopping experience change more in the next several months than they have arguably years. So there's a lot to into what we're doing. And obviously for us, we hope that if we do that, fast-forward couple of years from now, it's a different business and it's a business that's growing faster. That's our hope."

With regard to the site experience, there's a couple of examples that we've included in the attached slides. I think that, to step back from the slides for a second, there are -- there is amazing inventory and amazing deals on eBay, but we've been really honest saying that they're not always easy to find. We've had one tool in our search toolbox and that's been search. And if it doesn't show up in the first 8 listings in search, oftentimes there are incredible things that consumers want that they can't find it. And to be honest, that's gotten worse with mobile because consumers patience on 3.5 inches of real estate is a lot less than it is on a desktop. So the whole effort here is to improve discoverability. If you look at some of these new browse pages we're building, it's really simple. We will show you the best deal. We'll show you the best brand. We'll show you the best price. We want to make things really bulletproof and very, very simple, particularly in a world that's going all mobile. So for me, that's what -- there's a lot under the covers about how we're re-platforming but it's about a great, simple, elegant consumer experience that exposes the best of what we're about, which is our vast inventory. With regard to the marketing spend, we are experimenting more, as I said last quarter, up the funnel. Right now, it's experimentation. You'll see us a little bit on television. You'll see us in other areas this quarter. But to be clear, that's not -- we're not materially increasing our marketing spend at this point. We are repurposing spend that was down the funnel to up the funnel. And what we're doing is we're testing. You'll see a lot of media mix testing. We're trying to figure out the efficient frontier of what we can do. And I don't want to do any significant brand work until the product has gotten -- has moved on because what I don't want to do is spend a lot of money to bring people if our user experience is changing. So as the user experience evolves and as we get more comfortable that we're -- it'll never be -- we're never done but as we get closer to where we think we're going to be, we'll consider leaning it to that spend and doing more. But my view right now is that, that would come out of -- we spend a lot on marketing in this business. There's plenty of allocated spend that we can reallocate to go at that. If we think there's an opportunity to do more of these, the other question, we'll do it. With regards to auction, Scott, do want to take that question?"

And what we said for 2016 was we would continue on a pace consistent with that, plus offsetting dilution. And we have, in effect, offset the dilution in Q1 in addition to $500 million to $600 million a quarter. And we're not changing our expectations and our guidance for the rest of the year. With regards to Q2 guidance, a few thoughts. Seasonally, we do experience a deceleration in EPS from Q1 to Q2 and much like we saw last year, it's really a combination of -- not only our revenue obviously, but our expense profile. And, as such, the guidance is 40 to 42. A couple of points worth noting. First off, the guidance to your question assumes spot rates as of today. I don't -- I'm not -- you shouldn't read anything into that other than we put spot rates as of today because it's relatively upon us. And within that, we've also guided to the 4% to 6% revenue. A couple of things within the cost base. One, we don't have any favorability expected from another insurance favorability in G&A, and so I would expect G&A to pop back up as a percentage of revenue for Q2 and then for the rest of the year, that sort of normalizes because we'll be past stand up. And then secondly, below the line, we're going to get an impact from the incremental debt that we put on in Q1, and so that's factored into the guidance as well."

I mean, to be honest, since sanctions over a year ago and the collapse of the foreign exchange rate, our Russia business has not been at all strong. As you would imagine with an important business and a collapsed ruble, and I don't see that changing. It's a tiny bit of our business. And we did -- we are maintaining what we're doing there in the hope that at some point, it turns around. The future in Russia for eCommerce should be bright. And if it's growing well, there's scarcity of supply. There are very good dynamics and we've laid the railroad tracks. But if you ask me how our business is today, it's -- of the better part of the year it's been a disaster given the sanctions and currency devaluation. But it really doesn't show up in our overall results, it's so small. On the macro, what we said overall, it's stable. We did see, as we said last quarter, a little bit of softness in December. When you look at the quarter -- at Q1, there was really nothing to see here. It was pretty stable. Any softness we saw was remediated. And as a portfolio, it's kind of steady sideways. It's not inspiring global growth but a steady global growth. Obviously there's puts and takes in that. We have a global business like Apple does. Brazil has -- some Latin American countries have been weak. We're seeing a little bit better macro impact in Europe. It's a mix effect as it always is. But if you step back and look at the overall, we really haven't seen much change over the last 90 days."

Have -- with this foundation now going in place, we can pick up the pace on what we built on the foundation. This is still going to take a lot of time. I want to go back to first question I received. I want to make sure that the expectation is set. There's not a moment in time when all of a sudden, all of eBay is rebuilt and growth explodes. It doesn't work that way. This is a huge marketplace. There are -- it's an enormous buyer and seller base and we have to proceed with some caution. But I like where we are because the foundation is being laid. And now we can iterate at ways we just haven't been able to do before. So you're going to see a new suite new suite of apps soon. You're going to see new browse apps soon. You're going to see new SEO pages soon. You're going to see us start to go on offense and launch a couple of new category soon. All that's in the guidance. None of that is going to materially move things in the short run but it's evidence that we're moving from more of a defensive platforming to more of an offense to run the business. With regard to your channel discussion, it's a great lead into 2 quarters ago I said, regardless of our SEO issues and fixing SEO, for the long-term success of this business, we have got to diversify our traffic and user acquisition. eBay has had 2 major irons in the fire, which is CRM and search outside of its majority which come directly to our apps and into our site. But the new user acquisition has been dominated by search and by e-mail. And that has to change. Healthy eBay has gotten multiple competing channels for our investment dollar. And 2 quarters ago, I said that social, we're going to invest in it. It's early, it's not simple to get returns on social. And now fast-forward 2 quarters later and we're getting some somewhere on social. We're now in 14 different channels. We're working with all the big social players. I think if you ask them, we'd say we're being aggressive and even leading eCommerce efforts on many of those channels. It's still very small. As a competitive. If you have all those 14 channels, it's a tiny fraction of what we get from search but it's growing fast and we're starting to get some traction in the areas like I mentioned today like Snapchat and other channels where we are showing the ability to spend and acquire users and traffic. So that's encouraging. Again, it'll take time but we're starting to get somewhere. The third part of the question?"

GMV on our Marketplace platform grew 4% year-over-year, and StubHub and Classifieds both had strong performances, growing revenue at 34% and 17%, respectively.
Finally, we continue to be good capital stewards repurchasing $1 billion worth of our stock at attractive prices and acquiring new technology and talent to bolster our motors vertical. Repositioning our business for long-term success is a multiyear journey, and my focus is to drive the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform, while deliver growth and opportunistically returning capital to shareholders. Three quarters into our new strategy and one quarter into 2016, we are making progress on executing our plan.
First, our effort to drive best choice is about providing the greatest selection of inventory for our consumers. This encompasses new everyday items to rare and unique goods, with incredible deals you can only find on eBay. We've aligned our regional organizations more closely against our key verticals, which in turn enables them to think and act more like merchants. In Q1, we continued to increase the inventory available on our platform, with over 900 million live listings available at anytime. We're also working to bring even more unique and differentiated inventory by acquiring new small business sellers and brands. In Q1, we announced integration partnerships with BigCommerce and inkFrog, enabling sellers to more easily list their inventory directly on eBay and access our enormous global buyer base. We also launched brands like Vince Camuto and Samsonite on our U.S. platform and I'm excited to announce we just signed a partnership with Adidas to open showrooms on eBay across our key European markets later this year. In addition to these efforts, you can expect several exciting new category launches soon.
Next, having the most relevance means the shopping experience that is simple, data-driven and personalized. We intend to deliver a differentiated eBay shopping experience that enables buyers to find, compare and purchase items they need and want and to clearly understand the unique value that eBay brings. One of the key foundational changes we're making to our Marketplace platform to drive the most relevance is to shift to be more product-based. This initiative, which we call structured data, is how we're organizing our vast inventory and beginning to better aggregate insight into supply and demand. This is ultimately the foundation on which we'll build better user experiences and improve discoverability on and off eBay.
In Q1, we rolled out the second phase of our mandate for sellers to provide product data when selling on our platform, going live in France, Italy and Spain for the first time, while also increasing coverage to 8 more categories. This brings our mandate coverage to find us the percentage of addressable live listings where product identifiers require to approximately 60%. We've also continued to make progress in our data processing efforts. However, that effort does tend to trail the expansion of the mandate by a quarter or 2. In Q1, we added 16 million unique products to our catalog in addition to 1.6 million new user product reviews. Now, while most of our early efforts with this initiative have focused primarily on our sellers and our inventory, enabling improved buyer experiences is what will ultimately drive value in our ecosystem. It also takes the longest to get right, but we're making progress in some early use cases that give us confidence that we're on the right track.
Browsing on eBay is one example of where we started to change our shopping experience in ways that we have not previously been able to. We recently launched an entirely new browse experience, which takes advantage of our structured data catalog, enabling us to instantly surface products with great savings, best-selling items and more. In this experience, consumers can easily navigate to shop by brand or see our best deals. This is a great example of how eBay is enabling people to find their version of perfect, the right product at a great price, one click away. Search on eBay is also starting to benefit from our efforts in this area. We recently launched the ability for users to search on eBay using a product identifier directly in the search bar, quickly returning relevant items.
Finally, we're making progress on building new product and search pages, which are starting to drive healthy SEO traffic from search engines. While SEO traffic from nonstructured data pages continues to decline, we've been able to offset much of that decline by shifting traffic to these new pages, which now represent 10% of total SEO traffic with higher overall conversion rates.
Mobile is another key area of focus for us. Our mobile team has been hard at work on a new mobile release, which is currently in testing. We'll roll this out more broadly to customers soon and we'll rapidly iterate that to get our mobile experience back on a strong track. Looking forward, you will see us adopt a more consistent cadence of iteration on mobile throughout the course of 2016.
Having the most relevance also means ensuring that we're present where buyers are spending time online. As part of this, we continue to build upon our effort to diversify our traffic and leverage social channels more heavily. We recently became the first brand to test an audience match campaign on Snapchat, and we've seen great engagement thus far amongst Snapchat's large, active community. And we just announced the pilot integration that enables eBay users to receive activity notifications through Facebook Messenger.
Finally, the third main area of focus for us this year is to deliver the most powerful selling platform, enabling a simple selling experience for our business and consumer sellers. In Q1, we rolled out the new seller standards that were announced last fall. And we recently announced our spring seller update, with a significant investment into our anchor store benefits and planned improvements later this year to our suite of APIs and the availability of eBay-branded shipping supplies. Over 25,000 sellers are now using our new Seller Hub data to manage their businesses, providing them with the tools and data needed to manage their selling activities in one convenient place. We'll be rolling Seller Hub out to all of our sellers this summer. We also continue to scale our eBay Valet service to enable consumer sellers with a simple yet powerful way to approach selling on eBay. And we expanded our partnership with Shift in Q1, further simplifying the selling experience on eBay by enabling your sold items to be picked up at your home and packed and shipped for you.
Elsewhere in our business, StubHub is enjoying strong growth while driving innovative user experiences. StubHub continues to benefit from product experience changes we made in Q3 last year in addition to having a strong concert and sports landscape in Q1. We also made several enhancements to the StubHub user experience in the quarter, including a new recommendation engine, which enables users to quickly determine the best value for their tickets. And we recently launched a test of virtual reality technology, which enables fans to get an immersive view from available seats.
Our Classifieds platform saw accelerating growth, primarily driven by strength across our portfolio in Germany and with Gumtree in the U.K. In Germany, the acquisition last year of the leading European motors enthusiast community, Motor Talk, has enabled us to further enhance our market-leading presence in the motor's vertical. In the U.K., we launched a complete redesign of the Gumtree experience in Q1.
In summary, we are making progress on our strategy and on the financial framework we laid out in January. The product experience flywheel is clicking into gear and over the next 2 quarters, we expect to make significant progress on launching new user experiences. I look forward to updating you along the way as we continue to reposition eBay's business for long-term growth and success.
With that, let me turn it over to Scott to provide more details on our Q1 results."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 10.
As Devin summarized, our focus is to drive the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform while delivering on our financial commitment and positioning eBay for long-term success. When I reflect on the last 9 months of executing our new strategy, I feel good about the progress we are making and the stability we are seeing in the business. At the same time, it is important to keep in mind our progress. Due to the scale of our global Marketplace, it will take time for the green shoots we are seeking to start materially impacting the business.
While we execute our plan, we will continue to deliver what we promised. In Q1, we generated $2.1 billion of total revenue, $0.47 of non-GAAP EPS, $483 million in free cash flow and we repurchased $1 billion of our stock.
Let's start at the top of the funnel with Q1 active buyers on Slide 11. We added over 800,000 active buyers in Q1, growing trailing 12-month active buyers by 4%. As we discussed, we look at active buyers in 3 cohorts: retain, reactivated, and new. Growth in retained and reactivated buyers remain stable as we utilized marketing programs and promotions to drive engagement and retention. However, SEO headwinds continue impacting new buyer acquisition, driving 1 point of deceleration versus Q4.
On Slide 12, we enabled $20.5 billion of GMV in Q1, growing 5% versus last year. By geography, the U.S. generated $8.5 billion of GMV, up 3%, while international delivered $12 billion of GMV, up 6%.
Moving to revenue. We delivered net revenues of $2.1 billion, up 6% versus last year and accelerating 1 point versus Q4. We generated $1.7 billion of transaction revenue, up 3%, and $460 million of marketing services revenue, up 19%.
Transitioning to our Marketplaces platform on Slide 14, Q1 GMV grew 4% year-over-year in line with the prior quarter. While we face the ongoing challenges of SEO, the continued impact of mobile headwinds and the pressure on our C2C business, we are encouraged by delivering stable quarter-over-quarter growth. Total revenue for Marketplaces platform grew 3%, accelerating 2 points versus Q4. Transaction revenue grew 1%, up 1 point sequentially driven by international acceleration. 
In the U.S., we invested more heavily in contra revenue this quarter as we continuously experiment with a wide variety of promotions to see what is most effective in driving customer lifetime value. However, our global transaction take rate was flat versus Q4, as the increase in U.S. contra revenue was offset by a decrease internationally.
Marketing services revenue grew 19%, accelerating 10 points over Q4. U.S. advertising contributed to the strong quarter as a result of growing our mobile ad placements and improving yield in programmatic display ads. In addition, the PayPal operating agreement is included in our MS&O revenue stream, adding 10 points of growth year-over-year.
Moving to Slide 15. Q1 was another standout quarter for StubHub. We delivered GMV growth of 29% and we grew revenue by 34%. We had a strong quarter in sports and concerts in addition to launching a number of product innovations like ticket recommendations, which helped fans find the best value for the tickets they want.
In addition, we continue to see the impact of the product improvements launched last August, including pricing display changes and our updated mobile app. While we're very excited about the direction StubHub is headed, it's important to keep in mind we will start lapping the favorable comps from some of those changes in Q3.
In Q1, Classifieds delivered a strong quarter of growth, up 17% year-over-year, accelerating 3 points versus Q4. The strong performance in Q1 was driven by our sites in developed markets such as eBay Kleinanzeigen and Mobileye in Germany and Gumtree in the U.K. In addition, we launched in-app chat for our mobile experience, allowing buyers and sellers to message each other and facilitate even easier, faster buying experience.
We also further extended our vertical experience in Kijiji Canada with motors and housing. Finally, we continue to deepen the connection between our Marketplace and Classifieds platforms. We are piloting a number of different programs regionally, including exposing listings from eBay on our [indiscernible] properties and providing a tool for C2C sellers to identify which platform can help them realize the best price.
Turning to Slide 17 and major cost drivers. Cost of revenue increased 240 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by the addition of PayPal processing cost and increased investment insight availability. Q1 sales and marketing expense was relatively flat year-over-year, while product development increased 50 basis points, driven by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.
G&A was flat year-over-year, and standup costs were offset by a one-time insurance recovery. Pulling all of that together, we delivered a Q1 operating margin of 33.4%, down 220 basis points versus last year. Operating leverage in transaction losses in the insurance recoveries were more than offset by the increase in cost of revenue as well as the impact of foreign exchange and standup cost, which has cost us roughly 140 and 100 basis points, respectively. I'd like to take a moment to update you on our hedging strategy.
On our Q2 earnings call last July, I explained that our revenue was fully exposed to movements in currency, and that for 2015, we had implemented hedging strategies to economically protect our full year net income, some of which left us exposed to potential volatility in our quarterly results.
In 2016, our revenue remains fully exposed to movements in currency. We have implemented hedging strategies that allow us to limit the potential quarterly volatility and minimize the effects of FX in our current year earnings. Based on how those strategies are accounted for, we will see the impact of hedging cost -- hedging gains and losses in operating margin and OI&E, while net income is economically protected.
Moving to Slide 18. In Q1, we delivered $0.47 in non-GAAP EPS, down $0.01 versus Q1 2015, as revenue growth, the impact of shareholder -- share repurchases and cost control were more than offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and standup cost. The impact of the stronger U.S. dollar cost us roughly $0.03 of EPS and stand-up cost an additional $0.01.
On Slide 19. In Q1, we generated free cash flow of $483 million, up 19%, largely due to higher cash earnings driven by an increase in revenue and lapping separation-related cost incurred last year. CapEx was 7% of revenue in Q1 and our full year CapEx guidance remains 7% to 9%.
Moving to Slide 20. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $10.3 billion, including $3.4 billion in the U.S. As a reminder, our capital allocation policy is designed to manage the capital structure that optimizes our financial flexibility, access to debt and our cost of capital to drive long-term shareholder value. After retiring $850 million of debt last year, we accessed the debt markets in Q1, raising $2.25 billion in debt. We plan to use the debt for general corporate purposes as well as share repurchases and M&A activity. We remain a strong BBB credit-rated company with a gross debt to EBITDA ratio of below 3x. And we believe we are well capitalized with the means to deliver our current plans.
We will continue to be an acquisitive company, disciplined in our approach, utilizing M&A for geographical expansion and tech and talent acquisition. Over the last 9 months, we have made a few small acquisitions that fall under these categories, the most recent being the acquisition of Cargigi that we announced in March, a great addition to our eBay motors platform.
In Q1, we repurchased 42.3 million shares at an average price of $23.67 per share, amounting to $1 billion in repurchases. We ended the quarter with $800 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. We remain on track with our full year plans for share repurchases as I laid out in our last earnings call.
Moving to guidance on Slide 21. For Q2, we are projecting revenue between $2.14 billion and $2.19 billion using today's spot rates, growing 4% to 6% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.40 to $0.42 per share, representing negative 5% to 0% growth year-over-year. EPS growth is impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar, which in Q2 will cost us $0.02 of EPS, and stand-up costs, which cost an additional $0.01. For the full year, we are raising the low end of revenue guidance to 3%, bringing our new guidance range to 3% to 5% or $8.6 billion to $8.8 billion as reported. While the U.S. dollar has weakened since we provided guidance last quarter, we have not assumed the entire benefit in our full year guidance. A relatively small movement in rate can have a significant impact on our second half revenue. And given the recent volatility and catalysts that could generate more movement, we felt the best approach is not to count on the upside at this time. If recent spot rates do hold for the rest of the year, we estimate that all else equal, there will be roughly $80 million of upside to our second half and thus, full year revenue. All other full year guidance remains the same.
In closing, we are executing the plans we discussed for our Marketplace platform. It will take time, but we're encouraged by some of the green shoots we are experiencing -- we are beginning to see. StubHub is bringing new, differentiated experiences to fans. Classifieds continues to grow, launching new experiences and testing innovative ways to connect buyers and sellers, and there is more innovation coming. Financially, Q1 was a solid start to 2016 as we delivered on our commitments with revenue and EPS above guidance. We're on target with our full year plans to return capital to shareholders, and we are being disciplined in our use of capital and debt, while architecting for the long-term. And have firmed up our full year outlook.
Underpinning all of these efforts is our focus to drive the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform as we position eBay for long-term success. And now, we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator?"

With regard to structured data, let me just take the opportunity to remind you what we're doing. There are 3 phases to structured data. There is collecting product identifiers, there's processing those identifiers and then there's building user experiences. With regard to collecting product data, we've now expanded that mandate to 60% of our listings. With regard to what we process, that has lagged the 60% because it takes a bit longer and our mandate only expanded in the middle of the quarter, so that's at 38%. And we're beginning to build the product experiences that ultimately are what matter to consumers and sellers and that will drive better business performance. We measure everything rigorously, so I gave a couple of examples on this call of the experiences that we're already building. One example is, we're beginning to move our nonstructured data enabled SEO pages to structured data enabled pages. Those pages are now stable to slightly growing at better conversion rates than the 90% of pages that we haven't moved yet, which have been declining for the better part of 18 months. In addition, if you look at our browse pass, these are entirely new experiences, which we're really excited about, not just because it makes for a simpler eBay experience, but because I think we're beginning to show what's unique about eBay. When we talk about unique inventory and great deals, historically, they've been hard to find. And I think what structured data enables us to do is to really surface those in a way that hits consumers right between the eyes so they can see why shop eBay. Just back to your question more directly. I'll say what I have always had which is this is a long-term process. There isn't a moment where it's all fixed and everything jumps up. In fact, I think I consistently said that you probably wouldn't be able to really see these experiences until towards the end of this year. So this is a slow process, which will take time, but we are definitely seeing progress on that journey. And I'd say it's going about exactly the way we've explained for the better part of 6 months."

Let me start with mobile. Let me remind you that we did something very substantial, which was for our long-term success last September, and that was to replatform our mobile experience so that we didn't have multiple groups developing for multiple mobile operating systems. We're now on a common platform where we can speed up and scale. With that said, we did disrupt our ecosystem a bit as we signaled on the last couple of quarters, and we're pretty clear about why that happened. It was a couple of different issues. There were a couple of UI changes. There was a bit of speed decline in the app itself, and we've been iterating on that and we've been in testing, as I said in my remarks, and you can expect a significant new app release very soon. With that said, this isn't going to get solved and it's not a one-shot deal. The fact that we're on that common platform means we'll iterate quickly. But I'd say, we have growing confidence that we'll get back to a really strong track on mobile soon. With regard to the second part of your question, it actually has nothing to do with Google's right rail changes. We were an early adopter of PLAs so their changes on the right rail don't impact us at all. The SEO challenges really stem all the way back to May of '14 when if you remember without a structured data underpinning, our pages that we exposed to search engines, not just Google, but all search engines, were not really attached to our Marketplace. And there was a significant penalty that really has continued for the better part of 18 months. In many ways, that was the impetus to move to re-platforming the business so that the new pages that we put on, which now represent 10% of traffic, are on a much more stable foundation. So for us, SEO is -- I mean, I don't think it's just the day-in and day-out challenges, there's a major challenge, which we're addressing head-on with a long re-platforming around structured data and it will take time, but we are seeing progress there."

And how might that traject towards better growth in 2017-2018, when you have more leverage in the sort of noncommoditized products and subsectors that you want long-term leverage to? And maybe a second question, on more of a housekeeping matter, but we haven't been able to find the EPS guide for the full year on either the slides or the press release.

With regard to -- look, we are a very large Marketplace with last year, $85 billion of sales, so we sell a lot of everything, let's be clear. But ultimately, our success will not be the 9th party reselling an electronics device at razor thin margins, there'll be plenty of people doing that. What's unique about eBay is the spectrum of value, the choices that you get. It's not just that new iPhone, it's the used iPhone, it's a manufacturer refurb, it's 11 versions in between, that frankly only sit in our Marketplace. And then as you moved down the tail, you get things that aren't just version unique, you get things that are completely unique like collectibles and rare items, and that's an important part of who we are. So obviously, we're going to sell a lot of different things and we will sell commoditized items. But the reality to the question before about competition is not all competition is the same. Where it is commoditized items obviously that's where competition is the greatest, we still sell a lot of it, but that's where the competitive environment impacts us the most. In many ways, that's why we want to move to being sharply different and moving to being distinct and moving to doing the things that only we can do, and that's our strategy. So there's no doubt that there is a headwind from what I call commoditized items that require instant shipping. I don't think that's a lot of things. But that is in our strategy. And we're not going to compete by being a logistics company. We're going to compete by giving people the greatest choice, the greatest deals and unique value, that's who we are. Scott, can answer the EPS question."

Look, I don't -- we don't wake up in the morning and declare that we're a growth or a profitability company. Our job is to grow value for shareholders, right, growing over time the free cash flow of the business. We want to grow faster. We are not managing to a lower growth rate. What we're doing is making investments that we think are really important for the long-term of the business like the re-platforming. The hope obviously is that when we get that done, we can push the efficient frontier of growth and profitability out. In other words, we can grow faster and maintain reasonable margins. I don't look at it as black and white. I think that where we see good opportunities, we should invest in them. That doesn't mean I think with 3 to 4 quarters now under our belt, people understand we're not simply going to collapse the financial architecture and swing wildly at things and grow at all costs. But I also want to be clear that I'll invest in opportunities where we see them. We're running the company not for a quarter or a year, we're running the company to build the next 20 years of eBay. So that means being disciplined, but also investing in opportunities that are -- can expand what we do and grow the business. With regard to the structured data part of your question, I -- yes, I appreciate you saying that because we have been very consistent saying it will take time and it will be gradual. I think today, if you look at our prepared remarks, I just wanted to broaden that lens a little bit. Structured data gets a lot of press, but it's not the only thing we're doing. We're actually making a substantial number of changes for the company from the way we're organized to the way we acquire inventory to the way we replatform to the way we expose that inventory in the product. I think you'll see parts of the eBay shopping experience change more in the next several months than they have arguably in years. So there's a lot into what we're doing. And obviously for us, we hope that if we do that, fast-forward a couple of years from now, it's a different business and it's a business that's growing faster. That's our hope."

With regard to the site experience, there's a couple of examples that we've included in the attached slides. I think that, to step back from the slides for a second, there are -- there is amazing inventory and amazing deals on eBay, but we've been really honest saying that they're not always easy to find. We've had one tool in our toolbox and that's been search. And if it doesn't show up in the first 8 listings in search, oftentimes there are incredible things that consumers want, but they can't find it. And to be honest, that's gotten worse with mobile because consumers patience on 3.5 inches of real estate is a lot less than it is on a desktop. So the whole effort here is to improve discoverability. If you look at some of these new browse pages we're building, it's really simple. We will show you the best deal. We'll show you the best brand. We'll show you the best price. We want to make things really bulletproof and very, very simple, particularly in a world that's going all mobile. So for me, that's what -- there's a lot under the covers about how we're re-platforming, but it's about a great, simple, elegant consumer experience that exposes the best of what we're about, which is our vast inventory. With regard to the marketing spend, we are experimenting more, as I said last quarter, up the funnel. Right now, it's experimentation. You'll see us a little bit on television. You'll see us in other areas this quarter. But to be clear, that's not -- we're not materially increasing our marketing spend at this point. We are repurposing spend that was down the funnel to up the funnel. And what we're doing is, we're testing. You'll see a lot of media mix testing. We're trying to figure out the efficient frontier of what we can do. And I don't want to do any significant brand work until the product has gotten -- has moved on. Because what I don't want to do is spend a lot of money to bring people into a user experience that's changing. So as the user experience evolves and as we get more comfortable that we're -- it'll never be -- we're never done, but as we get closer to where we think we're going to be, we'll consider leaning into that spend and doing more. But my view right now is that, that would come out of -- we spend a lot on marketing this business. There's plenty of allocated spend that we can reallocate to go at that. If we think there's an opportunity to do vis-à-vis, the other question, we'll do it. With regards to auction, Scott, I don't know, do want to take that question?"

And we have, in effect, offset the dilution in Q1 in addition to the $500 million to $600 million per quarter. And we're not changing our expectations and our guidance for the rest of the year. With regards to Q2 guidance, maybe a few thoughts. Seasonally, we do experience a deceleration in EPS from Q1 to Q2 and much like we saw last year, it's really a combination of, not only our revenue obviously, but our expense profile. And, as such, the guidance is 40% to 42%. A couple of points worth noting. First off, the guidance to your question assumes spot rates as of today. I don't -- I'm not -- you shouldn't read anything into that other than we put spot rates as of today because it's relatively upon us. And within that, we've also guided to the 4% to 6% revenue. A couple of things within the cost base. One, we don't have any favorability expected from another insurance favorability in G&A, and so I would expect G&A to pop back up as a percentage of revenue for Q2 and then for the rest of the year, that sort of normalizes because we'll be past stand up. And then secondly, below the line, we're going to get an impact from the incremental debt that we put on in Q1, and so that's factored into the guidance as well."

I mean, if it's growing well, there's scarcity of supply. There are very good dynamics and we've laid the railroad tracks. But if you ask me how our business is today, it's -- of the better part of the year it's been a disaster given the sanctions and the currency devaluation. But it really doesn't show up in our overall results, it's so small. On the macro, what we said, overall, it's stable. We did see, as we said last quarter, a little bit of softness in December. When you look at the quarter -- at Q1, there was really nothing to see here. It was pretty stable. Any softness we saw was remediated. And as a portfolio, it's kind of steady sideways. It's not inspiring global growth, but a steady global growth. Obviously, there's puts and takes in that. We have a global business like Apple does. Brazil has -- some Latin American countries have been weak. We're seeing a little bit better macro impact in Europe. It's a mix effect as it always is.

I want to -- back to first question I received, I want to make sure that the expectations are set, that there's not a moment in time when all of a sudden, all of eBay is rebuilt and growth explodes. It doesn't work that way. This is a huge marketplace. There are -- it's an enormous buyer and seller base and we have to proceed with some caution. But I like where we are because the foundation is being laid. And now we can iterate in ways we just haven't been able to do before. So you're going to see a new suite of apps soon. You're going to see new browse apps soon. You're going to see new SEO pages soon. You're going to see us start to go on offense and launch a couple of new categories soon. All that's in the guidance. None of that is going to materially move things in the short run, but it's evidence that we're moving from more of a defensive platforming to more of an offensive to run the business. With regard to your channel discussion, it's a great lead into 2 quarters ago I said, regardless of our SEO issues and fixing SEO, for the long-term success of this business, we have got to diversify our traffic and user acquisition. eBay has had 2 major irons in the fire, which is CRM and search outside of its majority which come directly to our apps into our site. But the new user acquisition has been dominated by search and by e-mail. And that has to change. A healthy eBay has gotten multiple competing channels for our marginal investment dollar. And 2 quarters ago, I said that social, we're going to invest in it. It's early, it's not simple to get returns on social. And now fast-forward 2 quarters later and we're getting somewhere on social. We're now in 14 different channels. We're working with all the big social players. I think if you ask them, we'd say we're being aggressive and even leading eCommerce efforts on many of those channels. It's still very small. As a comparative, if you add all those 14 channels up, it's a tiny fraction of what we get from search, but it's growing fast. And we're starting to get some traction in areas like I mentioned today like Snapchat and other channels where we are showing the ability to spend and acquire users and traffic. So that's encouraging. Again, it'll take time, but we're starting to get somewhere. The third part of the question?"

In Q1, we delivered our third quarter in a row of solid results. Our business continues to consistently grow, while we make progress against our key strategic objectives.

Our business continues to consistently grow, while we make progress against our key strategic objectives. Overall total GMV was up 5% for the quarter, while revenue was up 6%. We grew active buyers 4% year-over-year, adding 6 million buyers to our platforms over the past year. GMV on our Marketplace platform grew 4% year-over-year, and StubHub and Classifieds both had strong performances, growing revenue at 34% and 17%, respectively.
Finally, we continue to be good capital stewards repurchasing $1 billion worth of our stock at attractive prices and acquiring new technology and talent to bolster our motors vertical. Repositioning our business for long-term success is a multiyear journey, and my focus is to drive the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform, while delivering growth and opportunistically returning capital to shareholders. Three quarters into our new strategy and one quarter into 2016, we are making progress on executing our plan.
First, our effort to drive best choice is about providing the greatest selection of inventory for our consumers. This encompasses new everyday items to rare and unique goods, with incredible deals you can only find on eBay. We've aligned our regional organizations more closely against our key verticals, which in turn enables them to think and act more like merchants. In Q1, we continued to increase the inventory available on our platform, with over 900 million live listings available at anytime. We're also working to bring even more unique and differentiated inventory by acquiring new small business sellers and brands. In Q1, we announced integration partnerships with BigCommerce and inkFrog, enabling sellers to more easily list their inventory directly on eBay and access our enormous global buyer base. We also launched brands like Vince Camuto and Samsonite on our U.S. platform and I'm excited to announce we just signed a partnership with Adidas to open showrooms on eBay across our key European markets later this year. In addition to these efforts, you can expect several exciting new category launches soon.
Next, having the most relevance means the shopping experience that is simple, data-driven and personalized. We intend to deliver a differentiated eBay shopping experience that enables buyers to find, compare and purchase items they need and want and to clearly understand the unique value that eBay brings. One of the key foundational changes we're making to our Marketplace platform to drive the most relevance is to shift to be more product-based. This initiative, which we call structured data, is how we're organizing our vast inventory and beginning to better aggregate insight into supply and demand. This is ultimately the foundation on which we'll build better user experiences and improve discoverability on and off eBay.
In Q1, we rolled out the second phase of our mandate for sellers to provide product data when selling on our platform, going live in France, Italy and Spain for the first time, while also increasing coverage to 8 more categories. This brings our mandate coverage, defined as the percentage of addressable live listings where product identifiers require to approximately 60%. We've also continued to make progress in our data processing efforts. However, that effort does tend to trail the expansion of the mandate by a quarter or 2. In Q1, we added 16 million unique products to our catalog in addition to 1.6 million new user product reviews. Now, while most of our early efforts with this initiative have focused primarily on our sellers and our inventory, enabling improved buyer experiences is what will ultimately drive value in our ecosystem. It also takes the longest to get right, but we're making progress in some early use cases that give us confidence that we're on the right track.
Browsing on eBay is one example of where we started to change our shopping experience in ways that we have not previously been able to. We recently launched an entirely new browse experience, which takes advantage of our structured data catalog, enabling us to instantly surface products with great savings, best-selling items and more. In this experience, consumers can easily navigate to shop by brand or see our best deals. This is a great example of how eBay is enabling people to find their version of perfect, the right product at a great price, one click away. Search on eBay is also starting to benefit from our efforts in this area. We recently launched the ability for users to search on eBay using a product identifier directly in the search bar, quickly returning relevant items.
Finally, we're making progress on building new product and search pages, which are starting to drive healthy SEO traffic from search engines. While SEO traffic from nonstructured data pages continues to decline, we've been able to offset much of that decline by shifting traffic to these new pages, which now represent 10% of total SEO traffic with higher overall conversion rates.
Mobile is another key area of focus for us. Our mobile team has been hard at work on a new mobile release, which is currently in testing. We'll roll this out more broadly to customers soon and we'll rapidly iterate that to get our mobile experience back on a strong track. Looking forward, you will see us adopt a more consistent cadence of iteration on mobile throughout the course of 2016.
Having the most relevance also means ensuring that we're present where buyers are spending time online. As part of this, we continue to build upon our effort to diversify our traffic and leverage social channels more heavily. We recently became the first brand to test an audience match campaign on Snapchat, and we've seen great engagement thus far amongst Snapchat's large, active community. And we just announced the pilot integration that enables eBay users to receive activity notifications through Facebook Messenger.
Finally, the third main area of focus for us this year is to deliver the most powerful selling platform, enabling a simple selling experience for our business and consumer sellers. In Q1, we rolled out the new seller standards that were announced last fall. And we recently announced our spring seller update, with a significant investment into our anchor store benefits and planned improvements later this year to our suite of APIs and the availability of eBay-branded shipping supplies. Over 25,000 sellers are now using our new Seller Hub data to manage their businesses, providing them with the tools and data needed to manage their selling activities in one convenient place. We'll be rolling Seller Hub out to all of our sellers this summer. We also continue to scale our eBay Valet service to enable consumer sellers with a simple yet powerful way to approach selling on eBay. And we expanded our partnership with Shift in Q1, further simplifying the selling experience on eBay by enabling your sold items to be picked up at your home and packed and shipped for you.
Elsewhere in our business, StubHub is enjoying strong growth while driving innovative user experiences. StubHub continues to benefit from product experience changes we made in Q3 last year in addition to having a strong concert and sports landscape in Q1. We also made several enhancements to the StubHub user experience in the quarter, including a new recommendation engine, which enables users to quickly determine the best value for their tickets. And we recently launched a test of virtual reality technology, which enables fans to get an immersive view from available seats.
Our Classifieds platform saw accelerating growth, primarily driven by strength across our portfolio in Germany and with Gumtree in the U.K. In Germany, the acquisition last year of the leading European motors enthusiast community, Motor Talk, has enabled us to further enhance our market-leading presence in the motor's vertical. In the U.K., we launched a complete redesign of the Gumtree experience in Q1.
In summary, we are making progress on our strategy and on the financial framework we laid out in January. The product experience flywheel is clicking into gear and over the next 2 quarters, we expect to make significant progress on launching new user experiences. I look forward to updating you along the way as we continue to reposition eBay's business for long-term growth and success.
With that, let me turn it over to Scott to provide more details on our Q1 results."

During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 10.
As Devin summarized, our focus is to drive the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform while delivering on our financial commitment and positioning eBay for long-term success. When I reflect on the last 9 months of executing our new strategy, I feel good about the progress we are making and the stability we are seeing in the business. At the same time, it is important to keep in mind our progress. Due to the scale of our global Marketplace, it will take time for the green shoots we are seeing to start materially impacting the business.
While we execute our plan, we will continue to deliver what we promised. In Q1, we generated $2.1 billion of total revenue, $0.47 of non-GAAP EPS, $483 million in free cash flow and we repurchased $1 billion of our stock.
Let's start at the top of the funnel with Q1 active buyers on Slide 11. We added over 800,000 active buyers in Q1, growing trailing 12-month active buyers by 4%. As we discussed, we look at active buyers in 3 cohorts: retain, reactivated, and new. Growth in retained and reactivated buyers remain stable as we utilized marketing programs and promotions to drive engagement and retention. However, SEO headwinds continue impacting new buyer acquisition, driving 1 point of deceleration versus Q4.
On Slide 12, we enabled $20.5 billion of GMV in Q1, growing 5% versus last year. By geography, the U.S. generated $8.5 billion of GMV, up 3%, while international delivered $12 billion of GMV, up 6%.
Moving to revenue. We delivered net revenues of $2.1 billion, up 6% versus last year and accelerating 1 point versus Q4. We generated $1.7 billion of transaction revenue, up 3%, and $460 million of marketing services revenue, up 19%.
Transitioning to our Marketplaces platform on Slide 14, Q1 GMV grew 4% year-over-year, in line with the prior quarter. While we face the ongoing challenges of SEO, the continued impact of mobile headwinds and the pressure on our C2C business, we are encouraged by delivering stable quarter-over-quarter growth. Total revenue for Marketplaces platform grew 3%, accelerating 2 points versus Q4. Transaction revenue grew 1%, up 1 point sequentially driven by international acceleration. 
In the U.S., we invested more heavily in contra revenue this quarter as we continuously experiment with a wide variety of promotions to see what is most effective in driving customer lifetime value. However, our global transaction take rate was flat versus Q4, as the increase in U.S. contra revenue was offset by a decrease internationally.
Marketing services revenue grew 19%, accelerating 10 points over Q4. U.S. advertising contributed to the strong quarter as a result of growing our mobile ad placements and improving yield in programmatic display ads. In addition, the PayPal operating agreement is included in our MS&O revenue stream, adding 10 points of growth year-over-year.
Moving to Slide 15. Q1 was another standout quarter for StubHub. We delivered GMV growth of 29% and we grew revenue by 34%. We had a strong quarter in sports and concerts in addition to launching a number of product innovations like ticket recommendations, which helped fans find the best value for the tickets they want.
In addition, we continue to see the impact of the product improvements launched last August, including pricing display changes and our updated mobile app. While we're very excited about the direction StubHub is headed, it's important to keep in mind we will start lapping the favorable comps from some of those changes in Q3.
In Q1, Classifieds delivered a strong quarter of growth, up 17% year-over-year, accelerating 3 points versus Q4. The strong performance in Q1 was driven by our sites in developed markets such as eBay Kleinanzeigen and Mobileye in Germany and Gumtree in the U.K. In addition, we launched in-app chat for our mobile experience, allowing buyers and sellers to message each other and facilitate even easier, faster buying experience.
We also further extended our vertical experience in Kijiji Canada with motors and housing. Finally, we continue to deepen the connection between our Marketplace and Classifieds platforms. We are piloting a number of different programs regionally, including exposing listings from eBay on our [indiscernible] properties and providing a tool for C2C sellers to identify which platform can help them realize the best price.
Turning to Slide 17 and major cost drivers. Cost of revenue increased 240 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by the addition of PayPal processing cost and increased investment in site availability. Q1 sales and marketing expense was relatively flat year-over-year, while product development increased 50 basis points, driven by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar.
G&A was flat year-over-year, and standup costs were offset by a one-time insurance recovery. Pulling all of that together, we delivered a Q1 operating margin of 33.4%, down 220 basis points versus last year. Operating leverage in transaction losses and the insurance recoveries were more than offset by the increase in cost of revenue as well as the impact of foreign exchange and standup cost, which has cost us roughly 140 and 100 basis points, respectively. I'd like to take a moment to update you on our hedging strategy.
On our Q2 earnings call last July, I explained that our revenue was fully exposed to movements in currency, and that for 2015, we had implemented hedging strategies to economically protect our full year net income, some of which left us exposed to potential volatility in our quarterly results.
In 2016, our revenue remains fully exposed to movements in currency. We have implemented hedging strategies that allow us to limit the potential quarterly volatility and minimize the effects of FX in our current year earnings. Based on how those strategies are accounted for, we will see the impact of hedging cost -- hedging gains and losses in operating margin and OI&E, while net income is economically protected.
Moving to Slide 18. In Q1, we delivered $0.47 in non-GAAP EPS, down $0.01 versus Q1 2015, as revenue growth, the impact of shareholder -- share repurchases and cost control were more than offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and standup cost. The impact of the stronger U.S. dollar cost us roughly $0.03 of EPS and stand-up cost an additional $0.01.
On Slide 19. In Q1, we generated free cash flow of $483 million, up 19%, largely due to higher cash earnings driven by an increase in revenue and lapping separation-related cost incurred last year. CapEx was 7% of revenue in Q1 and our full year CapEx guidance remains 7% to 9%.
Moving to Slide 20. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $10.3 billion, including $3.4 billion in the U.S. As a reminder, our capital allocation policy is designed to manage the capital structure that optimizes our financial flexibility, access to debt and our cost of capital to drive long-term shareholder value. After retiring $850 million of debt last year, we accessed the debt markets in Q1, raising $2.25 billion in debt. We plan to use the debt for general corporate purposes as well as share repurchases and M&A activity. We remain a strong BBB credit-rated company with a gross debt to EBITDA ratio of below 3x. And we believe we are well capitalized with the means to deliver our current plans.
We will continue to be an acquisitive company, disciplined in our approach, utilizing M&A for geographical expansion and tech and talent acquisition. Over the last 9 months, we have made a few small acquisitions that fall under these categories, the most recent being the acquisition of Cargigi that we announced in March, a great addition to our eBay motors platform.
In Q1, we repurchased 42.3 million shares at an average price of $23.67 per share, amounting to $1 billion in repurchases. We ended the quarter with $800 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. We remain on track with our full year plans for share repurchases as I laid out in our last earnings call.
Moving to guidance on Slide 21. For Q2, we are projecting revenue between $2.14 billion and $2.19 billion using today's spot rates, growing 4% to 6% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.40 to $0.42 per share, representing negative 5% to 0% growth year-over-year. EPS growth is impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar, which in Q2 will cost us $0.02 of EPS, and stand-up costs, which cost an additional $0.01. For the full year, we are raising the low end of revenue guidance to 3%, bringing our new guidance range to 3% to 5% or $8.6 billion to $8.8 billion as reported. While the U.S. dollar has weakened since we provided guidance last quarter, we have not assumed the entire benefit in our full year guidance. A relatively small movement in rate can have a significant impact on our second half revenue. And given the recent volatility and catalysts that could generate more movement, we felt the best approach is not to count on the upside at this time. If recent spot rates do hold for the rest of the year, we estimate that all else equal, there will be roughly $80 million of upside to our second half and thus, full year revenue. All other full year guidance remains the same.
In closing, we are executing the plans we discussed for our Marketplace platform. It will take time, but we're encouraged by some of the green shoots we are experiencing -- we are beginning to see. StubHub is bringing new, differentiated experiences to fans. Classifieds continues to grow, launching new experiences and testing innovative ways to connect buyers and sellers, and there is more innovation coming. Financially, Q1 was a solid start to 2016 as we delivered on our commitments with revenue and EPS above guidance. We're on target with our full year plans to return capital to shareholders, and we are being disciplined in our use of capital and debt, while architecting for the long-term. And have firmed up our full year outlook.
Underpinning all of these efforts is our focus to drive the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform as we position eBay for long-term success. And now, we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator?"

With regard to structured data, let me just take the opportunity to remind you what we're doing. There are 3 phases to structured data. There is collecting product identifiers, there's processing those identifiers and then there's building user experiences. With regard to collecting product data, we've now expanded that mandate to 60% of our listings. With regard to what we process, that has lagged the 60% because it takes a bit longer and our mandate only expanded in the middle of the quarter, so that's at 38%. And we're beginning to build the product experiences that ultimately are what matter to consumers and sellers and that will drive better business performance. We measure everything rigorously, so I gave a couple of examples on this call of the experiences that we're already building. One example is, we're beginning to move our nonstructured data enabled SEO pages to structured data enabled pages. Those pages are now stable to slightly growing at better conversion rates than the 90% of pages that we haven't moved yet, which have been declining for the better part of 18 months. In addition, if you look at our browse paths, these are entirely new experiences, which we're really excited about, not just because it makes for a simpler eBay experience, but because I think we're beginning to show what's unique about eBay. When we talk about unique inventory and great deals, historically, they've been hard to find. And I think what structured data enables us to do is to really surface those in a way that hits consumers right between the eyes so they can see why shop eBay. Just back to your question more directly. I'll say what I have always had which is this is a long-term process. There isn't a moment where it's all fixed and everything jumps up. In fact, I think I consistently said that you probably wouldn't be able to really see these experiences until towards the end of this year. So this is a slow process, which will take time, but we are definitely seeing progress on that journey. And I'd say it's going about exactly the way we've explained for the better part of 6 months."

And then StubHub grew 34%, which is flat quarter-on-quarter and Classifieds grew 17%, which is 3 points up quarter-on-quarter. Specific to the U.S., I would characterize it this way. There's a 1-point incremental gap in the U.S. Marketplace transaction revenue versus GMV growth quarter-over-quarter. And so that gap expanded as we ran a number of different promotions in Q1 to test the efficacy of our marketing spend, some of which shows up in contra and so modestly, more contra quarter-over-quarter. With regards to Classifieds, we kind of called it out in the prepared commentary. But our primary market in our developed countries such as Germany with Kleinanzeigen and Mobileye as well in Germany as well as Gumtree in the U.K., really continues to show stronger growth quarter-over-quarter."

And there's no doubt that there's certain categories like fashion that are getting more competitive. I'll just remind you and everyone that we're going to compete, but we are going to compete by being different. We want a sharply different eBay that isn't like anybody else and that doesn't mean the competition doesn't impact us, but this is not a zero-sum game in a growing environment. And my view of how we win is to be distinct and sharply different, not like anybody else. With regard directly to your question around acquisitions, we've said it for a couple of quarters, we will be acquisitive. We have a phenomenal financial flexibility and strong free cash flow dynamics. We are disciplined in the way we acquire. We don't swing wildly at things. But there's no doubt that in this environment, there are opportunities. And when we see those opportunities, we'll capitalize on them."

Let me start with mobile. Let me remind you that we did something very substantial, which was for our long-term success last September, and that was to replatform our mobile experience so that we didn't have multiple groups developing for multiple mobile operating systems. We're now on a common platform where we can speed up and scale. With that said, we did disrupt our ecosystem a bit as we signaled on the last couple of quarters, and we're pretty clear about why that happened. It was a couple of different issues. There were a couple of UI changes. There was a bit of speed decline in the app itself, and we've been iterating on that and we've been in testing, as I said in my remarks, and you can expect a significant new app release very soon. With that said, this isn't going to get solved and it's not a one-shot deal. The fact that we're on that common platform means we'll iterate quickly. But I'd say, we have growing confidence that we'll get back to a really strong track on mobile soon. With regard to the second part of your question, it actually has nothing to do with Google's right rail changes. We were an early adopter of PLAs so their changes on the right rail don't impact us at all. The SEO challenges really stem all the way back to May of '14 when if you remember without a structured data underpinning, our pages that we exposed to search engines, not just Google, but all search engines, were not really attached to our Marketplace. And there was a significant penalty that really has continued for the better part of 18 months. In many ways, that was the impetus to move to re-platforming the business so that the new pages that we put on, which now represent 10% of traffic, are on a much more stable foundation. So for us, SEO is -- I mean, I don't think it's just the day-in and day-out challenges, there's a major challenge, which we're addressing head-on with a long re-platforming around structured data and it will take time, but we are seeing progress there."

With regard to -- look, we are a very large Marketplace with last year, $85 billion of sales, so we sell a lot of everything, let's be clear. But ultimately, our success will not be the 9th party reselling an electronics device at razor thin margins, there'll be plenty of people doing that. What's unique about eBay is the spectrum of value, the choices that you get. It's not just that new iPhone, it's the used iPhone, it's a manufacturer refurb, it's 11 versions in between, that frankly only sit in our Marketplace. And then as you moved down the tail, you get things that aren't just version unique, you get things that are completely unique like collectibles and rare items, and that's an important part of who we are. So obviously, we're going to sell a lot of different things and we will sell commoditized items. But the reality to the question before about competition is not all competition is the same. Where it is commoditized items obviously that's where competition is the greatest, we still sell a lot of it, but that's where the competitive environment impacts us the most. In many ways, that's why we want to move to being sharply different and moving to being distinct and moving to doing the things that only we can do, and that's our strategy. So there's no doubt that there is a headwind from what I call commoditized items that require instant shipping. I don't think that's a lot of things. But that isn't our strategy. And we're not going to compete by being a logistics company. We're going to compete by giving people the greatest choice, the greatest deals and unique value, that's who we are.

Look, I don't -- we don't wake up in the morning and declare that we're a growth or a profitability company. Our job is to grow value for shareholders, right, growing over time the free cash flow of the business. We want to grow faster. We are not managing to a lower growth rate. What we're doing is making investments that we think are really important for the long-term of the business like the re-platforming. The hope obviously is that when we get that done, we can push the efficient frontier of growth and profitability out. In other words, we can grow faster and maintain reasonable margins. I don't look at it as black and white. I think that where we see good opportunities, we should invest in them. That doesn't mean I think with 3 to 4 quarters now under our belt, people understand we're not simply going to collapse the financial architecture and swing wildly at things and grow at all costs. But I also want to be clear that I'll invest in opportunities where we see them. We're running the company not for a quarter or a year, we're running the company to build the next 20 years of eBay. So that means being disciplined, but also investing in opportunities that are -- can expand what we do and grow the business. With regard to the structured data part of your question, I -- yes, I appreciate you saying that because we have been very consistent saying it will take time and it will be gradual. I think today, if you look at our prepared remarks, I just wanted to broaden that lens a little bit. Structured data gets a lot of press, but it's not the only thing we're doing. We're actually making a substantial number of changes for the company from the way we're organized to the way we acquire inventory to the way we replatform to the way we expose that inventory in the product. I think you'll see parts of the eBay shopping experience change more in the next several months than they have arguably in years. So there's a lot into what we're doing. And obviously for us, we hope that if we do that, fast-forward a couple of years from now, it's a different business and it's a business that's growing faster. That's our hope."

With regard to the site experience, there's a couple of examples that we've included in the attached slides. I think that, to step back from the slides for a second, there are -- there is amazing inventory and amazing deals on eBay, but we've been really honest saying that they're not always easy to find. We've had one tool in our toolbox and that's been search. And if it doesn't show up in the first 8 listings in search, oftentimes there are incredible things that consumers want, but they can't find it. And to be honest, that's gotten worse with mobile because consumers patience on 3.5 inches of real estate is a lot less than it is on a desktop. So the whole effort here is to improve discoverability. If you look at some of these new browse pages we're building, it's really simple. We will show you the best deal. We'll show you the best brand. We'll show you the best price. We want to make things really bulletproof and very, very simple, particularly in a world that's going all mobile. So for me, that's what -- there's a lot under the covers about how we're re-platforming, but it's about a great, simple, elegant consumer experience that exposes the best of what we're about, which is our vast inventory. With regard to the marketing spend, we are experimenting more, as I said last quarter, up the funnel. Right now, it's experimentation. You'll see us a little bit on television. You'll see us in other areas this quarter. But to be clear, that's not -- we're not materially increasing our marketing spend at this point. We are repurposing spend that was down the funnel to up the funnel. And what we're doing is, we're testing. You'll see a lot of media mix testing. We're trying to figure out the efficient frontier of what we can do. And I don't want to do any significant brand work until the product has gotten -- has moved on. Because what I don't want to do is spend a lot of money to bring people into a user experience that's changing. So as the user experience evolves and as we get more comfortable that we're -- it'll never be -- we're never done, but as we get closer to where we think we're going to be, we'll consider leaning into that spend and doing more. But my view right now is that, that would come out of -- we spend a lot on marketing this business. There's plenty of allocated spend that we can reallocate to go at that. If we think there's an opportunity to do more, vis-à-vis, the other question, we'll do it. With regards to auction, Scott, I don't know, do want to take that question?"

And we have, in effect, offset the dilution in Q1 in addition to the $500 million to $600 million per quarter. And we're not changing our expectations and our guidance for the rest of the year. With regards to Q2 guidance, maybe a few thoughts. Seasonally, we do experience a deceleration in EPS from Q1 to Q2 and much like we saw last year, it's really a combination of, not only our revenue obviously, but our expense profile. And, as such, the guidance is 40% to 42%. A couple of points worth noting. First off, the guidance to your question assumes spot rates as of today. I don't -- I'm not -- you shouldn't read anything into that other than we put spot rates as of today because it's relatively upon us. And within that, we've also guided to the 4% to 6% revenue. A couple of things within the cost base. One, we don't have any favorability expected from another insurance favorability in G&A, and so I would expect G&A to pop back up as a percentage of revenue for Q2 and then for the rest of the year, that sort of normalizes because we'll be past stand up. And then secondly, below the line, we're going to get an impact from the incremental debt that we put on in Q1, and so that's factored into the guidance as well."

Devin, you talked about the flywheel kicking into gear in Marketplace with the new experiences. Can you talk us through how this might manifest itself? Should we be expecting this to be reflected in eBay, competing more for order frequency, selling higher value items or from a pickup in new or even reactivated buyers? And a couple of other quick questions. Are there some other channels we could look at, beyond SEO, to revive new buyer growth? And can you give us the percentage of GMV or sold items that came through mobile?"
27862,330692140,963707,"eBay Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 26, 2016",2016-04-26,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Yes, there's a lot to that.

This is still going to take a lot of tim",482,"Yes, there's a lot to that. That's a very good question in multiple parts. Let me take them from the top. Have -- with this foundation now going in place, we can pick up the pace on what we build on the foundation. This is still going to take a lot of time. I want to -- back to first question I received, I want to make sure that the expectations are set, that there's not a moment in time when all of a sudden, all of eBay is rebuilt and growth explodes. It doesn't work that way. This is a huge marketplace. There are -- it's an enormous buyer and seller base and we have to proceed with some caution. But I like where we are because the foundation is being laid. And now we can iterate in ways we just haven't been able to do before. So you're going to see a new suite of apps soon. You're going to see new browse paths soon. You're going to see new SEO pages soon. You're going to see us start to go on offense and launch a couple of new categories soon. All that's in the guidance. None of that is going to materially move things in the short run, but it's evidence that we're moving from more of a defensive platforming to more of an offensive to run the business. With regard to your channel discussion, it's a great lead into 2 quarters ago I said, regardless of our SEO issues and fixing SEO, for the long-term success of this business, we have got to diversify our traffic and user acquisition. eBay has had 2 major irons in the fire, which is CRM and search outside of its majority which come directly to our apps and to our site. But the new user acquisition has been dominated by search and by e-mail. And that has to change. A healthy eBay has gotten multiple competing channels for our marginal investment dollar. And 2 quarters ago, I said that social, we're going to invest in it. It's early, it's not simple to get returns on social. And now fast-forward 2 quarters later and we're getting somewhere on social. We're now in 14 different channels. We're working with all the big social players. I think if you ask them, we'd say we're being aggressive and even leading eCommerce efforts on many of those channels. It's still very small. As a comparative, if you add all those 14 channels up, it's a tiny fraction of what we get from search, but it's growing fast. And we're starting to get some traction in areas like I mentioned today like Snapchat and other channels where we are showing the ability to spend and acquire users and traffic. So that's encouraging. Again, it'll take time, but we're starting to get somewhere. The third part of the question?"

27862,369944714,1008846,"eBay Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","eBay Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Selim, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a good quarter for us. We delivered strong top and bottom line financial results, led by acceleration in our core eBay platform and continued strong performance from StubHub. We made good progress on our",1522,"Thanks, Selim, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a good quarter for us. We delivered strong top and bottom line financial results, led by acceleration in our core eBay platform and continued strong performance from StubHub. We made good progress on our strategy, and we're starting to see some positive movement in underlying traffic and conversion metrics, driven by early versions of our new user experiences. 
Overall, total GMV was up 6% for the quarter while revenue was up 7%, and active buyer growth was stable at 4% year-over-year as we added over 1 million new buyers to our platform in Q2. GMV on our Marketplace platform grew at 5% year-over-year, a 1-point acceleration, driven by strength in the U.S. 
StubHub grew volume at 35% year-over-year, a 6-point acceleration and our classified platform grew revenue at 15%. Finally, we repurchased $0.5 billion of our stock and continued to invest in acquisitions to help strengthen our business. We acquired Expertmaker in the quarter and recently announced our intent to acquire SalesPredict, each of which will enable our efforts around machine learning, artificial intelligence and structured data. And we announced our intent to acquire Ticketbis and Ticket Utils, further strengthening our StubHub platform. 
It's been a year since we spun off PayPal, and we announced the focused strategy to reposition our business for long-term success by driving the best choice, the most relevance and the most powerful selling platform. I have never been more convinced than I am today that this is the right strategy for our company, and I'm pleased to see how our teams have embraced this new direction and are driving execution. 
However, I'm also clear about the gaps we still need to address in our business such as repositioning our brand, reigniting our new buyer acquisition flywheel and stemming the decline in our C2C platform. And while we're making good progress, our efforts will take time to yield material results in the business. 
We continue to drive best choice by providing the broadest spectrum of value for our consumers while working with our sellers to offer high shipping standards. In Q2, we hit a significant milestone, crossing the 1 billion live listing mark for the first time in our history. And in the U.S., 2/3 of all items shipped for free and they arrived within 3 business days or less.
This inventory growth is in part enabled by our success in signing on strategic inventory partners while continuing to tap into large pools of SMB merchants, with partners like BigCommerce. Finally, we launched a new wine category and it's off to a very good start. You can expect several more category launches over the remainder of this year. We're also building on our highly successful multibillion-dollar eBay deals platform in the U.S., doubling the number of deals available to our consumers since the beginning of the year. All of our deals ship for free for everyone, every day, without a membership required.
Next, we continue innovating to drive the most relevant shopping experience for our consumers. These innovations are being built on top of a strong and growing foundation of structured data. Our structured data mandate currently covers approximately 60% of relevant live listings on our site. And in Q2, we increased the percentage of structured data listings that we process to 42% of relevant live listings. 
While our effort to expand our penetration of structured data will continue over the coming months, our current footprint is already enabling us to build compelling new user experiences not previously possible in a listings space marketplace. Over time, this will help us in multiple areas of our business, including: more effectively enabling our consumers to get the items they want and need through better search, browse and merchandising; educating our sellers on inventory gaps and opportunities; more persistent and better ranking and natural search results; and more effective paid search marketing, just to name a few. 
Product reviews are a great example of a feature made possible by structured data. In Q2, our customers added 3.1 million new product reviews, nearly double the number added in the prior quarter, for a total of nearly 12 million reviews on the platform. 
Looking at other new user experiences, we continue to launch and iterate on our new browse and product pages, and we're starting to see early positive results. Q2 was the first positive quarter of SEO traffic in over 1.5 years. In the U.S., users who land in our new browse experience from our SEO channel are converting at approximately 10% higher rates. And we're also seeing similar results with our new product pages. We now have 15 million of these pages live. And as we add more categories and more product pages, we'll have more data to validate these early encouraging signs. 
While this is a step in the right direction, I want to remind you that SEO traffic only comprises about 10% of our overall traffic. We've recently launched the ability for users to quickly see the spectrum of value that our sellers offer through a product comparison experience across our selection of new, refurbished and used inventory. You can see this new experience in the slides accompanying my commentary.
Mobile has long been a competitive differentiator for us, and in order to maintain that advantage, we continue to invest and innovate on our mobile experience. In Q2, we launched a completely redesigned mobile experience and customer reception has been very positive so far. We've already released multiple updates enabled by a more efficient mobile development platform, which we released late last year. Our mobile experience is now getting back on the right track, with marketplace mobile volume growth accelerating to 19% in the quarter. 
As we make progress on the user experience, another key strategic focus for us this year has been to sharpen and more clearly differentiate our brand among consumers. As the #32 brand in the world according to Interbrand, we deliver a compelling value proposition to help every person get their version of perfect, no matter what it is. This speaks to the considerable strengths that come from the depth and breadth of our inventory and the incredible deals available to eBay shoppers every day, which are becoming increasingly discoverable and personalized. As we continue to roll out changes to the shopping experience on eBay, our brand promise will likewise more fully come to life for consumers. In Q2, we began to reflect this positioning in our marketing, and we plan to expand these efforts throughout the second half of 2016.
Finally, we continue to execute our plans to deliver the most powerful selling platform. Our structured data foundation is starting to enable us to provide sellers with insight into inventory gaps and opportunities on our Marketplace platform. In Q2, we ran several campaigns targeted to areas of a site where we saw high demand and not enough supply. These campaigns are enabling us to activate sellers and bring incremental inventory onto our platform.
On the consumer selling side, we're working in multiple areas to reduce friction and enable simpler experiences. Later this summer, we intend to launch a simplified listing flow on the core eBay platform that takes advantage of our structured data to save consumers time and effort in the listing process. 
And consumers continue to leverage our assisted selling service eBay Valet. Over 100,000 users have now experienced this service, and in Q2, we announced the partnership to expand valet drop-off sites to all U.S. FedEx locations, which should help drive further adoption. 
StubHub had another stellar quarter, driven by innovative user experiences and strength across multiple genres. Product experience changes we've made over the past year include a new pricing display, ticket recommendations and virtual reality and views, and they continue to propel this platform to new heights. 
And we've recently announced our intent to acquire Ticketbis, which will help accelerate our international footprint, and Ticket Utils, which will help enable us to offer sellers enhanced tools to better manage their inventory. Our classified platform continues to grow steadily, building on our market-leading position in several countries. This momentum is driven by improving the mobile experience with services like in-app chat while focusing on building and strengthening verticals in several markets such as real estate in Germany. And we continue to work on driving synergies between marketplace and Classifieds, testing ways to expose our inventory to consumers on both platforms.
In summary, Q2 was a good quarter for our business with accelerating volume and revenue growth. We continue to invest in product and technology and are accelerating the pace of innovation and new user experiences. One year since spinning off PayPal, we are executing our long-term business strategy and beginning to see the results from those efforts. And while there will be challenges along the way, you can count on us to make steady progress. eBay's business is strong, and we're running it to ensure that we will be a global technology leader for years to come. 
Now let me turn it over to Scott to provide more details on our Q2 results."

As Devin highlighted, we delivered good top and bottom line financial results this quarter, driven by acceleration in our marketplace and StubHub platforms. We are starting to see some green shoots of our strategic initiatives as we reposition our business for long-term success. 
At the same time, we are clear about our challenges such as repositioning our brand, acquiring more new buyers, reinvigorating CSE and enabling the best tools for our sellers. We remain focused on our efforts to provide the best choice, the most relevant and a powerful selling platform as we continue executing our strategic plan. 
During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation, beginning on Slide 10. In Q2, we generated $2.2 billion of total revenue, $0.43 of non-GAAP EPS and $617 million in free cash flow. We repurchased $500 million of our stock, and the Board of Directors has approved an additional $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization. And lastly, we are raising the full year guidance on revenue and EPS.
Let's start at the top of the funnel with Q2 active buyers on Slide 11. In the quarter, we increased the total active buyer base to 164 million while trailing 12-month growth was stable at 4%. As Devin highlighted, SEO traffic improved in the quarter but we are not yet seeing a material impact on acquiring new buyers to the SEO channel.
On Slide 12, we enabled $20.9 billion of GMV in Q2, up 6% versus last year, accelerating 1 point versus prior quarter. By geography, the U.S. generated $8.5 billion of GMV, up 5%, accelerating 2 points versus Q1. The acceleration was driven equally by marketplace and StubHub. International delivered $12.3 billion of GMV, up 6% year-over-year.
Moving to revenue. We delivered net revenues of $2.2 billion, up 7% versus last year and accelerating 1 point versus Q1. We generated $1.7 billion of transaction revenue, up 5%, and $480 million of marketing services revenue, up 15%.
Transitioning to our Marketplace platform on Slide 14. Q2 GMV grew 5% year-over-year, accelerating 1 point versus Q1. We are beginning to see early signs of recovery in such areas as mobile, C2C and SEO. While we are pleased to see an uptick in growth, we are cognizant we still have work ahead of us to stay on course.
Transaction revenue grew 2%, up 1 point sequentially, driven by the increase in volume plus lower spend in contra revenue. Marketing services revenue grew 11%, decelerating 8 points versus Q1, primarily driven by less ad monetization due to a continued shift to mobile and fewer ad placements on the desktop. The PayPal operating agreement added 10 points of growth year-over-year to marketplace MS&O. Excluding the PayPal operating agreement, marketplace MS&O grew 1%.
Moving to Slide 15. Q2 was another standout quarter for StubHub. We delivered 35% GMV growth and 40% revenue growth, both accelerating 6 points versus Q1. We had a strong quarter across genres and in specific events such as the NBA Finals, America and Hamilton, to name a few. 
We also benefited from new product innovations introduced earlier this year. We released our virtual reality tool to a limited number of venues, and by the end of Q2, approximately 20% of StubHub customers utilized the virtual reality experience before buying their ticket for those venues. In addition, our fans have increasingly been using our ticket recommendation feature, helping them quickly find the lowest price, the best value or the best seat. In Q2, we also kicked off an intensified cross-merchandising efforts, which means StubHub and marketplace, providing fans with a great opportunity to buy gear and memorabilia for the event they are attending.
Moving to Slide 16. In Q2, Classifieds revenue grew 15% year-over-year as we continue to drive strength in the automotive vertical across several geographies, including Germany, The Netherlands and Canada as well as our real estate verticals in Germany and Canada. While the growth decelerated 2 points versus Q1, Classifieds has consistently been in the double-digit range for the last 6 quarters.
Turning to Slide 17 in major cost drivers. Cost of revenue increased 160 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by the additional -- the addition of PayPal processing cost and the impact of foreign exchange. Q2 sales and marketing expense was relatively flatter year-over-year while product development increased 160 basis points. The increase was partially driven by the impact of foreign exchange but primarily by the investment in structured data, the core product experience and emerging trends in e-commerce such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.
G&A expense was relatively flat year-over-year, with standup costs offset by productivity. Pulling all of that together, we delivered Q2 operating margin of 29.1%, down 300 basis points versus last year. The impact of foreign exchange was approximately 80 [ph] basis points and standup costs an additional 90. The remaining increase was largely driven by invest -- our investment in product development.
Moving to Slide 18. In Q2, we delivered $0.43 in non-GAAP EPS, up $0.01 versus prior year, aided by share repurchases, which added roughly $0.03 of EPS. This was offset in part by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and standup costs, which cost roughly $0.01 of EPS each. 
While my prepared remarks are focused on non-GAAP financial measures, I'd like to take a moment to touch on GAAP EPS. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP measures for eBay are stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and significant onetime items. In Q2, GAAP EPS was $0.38, up $0.03 versus Q2 2015. In addition to the $0.01 increase in GAAP -- non-GAAP EPS, the incremental $0.02 of GAAP EPS growth were driven by onetime investment gains and their associated tax effects. As we've done in the past, you can find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and the earnings slides, which provide more detail.
On Slide 19, in Q2, we generated free cash flow of $617 million, up 79%, largely due to lapping separation-related costs incurred last year. As we previously discussed, 2016 will represent a more normalized level of free cash flow now that we're past separation. And we remain on track to deliver our full year guidance of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. CapEx was 7% of revenue in Q2. Our full year guidance remains 7% to 9%.
Moving to Slide 20. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and nonequity investments of $10.4 billion, including $3.1 billion in the U.S. During Q2 and over the past few weeks, we've announced multiple acquisitions, some of which have not yet closed. Ticketbis, Ticket Utils, Expertmaker and SalesPredict are on strategy and provide us with geographical expansion, tech and talent acquisition or both. We expect to spend approximately $250 million across all 4 acquisitions, although specific details have not been disclosed.
In Q2, we repurchased 20.8 million shares at an average price of $23.99 per share, amounting to $500 million in share repurchases. We ended the quarter with $300 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. The Board of Directors has approved an incremental $2.5 billion in share repurchase authorization. We remain on track with our full year plans for share repurchases as I laid out in our Q4 earnings call.
Before going to guidance, I'd like to touch on 3 topics: Brexit, foreign exchange and second half lapping. First on Brexit. With a weaker pound, we are seeing a boost in U.K. exports, which is driving a strong start to the quarter for our international business. This is offset by weaker U.K. import demand, particularly in the U.S. corridor. We have yet to see the impact of an economic slowdown on the U.K. domestic marketplace.
Second, on foreign exchange. As I explained last quarter, our revenue remains fully exposed to movements in currency, so when the U.S. dollar strengthen, it impacts revenue directly. During the last earnings call, we estimated that if currency rates held for the balance of the year, we would have $80 million of second half revenue upside versus the guidance we issued in January. We did not include that upside in the updated April guidance on revenue and based on current rates, we no longer expect any of this benefit.
With regards to earnings, our hedging program is to set up -- is set up to economically protect net income, which means our exposure versus guidance is limited to the portion that remains unhedged. And while the majority of the second half is hedged, foreign exchange will cost $0.01 of EPS in the back half of 2016 versus our prior full year guidance. Keep in mind that based on how our hedging is accounted for, we will continue to see the impact of hedging gains and losses in operating margin and OI&E.
Lastly, on second half lapping. As we communicated previously, we will start lapping tougher comps for StubHub in September, and we will start lapping the PayPal operating agreement in July.
Now moving to Q3 guidance on Slide 21. For Q3, we are projecting revenue between $2.16 billion and $2.19 billion, growing 6% to 7% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.42 to $0.44 per share, representing minus 2% to plus 2% growth year-over-year. EPS growth is impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar, which in Q3 will cost us roughly 7 points of growth, offset in part by the net benefit of the share repurchase program, which adds roughly 4 points of EPS growth.
Moving to the full year guidance on Slide 22. Based on continued strength across our platforms, we are raising revenue guidance for the full year. Revenue is now projected to be $8.85 billion to $8.95 billion, growing 5% to 6% year-over-year. We are also raising non-GAAP EPS guidance, now projected to be $1.85 to $1.90 per share, growing 1% to 4% year-over-year. 
The increase in guidance is driven by higher revenue and a more favorable tax rate of 19% to 20%, partially offset by product investment and foreign exchange. The resulting impact is operating margin at the low end of the 31% to 33% range we provided in January. As always, you can find guidance for our projected GAAP measurements in the earnings release and appendix of the earnings presentation.
I'd like to take a moment to reflect on where we are today versus what we committed to 6 months ago. In January, we projected revenue growth of 2% to 5%, acknowledging that we have a lot of work ahead of us and that we aspired to do better. We now have 2 quarters of 6% to 7% revenue growth behind us, and we believe we are on the right path. The green shoots on our strategic initiatives and the accelerating volume and revenue growth give us confidence to raise our projections for the full year. 
That said, we are realistic about what we need to accomplish and the challenges that lie ahead. We are making progress in executing our plan, and we remain confident in pursuing our strategy to provide the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform. And now we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator?"

On structured data, our current efforts are crossing all categories, but I guess what I would point out is that the category where we've had structured data the longest, which is in part why we went down this path, is our parts and accessories business. We've had that even before we embarked on this journey. We've had that in place for a couple of years. It also happens to be our fastest growing category. So we do see that where we have time to build a catalog and then build experiences on top of it, in this case, for parts and accessories, we build what we call Fitment, which is simply the ability to swap parts in and out and understand what fits -- what part fits what car. That's a great user experience. And each category is slightly different. That's unique to parts. But we are seeing some of the benefits now come through across multiple categories.

As it relates to this quarter, our marketing expense was roughly flat. And I think as you look forward, what you can expect is we'll be leaning in on our consideration in brand spend and reallocating within our marketing expense. That's not to preclude that we wouldn't invest more in contra per se, but that's kind of what we expect in the second half, which is a bit more within marketing expense reallocation."

What's the right way to think about where we are and sort of how much further there is to go to potentially get back to normal?

And that's more specific and helpful when you search for an item. I think that's a one foundational aspect as we think about going forward with our structured data initiatives. It's not, however, the overall aspect. I'm going to turn it over to Devin in a second to comment on that. To your earlier question on contra, year-over-year, we are actually spending a little bit more contra but quarter-to-quarter, we're spending less. And so the way I would think about it is we're going to pulse this up and down. It's going to be -- I foresee it to be somewhat seasonal and very much ROI focused on testing our efficient frontier on CLB. So I don't know if it's going to migrate down per se as your question implied. I just view it as over time, we're going to reallocate within our marketing expense. And in the second half of the year, you can expect us to reallocate it towards the top of the funnel are much more consideration focused spend.

On the structured data question, Heath, again, I think -- look, I don't want to read too much into any one category or any historical approach. For me, we've gone on a broad-based replatforming of our data infrastructure. In January, I said I thought you might start to see a showing up a bit by the end of the year. 2 quarters in advance, this quarter, we're starting to see it show up a bit. And I don't want to get over our skis. This is the beginning. We still have a lot of work to do. We've got a lot of replatforming left, a lot of user experiences still to build, but there's no doubt that where we have deployed these new user experiences, we're seeing either improved conversion or improved traffic or both. And you can just see it in the user experience. It's not a leap of the imagination. It's just a simpler, better user experience that shows how eBay is unique by showing our consumers the broad-based spectrum of value we have in a way that's not overwhelming.

Yes, we've had SEO challenges since May of '14 when Google made a significant algorithm change and a few other factors were at play. And there's been downward pressure slowly on our SEO channel ever since. It's been a long slow decline since then.

It was marginally positive but it was a positive trend. I do expect that trend to continue. I don't -- we don't know because we don't control the SEO channel entirely. There are other factors at play. But my hope is that we're on a -- we've gone from a slow steady downtick to a slow steady uptick from here because I think objectively, if you look at these new experiences, they are some of the best shopping experiences available on the Internet. On artificial intelligence and machine learning, some of this depends on how you use the term. I guess I'd say 2 things. One is when we talk about processing the data as the second step of our structured data approach, that is machine learning. That is taking the raw material that we get from sellers who are identifying the products they're selling through product identifiers and turning that into a catalog by using computing power to understand the association, the hierarchies and taxonomies that go into building a catalog that tells us where things go on the shelves metaphorically. So yes, we're already doing that. I think that when I look out to the future, we're also planting seeds because I think that the impact of AI will be much more significant on commerce eventually. I think that when we see now the way large-scale data sets are being used by algorithms through things like GPUs in the cloud, to me, AI is going to be the next platform revolution. And just like eBay was early on the Internet, was early on mobile, I want us to be early on AI. So yes, it's part of how we're building the catalog. But I think when I look out a few years, it's going to be significant for a massive improvement to personalization for consumers and targeting to sellers.

I said 2 quarters ago, we have to sharpen our brand and now we're clear about what it is. Second, we do like the trajectory we're on with these user experiences. We believe that if we bring more people to eBay, they'll like what they see. And third, in the second quarter, we began to do some consideration testing. We did a test in the U.K., we did a test in the U.S. A little bit of brand spend, a little bit of top of funnel. That was a little outdoor, a little television and the results were positive. We saw traffic and new user acceleration. Based on those 3 things, we're going to reallocate marketing spend. Don't expect us to do a huge overlay, not -- certainly not at this point. We're going to take spend from mid and bottom funnel, reallocate it to brand and top of the funnel. And in our major markets, you should begin to see that show up through the second half, particularly once the summer is over. You should begin to feel the sharpened eBay brand in our major markets."

I'm encouraged by about how we do show consumers sell inventory on both platforms. It's, at the end of the day, is a different format but ultimately, it's a consumer trying to sell an item and there's a buyer somewhere that wants that item.

When we went down the path of building a VR application, we thought it was a little early but it was an interesting thing to do, see how consumers like it. You heard in Scott's remarks the venues available, mostly MLB and baseball stadiums, I mean, 20% of ticket sales touch that VR application. That's a big deal. And we have excellent product and technology capability, not just in StubHub and eBay. And as the world moves to digital, I want to use that to drive a competitive wedge between us and the physical world. So I feel really good about StubHub's market position. Their growth's going to come down because they're going to hit a growth wall as Scott said in September, but that doesn't change the fact that StubHub is very well positioned in the market right now. On acquisitions, steady as she goes. If we find acquisitions that makes sense to expand their portfolio, whether it's tech, talent or geographic expansion or whatever, we won't hesitate to do it. We have a strong balance sheet, we'll be disciplined. But we won't back down from accelerating on our strategy."

Q2 was a good quarter for us. We delivered strong top and bottom line financial results led by acceleration in our core eBay platform and continued strong performance from StubHub. We made good progress on our",1523,"Thanks, Selim, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a good quarter for us. We delivered strong top and bottom line financial results led by acceleration in our core eBay platform and continued strong performance from StubHub. We made good progress on our strategy, and we're starting to see some positive movement in underlying traffic and conversion metrics driven by early versions of our new user experiences.
Overall, total GMV was up 6% for the quarter, while revenue was up 7%, and active buyer growth was stable at 4% year-over-year as we added over 1 million new buyers to our platform in Q2. GMV on our Marketplace platform grew at 5% year-over-year, a 1-point acceleration, driven by strength in the U.S.
StubHub grew volume at 35% year-over-year, a 6-point acceleration, and our classified platform grew revenue at 15%. Finally, we repurchased $0.5 billion of our stock and continued to invest in acquisitions to help strengthen our business. We acquired Expertmaker in the quarter and recently announced our intent to acquire SalesPredict, each of which will enable our efforts around machine learning, artificial intelligence and structured data. And we announced our intent to acquire Ticketbis and Ticket Utils, further strengthening our StubHub platform. 
It's been a year since we spun off PayPal, and we announced the focused strategy to reposition our business for long-term success by driving the best choice, the most relevance and the most powerful selling platform. I have never been more convinced than I am today that this is the right strategy for our company, and I'm pleased to see how our teams have embraced this new direction and are driving execution.
However, I'm also clear about the gaps we still need to address in our business such as repositioning our brand, reigniting our new buyer acquisition flywheel and stemming the decline in our C2C platform. And while we're making good progress, our efforts will take time to yield material results in the business.
We continue to drive best choice by providing the broadest spectrum of value for our consumers while working with our sellers to offer high shipping standards. In Q2, we hit a significant milestone, crossing the 1 billion live listing mark for the first time in our history. And in the U.S., 2/3 of all items shipped for free, and they arrived within 3 business days or less. This inventory growth is in part enabled by our success in signing on strategic inventory partners while continuing to tap into large pools of SMB merchants with partners like BigCommerce. 
Finally, we launched a new wine category, and it's off to a very good start. You can expect several more category launches over the remainder of this year. We're also building on our highly successful multi-billion-dollar eBay Deals platform in the U.S., doubling the number of deals available to our consumers since the beginning of the year. All of our deals ship for free for everyone everyday without a membership required.
Next, we continue innovating to drive the most relevant shopping experience for our consumers. These innovations are being built on top of a strong and growing foundation of structured data. Our structured data mandate currently covers approximately 60% of relevant live listings on our site, and in Q2, we increased the percentage of structured data listings that we process to 42% of relevant live listings.
While our effort to expand our penetration of structured data will continue over the coming months, our current footprint is already enabling us to build compelling new user experiences not previously possible in a listing space marketplace. Over time, this will help us in multiple areas of our business, including more effectively enabling our consumers to get the items they want and need through better search, browse and merchandising; educating our sellers on inventory gaps and opportunities; more persistent and better ranking in natural search results; and more effective paid search marketing just to name a few.
Product reviews are a great example of a feature made possible by structured data. In Q2, our customers added 3.1 million new product reviews, nearly double the number added in the prior quarter, for a total of nearly 12 million reviews on the platform.
Looking at other new user experiences. We continue to launch and iterate on our new browse and product pages, and we're starting to see early positive results. Q2 was the first positive quarter of SEO traffic in over 1.5 years. In the U.S., users who land in our new browse experience from our SEO channel are converting at approximately 10% higher rates, and we're also seeing similar results with our new product pages. We now have 15 million of these pages live, and as we add more categories and more product pages, we'll have more data to validate these early encouraging signs.
While this is a step in the right direction, I want to remind you that SEO traffic only comprises about 10% of our overall traffic. We've recently launched the ability for users to quickly see the spectrum of value that our sellers offer through a product comparison experience across our selection of new, refurbished and used inventory. You can see this new experience in the slides accompanying my commentary.
Mobile has long been a competitive differentiator for us, and in order to maintain that advantage, we continue to invest and innovate on our mobile experience. In Q2, we launched a completely redesigned mobile experience, and customer reception has been very positive so far. We've already released multiple updates enabled by our more efficient mobile development platform, which we released late last year. Our mobile experience is now getting back on the right track with marketplace mobile volume growth accelerating to 19% in the quarter.
As we made progress on the user experience, another key strategic focus for us this year has been to sharpen and more clearly differentiate our brand among consumers. As the #32 brand in the world according to Interbrand, we deliver a compelling value proposition to help every person get their version of perfect no matter what it is. This speaks to the considerable strengths that come from the depth and breadth of our inventory and the incredible deals available to eBay shoppers everyday, which are becoming increasingly discoverable and personalized. As we continue to roll out changes to the shopping experience on eBay, our brand promise will likewise more fully come to life for consumers. In Q2, we began to reflect this positioning in our marketing, and we plan to expand these efforts throughout the second half of 2016.
Finally, we continue to execute our plans to deliver the most powerful selling platform. Our structured data foundation is starting to enable us to provide sellers with insight into inventory gaps and opportunities on our Marketplace platform. In Q2, we ran several campaigns targeted to areas of the site where we saw high demand and not enough supply. These campaigns are enabling us to activate sellers and bring incremental inventory onto our platform.
On the consumer selling side, we're working in multiple areas to reduce friction and enable simpler experiences. Later this summer, we intend to launch a simplified listing flow on the core eBay platform that takes advantage of our structured data to save consumers time and effort in the listing process.
And consumers continue to leverage our assisted selling service eBay Valet. Over 100,000 users have now experienced the service, and in Q2, we announced a partnership to expand Valet drop-off sites to all U.S. FedEx locations, which should help drive further adoption. 
StubHub had another stellar quarter driven by innovative user experiences and strength across multiple genres. Product experience changes we've made over the past year include a new pricing display, ticket recommendations and virtual reality in sea views [ph] , and they continue to propel this platform to new heights. And we've recently announced our intent to acquire Ticketbis, which will help accelerate our international footprint, and Ticket Utils, which will help enable us to offer sellers enhanced tools to better manage their inventory. 
Our classified platform continues to grow steadily, building on our market-leading position in several countries. This momentum is driven by improving the mobile experience with services like in-app chat while focusing on building and strengthening verticals in several markets such as real estate in Germany. And we continue to work on driving synergies between Marketplace and Classifieds, testing ways to expose our inventory to consumers on both platforms.
In summary, Q2 was a good quarter for our business with accelerating volume and revenue growth. We continue to invest in product and technology and are accelerating the pace of innovation and new user experiences. One year since spinning off PayPal, we are executing our long-term business strategy and beginning to see the results from those efforts. And while there will be challenges along the way, you can count on us to make steady progress. eBay's business is strong, and we're running it to ensure that we will be a global technology leader for years to come.
Now let me turn it over to Scott to provide more details on our Q2 results."

As Devin highlighted, we delivered good top and bottom line financial results this quarter driven by acceleration in our Marketplace and StubHub platforms. We are starting to see some green shoots of our strategic initiatives as we reposition our business for long-term success.
At the same time, we are clear about our challenges such as repositioning our brand, acquiring more new buyers, reinvigorating C2C and enabling the best tools for our sellers. We remain focused on our efforts to provide the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform as we continue executing our strategic plan.
During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 10. In Q2, we generated $2.2 billion of total revenue, $0.43 of non-GAAP EPS and $617 million in free cash flow. We repurchased $500 million of our stock, and the Board of Directors has approved an additional $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization. And lastly, we are raising the full year guidance on revenue and EPS.
Let's start at the top of the funnel with Q2 active buyers on Slide 11. In the quarter, we increased the total active buyer base to 164 million, while trailing 12-month growth was stable at 4%. As Devin highlighted, SEO traffic improved in the quarter, but we are not yet seeing a material impact on acquiring new buyers to the SEO channel.
On Slide 12, we enabled $20.9 billion of GMV in Q2, up 6% versus last year, accelerating 1 point versus prior quarter. By geography, the U.S. generated $8.5 billion of GMV, up 5%, accelerating 2 points versus Q1. The acceleration was driven equally by Marketplace and StubHub. International delivered $12.3 billion of GMV, up 6% year-over-year.
Moving to revenue. We delivered net revenues of $2.2 billion, up 7% versus last year and accelerating 1 point versus Q1. We generated $1.7 billion of transaction revenue, up 5%, and $480 million of marketing services revenue, up 15%.
Transitioning to our Marketplaces platform on Slide 14. Q2 GMV grew 5% year-over-year, accelerating 1 point versus Q1. We are beginning to see early signs of recovery in such areas as mobile, C2C and SEO. While we are pleased to see the uptick in growth, we are cognizant we still have work ahead of us to stay on course.
Transaction revenue grew 2%, up 1 point sequentially, driven by the increase in volume plus lower spend in contra revenue. Marketing services revenue grew 11%, decelerating 8 points versus Q1, primarily driven by less ad monetization due to continued shift to mobile and fewer ad placements on the desktop. The PayPal operating agreement added 10 points of growth year-over-year to Marketplace MS&O. Excluding the PayPal operating agreement, Marketplace MS&O grew 1%.
Moving to Slide 15. Q2 was another standout quarter for StubHub. We delivered 35% GMV growth and 40% revenue growth, both accelerating 6 points versus Q1. We had a strong quarter across genres and in specific events such as the NBA Finals, Copa America and Hamilton to name a few.  We also benefited from new product innovations introduced earlier this year. We released our virtual reality tool to a limited number of venues, and by the end of Q2, approximately 20% of StubHub customers utilized the virtual reality experience before buying their ticket for those venues.
In addition, our fans have increasingly been using our ticket recommendation feature, helping them quickly find the lowest price, the best value or the best seat. In Q2, we also kicked off an intensified cross-merchandising effort between means StubHub and Marketplace, providing fans with a great opportunity to buy gear and memorabilia for the event they are attending.
Moving to Slide 16. In Q2, Classifieds revenue grew 15% year-over-year as we continue to drive strength in the automotive vertical across several geographies, including Germany, The Netherlands and Canada as well as our real estate verticals in Germany and Canada. While the growth decelerated 2 points versus Q1, Classifieds has consistently been in the double-digit range for the last 6 quarters.
Turning to Slide 17 and major cost drivers. Cost of revenue increased 160 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by the additional -- the addition of PayPal processing cost and the impact of foreign exchange. Q2 sales and marketing expense was relatively flatter year-over-year, while product development increased 160 basis points. The increase was partially driven by the impact of foreign exchange but primarily by the investment in structured data, the core product experience and emerging trends in e-commerce such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.
G&A expense was relatively flat year-over-year with stand-up costs offset by productivity. Pulling all of that together, we delivered Q2 operating margin of 29.1%, down 300 basis points versus last year. The impact of foreign exchange was approximately 80 basis points and stand-up costs, an additional 90. The remaining increase was largely driven by our investment in product development.
Moving to Slide 18. In Q2, we delivered $0.43 in non-GAAP EPS, up $0.01 versus prior year, aided by share repurchases, which added roughly $0.03 of EPS. This was offset in part by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and stand-up costs, which cost roughly $0.01 of EPS each.
While my prepared remarks are focused on non-GAAP financial measures, I'd like to take a moment to touch on GAAP EPS. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP measures for eBay are stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and significant onetime items. In Q2, GAAP EPS was $0.38, up $0.03 versus Q2 2015. In addition to the $0.01 increase in GAAP -- non-GAAP EPS, the incremental $0.02 of GAAP EPS growth were driven by onetime investment gains and their associated tax effects. As we've done in the past, you can find the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and the earnings slides, which provide more detail.
On Slide 19, in Q2, we generated free cash flow of $617 million, up 79%, largely due to lapping separation-related costs incurred last year. As we previously discussed, 2016 will represent a more normalized level of free cash flow now that we're past separation. And we remain on track to deliver our full year guidance of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. CapEx was 7% of revenue in Q2. Our full year guidance remains 7% to 9%.
Moving to Slide 20. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $10.4 billion, including $3.1 billion in the U.S. During Q2 and over the past few weeks, we've announced multiple acquisitions, some of which have not yet closed. Ticketbis, Ticket Utils, Expertmaker and SalesPredict are on strategy and provide us with geographical expansion, tech and talent acquisition or both. We expect to spend approximately $250 million across all 4 acquisitions, although specific details have not been disclosed.
In Q2, we repurchased 20.8 million shares at an average price of $23.99 per share, amounting to $500 million in share repurchases. We ended the quarter with $300 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. The Board of Directors has approved an incremental $2.5 billion in share repurchase authorization. We remain on track with our full year plans for share repurchases as I laid out in our Q4 earnings call.
Before going to guidance, I'd like to touch on 3 topics: Brexit, foreign exchange and second half lapping. First on Brexit. With a weaker pound, we are seeing a boost in U.K. exports, which is driving a strong start to the quarter for our international business. This is offset by weaker U.K. import demand, particularly in the U.S. corridor. We have yet to see the impact of an economic slowdown on the U.K. domestic marketplace.
Second on foreign exchange. As I explained last quarter, our revenue remains fully exposed to movements in currency, so when the U.S. dollar strengthen, it impacts revenue directly. During the last earnings call, we estimated that if currency rates held for the balance of the year, we would have $80 million of second half revenue upside versus the guidance we issued in January. We did not include that upside in the updated April guidance on revenue, and based on current rates, we no longer expect any of this benefit.
With regards to earnings, our hedging program is to set up -- is set up to economically protect net income, which means our exposure versus guidance is limited to the portion that remains unhedged. And while the majority of the second half is hedged, foreign exchange will cost $0.01 of EPS in the back half of 2016 versus our prior full year guidance. Keep in mind that based on how our hedging is accounted for, we will continue to see the impact of hedging gains and losses in operating margin and OI&E.
Lastly on second half lapping. As we communicated previously, we will start lapping tougher comps for StubHub in September, and we will start lapping the PayPal operating agreement in July.
Now moving to Q3 guidance on Slide 21. For Q3, we are projecting revenue between $2.16 billion and $2.19 billion, growing 6% to 7% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.42 to $0.44 per share, representing minus 2% to plus 2% growth year-over-year. EPS growth is impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar, which in Q3 will cost us roughly 7 points of growth offset in part by the net benefit of the share repurchase program, which adds roughly 4 points of EPS growth.
Moving to the full year guidance on Slide 22. Based on continued strength across our platforms, we are raising revenue guidance for the full year. Revenue is now projected to be $8.85 billion to $8.95 billion, growing 5% to 6% year-over-year. We are also raising non-GAAP EPS guidance, now projected to be $1.85 to $1.90 per share, growing 1% to 4% year-over-year. The increase in guidance is driven by higher revenue and a more favorable tax rate of 19% to 20% partially offset by product investment and foreign exchange. The resulting impact is operating margin at the low end of the 31% to 33% range we provided in January. As always, you can find guidance for our projected GAAP measurements in the earnings release and appendix of the earnings presentation.
I'd like to take a moment to reflect on where we are today versus what we committed to 6 months ago. In January, we projected revenue growth of 2% to 5%, acknowledging that we had a lot of work ahead of us and that we aspired to do better. We now have 2 quarters of 6% to 7% revenue growth behind us, and we believe we are on the right path. The green shoots on our strategic initiatives and the accelerating volume and revenue growth give us confidence to raise our projections for the full year.
That said, we are realistic about what we need to accomplish and the challenges that lie ahead. We are making progress in executing our plan, and we remain confident in pursuing our strategy to provide the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform.
And now we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator?"

Is there anything you want to call out for us in terms of certain categories in terms of duration of how long they've seen structured data and what that might mean for GMV growth? Would love to get a little bit of color there. And then, Scott, on the cost structure of the business, we were a little surprised you called out lower contra revenue as well as lower sales and marketing, but you saw a reacceleration. Want to know what that might mean for the cost structure of the business long term and sort of return on marketing spend."

On structured data, our current efforts are crossing all categories, but I guess what I would point out is that the category where we've had structured data the longest, which is in part why we went down this path, is our parts and accessories business. We've had that even before we embarked on this journey. We've had that in place for a couple of years. It also happens to be our fastest growing category. So we do see that where we have time to build a catalog and then build experiences on top of it, in this case, for parts and accessories, we built what we call Fitment, which is simply the ability to swap parts in and out and understand what fits -- what part fits what car. That's a great user experience. And each category is slightly different. That's unique to parts. But we are seeing some of the benefits now come through across multiple categories. I'll turn it to Scott for the second part of the question."

As it relates to this quarter, our marketing expense was roughly flat. And I think as you look forward, what you can expect is we'll be leaning in on our consideration in brand spend and reallocating within our marketing expense. That's not to preclude that we wouldn't invest more in contra per se, but that's kind of what we expect in the second half, which is a bit more within marketing expense reallocation."

If you were thinking about this, I don't know scale of 1 to 10, obviously, contra revenue went up significantly after the data breach and everything. Are we now back down to where we were prior to that? Are we 70% of the way down? What's the right way to think of where we are and sort of how much further there is to go to potentially get back to normal? And then to the extent that motors is an area that you've seen significant strength over the last few quarters, how much of that would you say is a function of motors being one of the categories or one of the areas where you started with structured data early? And is it right to think of that as a leading indicator for the rest of the business?"

I think, as you know, vehicles, automotive, we don't put into GMV. More shows up in subscription revenue but within MS&O. But for parts and accessories, we've had a catalog in Fitment for a good period of time. And I think you can see that the product experience in a number of different areas that it's going to change over time, and how we're going to migrate towards that -- towards the product experience, it's based more on a catalog. And that's more specific and helpful when you search for an item. I think that's a -- one foundational aspect as we think about going forward with our structured data initiatives. It's not, however, the overall aspect. I'm going to turn it over to Devin in a second to comment on that. To your earlier question on contra, year-over-year, we are actually spending a little bit more contra but quarter-to-quarter, we're spending less. And so the way I would think about it is we're going to pulse this up and down. It's going to be -- I foresee it to be somewhat seasonal and very much ROI focused on a -- on testing our efficient frontier on CLV. So I don't know if it's going to migrate down per se as your question implied. I just view it as a -- over time, we're going to reallocate within our marketing expense, and in the second half of the year, you can expect us to reallocate it towards the top of the funnel or much more consideration-focused spend. And on occasion, we'll continue to spend into contra as the ROIs dictate."

Contra, for us, is about acquiring healthy customer cohorts, and we'll keep doing that. On the structured data question, Heath, again, I think -- look, I don't want to read too much into any one category or any historical approach. For me, we've gone on a broad-based re-platforming of our data infrastructure. In January, I said I thought you might start to see it showing up a bit by the end of the year. Two quarters in advance, this quarter, we're starting to see it show up a bit. And I don't want to get over our skis. This is the beginning. We still have a lot of work to do. We've got a lot of re-platforming left, a lot of user experiences still to build, but there's no doubt that where we have deployed these new user experiences, we're seeing either improved conversion or improved traffic or both. And you can just see it in the user experience. It's not a leap of the imagination. It's just the simpler, better user experience that shows how eBay is unique by showing our consumers the broad-based spectrum of value we have in a way that's not overwhelming. And that's why we've gone down this path, and this quarter gives us confidence that we're on the right path."

And PayPal, the PayPal operating agreements, we start to lap them. And the combination of those 2 things put about 1 to 2 points of downward pressure on our revenue in the second half of the year.

Yes, we've had SEO challenges since May of '14 when Google made a significant algorithm change and a few other factors were at play. And there's been downward pressure slowly on our SEO channel ever since. It's been a long slow decline since then. It turned around this quarter, in part, because I believe we're putting fantastic user experiences based on structured data into our SEO channel. I wouldn't get overly excited. It was marginally positive, but it was a positive trend. I do expect that trend to continue. I don't -- I -- we don't know because we don't control the SEO channel entirely. There are other factors at play. But my hope is that we're on a -- we've gone from a slow, steady downtick to a slow, steady uptick from here because I think, objectively, if you look at these new experiences, they are some of the best shopping experiences available on the Internet. On artificial intelligence and machine learning, some of this depends on how you use the term. I guess I'd say 2 things. One is when we talk about processing the data as the second step of our structured data approach, that is machine learning. That is taking the raw material that we get from sellers, who are identifying the products they're selling through product identifiers, and turning that into a catalog by using computing power to understand the associations, the hierarchies and taxonomies that go into building a catalog that tells us where things go on the shelves metaphorically. So yes, we're already doing that. I think that when I look out to the future, we're also planting seeds because I think that the impact of AI will be much more significant on commerce eventually. I think that when we see now the way large-scale datasets are being used by algorithms through things like GPUs in the cloud, to me, AI is going to be the next platform revolution. And just like eBay was early on the Internet, was early on mobile, I want us to be early on AI. So yes, it's part of how we're building the catalog. But I think when I look out a few years, it's going to be significant for a massive improvement to personalization for consumers and targeting to sellers. So we're building that capability now possibly a little bit in advance of when that platform revolution comes."

I guess -- thanks, Colin. I direct the first question to Slide #5. I think that's the right one. It's called Structured Data: User Experiences. And the question was would the conversion hold when we look at the direct channel? It depends. I think, for us, the biggest question is how do we deploy this in the search results pages where a lot of the traffic ends up, whether it's through SEO or direct. And we're just starting to experiment with that. That is, you would understand, is the area we have to be the most careful. And that's when people say, ""Why don't you just throw all these experiences in? It seems to be working."" We've got a high converting, very high traffic search channel. I think that these pages matter in there. They will make an impact. But that's the main artery of commerce, and we've got to be careful. And that will take test-and-learn time. Is there any reason I believe that we won't get conversion improvements? No, there's no reason that I would believe we would not get conversion improvements over time. Again, I want to caution this is not straight up into the right from here. We got a lot of work to do, and this is -- I said it was a multi-year journey a year ago. It's still a multi-year journey. We're seeing some green shoots, but it's still a multi-year journey. I want to make sure we don't get overexuberant and say, ""Wow, this is just going to explode from here."" We still have a ton of work to do on this, and I just want to make sure everybody understands that. On the second question around brand, there's 2 things that are going on -- actually, 3. One is we're clear about our brand. We're clear about what the eBay brand stands for and how it's different and how that manifests itself to consumers. This idea of everybody can find their version of perfect is distinct to eBay. And I want every consumer in the world to understand that eventually. And that's our job. I said 2 quarters ago, we have to sharpen our brand, and now we're clear about what it is. Second, we do like the trajectory we're on with these user experiences. We believe that if we bring more people to eBay, they'll like what they see. And third, in the second quarter, we began to do some consideration testing. We did a test in the U.K. We did a test in the U.S., a little bit of brand spend, a little bit of top of funnel. That was a little outdoor, a little television, and the results were positive. We saw traffic and new user acceleration. Based on those 3 things, we're going to reallocate marketing spend. Don't expect us to do a huge overlay, not -- certainly not at this point. We're going to take spend from mid- and bottom funnel, reallocate it to brand and top of the funnel. And in our major markets, you should begin to see that show up through the second half. Particularly once the summer is over, you should begin to feel the sharpened eBay brand in our major markets."

I'm encouraged by it about how we do show consumer-sold inventory on both platforms.

We made good progress on our",1522,"Thanks, Selim, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a good quarter for us. We delivered strong top and bottom line financial results led by acceleration in our core eBay platform and continued strong performance from StubHub. We made good progress on our strategy, and we're starting to see some positive movement in underlying traffic and conversion metrics driven by early versions of our new user experiences.
Overall, total GMV was up 6% for the quarter, while revenue was up 7%, and active buyer growth was stable at 4% year-over-year as we added over 1 million new buyers to our platform in Q2. GMV on our Marketplace platform grew at 5% year-over-year, a 1-point acceleration, driven by strength in the U.S.
StubHub grew volume at 35% year-over-year, a 6-point acceleration, and our classified platform grew revenue at 15%. Finally, we repurchased $0.5 billion of our stock and continued to invest in acquisitions to help strengthen our business. We acquired Expertmaker in the quarter and recently announced our intent to acquire SalesPredict, each of which will enable our efforts around machine learning, artificial intelligence and structured data. And we announced our intent to acquire Ticketbis and Ticket Utils, further strengthening our StubHub platform. 
It's been a year since we spun off PayPal, and we announced a focused strategy to reposition our business for long-term success by driving the best choice, the most relevance and the most powerful selling platform. I have never been more convinced than I am today that this is the right strategy for our company, and I'm pleased to see how our teams have embraced this new direction and are driving execution.
However, I'm also clear about the gaps we still need to address in our business such as repositioning our brand, reigniting our new buyer acquisition flywheel and stemming the decline in our C2C platform. And while we're making good progress, our efforts will take time to yield material results in the business.
We continue to drive best choice by providing the broadest spectrum of value for our consumers while working with our sellers to offer high shipping standards. In Q2, we hit a significant milestone, crossing the 1 billion live listing mark for the first time in our history. And in the U.S., 2/3 of all items ship for free, and they arrived within 3 business days or less. This inventory growth is in part enabled by our success in signing on strategic inventory partners while continuing to tap into large pools of SMB merchants with partners like BigCommerce. 
Finally, we launched a new wine category and it's off to a very good start. You can expect several more category launches over the remainder of this year. We're also building on our highly successful multi-billion-dollar eBay Deals platform in the U.S., doubling the number of deals available to our consumers since the beginning of the year. All of our deals ship for free for everyone every day without a membership required.
Next, we continue innovating to drive the most relevant shopping experience for our consumers. These innovations are being built on top of a strong and growing foundation of structured data. Our structured data mandate currently covers approximately 60% of relevant live listings on our site, and in Q2, we increased the percentage of structured data listings that we've processed to 42% of relevant live listings.
While our effort to expand our penetration of structured data will continue over the coming months, our current footprint is already enabling us to build compelling new user experiences not previously possible in a listing space marketplace. Over time, this will help us in multiple areas of our business, including more effectively enabling our consumers to get the items they want and need through better search, browse and merchandising; educating our sellers on inventory gaps and opportunities; more persistent and better ranking in natural search results; and more effective paid search marketing just to name a few.
Product reviews are a great example of a feature made possible by structured data. In Q2, our customers added 3.1 million new product reviews, nearly double the number added in the prior quarter, for a total of nearly 12 million reviews on the platform.
Looking at other new user experiences. We continue to launch and iterate on our new browse and product pages, and we're starting to see early positive results. Q2 was the first positive quarter of SEO traffic in over 1.5 years. In the U.S., users who land in our new browse experience from our SEO channel are converting at approximately 10% higher rates, and we're also seeing similar results with our new product pages. We now have 15 million of these pages live and as we add more categories and more product pages, we'll have more data to validate these early encouraging signs.
While this is a step in the right direction, I want to remind you that SEO traffic only comprises about 10% of our overall traffic. We've recently launched the ability for users to quickly see the spectrum of value that our sellers offer through a product comparison experience across our selection of new, refurbished and used inventory. You can see this new experience in the slides accompanying my commentary.
Mobile has long been a competitive differentiator for us, and in order to maintain that advantage, we continue to invest and innovate on our mobile experience. In Q2, we launched a completely redesigned mobile experience and customer reception has been very positive so far. We've already released multiple updates enabled by our more efficient mobile development platform, which we released late last year. Our mobile experience is now getting back on the right track with marketplace mobile volume growth accelerating to 19% in the quarter.
As we make progress on the user experience, another key strategic focus for us this year has been to sharpen and more clearly differentiate our brand among consumers. As the #32 brand in the world according to Interbrand, we deliver a compelling value proposition to help every person get their version of perfect, no matter what it is. This speaks to the considerable strengths that come from the depth and breadth of our inventory and the incredible deals available to eBay shoppers every day, which are becoming increasingly discoverable and personalized. As we continue to roll out changes to the shopping experience on eBay, our brand promise will likewise more fully come to life for consumers. In Q2, we began to reflect this positioning in our marketing, and we plan to expand these efforts throughout the second half of 2016.
Finally, we continue to execute our plans to deliver the most powerful selling platform. Our structured data foundation is starting to enable us to provide sellers with insight into inventory gaps and opportunities on our Marketplace platform. In Q2, we ran several campaigns targeted to areas of the site where we saw high demand and not enough supply. These campaigns are enabling us to activate sellers and bring incremental inventory onto our platform.
On the consumer selling side, we're working in multiple areas to reduce friction and enable simpler experiences. Later this summer, we intend to launch a simplified listing flow on the core eBay platform that takes advantage of our structured data to save consumers time and effort in the listing process.
And consumers continue to leverage our assisted selling service, eBay Valet. Over 100,000 users have now experienced the service, and in Q2, we announced a partnership to expand Valet drop-off sites to all U.S. FedEx locations, which should help drive further adoption. 
StubHub had another stellar quarter driven by innovative user experiences and strength across multiple genres. Product experience changes we've made over the past year include a new pricing display, ticket recommendations and virtual reality in-seat views, and they continue to propel this platform to new heights. And we've recently announced our intent to acquire Ticketbis, which will help accelerate our international footprint, and Ticket Utils, which will help enable us to offer sellers enhanced tools to better manage their inventory. 
Our classified platform continues to grow steadily, building on our market-leading position in several countries. This momentum is driven by improving the mobile experience with services like in-app chat while focusing on building and strengthening verticals in several markets such as real estate in Germany. And we continue to work on driving synergies between Marketplace and Classifieds, testing ways to expose our inventory to consumers on both platforms.
In summary, Q2 was a good quarter for our business with accelerating volume and revenue growth. We continue to invest in product and technology and are accelerating the pace of innovation and new user experiences. One year since spinning off PayPal, we are executing our long-term business strategy and beginning to see the results from those efforts. And while there will be challenges along the way, you can count on us to make steady progress. eBay's business is strong and we're running it to ensure that we will be a global technology leader for years to come.
Now let me turn it over to Scott to provide more details on our Q2 results."

As Devin highlighted, we delivered good top and bottom line financial results this quarter driven by acceleration in our Marketplace and StubHub platforms. We are starting to see some green shoots of our strategic initiatives as we reposition our business for long-term success.
At the same time, we are clear about our challenges such as repositioning our brand, acquiring more new buyers, reinvigorating C2C and enabling the best tools for our sellers. We remain focused on our efforts to provide the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform as we continue executing our strategic plan.
During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 10. In Q2, we generated $2.2 billion of total revenue, $0.43 of non-GAAP EPS and $617 million in free cash flow. We repurchased $500 million of our stock and the Board of Directors has approved an additional $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization. And lastly, we are raising the full year guidance on revenue and EPS.
Let's start at the top of the funnel with Q2 active buyers on Slide 11. In the quarter, we increased the total active buyer base to 164 million, while trailing 12-month growth was stable at 4%. As Devin highlighted, SEO traffic improved in the quarter, but we are not yet seeing a material impact on acquiring new buyers through the SEO channel.
On Slide 12, we enabled $20.9 billion of GMV in Q2, up 6% versus last year, accelerating 1 point versus prior quarter. By geography, the U.S. generated $8.5 billion of GMV, up 5%, accelerating 2 points versus Q1. The acceleration was driven equally by Marketplace and StubHub. International delivered $12.3 billion of GMV, up 6% year-over-year.
Moving to revenue. We delivered net revenues of $2.2 billion, up 7% versus last year and accelerating 1 point versus Q1. We generated $1.7 billion of transaction revenue, up 5%, and $480 million of marketing services revenue, up 15%.
Transitioning to our Marketplaces platform on Slide 14. Q2 GMV grew 5% year-over-year, accelerating 1 point versus Q1. We are beginning to see early signs of recovery in such areas as mobile, C2C and SEO. While we are pleased to see the uptick in growth, we are cognizant we still have work ahead of us to stay on course.
Transaction revenue grew 2%, up 1 point sequentially, driven by the increase in volume plus lower spend in contra revenue. Marketing services revenue grew 11%, decelerating 8 points versus Q1, primarily driven by less ad monetization due to continued shift to mobile and fewer ad placements on the desktop. The PayPal operating agreement added 10 points of growth year-over-year to Marketplace MS&O. Excluding the PayPal operating agreement, Marketplace MS&O grew 1%.
Moving to Slide 15. Q2 was another standout quarter for StubHub. We delivered 35% GMV growth and 40% revenue growth, both accelerating 6 points versus Q1. We had a strong quarter across genres and in specific events such as the NBA Finals, Copa America and Hamilton, to name a few.  We also benefited from new product innovations introduced earlier this year. We released our virtual reality tool to a limited number of venues, and by the end of Q2, approximately 20% of StubHub customers utilized the virtual reality experience before buying their ticket for those venues.
In addition, our fans have increasingly been using our ticket recommendation feature, helping them quickly find the lowest price, the best value or the best seat. In Q2, we also kicked off an intensified cross-merchandising effort between StubHub and Marketplace, providing fans with a great opportunity to buy gear and memorabilia for the event they are attending.
Moving to Slide 16. In Q2, Classifieds revenue grew 15% year-over-year as we continue to drive strength in the automotive vertical across several geographies, including Germany, The Netherlands and Canada as well as our real estate verticals in Germany and Canada. While the growth decelerated 2 points versus Q1, Classifieds has consistently been in the double-digit range for the last 6 quarters.
Turning to Slide 17 and major cost drivers. Cost of revenue increased 160 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by the additional -- the addition of PayPal processing costs and the impact of foreign exchange. Q2 sales and marketing expense was relatively flat year-over-year, while product development increased 160 basis points. The increase was partially driven by the impact of foreign exchange but primarily by the investment in structured data, the core product experience and emerging trends in e-commerce such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.
G&A expense was relatively flat year-over-year with stand-up costs offset by productivity. Pulling all of that together, we delivered Q2 operating margin of 29.1%, down 300 basis points versus last year. The impact of foreign exchange was approximately 80 basis points and stand-up costs, an additional 90. The remaining increase was largely driven by our investment in product development.
Moving to Slide 18. In Q2, we delivered $0.43 in non-GAAP EPS, up $0.01 versus prior year, aided by share repurchases, which added roughly $0.03 of EPS. This was offset in part by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and stand-up costs, which cost roughly $0.01 of EPS each.
While my prepared remarks are focused on non-GAAP financial measures, I'd like to take a moment to touch on GAAP EPS. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP measures for eBay are stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and significant onetime items. In Q2, GAAP EPS was $0.38, up $0.03 versus Q2 2015. In addition to the $0.01 increase in GAAP -- non-GAAP EPS, the incremental $0.02 of GAAP EPS growth were driven by onetime investment gains and their associated tax effects. As we've done in the past, you can find the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings slides, which provide more detail.
On Slide 19, in Q2, we generated free cash flow of $617 million, up 79%, largely due to lapping separation-related costs incurred last year. As we previously discussed, 2016 will represent a more normalized level of free cash flow now that we're past separation. And we remain on track to deliver our full year guidance of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. CapEx was 7% of revenue in Q2. Our full year guidance remains 7% to 9%.
Moving to Slide 20. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $10.4 billion, including $3.1 billion in the U.S. During Q2 and over the past few weeks, we've announced multiple acquisitions, some of which have not yet closed. Ticketbis, Ticket Utils, Expertmaker and SalesPredict are on strategy and provide us with geographical expansion, tech and talent acquisition or both. We expect to spend approximately $250 million across all 4 acquisitions, although specific details have not been disclosed.
In Q2, we repurchased 20.8 million shares at an average price of $23.99 per share, amounting to $500 million in share repurchases. We ended the quarter with $300 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. The Board of Directors has approved an incremental $2.5 billion in share repurchase authorization. We remain on track with our full year plans for share repurchases as I laid out in our Q4 earnings call.
Before going through guidance, I'd like to touch on 3 topics: Brexit, foreign exchange and second half lapping. First on Brexit. With a weaker pound, we are seeing a boost in U.K. exports, which is driving a strong start to the quarter for our international business. This is offset by weaker U.K. import demand, particularly in the U.S. corridor. We have yet to see the impact of an economic slowdown on the U.K. domestic marketplace.
Second on foreign exchange. As I explained last quarter, our revenue remains fully exposed to movements in currency, so when the U.S. dollar strengthens, it impacts revenue directly. During the last earnings call, we estimated that if currency rates held for the balance of the year, we would have $80 million of second half revenue upside versus the guidance we issued in January. We did not include that upside in the updated April guidance on revenue and, based on current rates, we no longer expect any of this benefit.
With regards to earnings, our hedging program is to set up -- is set up to economically protect net income, which means our exposure versus guidance is limited to the portion that remains unhedged. And while the majority of the second half is hedged, foreign exchange will cost $0.01 of EPS in the back half of 2016 versus our prior full year guidance. Keep in mind that based on how our hedging is accounted for, we will continue to see the impact of hedging gains and losses in operating margins and OI&E.
Lastly on second half lapping. As we communicated previously, we will start lapping tougher comps for StubHub in September, and we will start lapping the PayPal operating agreement in July.
Now moving to Q3 guidance on Slide 21. For Q3, we are projecting revenue between $2.16 billion and $2.19 billion, growing 6% to 7% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.42 to $0.44 per share, representing minus 2% to plus 2% growth year-over-year. EPS growth is impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar, which in Q3 will cost us roughly 7 points of growth offset in part by the net benefit of the share repurchase program, which adds roughly 4 points of EPS growth.
Moving to the full year guidance on Slide 22. Based on continued strength across our platforms, we are raising revenue guidance for the full year. Revenue is now projected to be $8.85 billion to $8.95 billion, growing 5% to 6% year-over-year. We are also raising non-GAAP EPS guidance, now projected to be $1.85 to $1.90 per share, growing 1% to 4% year-over-year. The increase in guidance is driven by higher revenue and a more favorable tax rate of 19% to 20% partially offset by product investment and foreign exchange. The resulting impact is operating margin at the low end of the 31% to 33% range we provided in January. As always, you can find guidance for our projected GAAP measurements in the earnings release and appendix of the earnings presentation.
I'd like to take a moment to reflect on where we are today versus what we committed to 6 months ago. In January, we projected revenue growth of 2% to 5%, acknowledging that we had a lot of work ahead of us and that we aspired to do better. We now have 2 quarters of 6% to 7% revenue growth behind us, and we believe we are on the right path. The green shoots on our strategic initiatives and the accelerating volume and revenue growth give us confidence to raise our projections for the full year.
That said, we are realistic about what we need to accomplish and the challenges that lie ahead. We are making progress in executing our plan and we remain confident in pursuing our strategy to provide the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform.
And now we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator?"

Would love to get a little bit of color there. And then, Scott, on the cost structure of the business, we were a little surprised you called out lower contra revenue as well as lower sales and marketing, but you saw a reacceleration.

On structured data, our current efforts are crossing all categories, but I guess what I would point out is that the category where we've had structured data the longest, which is in part why we went down this path, is our parts and accessories business. We've had that even before we embarked on this journey. We've had that in place for a couple of years. It also happens to be our fastest growing category. So we do see that where we have time to build a catalog and then build experiences on top of it, in this case, for parts and accessories, we've built what we call Fitment, which is simply the ability to swap parts in and out and understand what fits -- what part fits what car. That's a great user experience. And each category is slightly different. That's unique to parts. But we are seeing some of the benefits now come through across multiple categories. I'll turn it to Scott for the second part of the question."

As it relates to this quarter, our marketing expense was roughly flat. And I think as you look forward, what you can expect is we'll be leaning in on our consideration in brand spend and reallocating within our marketing expense. That's not to preclude that we wouldn't invest more in contra per se, but that's kind of what we expect in the second half, which is a bit more within marketing expense reallocation."

If you were thinking about this, I don't know, scale of 1 to 10, obviously, contra revenue went up significantly after the data breach and everything. Are we now back down to where we were prior to that? Are we 70% of the way down? What's the right way to think of where we are and sort of how much further there is to go to potentially get back to normal? And then to the extent that motors is an area that you've seen significant strength over the last few quarters, how much of that would you say is a function of motors being one of the categories or one of the areas where you started with structured data early?

I think, as you know, vehicles, automotive, we don't put into GMV. More shows up in subscription revenue but -- within MS&O. But for parts and accessories, we've had a catalog in Fitment for a good period of time. And I think you can see through the product experience in a number of different areas that it's going to change over time, and how we're going to migrate towards that -- towards the product experience, it's based more on a catalog. And that's more specific and helpful when you search for an item. I think that's a -- one foundational aspect as we think about going forward with our structured data initiative. It's not, however, the overall aspect. I'm going to turn it over to Devin in a second to comment on that. To your earlier question on contra, year-over-year, we are actually spending a little bit more contra but, quarter-to-quarter, we're spending less. And so the way I would think about it is we're going to pulse this up and down. It's going to be -- I foresee it to be somewhat seasonal and very much ROI focused on a -- on testing our efficient frontier on CLV. So I don't know if it's going to migrate down per se as your question implied. I just view it as a -- over time, we're going to reallocate within our marketing expense and, in the second half of the year, you can expect us to reallocate it towards the top of the funnel or much more consideration-focused spend. And on occasion, we'll continue to spend into contra as the ROIs dictate."

Contra, for us, is about acquiring healthy customer cohorts and we'll keep doing that. On the structured data question, Heath, again, I think -- look, I don't want to read too much into any one category or any historical approach. For me, we've gone on a broad-based re-platforming of our data infrastructure. In January, I said I thought you might start to see it showing up a bit by the end of the year. Two quarters in advance, this quarter, we're starting to see it show up a bit. And I don't want to get over our skis. This is the beginning. We still have a lot of work to do. We've got a lot of re-platforming left, a lot of user experiences still to build, but there's no doubt that where we have deployed these new user experiences, we're seeing either improved conversion or improved traffic or both. And you can just see it in the user experience. It's not a leap of the imagination. It's just a simpler, better user experience that shows how eBay is unique by showing our consumers the broad-based spectrum of value we have in a way that's not overwhelming. And that's why we've gone down this path, and this quarter gives us confidence that we're on the right path."

You have said that eBay's customer experience should be fundamentally different by the fourth quarter, in large part because of the ongoing structured data initiative. Yet, your slide on the progress of structured data suggests only a small portion of the potential product pages were deployed by the end of 2Q. Is it correct then to assume that we should see a large number of structured data pages deployed in 3Q? And are you on path to achieve that? And secondly, can you shed some light on the extent to which the 11% FX-neutral growth in fixed-price GMV was due to cannibalization of auctions? Or is that close to a clean organic growth?"

Yes, we've had SEO challenges since May of '14 when Google made a significant algorithm change and a few other factors were at play. And there's been downward pressure slowly on our SEO channel ever since. It's been a long slow decline since then. It turned around this quarter, in part because, I believe, we're putting fantastic user experiences, based on structured data, into our SEO channel. I wouldn't get overly excited. It was marginally positive, but it was a positive trend. I do expect that trend to continue. I don't -- I -- we don't know because we don't control the SEO channel entirely. There are other factors at play. But my hope is that we're on a -- we've gone from a slow, steady downtick to a slow, steady uptick from here because I think, objectively, if you look at these new experiences, they are some of the best shopping experiences available on the Internet. On artificial intelligence and machine learning, some of it depends on how you use the term. I guess I'd say 2 things. One is when we talk about processing the data as the second step of our structured data approach, that is machine learning. That is taking the raw material that we get from sellers, who are identifying the products they're selling through product identifiers, and turning that into a catalog by using computing power to understand the associations, the hierarchies and taxonomies that go into building a catalog that tells us where things go on the shelves metaphorically. So yes, we're already doing that. I think that when I look out to the future, we're also planting seeds because I think that the impact of AI will be much more significant on commerce eventually. I think that when we see now the way large-scale datasets are being used by algorithms through things like GPUs in the cloud, to me, AI is going to be the next platform revolution. And just like eBay was early on the Internet, was early on mobile, I want us to be early on AI. So yes, it's part of how we're building the catalog. But I think when I look out a few years, it's going to be significant for a massive improvement to personalization for consumers and targeting to sellers. So we're building that capability now, possibly a little bit in advance of when that platform revolution comes."

I think that's the right one. It's called Structured Data: User Experiences. And the question was would the conversion hold when we look at the direct channel? It depends. I think, for us, the biggest question is how do we deploy this in the search results pages, where a lot of the traffic ends up, whether it's through SEO or direct. And we're just starting to experiment with that. That, as you would understand, is the area we have to be the most careful. And that's when people say, ""Why don't you just throw all these experiences in? It seems to be working."" We've got a high converting, very high traffic search channel. I think that these pages matter in there. They will make an impact. But that's the main artery of commerce, and we've got to be careful. And that will take test-and-learn time. Is there any reason I believe that we won't get conversion improvements? No, there's no reason that I would believe we would not get conversion improvements over time.

It's still a multi-year journey. We're seeing some green shoots but it's still a multi-year journey. I want to make sure we don't get over exuberant and say, ""Wow, this is just going to explode from here."" We still have a ton of work to do on this and I just want to make sure everybody understands that. On the second question around brand, there's 2 things that are going on -- actually, 3. One is we're clear about our brand. We're clear about what the eBay brand stands for and how it's different and how that manifests itself to consumers. This idea of everybody can find their version of perfect is distinct to eBay. And I want every consumer in the world to understand that eventually. And that's our job. I've said 2 quarters ago, we had to sharpen our brand and now we're clear about what it is. Second, we do like the trajectory we're on with these user experiences. We believe that if we bring more people to eBay, they'll like what they see. And third, in the second quarter, we began to do some consideration testing. We did a test in the U.K. We did a test in the U.S. A little bit of brand spend, a little bit of top of funnel. That was a little outdoor, a little television and the results were positive. We saw traffic and new user acceleration. Based on those 3 things, we're going to reallocate marketing spend. Don't expect us to do a huge overlay, not -- certainly not at this point. We're going to take spend from mid- and bottom funnel, reallocate it to brand and top of the funnel. And in our major markets, you should begin to see that show up through the second half. Particularly once the summer is over, you should begin to feel the sharpened eBay brand in our major markets."

There's no doubt that the innovation at the point of the product is driving StubHub share gains and market competitive position. Both the ticket pricing engine and the change to the way pricing is displayed have driven clear, demonstrable growth. I'm even amazed when we talk about making innovative bets for the future. When we went down the path of building a VR application, we thought it was a little early, but it was an interesting thing to do, see how consumers like it. You heard in Scott's remarks, for the venues available, mostly MLB baseball stadiums, I mean, 20% of ticket sales touch that VR application. That's a big deal. And we have excellent product and technology capability not just in StubHub and in eBay. And as the world moves to digital, I want to use that to drive a competitive wedge between us and the physical world. So I feel really good about StubHub's market position. Their growth's going to come down because they're going to hit a growth wall, as Scott said, in September, but that doesn't change the fact that StubHub is very well positioned in the market right now. On acquisitions, steady as she goes. If we find acquisitions that make sense to expand their portfolio, whether it's tech, talent or geographic expansion or whatever, we won't hesitate to do it. We have a strong balance sheet. We'll be disciplined. But we won't back down from accelerating on our strategy."

Q2 was a good quarter for us. We delivered strong top and bottom line financial results led by acceleration in our core eBay platform and continued strong performance from StubHub. We made good progress on our",1522,"Thanks, Selim, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a good quarter for us. We delivered strong top and bottom line financial results led by acceleration in our core eBay platform and continued strong performance from StubHub. We made good progress on our strategy, and we're starting to see some positive movement in underlying traffic and conversion metrics driven by early versions of our new user experiences.
Overall, total GMV was up 6% for the quarter, while revenue was up 7%, and active buyer growth was stable at 4% year-over-year as we added over 1 million new buyers to our platform in Q2. GMV on our Marketplace platform grew at 5% year-over-year, a 1-point acceleration, driven by strength in the U.S.
StubHub grew volume at 35% year-over-year, a 6-point acceleration, and our classified platform grew revenue at 15%. Finally, we repurchased $0.5 billion of our stock and continued to invest in acquisitions to help strengthen our business. We acquired Expertmaker in the quarter and recently announced our intent to acquire SalesPredict, each of which will enable our efforts around machine learning, artificial intelligence and structured data. And we announced our intent to acquire Ticketbis and Ticket Utils, further strengthening our StubHub platform. 
It's been a year since we spun off PayPal, and we announced a focused strategy to reposition our business for long-term success by driving the best choice, the most relevance and the most powerful selling platform. I have never been more convinced than I am today that this is the right strategy for our company, and I'm pleased to see how our teams have embraced this new direction and are driving execution.
However, I'm also clear about the gaps we still need to address in our business such as repositioning our brand, reigniting our new buyer acquisition flywheel and stemming the decline in our C2C platform. And while we're making good progress, our efforts will take time to yield material results in the business.
We continue to drive best choice by providing the broadest spectrum of value for our consumers while working with our sellers to offer high shipping standards. In Q2, we hit a significant milestone, crossing the 1 billion live listing mark for the first time in our history. And in the U.S., 2/3 of all items ship for free, and they arrived within 3 business days or less. This inventory growth is in part enabled by our success in signing on strategic inventory partners while continuing to tap into large pools of SMB merchants with partners like BigCommerce. 
Finally, we launched a new wine category and it's off to a very good start. You can expect several more category launches over the remainder of this year. We're also building on our highly successful multi-billion-dollar eBay Deals platform in the U.S., doubling the number of deals available to our consumers since the beginning of the year. All of our deals ship for free for everyone every day without a membership required.
Next, we continue innovating to drive the most relevant shopping experience for our consumers. These innovations are being built on top of a strong and growing foundation of structured data. Our structured data mandate currently covers approximately 60% of relevant live listings on our site, and in Q2, we increased the percentage of structured data listings that we've processed to 42% of relevant live listings.
While our effort to expand our penetration of structured data will continue over the coming months, our current footprint is already enabling us to build compelling new user experiences not previously possible in a listing space marketplace. Over time, this will help us in multiple areas of our business, including more effectively enabling our consumers to get the items they want and need through better search, browse and merchandising; educating our sellers on inventory gaps and opportunities; more persistent and better ranking in natural search results; and more effective paid search marketing just to name a few.
Product reviews are a great example of a feature made possible by structured data. In Q2, our customers added 3.1 million new product reviews, nearly double the number added in the prior quarter, for a total of nearly 12 million reviews on the platform.
Looking at other new user experiences. We continue to launch and iterate on our new browse and product pages, and we're starting to see early positive results. Q2 was the first positive quarter of SEO traffic in over 1.5 years. In the U.S., users who land in our new browse experience from our SEO channel are converting at approximately 10% higher rates, and we're also seeing similar results with our new product pages. We now have 15 million of these pages live and as we add more categories and more product pages, we'll have more data to validate these early encouraging signs.
While this is a step in the right direction, I want to remind you that SEO traffic only comprises about 10% of our overall traffic. We've recently launched the ability for users to quickly see the spectrum of value that our sellers offer through a product comparison experience across our selection of new, refurbished and used inventory. You can see this new experience in the slides accompanying my commentary.
Mobile has long been a competitive differentiator for us, and in order to maintain that advantage, we continue to invest and innovate on our mobile experience. In Q2, we launched a completely redesigned mobile experience and customer reception has been very positive so far. We've already released multiple updates enabled by our more efficient mobile development platform, which we released late last year. Our mobile experience is now getting back on the right track with marketplace mobile volume growth accelerating to 19% in the quarter.
As we make progress on the user experience, another key strategic focus for us this year has been to sharpen and more clearly differentiate our brand among consumers. As the #32 brand in the world according to Interbrand, we deliver a compelling value proposition to help every person get their version of perfect, no matter what it is. This speaks to the considerable strengths that come from the depth and breadth of our inventory and the incredible deals available to eBay shoppers every day, which are becoming increasingly discoverable and personalized. As we continue to roll out changes to the shopping experience on eBay, our brand promise will likewise more fully come to life for consumers. In Q2, we began to reflect this positioning in our marketing, and we plan to expand these efforts throughout the second half of 2016.
Finally, we continue to execute our plans to deliver the most powerful selling platform. Our structured data foundation is starting to enable us to provide sellers with insight into inventory gaps and opportunities on our Marketplace platform. In Q2, we ran several campaigns targeted to areas of the site where we saw high demand and not enough supply. These campaigns are enabling us to activate sellers and bring incremental inventory onto our platform.
On the consumer selling side, we're working in multiple areas to reduce friction and enable simpler experiences. Later this summer, we intend to launch a simplified listing flow on the core eBay platform that takes advantage of our structured data to save consumers time and effort in the listing process.
And consumers continue to leverage our assisted selling service, eBay Valet. Over 100,000 users have now experienced the service, and in Q2, we announced a partnership to expand Valet drop-off sites to all U.S. FedEx locations, which should help drive further adoption. 
StubHub had another stellar quarter driven by innovative user experiences and strength across multiple genres. Product experience changes we've made over the past year include a new pricing display, ticket recommendations and virtual reality in-seat views, and they continue to propel this platform to new heights. And we've recently announced our intent to acquire Ticketbis, which will help accelerate our international footprint, and Ticket Utils, which will help enable us to offer sellers enhanced tools to better manage their inventory. 
Our classified platform continues to grow steadily, building on our market-leading position in several countries. This momentum is driven by improving the mobile experience with services like in-app chat while focusing on building and strengthening verticals in several markets such as real estate in Germany. And we continue to work on driving synergies between Marketplace and Classifieds, testing ways to expose our inventory to consumers on both platforms.
In summary, Q2 was a good quarter for our business with accelerating volume and revenue growth. We continue to invest in product and technology and are accelerating the pace of innovation and new user experiences. One year since spinning off PayPal, we are executing our long-term business strategy and beginning to see the results from those efforts. And while there will be challenges along the way, you can count on us to make steady progress. eBay's business is strong and we're running it to ensure that we will be a global technology leader for years to come.
Now let me turn it over to Scott to provide more details on our Q2 results."

As Devin highlighted, we delivered good top and bottom line financial results this quarter driven by acceleration in our Marketplace and StubHub platforms. We are starting to see some green shoots of our strategic initiatives as we reposition our business for long-term success.
At the same time, we are clear about our challenges such as repositioning our brand, acquiring more new buyers, reinvigorating C2C and enabling the best tools for our sellers. We remain focused on our efforts to provide the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform as we continue executing our strategic plan.
During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 10. In Q2, we generated $2.2 billion of total revenue, $0.43 of non-GAAP EPS and $617 million in free cash flow. We repurchased $500 million of our stock and the Board of Directors has approved an additional $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization. And lastly, we are raising the full year guidance on revenue and EPS.
Let's start at the top of the funnel with Q2 active buyers on Slide 11. In the quarter, we increased the total active buyer base to 164 million, while trailing 12-month growth was stable at 4%. As Devin highlighted, SEO traffic improved in the quarter, but we are not yet seeing a material impact on acquiring new buyers through the SEO channel.
On Slide 12, we enabled $20.9 billion of GMV in Q2, up 6% versus last year, accelerating 1 point versus prior quarter. By geography, the U.S. generated $8.5 billion of GMV, up 5%, accelerating 2 points versus Q1. The acceleration was driven equally by Marketplace and StubHub. International delivered $12.3 billion of GMV, up 6% year-over-year.
Moving to revenue. We delivered net revenues of $2.2 billion, up 7% versus last year and accelerating 1 point versus Q1. We generated $1.7 billion of transaction revenue, up 5%, and $480 million of marketing services revenue, up 15%.
Transitioning to our Marketplaces platform on Slide 14. Q2 GMV grew 5% year-over-year, accelerating 1 point versus Q1. We are beginning to see early signs of recovery in such areas as mobile, C2C and SEO. While we are pleased to see the uptick in growth, we are cognizant we still have work ahead of us to stay on course.
Transaction revenue grew 2%, up 1 point sequentially, driven by the increase in volume plus lower spend in contra revenue. Marketing services revenue grew 11%, decelerating 8 points versus Q1, primarily driven by less ad monetization due to continued shift to mobile and fewer ad placements on the desktop. The PayPal operating agreement added 10 points of growth year-over-year to Marketplace MS&O. Excluding the PayPal operating agreement, Marketplace MS&O grew 1%.
Moving to Slide 15. Q2 was another standout quarter for StubHub. We delivered 35% GMV growth and 40% revenue growth, both accelerating 6 points versus Q1. We had a strong quarter across genres and in specific events such as the NBA Finals, Copa America and Hamilton, to name a few.  We also benefited from new product innovations introduced earlier this year. We released our virtual reality tool to a limited number of venues, and by the end of Q2, approximately 20% of StubHub customers utilized the virtual reality experience before buying their ticket for those venues.
In addition, our fans have increasingly been using our ticket recommendation feature, helping them quickly find the lowest price, the best value or the best seat. In Q2, we also kicked off an intensified cross-merchandising effort between StubHub and Marketplace, providing fans with a great opportunity to buy gear and memorabilia for the event they are attending.
Moving to Slide 16. In Q2, Classifieds revenue grew 15% year-over-year as we continue to drive strength in the automotive vertical across several geographies, including Germany, The Netherlands and Canada as well as our real estate verticals in Germany and Canada. While the growth decelerated 2 points versus Q1, Classifieds has consistently been in the double-digit range for the last 6 quarters.
Turning to Slide 17 and major cost drivers. Cost of revenue increased 160 basis points year-over-year driven primarily by the additional -- the addition of PayPal processing costs and the impact of foreign exchange. Q2 sales and marketing expense was relatively flat year-over-year, while product development increased 160 basis points. The increase was partially driven by the impact of foreign exchange but primarily by the investment in structured data, the core product experience and emerging trends in e-commerce such as artificial intelligence and machine learning.
G&A expense was relatively flat year-over-year with stand-up costs offset by productivity. Pulling all of that together, we delivered Q2 operating margin of 29.1%, down 300 basis points versus last year. The impact of foreign exchange was approximately 80 basis points and stand-up costs, an additional 90. The remaining increase was largely driven by our investment in product development.
Moving to Slide 18. In Q2, we delivered $0.43 in non-GAAP EPS, up $0.01 versus prior year, aided by share repurchases, which added roughly $0.03 of EPS. This was offset in part by the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and stand-up costs, which cost roughly $0.01 of EPS each.
While my prepared remarks are focused on non-GAAP financial measures, I'd like to take a moment to touch on GAAP EPS. The difference between GAAP and non-GAAP measures for eBay are stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles and significant onetime items. In Q2, GAAP EPS was $0.38, up $0.03 versus Q2 2015. In addition to the $0.01 increase in GAAP -- non-GAAP EPS, the incremental $0.02 of GAAP EPS growth were driven by onetime investment gains and their associated tax effects. As we've done in the past, you can find the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings slides, which provide more detail.
On Slide 19, in Q2, we generated free cash flow of $617 million, up 79%, largely due to lapping separation-related costs incurred last year. As we previously discussed, 2016 will represent a more normalized level of free cash flow now that we're past separation. And we remain on track to deliver our full year guidance of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. CapEx was 7% of revenue in Q2. Our full year guidance remains 7% to 9%.
Moving to Slide 20. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $10.4 billion, including $3.1 billion in the U.S. During Q2 and over the past few weeks, we've announced multiple acquisitions, some of which have not yet closed. Ticketbis, Ticket Utils, Expertmaker and SalesPredict are on strategy and provide us with geographical expansion, tech and talent acquisition or both. We expect to spend approximately $250 million across all 4 acquisitions, although specific details have not been disclosed.
In Q2, we repurchased 20.8 million shares at an average price of $23.99 per share, amounting to $500 million in share repurchases. We ended the quarter with $300 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. The Board of Directors has approved an incremental $2.5 billion in share repurchase authorization. We remain on track with our full year plans for share repurchases as I laid out in our Q4 earnings call.
Before going through guidance, I'd like to touch on 3 topics: Brexit, foreign exchange and second half lapping. First on Brexit. With a weaker pound, we are seeing a boost in U.K. exports, which is driving a strong start to the quarter for our international business. This is offset by weaker U.K. import demand, particularly in the U.S. corridor. We have yet to see the impact of an economic slowdown on the U.K. domestic marketplace.
Second on foreign exchange. As I explained last quarter, our revenue remains fully exposed to movements in currency, so when the U.S. dollar strengthens, it impacts revenue directly. During the last earnings call, we estimated that if currency rates held for the balance of the year, we would have $80 million of second half revenue upside versus the guidance we issued in January. We did not include that upside in the updated April guidance on revenue and, based on current rates, we no longer expect any of this benefit.
With regards to earnings, our hedging program is to set up -- is set up to economically protect net income, which means our exposure versus guidance is limited to the portion that remains unhedged. And while the majority of the second half is hedged, foreign exchange will cost $0.01 of EPS in the back half of 2016 versus our prior full year guidance. Keep in mind that based on how our hedging is accounted for, we will continue to see the impact of hedging gains and losses in operating margins and OI&E.
Lastly on second half lapping. As we communicated previously, we will start lapping tougher comps for StubHub in September, and we will start lapping the PayPal operating agreement in July.
Now moving to Q3 guidance on Slide 21. For Q3, we are projecting revenue between $2.16 billion and $2.19 billion, growing 6% to 7% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.42 to $0.44 per share, representing minus 2% to plus 2% growth year-over-year. EPS growth is impacted by the stronger U.S. dollar, which in Q3 will cost us roughly 7 points of growth offset in part by the net benefit of the share repurchase program, which adds roughly 4 points of EPS growth.
Moving to the full year guidance on Slide 22. Based on continued strength across our platforms, we are raising revenue guidance for the full year. Revenue is now projected to be $8.85 billion to $8.95 billion, growing 5% to 6% year-over-year. We are also raising non-GAAP EPS guidance, now projected to be $1.85 to $1.90 per share, growing 1% to 4% year-over-year. The increase in guidance is driven by higher revenue and a more favorable tax rate of 19% to 20% partially offset by product investment and foreign exchange. The resulting impact is operating margin at the low end of the 31% to 33% range we provided in January. As always, you can find guidance for our projected GAAP measurements in the earnings release and appendix of the earnings presentation.
I'd like to take a moment to reflect on where we are today versus what we committed to 6 months ago. In January, we projected revenue growth of 2% to 5%, acknowledging that we had a lot of work ahead of us and that we aspired to do better. We now have 2 quarters of 6% to 7% revenue growth behind us, and we believe we are on the right path. The green shoots on our strategic initiatives and the accelerating volume and revenue growth give us confidence to raise our projections for the full year.
That said, we are realistic about what we need to accomplish and the challenges that lie ahead. We are making progress in executing our plan and we remain confident in pursuing our strategy to provide the best choice, the most relevance and a powerful selling platform.
And now we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator?"

And then, Scott, on the cost structure of the business, we were a little surprised you called out lower contra revenue as well as lower sales and marketing, but you saw a reacceleration. Want to know what that might mean for the cost structure of the business long term and sort of return on marketing spend."

On structured data, our current efforts are crossing all categories, but I guess what I would point out is that the category where we've had structured data the longest, which is in part why we went down this path, is our parts and accessories business. We've had that even before we embarked on this journey. We've had that in place for a couple of years. It also happens to be our fastest growing category. So we do see that where we have time to build a catalog and then build experiences on top of it, in this case, for parts and accessories, we've built what we call Fitment, which is simply the ability to swap parts in and out and understand what fits -- what part fits what car. That's a great user experience. And each category is slightly different. That's unique to parts. But we are seeing some of the benefits now come through across multiple categories. I'll turn it to Scott for the second part of the question."

As it relates to this quarter, our marketing expense was roughly flat. And I think as you look forward, what you can expect is we'll be leaning in on our consideration in brand spend and reallocating within our marketing expense. That's not to preclude that we wouldn't invest more in contra per se, but that's kind of what we expect in the second half, which is a bit more within marketing expense reallocation."

I think, as you know, vehicles, automotive, we don't put into GMV. More shows up in subscription revenue but -- within MS&O. But for parts and accessories, we've had a catalog in Fitment for a good period of time. And I think you can see through the product experience in a number of different areas that it's going to change over time, and how we're going to migrate towards that -- towards the product experience, it's based more on a catalog. And that's more specific and helpful when you search for an item. I think that's a -- one foundational aspect as we think about going forward with our structured data initiative. It's not, however, the overall aspect. I'm going to turn it over to Devin in a second to comment on that. To your earlier question on contra, year-over-year, we are actually spending a little bit more contra but, quarter-to-quarter, we're spending less. And so the way I would think about it is we're going to pulse this up and down. It's going to be -- I foresee it to be somewhat seasonal and very much ROI focused on a -- on testing our efficient frontier on CLV. So I don't know if it's going to migrate down per se as your question implied. I just view it as a -- over time, we're going to reallocate within our marketing expense and, in the second half of the year, you can expect us to reallocate it towards the top of the funnel or much more consideration-focused spend.

On the structured data question, Heath, again, I think -- look, I don't want to read too much into any one category or any historical approach. For me, we've gone on a broad-based re-platforming of our data infrastructure. In January, I said I thought you might start to see it showing up a bit by the end of the year. Two quarters in advance, this quarter, we're starting to see it show up a bit. And I don't want to get over our skis. This is the beginning. We still have a lot of work to do. We've got a lot of re-platforming left, a lot of user experiences still to build, but there's no doubt that where we have deployed these new user experiences, we're seeing either improved conversion or improved traffic or both. And you can just see it in the user experience. It's not a leap of the imagination. It's just a simpler, better user experience that shows how eBay is unique by showing our consumers the broad-based spectrum of value we have in a way that's not overwhelming. And that's why we've gone down this path, and this quarter gives us confidence that we're on the right path."

Yes, we've had SEO challenges since May of '14 when Google made a significant algorithm change and a few other factors were at play. And there's been downward pressure slowly on our SEO channel ever since. It's been a long slow decline since then. It turned around this quarter, in part because, I believe, we're putting fantastic user experiences, based on structured data, into our SEO channel. I wouldn't get overly excited. It was marginally positive, but it was a positive trend. I do expect that trend to continue. I don't -- I -- we don't know because we don't control the SEO channel entirely. There are other factors at play. But my hope is that we're on a -- we've gone from a slow, steady downtick to a slow, steady uptick from here because I think, objectively, if you look at these new experiences, they are some of the best shopping experiences available on the Internet. On artificial intelligence and machine learning, some of it depends on how you use the term. I guess I'd say 2 things. One is when we talk about processing the data as the second step of our structured data approach, that is machine learning. That is taking the raw material that we get from sellers, who are identifying the products they're selling through product identifiers, and turning that into a catalog by using computing power to understand the associations, the hierarchies and taxonomies that go into building a catalog that tells us where things go on the shelves metaphorically. So yes, we're already doing that. I think that when I look out to the future, we're also planting seeds because I think that the impact of AI will be much more significant on commerce eventually. I think that when we see now the way large-scale datasets are being used by algorithms through things like GPUs in the cloud, to me, AI is going to be the next platform revolution. And just like eBay was early on the Internet, was early on mobile, I want us to be early on AI. So yes, it's part of how we're building the catalog. But I think when I look out a few years, it's going to be significant for a massive improvement to personalization for consumers and targeting to sellers. So we're building that capability now, possibly a little bit in advance of when that platform revolution comes."

One is we're clear about our brand. We're clear about what the eBay brand stands for and how it's different and how that manifests itself to consumers. This idea of everybody can find their version of perfect is distinct to eBay. And I want every consumer in the world to understand that eventually. And that's our job. I've said 2 quarters ago, we had to sharpen our brand and now we're clear about what it is. Second, we do like the trajectory we're on with these user experiences. We believe that if we bring more people to eBay, they'll like what they see. And third, in the second quarter, we began to do some consideration testing. We did a test in the U.K. We did a test in the U.S. A little bit of brand spend, a little bit of top of funnel. That was a little outdoor, a little television and the results were positive. We saw traffic and new user acceleration. Based on those 3 things, we're going to reallocate marketing spend. Don't expect us to do a huge overlay, not -- certainly not at this point. We're going to take spend from mid- and bottom funnel, reallocate it to brand and top of the funnel. And in our major markets, you should begin to see that show up through the second half. Particularly once the summer is over, you should begin to feel the sharpened eBay brand in our major markets."

But it's early days on this, and we'll continue to watch what's going on with the domestic U.K. marketplace as we go forward in the quarter."

There's a really good complement between traffic customers and merchandising, and we'll drive hard at that. On Classifieds, similarly, we have a couple of very interesting experiments. I'm encouraged by it about how we do show consumer-sold inventory on both platforms. It's -- at the end of the day, it's a different format, but ultimately, it's a consumer trying to sell an item and there's a buyer somewhere that wants that item.

When we went down the path of building a VR application, we thought it was a little early, but it was an interesting thing to do, see how consumers like it. You heard in Scott's remarks, for the venues available, mostly MLB baseball stadiums, I mean, 20% of ticket sales touch that VR application. That's a big deal. And we have excellent product and technology capability not just in StubHub and in eBay. And as the world moves to digital, I want to use that to drive a competitive wedge between us and the physical world. So I feel really good about StubHub's market position. Their growth's going to come down because they're going to hit a growth wall, as Scott said, in September, but that doesn't change the fact that StubHub is very well positioned in the market right now. On acquisitions, steady as she goes. If we find acquisitions that make sense to expand their portfolio, whether it's tech, talent or geographic expansion or whatever, we won't hesitate to do it. We have a strong balance sheet. We'll be disciplined. But we won't back down from accelerating on our strategy."

We delivered good top and bottom line financial results in Q3 led by consistent performance in our core eBay platform and strong growth from StubHub and Classifieds.

We delivered good top and bottom line financial results in Q3 led by consistent performance in our core eBay platform and strong growth from StubHub and Classifieds. We made progress on our strategy, began activating our new brand marketing messages, and we readied our organization to execute in the upcoming holiday quarter.
Overall, total GMV was up 5% for the quarter, while revenue was up 8%. GMV decelerated modestly while revenue accelerated 1 point. GMV deceleration was driven primarily by StubHub lapping last year's product changes and in part, by the shift of marketing spend to longer-cycle brand investments on our Marketplace platform. The revenue acceleration was driven primarily by lower contra revenue spend and a VAT settlement.
Active buyer growth was 3%, and we added over 1 million additional buyers to our platforms in Q3. GMV on our Marketplace platform grew at 4%, while StubHub grew volume at 23%. And our Classified platform grew revenue at 14%. Finally, we repurchased $0.5 billion of our stock, and we closed several key acquisitions that we announced over the last several months.
On our Marketplace platform, we continue to make steady progress against our strategy to drive the best choice, the most relevance and the most powerful selling platform. In Q3, we signed several new strategic brand partners, including Mattel, Fender, Volcom and Magic Chef, enhancing our efforts to drive more choice for our consumers. Using our data, we're also increasingly reaching out to our sellers to prompt them to source and list in-demand goods where we see gaps in supply.
And finally, in the past several months, we've launched several new curated vertical experiences in fashion and home and garden. Most recently, we announced eBay Collective in the U.S., a shopping destination, which provides consumers with curated inventory for antique, modern and contemporary furniture and fine art. This is similar to the approach we took earlier in the year with the launch of our curated Wine category on eBay, and it's an approach we'll seek to replicate going forward where we see the opportunity to do so.
I'm particularly excited about the improvements we're making to drive the most relevant shopping experience for our consumers. We continue to process more data from our structured data initiative, which enables us to have better insight into the inventory on our site and to build better user experiences.
In Q3, we increased the percentage of structured data listings processed to 48% of relevant live listings. The ongoing growth and penetration of structured data is enabling us to accelerate the pace of new browse and product page launches, and we ended Q3 with over 100 million pages built on structured data that showcase our inventory in ways that were not possible just a year ago. We're further enhancing these pages by introducing new features such as multiple top picks, product comparisons and limited-time deals, and we continue to see significantly higher conversion. While these early results give us continued confidence in our strategy, our new pages are currently being exposed to a very small fraction of our traffic. The majority of our business today comes through our organic on eBay [ph] search funnel. Over time, we expect to start introducing these new experiences to our organic traffic. Now while we're moving at an urgent pace, you can expect us to take an intelligent approach to this transition to ensure that we don't disrupt our customers along the way.
Another area I'm excited about is mobile. Since the launch of our redesigned eBay mobile apps in May, customer reviews have trended higher as we've seen -- as we have significantly improved the speed and the usability of our apps. And our ability to rapidly iterate on user feedback has enabled us to keep this positive momentum going. We recently released the fifth update to our new mobile experience in the past 5 months, and this cadence of improvements is translating into better growth with Q3 being the second quarter in a row of mobile growth acceleration.
We're also beginning to leverage artificial intelligence to power unique commerce experiences for our users. Yesterday, we announced the beta launch of eBay ShopBot on Facebook Messenger, a personalized shopping assistant that enables people to find the best deals from eBay's 1 billion listings. Our vision is to make shopping with eBay as easy as talking to a friend, whether you're looking for something specific or you're browsing for inspiration.
eBay continues to be one of the leading consumer brands in the world, having recently been ranked #32 by Interbrand in their 2016 Best Global Brands report. This is the same position that eBay achieved in 2015, and we view this as positive because the recent ranking reflects the first full year post the PayPal spin.
With that said, we've also been doing considerable work to sharpen our brand. During Q3, we began to activate our new brand messages by running several marketing pilots externally. We continue to shift more of our marketing resources towards top-of-the-funnel consideration and will further ramp our external efforts during the upcoming holiday season and into 2017. This includes plans to advertise on TV in the U.S. and Europe during this holiday season, which we have not done since 2014.
Finally, we continue to execute on our plans to deliver the most powerful selling platform. In August, we launched Seller Hub to all U.S. sellers and have recently begun the process of rolling that out to international markets. Thus far, over 0.5 million sellers have used Seller Hub, and we're seeing early improvements in key listing metrics and strong adoption of marketing features such as our promotions tool. And we're steadily expanding our promoted listings product, enabling more and more sellers to bid their inventory for placement in search results. We also today announced the launch of an entirely new set of APIs, making it simpler for our developers and sellers to rapidly integrate with eBay and onboard all their inventory using retail and industry standard practice.
On the consumer selling side, we continue to simplify selling on eBay. We recently began rolling out our simplified listing flow to a portion of first-time consumer sellers. While still early, we're seeing better completion rates and improved listing quality. We're also seeing strong demand for our assisted selling service, eBay Valet. We now have drop-off sites live in 1,700 FedEx locations, and we've made several improvements to enable a better user experience, including upfront value estimation and item eligibility. And in September, we launched Quick Sale, which enables consumers to trade in their mobile phone with transparent pricing, taking advantage of mobile phone industry upgrade cycles.
StubHub continues to innovate and execute against the large and increasingly global market opportunity. The team continues to drive innovative user experiences, expanding our virtual reality technology to 55 total venues, which represent over 1/3 of ticket sales on our native app platform. We also recently launched our blended primary and secondary ticket experience for the Philadelphia 76ers and launched the ability for users to receive support through a Skype chatbot.
Growth began to slow in the quarter as we started to lap the product changes we made last September, and our comps will get more difficult from here. However, we believe our strategy of expanding internationally and selectively tapping into the primary market will serve us well over the long term.
Our Classified platform continues its good growth, driven by strong vibrancy metrics across our major markets, increased engagement with our native mobile apps and continued strength in the motors and the real estate verticals across our key markets. And we're working to leverage all 3 of our platforms to drive great consumer experiences. The eBay and Gumtree inventory integration effort that we launched in Australia in Q2 show good results, and we'll now roll out the integration of core inventory into our Classified sites in several other markets. We also began testing ticketing inventory integration between Kijiji Canada and StubHub. We envision tying our strong eBay assets closer together over time to enable a more unified experience for all of our consumers.
In summary, we're making meaningful progress on our strategy while delivering good financial results. Re-platforming a business of our size and scale takes time. However, our pace of innovation has accelerated. We're increasingly using structured data and artificial intelligence to transform shopping on eBay, delivering more personalization capabilities, continuing to iterate our mobile experience and bringing more unique inventory and categories to our customers. We've got more work to do, but I'm confident we're on the right path.
Now let me turn it over to Scott, and he'll provide more details on our Q3 results."

In Q3 business performance was stable, and we delivered good financial results while executing on our strategic priorities. StubHub and Classifieds continued growing double digits, and the Marketplace improvements we saw last quarter are still evident in mobile C2C and SEO. As we reflect on the last 9 months, we remain confident in our strategy and we continue to make progress.
During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 4. In Q3, we generated $2.2 billion of total revenue, $0.45 of non-GAAP EPS, $617 million in free cash flow, and we repurchased $500 million of our stock. In addition, we are raising the full year guidance on revenue and expect to be in the middle of the previously communicated non-GAAP EPS range.
Let's start with Q3 active buyers on Slide 5. In the quarter, trailing 12-month growth was down 1 point to 3% year-over-year. The quarter-over-quarter deceleration was driven by lapping last year's increased marketing spend in India.
On Slide 6, we enabled $20.1 billion of GMV in Q3, up 5% versus last year, decelerating 1 point versus prior quarter, driven by StubHub and the U.S. Marketplace platform. By geography, the U.S. generated $8.4 billion of GMV, up 3%, while the international delivered $11.7 billion of GMV, up 7% year-over-year.
Moving to revenue. We generated net revenues of $2.2 billion, up 8% versus last year, accelerating 1 point versus Q2. We delivered $1.7 billion of transaction revenue, up 8% and $470 million of marketing services and other revenue, up 10%.
Transitioning to our Marketplaces platform on Slide 8. Q3 grew [ph] 4% year-over-year, rounding down 1 point versus Q2. U.S. GMV decelerated as we shifted marketing spend to more brand awareness, which tends to have a longer payback as we start to influence consideration. International GMV improved slightly quarter-over-quarter, rounding up 1 point.
Total Marketplace revenue was $1.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, a 2 point acceleration versus prior quarter. Transaction revenue grew 5%, up 3 points quarter-over-quarter. This acceleration is attributed to reduced marketing incentives that show up in contra revenue, along with the VAT settlement. Marketing services and other revenue grew 5%, decelerating 6 points versus Q2, driven by tougher comps from the PayPal operating agreement.
Moving to Slide 9. StubHub had another strong quarter, delivering 23% GMV growth and 32% revenue growth, driven in strength in -- driven by strength in concerts, theater and Major League Baseball. In the quarter, we closed both the Ticketbis and Ticket Utils acquisitions, adding to our international presence and improving seller tools.
Moving to Slide 10. In Q3, Classifieds revenue grew 14% year-over-year, a 1 point deceleration from last quarter. The automotive and real estate verticals in our key markets remain strong, while ad revenue growth modestly decelerated. Our key engagement metrics like visits, replies and listings remain healthy, and we will continue to innovate across our mobile apps, which are increasingly more important as traffic continues to shift to mobile.
Turning to Slide 11 and [ph] major cost drivers. In Q3, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 29.9%, which is down 200 basis points versus last year. The impact of a strong U.S. dollar pressured margins 200 basis points. The foreign exchange impact was felt across all spend categories, so I will focus my comments on the operational dynamics of our expenses.
Roughly half the increase in cost of revenue was driven by the mix of our faster growth platforms like StubHub, which have an inherently lower gross margin. Q3 sales and marketing expense increased slightly as we shifted spend away from seller incentives that show up in contra revenue and redeployed to top-of-the-funnel channels like brand.
Product development is an area where we have been investing more heavily, and half of the year-over-year increase is from our work on the Marketplace product experience. G&A expense was down roughly 80 basis points year-over-year from strong operating leverage.
Moving to Slide 12. In Q3, we delivered $0.45 in non-GAAP EPS, up $0.02 versus prior year, driven by revenue growth in the net benefit of share repurchases partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. In Q3, GAAP EPS was $0.36, down $0.09 versus last year. The drop in GAAP EPS is driven by last year's investment gains in Snapdeal and Baixing. As always, you can find the detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
On Slide 13, in Q3, we generated free cash flow of $617 million, up 34%, largely due to lapping separation-related costs incurred last year. We remain on track to deliver our full year guidance of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. CapEx was 8% of revenue in Q3, and our full year guidance remains 7% to 9%.
Moving to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $10.4 billion, of which $2.7 billion is in the U.S. In Q3, we repurchased 16.5 million shares at an average price of $30.29 per share, amounting to $500 million in repurchases. We have completed share repurchases of $2 billion this year or roughly 115% of our year-to-date free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining, and we are on track with our full year plans for share repurchases, which will represent $500 million for Q4.
Let me remind you about our strategy and overall philosophy on investments. We regularly review and actively manage our investment portfolio to ensure that our investments support the company's strategic direction and complement our disciplined approach to value creation, profitability and capital allocation.
With this in mind, we recently sold most of our stake in MercadoLibre. We remain committed to our customers in Latin America, and we have signed a strategic agreement with MercadoLibre that is designed to advance cross-border opportunities for our sellers who are targeting buyers in Latin America. The sale has enabled us to realize roughly $1.2 billion of gross proceeds. We are currently working through the exact U.S. and international tax implications, including the timing of cash payments, which could have an impact on our free cash flow. We intend to use the net proceeds in a manner consistent with our capital allocation policy.
New moving to guidance on Slide 15. For Q4, we are projecting revenue between $2.36 billion and $2.41 billion, growing 4% to 6% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 to $0.54 per share, representing 4% to 8% as reported year-over-year growth. The EPS growth is driven by revenue growth and the net benefit of our share repurchase program partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar.
Based on Q3 performance, we are raising revenue guidance for the full year. Revenue is now projected to be $8.95 billion to $9 billion, growing 6% to 7% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP margin guidance range of 31% to 33% is unchanged. However, we continue to expect to be at the low end of this range. We are raising our full year non-GAAP tax rate slightly to 19.5% to 20.5%. And now we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the middle of our previously disclosed guidance range of $1.85 to $1.90 per share. Due to the sale of our stake in MercadoLibre, we are raising our full year GAAP EPS guidance to $2.22 to $2.32 per share.
As we enter Q4, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on 2016. We started the year expecting to grow revenue in the 2% to 5% range. Year-to-date, we have executed on and aligned our investments behind our strategic initiatives while increasing our revenue growth outlook to 6% to 7%. The Marketplace platform began seeing green shoots from our re-platforming, and while the efforts are positive, they have not yet materially impacted the trajectory of the overall business.
StubHub enjoyed strong performance over the past 3 quarters and has now started lapping the product changes from last September, which will carry into next year. Classifieds continued its double-digit growth while investing in mobile innovation, and we started lapping the PayPal operating agreement revenue in July, which puts pressure on our marketing services revenue growth.
While accelerating our revenue growth this year, we increased investment in product development and brand to invest in future growth. That, combined with our recent acquisitions and integrations, has been paid for with operating leverage and [ph] G&A and redeployment within marketing. And while we are relatively well protected on net income due to our hedging program, the stronger U.S. dollar has driven roughly 150 basis points of ongoing margin compression year-over-year.
Throughout 2016, we continue executing on our disciplined capital allocation strategy, and we have been acquisitive in the areas of geographic expansion and tech and talent while returning $2 billion worth of capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.
Since the separation with PayPal last July, we have repurchased $3.2 billion worth of our shares or roughly 11% of gross shares outstanding. Our strong ongoing cash flow, along with the cash from the sale of our stake in MercadoLibre, allows us to continue our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including return of capital to shareholders through share repurchase.
In closing, we are focusing on the holiday season in Q4 and continuing to lay the foundation for 2017 and beyond.

Yes, as we've said, I think, consistently for the last year, this is a large effort to re-platform our business. We have an amazing flywheel, but the re-platforming is necessary to simplify eBay and to make it more relevant for our consumers and our sellers globally. We feel very confident we're on the right track. Where we've been able to add structured data, where we've been able to build new experiences on it now 100 million pages, we're very happy with those results. In fact, they are in line with exactly what we had hoped when we engaged in this initiative. We've also said that it's not a white switch that you turn on or off because we have such a strong core business. And so much of our traffic is organic through the core search funnel, it's a careful exercise, and it isn't a switch that you just [indiscernible] We've got to introduce these new experiences carefully because we have a higher converting high traffic tunnel, which is the organic eBay funnel and the organic search channel. So we think we're on track. And vis-à-vis GMV, one of the things I'd just note is that our business -- it's always been very difficult or impossible to look at GMV without revenue. We spend and subsidize at times. We do deals in promotions. We'll do that through the holiday. As we said here, the U.S. deceleration here was driven by a very conscious effort to begin to move our marketing spend into top of the funnel. As we start to introduce these new experiences, and we think the customers' like it and that's evidenced in higher conversion, we think it makes more sense to spend up the funnel. That does lengthen the time line. That does mean you may move it from say, a subsidized deal, which would've been GMV in the quarter to a brand campaign, which doesn't tend to work that quickly but that's okay. We said we're doing this for the long term. We're building a moat around eBay's business, and we're going to do this in a considered way so that the business is more competitive and relevant than it's ever been. And I'm really pleased with that. I think that's right where we want to be. I'll turn it over to Scott and maybe he can comment on the second part of your question, which is a buyer question."

The first is that top-of-the-funnel brand marketing creates a halo around everything we do. So whether or not you end up on that experience through the core eBay funnel or whether or not you end up on it through say, through Google's natural search results, we think that it takes longer but ultimately, changing consideration of the eBay brand will yield benefits across all of our channels. So that's a reason to start because now with 100 million pages out there, even if we did nothing to increase the exposure of that to the core channel, it would still yield benefits because there are a lot of people that end up on our site through say, external search result. But we are also beginning to open up more of the aperture this holiday, in particular through our category pages, through our landing pages, where a number of our holiday campaigns will drive people. We are certainly going to carefully but increase the exposure of the new pages to more and more of our traffic over time. That's the goal. So I think that the brand benefit for us is really clear. We wish it yielded a 90-day payback but brand doesn't tend to work that way. Just to reiterate, what I love about our sharper brand positioning is there's been a lot of commentary about the functional gaps we need to close, i.e., we sell a lot of new goods, we sell a lot of in-season goods, 60% of all of our inventory arrives within 3 business days. All of that is true, but that isn't enough. And I think what is really unique about eBay, and remember eBay is trying to be more unique, not more same, is that everybody finds their version of perfect. And whether that means we have extraordinary millions of items of inventory that you can only find on eBay or whether it's -- we have the greatest deals and pricing power in some of our core more inventory items, that's what's uniquely eBay. It is in a more emotional shopping experience, it's a more resonant shopping experience, it's a unique inventory and great amazing deals experience, and too many consumers don't know that. So it's worth moving the marketing money even if it has a short-term impact in not subsidizing deals. And that's the balance that we're drawing. The balance we're drawing is delivering consistent and good financial results and beginning to pivot our marketing spend to build more of a moat around the very strong eBay brand. That's exactly what goes through our head when we consider how much to spend and where to spend in marketing and at what pace do we introduce these new structured data pages."

And with 48% of experiences built on it, it's not -- we're not bound in specific verticals. We're across the board. Remember, we're still out in largely external exogenous search, not in the core search funnel. But there are 2 metrics that matter to make this super simple: traffic and conversion. When I look at the page versus the page it replaced, I can see that it's simpler, it's better organized, it shows off what's unique about eBay. But put aside what I can see, I look at data. And the data for us, as we said in my remarks, shows a significant increase in conversion. So we took this page down, we put this page up, the conversion is significant. It's not you need a microscope to see it. It's meaningful. Now I do suspect that as we get closer to better converting channels like core search, we won't maintain those conversion gains because we're basically competing against a better converting channel. But these are good experiences in the data shows that our customers like them and our customers are converting on these pages. So it's across category. It's actually fairly uniform. I wish I could say it's really working in this but not that. It's actually so far pretty uniform. It may prove not to be as we get more aggressive about introducing these experiences. But so far, it's fairly uniform and the pickup in the data is fairly significant. StubHub. So I think we feel great about StubHub's business. I think that they've made significant improvements to their brand, to their product, to things like ticket recommendations, to the revised StubHub brand campaign, to their select entry into the primary market, to some of the deals that they've done with leading franchises and teams. StubHub, we made some significant product changes last September and the growth rate took off like a rocket ship, and we're facing that wall right now. That's the reality of the math. It doesn't change at all how we feel about their competitive position. And remember we also now have, through the acquisition of Ticketbis, have entered the international market. And we think that internationally, we're in the first inning of the secondary ticket market. So competitively, we think we're doing great. We think that this is the leading secondary market and increasingly primary market to get franchised. We think their competitive positions have never been stronger than it is right now. And the market opportunity, we're going to face the math for another several quarters of the huge acceleration we had a year ago, but that doesn't change our view that this is a great long-term business that benefits from being part of eBay and we're going to grow it."

And as we've talked about in the past, we kind of think about those as a bucket whether they show up in a marketing spend, whether they show up in revenue as negative revenue or positive revenue or in marketing expense. And what we're really looking for is where we can drive growth, COV, buyer acquisition, those types of metrics. This quarter, we happen to shift away from the degree of buyer couponing in seller incentives and inventory incentives that we did last quarter and certainly versus year-over-year, which had a positive impact on the overall revenue rate.

Because we're replacing high-converting pages, it will be a march, it'll be a slower and steady march, and we'll continue to deliver good results while we're doing that. We'll continue to be disciplined about capital allocation while we're doing that. We'll continue to generate leverage for our shareholders while we're doing that. So I think it's been a consistent story since we started this. Scott, you can talk about the margin."

At this point, we're at 47% share of the feedback continues to improve on 5.0 [ph] and the growth is accelerating as well. And then C2C, we've done a series of things that Devin laid out many of them in his prepared remarks. And while we're still shrinking, it's shrinking less so. And so those are just a couple of extra points around our strategy and initiatives that we're laying to drive future growth. As it relates to the margin, what I'd point to is what I talked about for cost of revenue is kind of the gross margin dynamics that StubHub having a bit heavier, not only a higher take rate but heavier cost dynamic. But the underlying -- we don't really have segment margins, if you will, for the different platforms, so can't really comment on that."

It will certainly continue this quarter even through the holiday. If you think about it, the least disruptive is exogenous through search channels, then category and browse pages, which we're sort of introducing right now, and you'll see us drive a number of holiday campaigns directly to those experiences for the first time. And then the final one, which is the biggest channel but the one that we have to be the most careful about is the organic search channel. So we're not going to do that through this holiday. We will do more category in landing pages. We'll do more holiday campaigns that take you to those experiences but we're not going to mess around with our core search funnel as we get ready for holiday. You can expect us to start to do that next year. On social, Colin, we are very aggressive about that. And by the way, top of the funnel, when we talk about brand marketing, I think it sometimes gets conflated with TV. TV is not the largest part of it. It's brand across all channels including social. So this quarter, we added an 18th social channel. We're working aggressively with multiple social channels, including what I mentioned in my remarks, launching a bot on Facebook Messenger but we're advertising. And you'll see eBay brand messages in addition to bottom-of-the-funnel call to action messages increasingly across major social and messaging platforms."

We'll have 3 months of lapping versus just 1 month of lapping in Q4, which will decelerate -- have an impact to decelerating our overall total revenue. And we have about 1 point of some nonrepeating VAT settlements in Q3 that I called out in my prepared remarks. So those 2 will have an impact on the overall revenue growth that we called out. I would characterize the underlying revenue growth at 4% to 6% as relatively stable quarter-to-quarter. And then we expect the initiatives to continue on the positive trajectory that we've called out but not yet having this massive inflection point or date that everyone's looking for.

So we have a way -- we are going to do, as we increase the amount of up-the-funnel brand marketing, we are going to do our best at measuring value. It certainly needs a longer time frame.

Vis-à-vis the VR rollout of StubHub, I think I have said that it's now 55 venues, which -- and we'll just keep marching down that path because customers are actually using it. I think we've got one of the best use cases for VR actually driving commerce, and it makes sense. It's an immersive experience, it's a high ASP sale and we're learning from that about how the might bring VR into more core eBay activities where immersion matters, where high ASP drives careful consideration of the visual image before purchase.

We delivered good top and bottom line financial results in Q3 led by consistent performance in our core eBay platform and strong growth from StubHub and Classifieds. We made progress on our strategy, began activating our new brand marketing messages, and we readied our organization to execute in the upcoming holiday quarter.
Overall, total GMV was up 5% for the quarter, while revenue was up 8%. GMV decelerated modestly while revenue accelerated 1 point. GMV deceleration was driven primarily by StubHub lapping last year's product changes and in part, by the shift of marketing spend to longer-cycle brand investments on our Marketplace platform. The revenue acceleration was driven primarily by lower contra revenue spend and a VAT settlement.
Active buyer growth was 3%, and we added over 1 million additional buyers to our platforms in Q3. GMV on our Marketplace platform grew at 4%, while StubHub grew volume at 23%. And our Classified platform grew revenue at 14%. Finally, we repurchased $0.5 billion of our stock, and we closed several key acquisitions that we announced over the last several months.
On our Marketplace platform, we continue to make steady progress against our strategy to drive the best choice, the most relevance and the most powerful selling platform. In Q3, we signed several new strategic brand partners, including Mattel, Fender, Volcom and Magic Chef, enhancing our efforts to drive more choice for our consumers. Using our data, we're also increasingly reaching out to our sellers to prompt them to source and list in-demand goods where we see gaps in supply.
And finally, in the past several months, we've launched several new curated vertical experiences in fashion and home and garden. Most recently, we announced eBay Collective in the U.S., a shopping destination, which provides consumers with curated inventory for antique, modern and contemporary furniture and fine art. This is similar to the approach we took earlier in the year with the launch of our curated Wine category on eBay, and it's an approach we'll seek to replicate going forward where we see the opportunity to do so.
I'm particularly excited about the improvements we're making to drive the most relevant shopping experience for our consumers. We continue to process more data from our structured data initiative, which enables us to have better insight into the inventory on our site and to build better user experiences.
In Q3, we increased the percentage of structured data listings processed to 48% of relevant live listings. The ongoing growth and penetration of structured data is enabling us to accelerate the pace of new browse and product page launches, and we ended Q3 with over 100 million pages built on structured data that showcase our inventory in ways that were not possible just a year ago. We're further enhancing these pages by introducing new features such as multiple top picks, product comparisons and limited-time deals, and we continue to see significantly higher conversion. While these early results give us continued confidence in our strategy, our new pages are currently being exposed to a very small fraction of our traffic. The majority of our business today comes through our organic on eBay search funnel. Over time, we expect to start introducing these new experiences to our organic traffic. Now while we're moving at an urgent pace, you can expect us to take an intelligent approach to this transition to ensure that we don't disrupt our customers along the way.
Another area I'm excited about is mobile. Since the launch of our redesigned eBay mobile apps in May, customer reviews have trended higher as we've seen -- as we have significantly improved the speed and the usability of our apps. And our ability to rapidly iterate on user feedback has enabled us to keep this positive momentum going. We recently released the fifth update to our new mobile experience in the past 5 months, and this cadence of improvements is translating into better growth with Q3 being the second quarter in a row of mobile growth acceleration.
We're also beginning to leverage artificial intelligence to power unique commerce experiences for our users. Yesterday, we announced the beta launch of eBay ShopBot on Facebook Messenger, a personalized shopping assistant that enables people to find the best deals from eBay's 1 billion listings. Our vision is to make shopping with eBay as easy as talking to a friend, whether you're looking for something specific or you're browsing for inspiration.
eBay continues to be one of the leading consumer brands in the world, having recently been ranked #32 by Interbrand in their 2016 Best Global Brands report. This is the same position that eBay achieved in 2015, and we view this as positive because the recent ranking reflects the first full year post the PayPal spin.
With that said, we've also been doing considerable work to sharpen our brand. During Q3, we began to activate our new brand messages by running several marketing pilots externally. We continue to shift more of our marketing resources towards top-of-the-funnel consideration and will further ramp our external efforts during the upcoming holiday season and into 2017. This includes plans to advertise on TV in the U.S. and Europe during this holiday season, which we have not done since 2014.
Finally, we continue to execute on our plans to deliver the most powerful selling platform. In August, we launched Seller Hub to all U.S. sellers and have recently begun the process of rolling that out to international markets. Thus far, over 0.5 million sellers have used Seller Hub, and we're seeing early improvements in key listing metrics and strong adoption of marketing features such as our promotions tool. And we're steadily expanding our promoted listings product, enabling more and more sellers to bid their inventory for placement in search results. We also today announced the launch of an entirely new set of APIs, making it simpler for our developers and sellers to rapidly integrate with eBay and onboard all their inventory using retail and industry standard practice.
On the consumer selling side, we continue to simplify selling on eBay. We recently began rolling out our simplified listing flow to a portion of first-time consumer sellers. While still early, we're seeing better completion rates and improved listing quality. We're also seeing strong demand for our assisted selling service, eBay Valet. We now have drop-off sites live in 1,700 FedEx locations, and we've made several improvements to enable a better user experience, including upfront value estimation and item eligibility. And in September, we launched Quick Sale, which enables consumers to trade in their mobile phone with transparent pricing, taking advantage of mobile phone industry upgrade cycles.
StubHub continues to innovate and execute against the large and increasingly global market opportunity. The team continues to drive innovative user experiences, expanding our virtual reality technology to 55 total venues, which represent over 1/3 of ticket sales on our native app platform. We also recently launched our blended primary and secondary ticket experience for the Philadelphia 76ers and launched the ability for users to receive support through a Skype chatbot.
Growth began to slow in the quarter as we started to lap the product changes we made last September, and our comps will get more difficult from here. However, we believe our strategy of expanding internationally and selectively tapping into the primary market will serve us well over the long term.
Our Classified platform continues its good growth, driven by strong vibrancy metrics across our major markets, increased engagement with our native mobile apps and continued strength in the motors and the real estate verticals across our key markets. And we're working to leverage all 3 of our platforms to drive great consumer experiences. The eBay and Gumtree inventory integration effort that we launched in Australia in Q2 show good results, and we'll now roll out the integration of core inventory into our Classified sites in several other markets. We also began testing ticketing inventory integration between Kijiji Canada and StubHub. We envision tying our strong eBay assets closer together over time to enable a more unified experience for all of our consumers.
In summary, we're making meaningful progress on our strategy while delivering good financial results. Re-platforming a business of our size and scale takes time. However, our pace of innovation has accelerated. We're increasingly using structured data and artificial intelligence to transform shopping on eBay, delivering more personalization capabilities, continuing to iterate our mobile experience and bringing more unique inventory and categories to our customers. We've got more work to do, but I'm confident we're on the right path.
Now let me turn it over to Scott, and he'll provide more details on our Q3 results."

In Q3 business performance was stable, and we delivered good financial results while executing on our strategic priorities. StubHub and Classifieds continued growing double digits, and the Marketplace improvements we saw last quarter are still evident in mobile C2C and SEO. As we reflect on the last 9 months, we remain confident in our strategy and we continue to make progress.
During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 4. In Q3, we generated $2.2 billion of total revenue, $0.45 of non-GAAP EPS, $617 million in free cash flow, and we repurchased $500 million of our stock. In addition, we are raising the full year guidance on revenue and expect to be in the middle of the previously communicated non-GAAP EPS range.
Let's start with Q3 active buyers on Slide 5. In the quarter, trailing 12-month growth was down 1 point to 3% year-over-year. The quarter-over-quarter deceleration was driven by lapping last year's increased marketing spend in India.
On Slide 6, we enabled $20.1 billion of GMV in Q3, up 5% versus last year, decelerating 1 point versus prior quarter, driven by StubHub and the U.S. Marketplace platform. By geography, the U.S. generated $8.4 billion of GMV, up 3%, while the international delivered $11.7 billion of GMV, up 7% year-over-year.
Moving to revenue. We generated net revenues of $2.2 billion, up 8% versus last year, accelerating 1 point versus Q2. We delivered $1.7 billion of transaction revenue, up 8% and $470 million of marketing services and other revenue, up 10%.
Transitioning to our Marketplaces platform on Slide 8. Q3 grew [ph] 4% year-over-year, rounding down 1 point versus Q2. U.S. GMV decelerated as we shifted marketing spend to more brand awareness, which tends to have a longer payback as we start to influence consideration. International GMV improved slightly quarter-over-quarter, rounding up 1 point.
Total Marketplace revenue was $1.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, a 2 point acceleration versus prior quarter. Transaction revenue grew 5%, up 3 points quarter-over-quarter. This acceleration is attributed to reduced marketing incentives that show up in contra revenue, along with the VAT settlement. Marketing services and other revenue grew 5%, decelerating 6 points versus Q2, driven by tougher comps from the PayPal operating agreement.
Moving to Slide 9. StubHub had another strong quarter, delivering 23% GMV growth and 32% revenue growth, driven in strength in -- driven by strength in concerts, theater and Major League Baseball. In the quarter, we closed both the Ticketbis and Ticket Utils acquisitions, adding to our international presence and improving seller tools.
Moving to Slide 10. In Q3, Classifieds revenue grew 14% year-over-year, a 1 point deceleration from last quarter. The automotive and real estate verticals in our key markets remain strong, while ad revenue growth modestly decelerated. Our key engagement metrics like visits, replies and listings remain healthy, and we will continue to innovate across our mobile apps, which are increasingly more important as traffic continues to shift to mobile.
Turning to Slide 11 and major cost drivers. In Q3, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 29.9%, which is down 200 basis points versus last year. The impact of a strong U.S. dollar pressured margins 200 basis points. The foreign exchange impact was felt across all spend categories, so I will focus my comments on the operational dynamics of our expenses.
Roughly half the increase in cost of revenue was driven by the mix of our faster growth platforms like StubHub, which have an inherently lower gross margin. Q3 sales and marketing expense increased slightly as we shifted spend away from seller incentives that show up in contra revenue and redeployed to top-of-the-funnel channels like brand.
Product development is an area where we have been investing more heavily, and half of the year-over-year increase is from our work on the Marketplace product experience. G&A expense was down roughly 80 basis points year-over-year from strong operating leverage.
Moving to Slide 12. In Q3, we delivered $0.45 in non-GAAP EPS, up $0.02 versus prior year, driven by revenue growth in the net benefit of share repurchases partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. In Q3, GAAP EPS was $0.36, down $0.09 versus last year. The drop in GAAP EPS is driven by last year's investment gains in Snapdeal and Baixing. As always, you can find the detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
On Slide 13, in Q3, we generated free cash flow of $617 million, up 34%, largely due to lapping separation-related costs incurred last year. We remain on track to deliver our full year guidance of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. CapEx was 8% of revenue in Q3, and our full year guidance remains 7% to 9%.
Moving to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $10.4 billion, of which $2.7 billion is in the U.S. In Q3, we repurchased 16.5 million shares at an average price of $30.29 per share, amounting to $500 million in repurchases. We have completed share repurchases of $2 billion this year or roughly 115% of our year-to-date free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining, and we are on track with our full year plans for share repurchases, which will represent $500 million for Q4.
Let me remind you about our strategy and overall philosophy on investments. We regularly review and actively manage our investment portfolio to ensure that our investments support the company's strategic direction and complement our disciplined approach to value creation, profitability and capital allocation.
With this in mind, we recently sold most of our stake in MercadoLibre. We remain committed to our customers in Latin America, and we have signed a strategic agreement with MercadoLibre that is designed to advance cross-border opportunities for our sellers who are targeting buyers in Latin America. The sale has enabled us to realize roughly $1.2 billion of gross proceeds. We are currently working through the exact U.S. and international tax implications, including the timing of cash payments, which could have an impact on our free cash flow. We intend to use the net proceeds in a manner consistent with our capital allocation policy.
New moving to guidance on Slide 15. For Q4, we are projecting revenue between $2.36 billion and $2.41 billion, growing 4% to 6% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 to $0.54 per share, representing 4% to 8% as reported year-over-year growth. The EPS growth is driven by revenue growth and the net benefit of our share repurchase program partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar.
Based on Q3 performance, we are raising revenue guidance for the full year. Revenue is now projected to be $8.95 billion to $9 billion, growing 6% to 7% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP margin guidance range of 31% to 33% is unchanged. However, we continue to expect to be at the low end of this range. We are raising our full year non-GAAP tax rate slightly to 19.5% to 20.5%. And now we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the middle of our previously disclosed guidance range of $1.85 to $1.90 per share. Due to the sale of our stake in MercadoLibre, we are raising our full year GAAP EPS guidance to $2.22 to $2.32 per share.
As we enter Q4, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on 2016. We started the year expecting to grow revenue in the 2% to 5% range. Year-to-date, we have executed on and aligned our investments behind our strategic initiatives while increasing our revenue growth outlook to 6% to 7%. The Marketplace platform began seeing green shoots from our re-platforming, and while the efforts are positive, they have not yet materially impacted the trajectory of the overall business.
StubHub enjoyed strong performance over the past 3 quarters and has now started lapping the product changes from last September, which will carry into next year. Classifieds continued its double-digit growth while investing in mobile innovation, and we started lapping the PayPal operating agreement revenue in July, which puts pressure on our marketing services revenue growth.
While accelerating our revenue growth this year, we increased investment in product development and brand to invest in future growth. That, combined with our recent acquisitions and integrations, has been paid for with operating leverage in G&A and redeployment within marketing. And while we are relatively well protected on net income due to our hedging program, the stronger U.S. dollar has driven roughly 150 basis points of ongoing margin compression year-over-year.
Throughout 2016, we continue executing on our disciplined capital allocation strategy, and we have been acquisitive in the areas of geographic expansion and tech and talent while returning $2 billion worth of capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.
Since the separation with PayPal last July, we have repurchased $3.2 billion worth of our shares or roughly 11% of gross shares outstanding. Our strong ongoing cash flow, along with the cash from the sale of our stake in MercadoLibre, allows us to continue our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including return of capital to shareholders through share repurchase.
In closing, we are focusing on the holiday season in Q4 and continuing to lay the foundation for 2017 and beyond.

And you guys have said that the aspirational goal at the end of the day is to get back to kind of double-digit e-commerce-like growth rates. So as we look over the next year and you start cutting more traffic over to these higher converting pages, when do you think we'll start to see the GMV growth start to pick up? Any color there would be helpful.

Yes, as we've said, I think, consistently for the last year, this is a large effort to re-platform our business. We have an amazing flywheel, but the re-platforming is necessary to simplify eBay and to make it more relevant for our consumers and our sellers globally. We feel very confident we're on the right track. Where we've been able to add structured data, where we've been able to build new experiences on it, now 100 million pages, we're very happy with those results. In fact, they are in line with exactly what we had hoped when we engaged in this initiative. We've also said that it's not a light switch that you turn on or off because we have such a strong core business, and so much of our traffic is organic through the core search funnel. It's a careful exercise, and it isn't a switch that you just throw on. We've got to introduce these new experiences carefully because we have a high converting, high-traffic tunnel, which is the organic eBay funnel and the organic search channel. So we think we're on track. And vis-à-vis GMV, one of the things I'd just note is that our business -- it's always been very difficult or impossible to look at GMV without revenue. We spend and subsidize at times. We do deals and promotions. We'll do that through the holiday. As we said here, the U.S. deceleration here was driven by a very conscious effort to begin to move our marketing spend into top of the funnel. As we start to introduce these new experiences and we think our customers like it and that's evidenced in higher conversion, we think it makes more sense to spend up the funnel. That does lengthen the time line. That does mean you may move it from, say, a subsidized deal, which would have been GMV in the quarter, to a brand campaign, which doesn't tend to work that quickly. But that's okay. We said we're doing this for the long term. We're building a moat around eBay's business, and we're going to do this in a considered way so that the business is more competitive and relevant than it's ever been. And I'm really pleased with that. I think that's right where we want to be. I'll turn it over to Scott, and maybe he can comment on the second part of your question, which is a buyer question."

It's not yet really seeing the acceleration from our structured data and SEO effort and what we're doing around the re-platforming, but it's stable.

The first is that top-of-the-funnel brand marketing creates a halo around everything we do. So whether or not you end up on that experience through the core eBay funnel or whether or not you end up on it through, say, through Google's natural search results, we think that it takes longer, but ultimately, changing consideration of the eBay brand will yield benefits across all of our channels. So that's a reason to start because now with 100 million pages out there, even if we did nothing to increase the exposure of that to the core channel, it would still yield benefits because there are a lot of people that end up on our site through, say, external search results. But we are also beginning to open up more of the aperture this holiday, in particular, through our category pages, through our landing pages, where a number of our holiday campaigns will drive people. We are certainly going to carefully but increase the exposure of the new pages to more and more of our traffic over time. That's the goal. So I think that the brand benefit for us is really clear. It -- we wish it yielded a 90-day payback, but brand doesn't tend to work that way. Just to reiterate, what I love about our sharper brand positioning is there's been a lot of commentary about the functional gaps we need to close, i.e. we sell a lot of new goods, we sell a lot of in-season goods, 60% of all of our inventory arrives within 3 business days. All of that is true, but that isn't enough. And I think what is really unique about eBay, and remember, eBay is trying to be more unique, not more same, is that everybody finds their version of perfect. And whether that means we have extraordinary millions of items of inventory that you can only find on eBay or whether it's -- we have the greatest deals and pricing power in some of our core more head inventory items, that's what's uniquely eBay. It is in a more emotional shopping experience. It's a more resonant shopping experience. It's a unique inventory and great amazing deals experience. And too many consumers don't know that. So it's worth moving the marketing money even if it has a short-term impact in not subsidizing deals, and that's the balance that we're drawing. The balance we're drawing is delivering consistent and good financial results and beginning to pivot our marketing spend to build more of a moat around the very strong eBay brand. That's exactly what goes through our head when we consider how much to spend and where to spend in marketing and at what pace do we introduce these new structured data pages."

And with 48% of experiences built on it, it's not -- we're not bound in specific verticals. We're across the board. Remember, we're still out in largely external exogenous search, not in the core search funnel. But there are 2 metrics that matter to make this super simple: traffic and conversion. When I look at the page versus the page it replaced, I can see that it's simpler. It's better organized. It shows off what's unique about eBay. But put aside what I can see, I look at data. And the data, for us, as we said in my remarks, shows a significant increase in conversion. So we took this page down. We put this page up. The conversion is significant. It's not you need a microscope to see it. It's meaningful. Now I do suspect that as we get closer to better converting channels like core search, we won't maintain those conversion gains because we're basically competing against a better converting channel. But these are good experiences. And the data shows that our customers like them, and our customers are converting on these pages. So it's across category. It's actually fairly uniform. I wish I could say it's really working in this but not that. It's actually so far pretty uniform. It may prove not to be as we get more aggressive about introducing these experiences, but so far, it's fairly uniform. And the pickup in the data is fairly significant. StubHub. So I think we feel great about StubHub's business. I think that they've made significant improvements to their brand, to their product, to things like ticket recommendations, to the revised StubHub brand campaign, to their select entry into the primary market, to some of the deals that they've done with leading franchises and teams. StubHub, we made some significant product changes last September, and the growth rate took off like a rocket ship. And we're facing that wall right now. That's the reality of the math. It doesn't change at all how we feel about their competitive position. And remember, we also now have, through the acquisition of Ticketbis, have entered the international market, and we think that internationally, we're in the first inning of the secondary ticket market. So competitively, we think we're doing great. We think that this is the leading secondary market and increasingly, primary market ticket franchise. We think their competitive position's never been stronger than it is right now.

And quarter-to-quarter, I think we are up 10 basis points on transaction take rates for the Marketplaces business so not a radical departure from the past or even year-on-year. I think it's relatively flat. When I look at the dynamics on contra, we've changed a -- we've been pushing the frontier of what we spend on whether it's buyer coupons, seller incentives, inventory incentives quarter-to-quarter. And as we've talked about in the past, we kind of think about those as a bucket, whether they show up in a marketing spend, whether they show up in revenue as negative revenue or positive revenue or in marketing expense. And what we're really looking for is where we can drive growth, CLV, buyer acquisition, those types of metrics. This quarter, we happen to shift away from the degree of buyer couponing and seller incentives and inventory incentives that we did last quarter and certainly versus year-over-year, which had a positive impact on the overall revenue rate and then, as Devin commented, the combination of that plus redeployment of lower marketing channel spend to upper really starting the transition for us as we start the process of activating our brand."

I'll take the first one, and Scott can comment on the second. Keep in mind, structured data is an input, not an output. The way we've categorized our strategy is relevance, choice and the best shopping experience. Structured data is an enabler of that. So no, I don't think -- I think it's a soundbite to say we're hinging everything on structured data. Our strategy is to have a brand that's differentiated, to have inventory that's differentiated and to have a simpler, more compelling shopping experience. I mean, that's a really simple way to describe it. And all of those things are happening in earnest right now. So I think structured data is like a foundation of some of that. It's the scaffolding that we need to build on top of, but it's not the sort of one thing that -- one bullet that we've shot, and if that one bullet doesn't hit its mark, then our business is not going to be where we want it to be. I think we have a multi-pronged strategy. Structured data is an important foundational element, but it's an input, not an output. Vis-à-vis timing, we'll say what we've always said, which is this will take time. The results are not a light switch. It's not going to be 1 quarter. We said that last quarter. It's not going to be 1 quarter where all of a sudden we just pop out the top. Because we're replacing high converting pages, it'll be a march. It'll be a slower and steady march, and we'll continue to deliver good results while we're doing that. We'll continue to be disciplined about capital allocation while we're doing that.

As it relates to the margin, what I'd point to is what I talked about for cost of revenue, is kind of the gross margin dynamics of StubHub having a bit heavier -- not only a higher take rate but heavier cost dynamic.

We will do more category in landing pages. We'll do more holiday campaigns to take you to those experiences, but we're not going to mess around with our core search funnel as we get ready for holiday. You can expect us to start to do that next year. On social, Colin, we are very aggressive about that. And by the way, top of the funnel, when we talk about brand marketing, I think it sometimes gets conflated with TV. TV is not the largest part of it. It's brand across all channels, including social. So this quarter, we added an 18th social channel. We're working aggressively with multiple social channels, including what I mentioned in my remarks, launching a bot on Facebook Messenger, but we're advertising.

We'll have 3 months of lapping versus just a month of lapping in Q4, which will decelerate -- have an impact to decelerating our overall total revenue. And we have about 1 point of some non-repeating VAT settlements in Q3 that I called out in my prepared remarks. So those 2 will have an impact on the overall revenue growth that we called out.

If you look at the collective experience that we launched this week, it's actually using Corrigon to do background image improvement. It's a great experience. If you haven't seen it, please go look at it. Just type collective into eBay search, and go take a look at that vertical experience. That is using the Corrigon technology to, in essence, take seller images and improve them and remove the backgrounds and make them look just about museum quality. So the answer is we're already using it, and we'll expand the use of that over time. Vis-à-vis the other acquisitions like SalesPredict and Expertmaker, we are already starting to use that in the more back-end part of the structured data initiative to create catalogs and taxonomies, which is happening with pace. So all of these things -- almost all -- I think -- I believe all 3 of them, we have been working with prior to buying them. And they are wired on now and they are -- they'll come online with even more spectrum over time. Vis-à-vis the VR rollout of StubHub, I think I have said that it's now 55 venues, which -- and we'll just keep marching down that path because customers are actually using it. I think we've got one of the best use cases for VR actually driving commerce, and it makes sense. It's an immersive experience. It's a high ASP sale. And we're learning from that about how we might bring VR into more core eBay activities, where immersion matters, where high ASP drives careful consideration of the visual image before purchase. So we like VR and augmented reality, and we think they're going to be meaningful in commerce, and we want to be a leader there."

We delivered good top and bottom line financial results in Q3 led by consistent performance in our core eBay platform and strong growth from StubHub and Classifieds.

We delivered good top and bottom line financial results in Q3 led by consistent performance in our core eBay platform and strong growth from StubHub and Classifieds. We made progress on our strategy, began activating our new brand marketing messages, and we readied our organization to execute in the upcoming holiday quarter.
Overall, total GMV was up 5% for the quarter, while revenue was up 8%. GMV decelerated modestly while revenue accelerated 1 point. GMV deceleration was driven primarily by StubHub lapping last year's product changes and, in part, by the shift of marketing spend to longer-cycle brand investments on our Marketplace platform. The revenue acceleration was driven primarily by lower contra revenue spend and a VAT settlement.
Active buyer growth was 3%, and we added over 1 million additional buyers to our platforms in Q3. GMV on our Marketplace platform grew at 4%, while StubHub grew volume at 23%. And our Classified platform grew revenue at 14%. Finally, we repurchased $0.5 billion of our stock, and we closed several key acquisitions that we announced over the last several months.
On our Marketplace platform, we continue to make steady progress against our strategy to drive the best choice, the most relevance and the most powerful selling platform. In Q3, we signed several new strategic brand partners, including Mattel, Fender, Volcom and Magic Chef, enhancing our efforts to drive more choice for our consumers. Using our data, we're also increasingly reaching out to our sellers to prompt them to source and list in-demand goods where we see gaps in supply.
And finally, in the past several months, we've launched several new curated vertical experiences in fashion and home and garden. Most recently, we announced eBay Collective in the U.S., a shopping destination, which provides consumers with curated inventory for antique, modern and contemporary furniture and fine art. This is similar to the approach we took earlier in the year with the launch of our curated Wine category on eBay, and it's an approach we'll seek to replicate going forward where we see the opportunity to do so.
I'm particularly excited about the improvements we're making to drive the most relevant shopping experience for our consumers. We continue to process more data from our structured data initiative, which enables us to have better insight into the inventory on our site and to build better user experiences.
In Q3, we increased the percentage of structured data listings processed to 48% of relevant live listings. The ongoing growth and penetration of structured data is enabling us to accelerate the pace of new browse and product page launches, and we ended Q3 with over 100 million pages built on structured data that showcase our inventory in ways that were not possible just a year ago. We're further enhancing these pages by introducing new features such as multiple top picks, product comparisons and limited-time deals, and we continue to see significantly higher conversion. While these early results give us continued confidence in our strategy, our new pages are currently being exposed to a very small fraction of our traffic. The majority of our business today comes through our organic on eBay search funnel. Over time, we expect to start introducing these new experiences to our organic traffic. Now while we're moving at an urgent pace, you can expect us to take an intelligent approach to this transition to ensure that we don't disrupt our customers along the way.
Another area I'm excited about is mobile. Since the launch of our redesigned eBay mobile apps in May, customer reviews have trended higher as we've seen -- as we have significantly improved the speed and the usability of our apps. And our ability to rapidly iterate on user feedback has enabled us to keep this positive momentum going. We recently released the fifth update to our new mobile experience in the past 5 months, and this cadence of improvements is translating into better growth with Q3 being the second quarter in a row of mobile growth acceleration.
We're also beginning to leverage artificial intelligence to power unique commerce experiences for our users. Yesterday, we announced the beta launch of eBay ShopBot on Facebook Messenger, a personalized shopping assistant that enables people to find the best deals from eBay's 1 billion listings. Our vision is to make shopping with eBay as easy as talking to a friend, whether you're looking for something specific or you're browsing for inspiration.
eBay continues to be one of the leading consumer brands in the world, having recently been ranked #32 by Interbrand in their 2016 Best Global Brands report. This is the same position that eBay achieved in 2015, and we view this as positive because the recent ranking reflects the first full year post the PayPal spin.
With that said, we've also been doing considerable work to sharpen our brand. During Q3, we began to activate our new brand messages by running several marketing pilots externally. We continue to shift more of our marketing resources towards top-of-the-funnel consideration and will further ramp our external efforts during the upcoming holiday season and into 2017. This includes plans to advertise on TV in the U.S. and Europe during this holiday season, which we have not done since 2014.
Finally, we continue to execute on our plans to deliver the most powerful selling platform. In August, we launched Seller Hub to all U.S. sellers and have recently begun the process of rolling that out to international markets. Thus far, over 0.5 million sellers have used Seller Hub, and we're seeing early improvements in key listing metrics and strong adoption of marketing features such as our promotions tool. And we're steadily expanding our promoted listings product, enabling more and more sellers to bid their inventory for placement in search results. We also today announced the launch of an entirely new set of APIs, making it simpler for our developers and sellers to rapidly integrate with eBay and onboard all their inventory using retail and industry standard practice.
On the consumer selling side, we continue to simplify selling on eBay. We recently began rolling out our simplified listing flow to a portion of first-time consumer sellers. While still early, we're seeing better completion rates and improved listing quality. We're also seeing strong demand for our assisted selling service, eBay Valet. We now have drop-off sites live in 1,700 FedEx locations, and we've made several improvements to enable a better user experience, including upfront value estimation and item eligibility. And in September, we launched Quick Sale, which enables consumers to trade in their mobile phone with transparent pricing, taking advantage of mobile phone industry upgrade cycles.
StubHub continues to innovate and execute against the large and increasingly global market opportunity. The team continues to drive innovative user experiences, expanding our virtual reality technology to 55 total venues, which represent over 1/3 of ticket sales on our native app platform. We also recently launched our blended primary and secondary ticket experience for the Philadelphia 76ers and launched the ability for users to receive support through a Skype chatbot.
Growth began to slow in the quarter as we started to lap the product changes we made last September, and our comps will get more difficult from here. However, we believe our strategy of expanding internationally and selectively tapping into the primary market will serve us well over the long term.
Our Classified platform continues its good growth, driven by strong vibrancy metrics across our major markets, increased engagement with our native mobile apps and continued strength in the motors and the real estate verticals across our key markets. And we're working to leverage all 3 of our platforms to drive great consumer experiences. The eBay and Gumtree inventory integration effort that we launched in Australia in Q2 show good results, and we'll now roll out the integration of core inventory into our Classified sites in several other markets. We also began testing ticketing inventory integration between Kijiji Canada and StubHub. We envision tying our strong eBay assets closer together over time to enable a more unified experience for all of our consumers.
In summary, we're making meaningful progress on our strategy while delivering good financial results. Re-platforming a business of our size and scale takes time. However, our pace of innovation has accelerated. We're increasingly using structured data and artificial intelligence to transform shopping on eBay, delivering more personalization capabilities, continuing to iterate our mobile experience and bringing more unique inventory and categories to our customers. We've got more work to do, but I'm confident we're on the right path.
Now let me turn it over to Scott, and he'll provide more details on our Q3 results."

In Q3 business performance was stable, and we delivered good financial results while executing on our strategic priorities. StubHub and Classifieds continued growing double digits, and the Marketplace improvements we saw last quarter are still evident in mobile C2C and SEO. As we reflect on the last 9 months, we remain confident in our strategy and we continue to make progress.
During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 4. In Q3, we generated $2.2 billion of total revenue, $0.45 of non-GAAP EPS, $617 million in free cash flow, and we repurchased $500 million of our stock. In addition, we are raising the full year guidance on revenue and expect to be in the middle of the previously communicated non-GAAP EPS range.
Let's start with Q3 active buyers on Slide 5. In the quarter, trailing 12-month growth was down 1 point to 3% year-over-year. The quarter-over-quarter deceleration was driven by lapping last year's increased marketing spend in India.
On Slide 6, we enabled $20.1 billion of GMV in Q3, up 5% versus last year, decelerating 1 point versus prior quarter, driven by StubHub and the U.S. Marketplace platform. By geography, the U.S. generated $8.4 billion of GMV, up 3%, while the international delivered $11.7 billion of GMV, up 7% year-over-year.
Moving to revenue. We generated net revenues of $2.2 billion, up 8% versus last year, accelerating 1 point versus Q2. We delivered $1.7 billion of transaction revenue, up 8% and $470 million of marketing services and other revenue, up 10%.
Transitioning to our Marketplaces platform on Slide 8. Q3 grew [ph] 4% year-over-year, rounding down 1 point versus Q2. U.S. GMV decelerated as we shifted marketing spend to more brand awareness, which tends to have a longer payback as we start to influence consideration. International GMV improved slightly quarter-over-quarter, rounding up 1 point.
Total Marketplace revenue was $1.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, a 2 point acceleration versus prior quarter. Transaction revenue grew 5%, up 3 points quarter-over-quarter. This acceleration is attributed to reduced marketing incentives that show up in contra revenue, along with the VAT settlement. Marketing services and other revenue grew 5%, decelerating 6 points versus Q2, driven by tougher comps from the PayPal operating agreement.
Moving to Slide 9. StubHub had another strong quarter, delivering 23% GMV growth and 32% revenue growth, driven in strength in -- driven by strength in concerts, theater and Major League Baseball. In the quarter, we closed both the Ticketbis and Ticket Utils acquisitions, adding to our international presence and improving seller tools.
Moving to Slide 10. In Q3, Classifieds revenue grew 14% year-over-year, a 1 point deceleration from last quarter. The automotive and real estate verticals in our key markets remain strong, while ad revenue growth modestly decelerated. Our key engagement metrics like visits, replies and listings remain healthy, and we will continue to innovate across our mobile apps, which are increasingly more important as traffic continues to shift to mobile.
Turning to Slide 11 and major cost drivers. In Q3, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 29.9%, which is down 200 basis points versus last year. The impact of a strong U.S. dollar pressured margins 200 basis points. The foreign exchange impact was felt across all spend categories, so I will focus my comments on the operational dynamics of our expenses.
Roughly half the increase in cost of revenue was driven by the mix of our faster growth platforms like StubHub, which have an inherently lower gross margin. Q3 sales and marketing expense increased slightly as we shifted spend away from seller incentives that show up in contra revenue and redeployed to top-of-the-funnel channels like brand.
Product development is an area where we have been investing more heavily, and half of the year-over-year increase is from our work on the Marketplace product experience. G&A expense was down roughly 80 basis points year-over-year from strong operating leverage.
Moving to Slide 12. In Q3, we delivered $0.45 in non-GAAP EPS, up $0.02 versus prior year, driven by revenue growth and the net benefit of share repurchases partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. In Q3, GAAP EPS was $0.36, down $0.09 versus last year. The drop in GAAP EPS is driven by last year's investment gains in Snapdeal and Baixing. As always, you can find the detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
On Slide 13, in Q3, we generated free cash flow of $617 million, up 34%, largely due to lapping separation-related costs incurred last year. We remain on track to deliver our full year guidance of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. CapEx was 8% of revenue in Q3, and our full year guidance remains 7% to 9%.
Moving to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $10.4 billion, of which $2.7 billion is in the U.S. In Q3, we repurchased 16.5 million shares at an average price of $30.29 per share, amounting to $500 million in repurchases. We have completed share repurchases of $2 billion this year or roughly 115% of our year-to-date free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining, and we are on track with our full year plans for share repurchases, which will represent $500 million for Q4.
Let me remind you about our strategy and overall philosophy on investments. We regularly review and actively manage our investment portfolio to ensure that our investments support the company's strategic direction and complement our disciplined approach to value creation, profitability and capital allocation.
With this in mind, we recently sold most of our stake in MercadoLibre. We remain committed to our customers in Latin America, and we have signed a strategic agreement with MercadoLibre that is designed to advance cross-border opportunities for our sellers who are targeting buyers in Latin America. The sale has enabled us to realize roughly $1.2 billion of gross proceeds. We are currently working through the exact U.S. and international tax implications, including the timing of cash payments, which could have an impact on our free cash flow. We intend to use the net proceeds in a manner consistent with our capital allocation policy.
Now moving to guidance on Slide 15. For Q4, we are projecting revenue between $2.36 billion and $2.41 billion, growing 4% to 6% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 to $0.54 per share, representing 4% to 8% as reported year-over-year growth. The EPS growth is driven by revenue growth and the net benefit of our share repurchase program partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar.
Based on Q3 performance, we are raising revenue guidance for the full year. Revenue is now projected to be $8.95 billion to $9 billion, growing 6% to 7% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP margin guidance range of 31% to 33% is unchanged. However, we continue to expect to be at the low end of this range. We are raising our full year non-GAAP tax rate slightly to 19.5% to 20.5%. And now we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the middle of our previously disclosed guidance range of $1.85 to $1.90 per share. Due to the sale of our stake in MercadoLibre, we are raising our full year GAAP EPS guidance to $2.22 to $2.32 per share.
As we enter Q4, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on 2016. We started the year expecting to grow revenue in the 2% to 5% range. Year-to-date, we have executed on and aligned our investments behind our strategic initiatives while increasing our revenue growth outlook to 6% to 7%. The Marketplace platform began seeing green shoots from our re-platforming, and while the efforts are positive, they have not yet materially impacted the trajectory of the overall business.
StubHub enjoyed strong performance over the past 3 quarters and has now started lapping the product changes from last September, which will carry into next year. Classifieds continued its double-digit growth while investing in mobile innovation, and we started lapping the PayPal operating agreement revenue in July, which puts pressure on our marketing services revenue growth.
While accelerating our revenue growth this year, we increased investment in product development and brand to invest in future growth. That, combined with our recent acquisitions and integrations, has been paid for with operating leverage in G&A and redeployment within marketing. And while we are relatively well protected on net income due to our hedging program, the stronger U.S. dollar has driven roughly 150 basis points of ongoing margin compression year-over-year.
Throughout 2016, we continue executing on our disciplined capital allocation strategy, and we have been acquisitive in the areas of geographic expansion and tech and talent while returning $2 billion worth of capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.
Since the separation with PayPal last July, we have repurchased $3.2 billion worth of our shares or roughly 11% of gross shares outstanding. Our strong ongoing cash flow, along with the cash from the sale of our stake in MercadoLibre, allows us to continue our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including return of capital to shareholders through share repurchase.
In closing, we are focusing on the holiday season in Q4 and continuing to lay the foundation for 2017 and beyond.

Yes, as we've said, I think, consistently for the last year, this is a large effort to re-platform our business. We have an amazing flywheel, but the re-platforming is necessary to simplify eBay and to make it more relevant for our consumers and our sellers globally. We feel very confident we're on the right track. Where we've been able to add structured data, where we've been able to build new experiences on it, now 100 million pages, we're very happy with those results. In fact, they are in line with exactly what we had hoped when we engaged in this initiative. We've also said that it's not a light switch that you turn on or off because we have such a strong core business, and so much of our traffic is organic through the core search funnel. It's a careful exercise, and it isn't a switch that you just throw on. We've got to introduce these new experiences carefully because we have a high converting, high-traffic channel, which is the organic eBay funnel and the organic search channel. So we think we're on track. And vis-à-vis GMV, one of the things I'd just note is that our business -- it's always been very difficult or impossible to look at GMV without revenue. We spend and subsidize at times. We do deals and promotions. We'll do that through the holiday. As we said here, the U.S. deceleration here was driven by a very conscious effort to begin to move our marketing spend into top of the funnel. As we start to introduce these new experiences and we think our customers like it and that's evidenced in higher conversion, we think it makes more sense to spend up the funnel. That does lengthen the time line. That does mean you may move it from, say, a subsidized deal, which would have been GMV in the quarter, to a brand campaign, which doesn't tend to work that quickly. But that's okay. We said we're doing this for the long term.

Specific to the deceleration, it's really driven by lapping a campaign we did last year in India to push the efficient frontier around CLV in that business. And the underlying cohorts of our major markets remain stable. New buyer acquisition is stable to Devin's point. It's not yet really seeing the acceleration from our structured data and SEO effort and what we're doing around the re-platforming, but it's stable. And the retained and reactive data [ph] and GMV per buyer in those buckets and the retention curves also remain stable."

So why ramp up marketing if you are not -- if the new experience is going to be available just to a small portion of the traffic? Are we right to -- could we conclude that this will change as you ramp up marketing? Or there is some other explanation?"

The first is that top-of-the-funnel brand marketing creates a halo around everything we do. So whether or not you end up on that experience through the core eBay funnel or whether or not you end up on it through, say, through Google's natural search results, we think that it takes longer, but ultimately, changing consideration of the eBay brand will yield benefits across all of our channels. So that's a reason to start because now with 100 million pages out there, even if we did nothing to increase the exposure of that to the core channel, it would still yield benefits because there are a lot of people that end up on our site through, say, external search results. But we are also beginning to open up more of the aperture this holiday, in particular, through our category pages, through our landing pages, where a number of our holiday campaigns will drive people. We are certainly going to carefully but increase the exposure of the new pages to more and more of our traffic over time. That's the goal. So I think that the brand benefit for us is really clear. It -- we wish it yielded a 90-day payback, but brand doesn't tend to work that way. Just to reiterate, what I love about our sharper brand positioning is there's been a lot of commentary about the functional gaps we need to close, i.e. we sell a lot of new goods, we sell a lot of in-season goods, 60% of all of our inventory arrives within 3 business days. All of that is true, but that isn't enough. And I think what is really unique about eBay, and remember, eBay is trying to be more unique, not more same, is that everybody finds their version of perfect. And whether that means we have extraordinary millions of items of inventory that you can only find on eBay or whether it's -- we have the greatest deals and pricing power in some of our core -- more head inventory items, that's what's uniquely eBay. It is in a more emotional shopping experience. It's a more resonant shopping experience. It's a unique inventory and great amazing deals experience. And too many consumers don't know that. So it's worth moving the marketing money even if it has a short-term impact in not subsidizing deals, and that's the balance that we're drawing. The balance we're drawing is delivering consistent and good financial results and beginning to pivot our marketing spend to build more of a moat around the very strong eBay brand. That's exactly what goes through our head when we consider how much to spend and where to spend in marketing and at what pace do we introduce these new structured data pages."

On the first part, now with 42% of live listings processed, we're covered across quite a few categories. And with 48% of experiences built on it, it's not -- we're not down in specific verticals, we're across the board. Remember, we're still out in largely external exogenous search, not in the core search funnel. But there are 2 metrics that matter to make this super simple: traffic and conversion. When I look at the page versus the page it replaced, I can see that it's simpler. It's better organized. It shows off what's unique about eBay. But put aside what I can see, I look at data. And the data, for us, as we said in my remarks, shows a significant increase in conversion. So we took this page down. We put this page up. The conversion is significant. It's not you need a microscope to see it. It's meaningful. Now I do suspect that as we get closer to better converting channels like core search, we won't maintain those conversion gains because we're basically competing against a better converting channel. But these are good experiences. And the data shows that our customers like them, and our customers are converting on these pages. So it's across category. It's actually fairly uniform. I wish I could say it's really working in this but not that. It's actually so far pretty uniform. It may prove not to be as we get more aggressive about introducing these experiences, but so far, it's fairly uniform. And the pickup in the data is fairly significant. StubHub. So I think we feel great about StubHub's business. I think that they've made significant improvements to their brand, to their product, to things like ticket recommendations, to the revised StubHub brand campaign, to their select entry into the primary market, to some of the deals that they've done with leading franchises and teams. StubHub, we made some significant product changes last September, and the growth rate took off like a rocket ship. And we're facing that wall right now. That's the reality of the math. It doesn't change at all how we feel about their competitive position. And remember, we also now have, through the acquisition of Ticketbis, have entered the international market, and we think that internationally, we're in the first inning of the secondary ticket market. So competitively, we think we're doing great. We think that this is the leading secondary market and increasingly, primary market ticket franchise. We think their competitive position's never been stronger than it is right now. And the market opportunity, we're going to face the math for another several quarters of the huge acceleration we had a year ago, but that doesn't change our view that this is a great long-term business that benefits from being part of eBay, and we're going to grow it."

When I look at the dynamics on contra, we've changed a -- we've been pushing the frontier of what we spend on whether it's buyer coupons, seller incentives, inventory incentives quarter-to-quarter. And as we've talked about in the past, we kind of think about those as a bucket, whether they show up in a marketing spend, whether they show up in revenue as negative revenue or positive revenue or in marketing expense. And what we're really looking for is where we can drive growth, CLV, buyer acquisition, those types of metrics. This quarter, we happen to shift away from the degree of buyer couponing and seller incentives and inventory incentives that we did last quarter and certainly versus year-over-year, which had a positive impact on the overall revenue rate and then, as Devin commented, the combination of that plus redeployment of lower marketing channel spends to upper really starting the transition for us as we start the process of activating our brand."

The way we've categorized our strategy is relevance, choice and the best shopping experience. Structured data is an enabler of that. So no, I don't think -- I think it's a soundbite to say we're hinging everything on structured data. Our strategy is to have a brand that's differentiated, to have inventory that's differentiated and to have a simpler, more compelling shopping experience. I mean, that's a really simple way to describe it. And all of those things are happening in earnest right now. So I think structured data is like a foundation of some of that. It's the scaffolding that we need to build on top of, but it's not the sort of one thing that -- one bullet that we've shot, and if that one bullet doesn't hit its mark, then our business is not going to be where we want it to be. I think we have a multi-pronged strategy. Structured data is an important foundational element, but it's an input, not an output. Vis-à-vis timing, we'll say what we've always said, which is this will take time. The results are not a light switch. It's not going to be 1 quarter. We said that last quarter. It's not going to be 1 quarter where all of a sudden we just pop out the top. Because we're replacing high converting pages, it'll be a march. It'll be a slower and steady march, and we'll continue to deliver good results while we're doing that. We'll continue to be disciplined about capital allocation while we're doing that.

We will do more category in landing pages. We'll do more holiday campaigns to take you to those experiences, but we're not going to mess around with our core search funnel as we get ready for holiday. You can expect us to start to do that next year. On social, Colin, we are very aggressive about that. And by the way, top of the funnel, when we talk about brand marketing, I think it sometimes gets conflated with TV. TV is not the largest part of it. It's brand across all channels, including social. So this quarter, we added an 18th social channel. We're working aggressively with multiple social channels, including what I mentioned in my remarks, launching a bot on Facebook Messenger, but we're advertising.

And if the greenshoe is exercised, we'll have sold all of our stake in MercadoLibre. And really, this is driven by the fact that we regularly review and actively manage our investments as part of our disciplined capital allocation strategy. The sale's going to enable us to recognize a significant gain. It'll be about $1.2 billion of gross proceeds and about $700 million to $800 million of net gain. If the shoe exercises, that'll be in addition to that. This is a Q4 event, and we're working through the U.S. and international tax implications of this, the timing of the cash payments, which may impact free cash flow, but this does not change our capital allocation strategy nor our relationship with MELI. We have a great relationship with them, and we've actually signed an agreement with them to expand our relationship to help connect our sellers to Latin America buyers."

And that still provides us the flexibility to do acquisitions where we see that we can create value, and we won't hesitate to do that. I don't think we've said a lot about big versus small. It's more about being disciplined about what we do. I -- we wouldn't hesitate to do something larger if we thought that we could create sustainable long-term value in doing it. And right now we've built capabilities, particularly in areas like AI and a little bit of geo expansion through small tuck-ins, and it's likely to continue. But if we saw the opportunity to do something more meaningful, we wouldn't hesitate to do it, but we'll be disciplined about it. We don't swing wildly at things."

And the reason that, historically, we've been somewhat averse to moving our marketing up the funnel is because it gets harder to measure value. It's easy to measure value when you're marketing down the funnel, and it gets harder as you move up. But that doesn't mean there is no value. So we have a way -- we are going to do -- as we increase the amount of up-the-funnel brand marketing, we are going to do our best at measuring value. It certainly needs a longer time frame. I think it is at least a year in which it needs to be in the market to really resonate and start to shift the perception in consideration of the eBay brand. And we're going to watch it. It's not -- that's not the kind of thing you watch every day like you do down-the-funnel marketing, but we're certainly going to watch it carefully. We've got a measurement framework for it.

If you haven't seen it, please go look at it. Just type collective into eBay search, and go take a look at that vertical experience. That is using the Corrigon technology to, in essence, take seller images and improve them and remove the backgrounds and make them look just about museum quality. So the answer is we're already using it, and we'll expand the use of that over time. Vis-à-vis the other acquisitions like SalesPredict and Expertmaker, we are already starting to use that in the more back-end part of the structured data initiative to create catalogs and taxonomies, which is happening with pace. So all of these things -- almost all -- I think -- I believe all 3 of them, we have been working with prior to buying them. And they are wired on now and they are -- they'll come online with even more spectrum over time. Vis-à-vis the VR rollout of StubHub, I think I have said that it's now 55 venues, which -- and we'll just keep marching down that path because customers are actually using it. I think we've got one of the best use cases for VR actually driving commerce, and it makes sense. It's an immersive experience. It's a high ASP sale. And we're learning from that about how we might bring VR into more core eBay activities, where immersion matters, where high ASP drives careful consideration of the visual image before purchase. So we like VR and augmented reality, and we think they're going to be meaningful in commerce, and we want to be a leader there."

We delivered good top and bottom line financial results in Q3 led by consistent performance in our core eBay platform and strong growth from StubHub and Classifieds.

We delivered good top and bottom line financial results in Q3 led by consistent performance in our core eBay platform and strong growth from StubHub and Classifieds. We made progress on our strategy, began activating our new brand marketing messages, and we readied our organization to execute in the upcoming holiday quarter.
Overall, total GMV was up 5% for the quarter, while revenue was up 8%. GMV decelerated modestly while revenue accelerated 1 point. GMV deceleration was driven primarily by StubHub lapping last year's product changes and, in part, by the shift of marketing spend to longer-cycle brand investments on our Marketplace platform. The revenue acceleration was driven primarily by lower contra revenue spend and a VAT settlement.
Active buyer growth was 3%, and we added over 1 million additional buyers to our platforms in Q3. GMV on our Marketplace platform grew at 4%, while StubHub grew volume at 23%. And our Classified platform grew revenue at 14%. Finally, we repurchased $0.5 billion of our stock, and we closed several key acquisitions that we announced over the last several months.
On our Marketplace platform, we continue to make steady progress against our strategy to drive the best choice, the most relevance and the most powerful selling platform. In Q3, we signed several new strategic brand partners, including Mattel, Fender, Volcom and Magic Chef, enhancing our efforts to drive more choice for our consumers. Using our data, we're also increasingly reaching out to our sellers to prompt them to source and list in-demand goods where we see gaps in supply.
And finally, in the past several months, we've launched several new curated vertical experiences in fashion and home and garden. Most recently, we announced eBay Collective in the U.S., a shopping destination, which provides consumers with curated inventory for antique, modern and contemporary furniture and fine art. This is similar to the approach we took earlier in the year with the launch of our curated Wine category on eBay, and it's an approach we'll seek to replicate going forward where we see the opportunity to do so.
I'm particularly excited about the improvements we're making to drive the most relevant shopping experience for our consumers. We continue to process more data from our structured data initiative, which enables us to have better insight into the inventory on our site and to build better user experiences.
In Q3, we increased the percentage of structured data listings processed to 48% of relevant live listings. The ongoing growth and penetration of structured data is enabling us to accelerate the pace of new browse and product page launches, and we ended Q3 with over 100 million pages built on structured data that showcase our inventory in ways that were not possible just a year ago. We're further enhancing these pages by introducing new features such as multiple top picks, product comparisons and limited-time deals, and we continue to see significantly higher conversion. While these early results give us continued confidence in our strategy, our new pages are currently being exposed to a very small fraction of our traffic. The majority of our business today comes through our organic on eBay search funnel. Over time, we expect to start introducing these new experiences to our organic traffic. Now while we're moving at an urgent pace, you can expect us to take an intelligent approach to this transition to ensure that we don't disrupt our customers along the way.
Another area I'm excited about is mobile. Since the launch of our redesigned eBay mobile apps in May, customer reviews have trended higher as we've seen -- as we have significantly improved the speed and the usability of our apps. And our ability to rapidly iterate on user feedback has enabled us to keep this positive momentum going. We recently released the fifth update to our new mobile experience in the past 5 months, and this cadence of improvements is translating into better growth with Q3 being the second quarter in a row of mobile growth acceleration.
We're also beginning to leverage artificial intelligence to power unique commerce experiences for our users. Yesterday, we announced the beta launch of eBay ShopBot on Facebook Messenger, a personalized shopping assistant that enables people to find the best deals from eBay's 1 billion listings. Our vision is to make shopping with eBay as easy as talking to a friend, whether you're looking for something specific or you're browsing for inspiration.
eBay continues to be one of the leading consumer brands in the world, having recently been ranked #32 by Interbrand in their 2016 Best Global Brands report. This is the same position that eBay achieved in 2015, and we view this as positive because the recent ranking reflects the first full year post the PayPal spin.
With that said, we've also been doing considerable work to sharpen our brand. During Q3, we began to activate our new brand messages by running several marketing pilots externally. We continue to shift more of our marketing resources towards top-of-the-funnel consideration and will further ramp our external efforts during the upcoming holiday season and into 2017. This includes plans to advertise on TV in the U.S. and Europe during this holiday season, which we have not done since 2014.
Finally, we continue to execute on our plans to deliver the most powerful selling platform. In August, we launched Seller Hub to all U.S. sellers and have recently begun the process of rolling that out to international markets. Thus far, over 0.5 million sellers have used Seller Hub, and we're seeing early improvements in key listing metrics and strong adoption of marketing features such as our promotions tool. And we're steadily expanding our promoted listings product, enabling more and more sellers to bid their inventory for placement in search results. We also today announced the launch of an entirely new set of APIs, making it simpler for our developers and sellers to rapidly integrate with eBay and onboard all their inventory using retail and industry standard practice.
On the consumer selling side, we continue to simplify selling on eBay. We recently began rolling out our simplified listing flow to a portion of first-time consumer sellers. While still early, we're seeing better completion rates and improved listing quality. We're also seeing strong demand for our assisted selling service, eBay Valet. We now have drop-off sites live in 1,700 FedEx locations, and we've made several improvements to enable a better user experience, including upfront value estimation and item eligibility. And in September, we launched Quick Sale, which enables consumers to trade in their mobile phone with transparent pricing, taking advantage of mobile phone industry upgrade cycles.
StubHub continues to innovate and execute against the large and increasingly global market opportunity. The team continues to drive innovative user experiences, expanding our virtual reality technology to 55 total venues, which represent over 1/3 of ticket sales on our native app platform. We also recently launched our blended primary and secondary ticket experience for the Philadelphia 76ers and launched the ability for users to receive support through a Skype chatbot.
Growth began to slow in the quarter as we started to lap the product changes we made last September, and our comps will get more difficult from here. However, we believe our strategy of expanding internationally and selectively tapping into the primary market will serve us well over the long term.
Our Classified platform continues its good growth, driven by strong vibrancy metrics across our major markets, increased engagement with our native mobile apps and continued strength in the motors and the real estate verticals across our key markets. And we're working to leverage all 3 of our platforms to drive great consumer experiences. The eBay and Gumtree inventory integration effort that we launched in Australia in Q2 show good results, and we'll now roll out the integration of core inventory into our Classified sites in several other markets. We also began testing ticketing inventory integration between Kijiji Canada and StubHub. We envision tying our strong eBay assets closer together over time to enable a more unified experience for all of our consumers.
In summary, we're making meaningful progress on our strategy while delivering good financial results. Re-platforming a business of our size and scale takes time. However, our pace of innovation has accelerated. We're increasingly using structured data and artificial intelligence to transform shopping on eBay, delivering more personalization capabilities, continuing to iterate our mobile experience and bringing more unique inventory and categories to our customers. We've got more work to do, but I'm confident we're on the right path.
Now let me turn it over to Scott, and he'll provide more details on our Q3 results."

In Q3 business performance was stable, and we delivered good financial results while executing on our strategic priorities. StubHub and Classifieds continued growing double digits, and the Marketplace improvements we saw last quarter are still evident in mobile C2C and SEO. As we reflect on the last 9 months, we remain confident in our strategy and we continue to make progress.
During my discussion, I'll reference our earnings presentation beginning on Slide 4. In Q3, we generated $2.2 billion of total revenue, $0.45 of non-GAAP EPS, $617 million in free cash flow, and we repurchased $500 million of our stock. In addition, we are raising the full year guidance on revenue and expect to be in the middle of the previously communicated non-GAAP EPS range.
Let's start with Q3 active buyers on Slide 5. In the quarter, trailing 12-month growth was down 1 point to 3% year-over-year. The quarter-over-quarter deceleration was driven by lapping last year's increased marketing spend in India.
On Slide 6, we enabled $20.1 billion of GMV in Q3, up 5% versus last year, decelerating 1 point versus prior quarter, driven by StubHub and the U.S. Marketplace platform. By geography, the U.S. generated $8.4 billion of GMV, up 3%, while the international delivered $11.7 billion of GMV, up 7% year-over-year.
Moving to revenue. We generated net revenues of $2.2 billion, up 8% versus last year, accelerating 1 point versus Q2. We delivered $1.7 billion of transaction revenue, up 8% and $470 million of marketing services and other revenue, up 10%.
Transitioning to our Marketplaces platform on Slide 8. Q3 grew [ph] 4% year-over-year, rounding down 1 point versus Q2. U.S. GMV decelerated as we shifted marketing spend to more brand awareness, which tends to have a longer payback as we start to influence consideration. International GMV improved slightly quarter-over-quarter, rounding up 1 point.
Total Marketplace revenue was $1.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, a 2 point acceleration versus prior quarter. Transaction revenue grew 5%, up 3 points quarter-over-quarter. This acceleration is attributed to reduced marketing incentives that show up in contra revenue, along with the VAT settlement. Marketing services and other revenue grew 5%, decelerating 6 points versus Q2, driven by tougher comps from the PayPal operating agreement.
Moving to Slide 9. StubHub had another strong quarter, delivering 23% GMV growth and 32% revenue growth, driven in strength in -- driven by strength in concerts, theater and Major League Baseball. In the quarter, we closed both the Ticketbis and Ticket Utils acquisitions, adding to our international presence and improving seller tools.
Moving to Slide 10. In Q3, Classifieds revenue grew 14% year-over-year, a 1 point deceleration from last quarter. The automotive and real estate verticals in our key markets remain strong, while ad revenue growth modestly decelerated. Our key engagement metrics like visits, replies and listings remain healthy, and we will continue to innovate across our mobile apps, which are increasingly more important as traffic continues to shift to mobile.
Turning to Slide 11 and major cost drivers. In Q3, we delivered non-GAAP operating margin of 29.9%, which is down 200 basis points versus last year. The impact of a strong U.S. dollar pressured margins 200 basis points. The foreign exchange impact was felt across all spend categories, so I will focus my comments on the operational dynamics of our expenses.
Roughly half the increase in cost of revenue was driven by the mix of our faster growth platforms like StubHub, which have an inherently lower gross margin. Q3 sales and marketing expense increased slightly as we shifted spend away from seller incentives that show up in contra revenue and redeployed to top-of-the-funnel channels like brand.
Product development is an area where we have been investing more heavily, and half of the year-over-year increase is from our work on the Marketplace product experience. G&A expense was down roughly 80 basis points year-over-year from strong operating leverage.
Moving to Slide 12. In Q3, we delivered $0.45 in non-GAAP EPS, up $0.02 versus prior year, driven by revenue growth and the net benefit of share repurchases partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. In Q3, GAAP EPS was $0.36, down $0.09 versus last year. The drop in GAAP EPS is driven by last year's investment gains in Snapdeal and Baixing. As always, you can find the detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures in our press release and earnings presentation.
On Slide 13, in Q3, we generated free cash flow of $617 million, up 34%, largely due to lapping separation-related costs incurred last year. We remain on track to deliver our full year guidance of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. CapEx was 8% of revenue in Q3, and our full year guidance remains 7% to 9%.
Moving to Slide 14. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and non-equity investments of $10.4 billion, of which $2.7 billion is in the U.S. In Q3, we repurchased 16.5 million shares at an average price of $30.29 per share, amounting to $500 million in repurchases. We have completed share repurchases of $2 billion this year or roughly 115% of our year-to-date free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $2.3 billion of share repurchase authorization remaining, and we are on track with our full year plans for share repurchases, which will represent $500 million for Q4.
Let me remind you about our strategy and overall philosophy on investments. We regularly review and actively manage our investment portfolio to ensure that our investments support the company's strategic direction and complement our disciplined approach to value creation, profitability and capital allocation.
With this in mind, we recently sold most of our stake in MercadoLibre. We remain committed to our customers in Latin America, and we have signed a strategic agreement with MercadoLibre that is designed to advance cross-border opportunities for our sellers who are targeting buyers in Latin America. The sale has enabled us to realize roughly $1.2 billion of gross proceeds. We are currently working through the exact U.S. and international tax implications, including the timing of cash payments, which could have an impact on our free cash flow. We intend to use the net proceeds in a manner consistent with our capital allocation policy.
Now moving to guidance on Slide 15. For Q4, we are projecting revenue between $2.36 billion and $2.41 billion, growing 4% to 6% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 to $0.54 per share, representing 4% to 8% as reported year-over-year growth. The EPS growth is driven by revenue growth and the net benefit of our share repurchase program partially offset by the impact of a stronger dollar.
Based on Q3 performance, we are raising revenue guidance for the full year. Revenue is now projected to be $8.95 billion to $9 billion, growing 6% to 7% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP margin guidance range of 31% to 33% is unchanged. However, we continue to expect to be at the low end of this range. We are raising our full year non-GAAP tax rate slightly to 19.5% to 20.5%. And now we expect our non-GAAP EPS to be in the middle of our previously disclosed guidance range of $1.85 to $1.90 per share. Due to the sale of our stake in MercadoLibre, we are raising our full year GAAP EPS guidance to $2.22 to $2.32 per share.
As we enter Q4, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on 2016. We started the year expecting to grow revenue in the 2% to 5% range. Year-to-date, we have executed on and aligned our investments behind our strategic initiatives while increasing our revenue growth outlook to 6% to 7%. The Marketplace platform began seeing green shoots from our re-platforming, and while the efforts are positive, they have not yet materially impacted the trajectory of the overall business.
StubHub enjoyed strong performance over the past 3 quarters and has now started lapping the product changes from last September, which will carry into next year. Classifieds continued its double-digit growth while investing in mobile innovation, and we started lapping the PayPal operating agreement revenue in July, which puts pressure on our marketing services revenue growth.
While accelerating our revenue growth this year, we increased investment in product development and brand to invest in future growth. That, combined with our recent acquisitions and integrations, has been paid for with operating leverage in G&A and redeployment within marketing. And while we are relatively well protected on net income due to our hedging program, the stronger U.S. dollar has driven roughly 150 basis points of ongoing margin compression year-over-year.
Throughout 2016, we continue executing on our disciplined capital allocation strategy, and we have been acquisitive in the areas of geographic expansion and tech and talent while returning $2 billion worth of capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.
Since the separation with PayPal last July, we have repurchased $3.2 billion worth of our shares or roughly 11% of gross shares outstanding. Our strong ongoing cash flow, along with the cash from the sale of our stake in MercadoLibre, allows us to continue our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including return of capital to shareholders through share repurchase.
In closing, we are focusing on the holiday season in Q4 and continuing to lay the foundation for 2017 and beyond.

And you guys have said that the aspirational goal at the end of the day is to get back to kind of double-digit e-commerce-like growth rates. So as we look over the next year and you start cutting more traffic over to these higher converting pages, when do you think we'll start to see the GMV growth start to pick up?

Yes, as we've said, I think, consistently for the last year, this is a large effort to re-platform our business. We have an amazing flywheel, but the re-platforming is necessary to simplify eBay and to make it more relevant for our consumers and our sellers globally. We feel very confident we're on the right track. Where we've been able to add structured data, where we've been able to build new experiences on it, now 100 million pages, we're very happy with those results. In fact, they are in line with exactly what we had hoped when we engaged in this initiative. We've also said that it's not a light switch that you turn on or off because we have such a strong core business, and so much of our traffic is organic through the core search funnel. It's a careful exercise, and it isn't a switch that you just throw on. We've got to introduce these new experiences carefully because we have a high converting, high-traffic channel, which is the organic eBay funnel and the organic search channel. So we think we're on track. And vis-à-vis GMV, one of the things I'd just note is that our business -- it's always been very difficult or impossible to look at GMV without revenue. We spend and subsidize at times. We do deals and promotions. We'll do that through the holiday. As we said here, the U.S. deceleration here was driven by a very conscious effort to begin to move our marketing spend into top of the funnel. As we start to introduce these new experiences and we think our customers like it and that's evidenced in higher conversion, we think it makes more sense to spend up the funnel. That does lengthen the time line. That does mean you may move it from, say, a subsidized deal, which would have been GMV in the quarter, to a brand campaign, which doesn't tend to work that quickly. But that's okay. We said we're doing this for the long term. We're building a moat around eBay's business, and we're going to do this in a considered way so that the business is more competitive and relevant than it's ever been. And I'm really pleased with that. I think that's right where we want to be. I'll turn it over to Scott, and maybe he can comment on the second part of your question, which is a buyer question."

The first is that top-of-the-funnel brand marketing creates a halo around everything we do. So whether or not you end up on that experience through the core eBay funnel or whether or not you end up on it through, say, through Google's natural search results, we think that it takes longer, but ultimately, changing consideration of the eBay brand will yield benefits across all of our channels. So that's a reason to start because now with 100 million pages out there, even if we did nothing to increase the exposure of that to the core channel, it would still yield benefits because there are a lot of people that end up on our site through, say, external search results. But we are also beginning to open up more of the aperture this holiday, in particular, through our category pages, through our landing pages, where a number of our holiday campaigns will drive people. We are certainly going to carefully but increase the exposure of the new pages to more and more of our traffic over time. That's the goal. So I think that the brand benefit for us is really clear. It -- we wish it yielded a 90-day payback, but brand doesn't tend to work that way. Just to reiterate, what I love about our sharper brand positioning is there's been a lot of commentary about the functional gaps we need to close, i.e. we sell a lot of new goods, we sell a lot of in-season goods, 60% of all of our inventory arrives within 3 business days. All of that is true, but that isn't enough. And I think what is really unique about eBay, and remember, eBay is trying to be more unique, not more same, is that everybody finds their version of perfect. And whether that means we have extraordinary millions of items of inventory that you can only find on eBay or whether it's -- we have the greatest deals and pricing power in some of our core -- more head inventory items, that's what's uniquely eBay. It is in a more emotional shopping experience. It's a more resonant shopping experience. It's a unique inventory and great amazing deals experience. And too many consumers don't know that. So it's worth moving the marketing money even if it has a short-term impact in not subsidizing deals, and that's the balance that we're drawing. The balance we're drawing is delivering consistent and good financial results and beginning to pivot our marketing spend to build more of a moat around the very strong eBay brand. That's exactly what goes through our head when we consider how much to spend and where to spend in marketing and at what pace do we introduce these new structured data pages."

On the first part, now with 42% of live listings processed, we're covered across quite a few categories. And with 48% of experiences built on it, it's not -- we're not down in specific verticals, we're across the board. Remember, we're still out in largely external exogenous search, not in the core search funnel. But there are 2 metrics that matter to make this super simple: traffic and conversion. When I look at the page versus the page it replaced, I can see that it's simpler. It's better organized. It shows off what's unique about eBay. But put aside what I can see, I look at data. And the data, for us, as we said in my remarks, shows a significant increase in conversion. So we took this page down. We put this page up. The conversion is significant. It's not you need a microscope to see it. It's meaningful. Now I do suspect that as we get closer to better converting channels like core search, we won't maintain those conversion gains because we're basically competing against a better converting channel. But these are good experiences. And the data shows that our customers like them, and our customers are converting on these pages. So it's across category. It's actually fairly uniform. I wish I could say it's really working in this but not that. It's actually so far pretty uniform. It may prove not to be as we get more aggressive about introducing these experiences, but so far, it's fairly uniform. And the pickup in the data is fairly significant. StubHub. So I think we feel great about StubHub's business. I think that they've made significant improvements to their brand, to their product, to things like ticket recommendations, to the revised StubHub brand campaign, to their select entry into the primary market, to some of the deals that they've done with leading franchises and teams. StubHub, we made some significant product changes last September, and the growth rate took off like a rocket ship. And we're facing that wall right now. That's the reality of the math. It doesn't change at all how we feel about their competitive position. And remember, we also now have, through the acquisition of Ticketbis, have entered the international market, and we think that internationally, we're in the first inning of the secondary ticket market. So competitively, we think we're doing great. We think that this is the leading secondary market and increasingly, primary market ticket franchise. We think their competitive position's never been stronger than it is right now. And the market opportunity, we're going to face the math for another several quarters of the huge acceleration we had a year ago, but that doesn't change our view that this is a great long-term business that benefits from being part of eBay, and we're going to grow it."

It'll be a slower and steady march, and we'll continue to deliver good results while we're doing that. We'll continue to be disciplined about capital allocation while we're doing that. We'll continue to generate leverage for our shareholders while we're doing that. So I think it's been a consistent story since we started this.

In Devin's prepared comments, you heard him talk about the continued acceleration. At this point, we're at 47% share. The feedback continues to improve on 5.0 [ph], and the growth is accelerating as well. And then C2C, we've done a series of things that Devin laid out, many of them, in his prepared remarks. And while we're still shrinking, it's shrinking less so. And so those are just a couple of extra points around our strategy and initiatives that we're laying to drive future growth. As it relates to the margin, what I'd point to is what I talked about for cost of revenue, is kind of the gross margin dynamics of StubHub having a bit heavier -- not only a higher take rate but heavier cost dynamic. But the underlying -- we don't really have segment margins, if you will, for the different platforms, so can't really comment on that."

If you think about it, the least disruptive is exogenous through search channels, then category and browse pages, which we're sort of introducing right now and you'll see us drive a number of holiday campaigns directly to those experiences for the first time. And then the final one, which is the biggest channel but the one that we have to be the most careful about is the organic search channel. So we're not going to do that through this holiday. We will do more category in landing pages. We'll do more holiday campaigns to take you to those experiences, but we're not going to mess around with our core search funnel as we get ready for holiday. You can expect us to start to do that next year. On social, Colin, we are very aggressive about that. And by the way, top of the funnel, when we talk about brand marketing, I think it sometimes gets conflated with TV. TV is not the largest part of it. It's brand across all channels, including social. So this quarter, we added an 18th social channel. We're working aggressively with multiple social channels, including what I mentioned in my remarks, launching a bot on Facebook Messenger, but we're advertising. And you'll see eBay brand messages in addition to bottom-of-the-funnel call-to-action messages increasingly across major social and messaging platforms."

Specific to Q4, the guidance, as you called out, was 4% to 6% FX-neutral revenue growth with EPS $0.52 to $0.54, up 4% to 8%. Specific to the revenue, this really implies underlying continued stability with a couple of dynamics worth noting. First off, you called out one of them, the StubHub lapping. We'll have 3 months of lapping versus just a month of lapping in Q4, which will decelerate -- have an impact to decelerating our overall total revenue. And we have about 1 point of some non-repeating VAT settlements in Q3 that I called out in my prepared remarks. So those 2 will have an impact on the overall revenue growth that we called out. I would characterize the underlying revenue growth at 4% to 6% as relatively stable quarter-to-quarter. And then we expect the initiatives to continue on the positive trajectory that we've called out but not yet having this massive inflection point or a date that everyone's looking for. We continue to see progress. We'll continue to elevate the experience via structured data and the user experience.

And the reason that, historically, we've been somewhat averse to moving our marketing up the funnel is because it gets harder to measure value. It's easy to measure value when you're marketing down the funnel, and it gets harder as you move up. But that doesn't mean there is no value. So we have a way -- we are going to do -- as we increase the amount of up-the-funnel brand marketing, we are going to do our best at measuring value. It certainly needs a longer time frame.

I think we've got one of the best use cases for VR actually driving commerce, and it makes sense. It's an immersive experience. It's a high ASP sale.
