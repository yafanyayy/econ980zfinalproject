During the third quarter, we focused intently on making the most of the fundamental strengths in both of our businesses and capitalize on the generally favorable market conditions affecting our dental and Animal Health segments. We are pleased with our third quarter results with our broad sales momentum and our execution. 
Since we closed the acquisition of Animal Health International last June, we have made it a high priority to preserve our focus on customer service and sales effectiveness as we move through this difficult period of integration. Across our entire organization, I am pleased to say that we have done this and it is paying off. We achieved several additional integration milestones in the fiscal 2016 third quarter. 
We made additional progress on the headquarters relocations to our new Animal Health segment and consolidating functions to Colorado. We further strengthened what we believe to be the deepest leadership team in the Animal Health industry and we unified our marketing and operations team. Today, we are truly operating as one business with our vendor partners, nearly all of whom have products across the entire Animal Health segment. Certainly, this is an important early integration win. 
Also of note, at the end of the quarter, we moved forward with our first pilot implementations for our next-generation systems initiative. This multiyear initiative will, over time, significantly enhance our efficiency and help drive bottom line performance. To date, we have 6 branches, 2 fulfillment centers and several corporate functions directly involved -- involving more than 1,000 employees on the new system. Overall, these early pilots are going well and I want to acknowledge the invaluable contribution of all Patterson employees involved. 
I personally visited a branch office and fulfillment center as we went live, and was very encourage to see the commitment and determination of our employees first-hand. Let me also thank our new colleagues from Animal Health International who bring valuable experience, having made this system's journey. They have been incredibly helpful to our launch, and we believe their guidance and input will continue to be very valuable as we learn from these early pilots and ultimately extend the implementation across our entire organization. 
Looking now at our markets. The stable to steadily improving conditions we have experienced in the past several quarters largely continued in quarter 3. Both segments of our business are sound underlying dynamics, which served as tailwinds for our dental and companion animal businesses. Improving employment levels and consumer spending continue to benefit both dental service utilization and spending on pets. 
On the production animal side, the end market conditions we witnessed in the second quarter largely continued in quarter 3. By combining our new production animal strength with our companion animal leadership, we have clearly created the markets most formidable Animal Health platform. Moreover, we've positioned Patterson to benefit from a new growth catalyst, the ever-increasing global demand for animal protein. 
Now looking at our results for the quarter. We turned in a strong performance. Consolidated sales from continuing operations rose 48% on a constant currency basis to $1.4 billion, reflecting the Animal Health International acquisition. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations rose 39% to $0.68 per diluted share. 
Let's examine our 2 segments starting with dental. U.S. dental market fundamentals were healthy during the quarter, and we executed well. Sales from consumables expanded significantly during the period of more than 5% on a constant currency basis. This is also a nice sequential improvement to our increase in the first half of the year and we remain encouraged by the momentum here. 
Sales in our dental equipment category, which can be more variable quarter-to-quarter, posted solid gains. Equipment sales rose 6.8% in constant currency. Technology remains a high priority area for investments of dentists. During the quarter, sales of digital radiography and traditional core equipment were particularly strong although CEREC sales were below our internal expectations for the period. 
However, just this morning, Sirona announce their new CEREC zirconia workflow, which combines CAD/CAM technology support with full contours zirconium materials. This product offering will allow for a single visit restorations using its high strength material and we are very enthusiastic about this enhancement to the CEREC platform. We feel confident in saying that the interest in CAD/CAM offerings is building a cross dental offices of all sizes. 
Today's product announcement once again expands the potential for CEREC chairside single visit dentistry. Our leadership in digital dental technology as well as traditional equipment is driven by a particular philosophy and approach to serving the customer that we believe has growing appeal. In addition to the many advantages this technology can provide dentists helping patients, dental offices of all sizes are increasingly seeking a worry-free approach to leveraging technology into their business. 
We are speaking to you today from the Chicago Dental Society Midwinter Meeting and this technology and equipment partnership is a common and compelling desire among our dental customers. The importance of superior technical support and service infrastructure needed to support this technology cannot be overestimated. Patterson has invested significantly in these resources over the past 15 years, and we believe our service and support infrastructure give us a distinct competitive advantage to serve an ever evolving customer. 
Looking now at traditional equipment. Our quarter 3 performance was particularly strong. For several quarters, we have been describing our goal to build on the important strategic relationship we have with A-dec and improve our ability to address a wider range of customer needs with expanded offerings. Those offerings include new partnerships with crane and the Belmont company as well as the new Sirona line of treatment centers and traditional equipment. 
Our results this quarter show that our execution in this area is clearly starting to pay off. Sales of core equipment on a constant currency basis improved double-digits year-over-year. We began training on the Sirona treatment centers last quarter. Customer reactions so far has been enthusiastic. We're confident that these lines will be welcomed additions to what we believe will be the most compelling portfolio of traditional equipment products in the dental community. 
Now let me provide some perspective on this year's extension of Section 179 tax benefits. Naturally, we're pleased to see the extension of these tax benefits for capital purchases made permanent and we believe this certainly helps our customers with our capital purchase planning in the years to come. The extension of Section 179 benefits this year came at roughly the same time as last year. So we view our growth and equipment sales in quarter 3 as largely a function of market demand and sales execution rather than tax incentivized purchases. 
Now turning to our Animal Health segment. During the quarter, sales in this segment more than doubled year-over-year on a constant currency basis. As I mentioned earlier, our sales team in this segment has focused on a thorough and timely integration, and these critical efforts are paying off across the entire Animal Health platform. Companion Animal continues to benefit from stable to improving market conditions and favorable pet ownership trends. Sales in the legacy companion animal business, excluding revenue from the acquisition and the impact of the shift in veterinary diagnostic vendor relationships improved 6.2% in constant currency during the quarter. 
U.S. companion animal is particularly strong expanding by more than 11%. I need to emphasize that this growth is a direct result of our efforts to rapidly integrate our companion animal management and sales teams and strong execution. As you have seen in the press release, sales from Animal Health International added nearly $407 million to our Animal Health segment in the quarter. Similar to last quarter, end market pricing and customer profitability across the beef, dairy and swine species remain somewhat soft. These factors are part of production animal market cyclicality and they impacted growth in our production animal business. However, it's important to remember that regardless of market conditions, producers must continue to manage the health of their animals and we play a critical role in helping them achieve this important objective. 
And key to long-term growth, we now possess the foremost animal production business in North America and we are especially pleased at how well we executed the market while advancing all the integration activities involved with the acquisition. All in all, we continue to make substantial progress in this all-important first year of integration in our Animal Health segment and are optimistic about the prospects ahead. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials."
320186,325491320,940488,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. As Scott mentioned, we are pleased with the broad sales momentum and execution during our third quarter. Again, on this call, I will discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations focused on the transformed Patterson Compa",1374,"Thank you, Scott. As Scott mentioned, we are pleased with the broad sales momentum and execution during our third quarter. Again, on this call, I will discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations focused on the transformed Patterson Company. Also, bear in mind that today's results reflect the second full quarter of contributions from Animal Health International. So where appropriate, I will refer to organic sales, which stripped out the impact of the acquisition to provide a more normalized view of operations. 
Looking at the top line. We reported consolidated sales of $1.4 billion, up 48% on a constant currency basis. Organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis rose 6.2%, excluding the impact from the change in diagnostic manufacturers in our companion animal business. Also, this is up sequentially from 3.3% organic growth in Q2. The effects of foreign currency translation moderated slightly during the quarter. On a consolidated basis, currency translation sales reduced sales by approximately 1.7%. We continue to anticipate that 15% to 20% of our revenue will come from international forces. 
Now let's look at margin. As a reminder, when we announced the acquisition of Animal Health International and the sale of Patterson Medical last year, the central rationale was to gain a broader platform for growth and improve our return on invested capital profile in exchange for some margin dilution. Consolidated operating margins during the third quarter reflected that impact declining 70 basis points. However, with the additional earnings power from Animal Health International, our operating income rose by $28 million to $108 million, up 35% over third quarter last year. 
Organic consolidated operating margin in the third quarter averaged 8.9%. We had another good quarter of operating margin expansion, which involves our dental and Animal Health businesses. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS from continuing operations totaled $0.68. Now let's move on to our segments. In our dental segment, sales rose 5.9% on a constant currency basis. On the same basis, consumables grew more than 5% as we saw solid gains and utilization. Equipment sales were up 6.8% in constant currency, reflecting strength in both core equipment and technology sales. 
While we certainly believe the appetite for technology among practitioners is healthy and expanding, CEREC sales fell short of our internal expectations as Scott noted. However, with the new product innovation and focused promotional offering, we anticipate a stronger CEREC performance in Q4. Operating margins increased 15 basis points over the prior year in dental driven by gross margins. Specifically, earning additional manufacturing rebates, which resulted from our efforts to broaden our core equipment portfolio as well as mix. We are on track to deliver operating margin expansion of between 20 and 30 basis points in dental for the full year. 
Now turning to our Animal Health segment. In this discussion, organic sales metrics exclude both the contribution from Animal Health International and the impact of the change in veterinary diagnostic manufacturers. Note that this is the last time we will adjust for this change because it has now been analyzed. On a constant currency basis, organic sales in the segment rose more than 6% for the quarter, driven by strength in the U.S. Sales from the legacy U.S. companion animal business expanded 11.3%. This was partially offset by growth of less than 1% in constant currency sales in the U.K. 
The sales contribution from Animal Health International during the period totaled $407 million. With that contribution, sales for the consolidated Patterson Animal Health segment more than doubled from the prior year. As Scott mentioned, the production animal market is currently impacted by some softness across beef and dairy cattle as well as the swine species. We currently expect these conditions to continue in the fiscal 2017 with expected revenue growth rates in the 2% to 3% range for this business. 
Operating margin within the Animal Health segment increased by 80 basis points led by improvements in our legacy companion animal business and synergies capture. And we expect operating margins here to continue to expand going forward. For the full year, we continue to anticipate operating margins on an adjusted basis of 4% to 5% in the Animal Health segment as we said previously. We are pleased with our progress in capturing synergies during the quarter. Specifically, we have made strides in several areas, including the integration of our companion animal sales force lowering facility expenses and reducing logistics costs among others. 
Our efforts so far this year demonstrate that we are on track to achieve our stated goal of realizing between $20 million and $30 million in synergies over a 3-year period. Now a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. We used $47.5 million of operating cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter versus generating $119.4 million in the prior period. The increase in working capital is due to a few factors. Investment in inventories and our pilot locations in preparation for the new ERP system; inventory build with CEREC units and purchasing opportunities from our consumable vendors at year-end. Working capital levels should come down over the next few quarters as we work through consolidation expertise from the acquisition, stabilize business processes connected to our ERP initiatives and work down on the safety stock we used to ensure we would properly serve our customers during our pilot phase. 
As a result, we expect our net income to free cash flow conversion to still be positive for fiscal 2016 but lower than our historical performance. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities. FX in the third quarter totaled $15 million and included investments for normal replacements as well as our corporatewide information technology initiative. For the 2016 fiscal year, we are currently estimating CapEx to be approximately $65 million to $75 million. 
In terms of shareholder returns year-to-date we have $267 million to our shareholders through a combination of $67 million in dividends and $200 million of share buybacks. I'll wrap up this discussion with a few comments on fiscal 2016 guidance. Based on our performance in the first 9 months of fiscal 2016, we are narrowing our adjusted earnings guidance range to $2.42 to $2.88 per diluted share. I'll remind you that this range assumes stable North American and International markets, it includes the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2016 and excludes any impact of additional share repurchases for the balance of the year. 
Our guidance excludes onetime transaction-related costs, integration expense and deal amortization nonreturning IP training costs and tax costs related to cash repatriation. Before I turn it back to Scott, a note about our next-generation systems initiative and expense levels going forward. Today, we are actively shipping product on a new system. We are using it across a representative section of Patterson and ultimately, this will lead to new efficiencies and cost savings. 
However, this investment will begin depreciating in fiscal '17 as we move further in its implementation. We are currently in the stabilization phase with our pilot activity and are totally committed to ensuring a smooth transition to the new system. This pilot phase will continue through the end of the fiscal year then move into broader implementation during the late summer or early fall. We have significantly reduced our implementation risk by deploying the new technology gradually throughout our system rather than sweeping the switch all at once. But this comes with a cost in FY '17 as we are essentially running on 2 technology platforms. 
Additionally, some efficiencies cannot be fully realized until the ERP platform is totally implemented. As a result, we expect approximately a $25 million step up in operating expense pretax associated with the ERP implementation in 2017. Although we are not providing specific guidance for fiscal 2017 today, we expect that momentum in the underlying business combined with efficiency initiatives should enable us to partially offset this step up in expense. We will provide additional detail around this when we provide fiscal 2017 guidance during our year-end conference call in May. All in all, we are on track for a solid fiscal 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments."

We are proud of our many accomplishments thus far in 2016 especially when I consider the range of initiatives we have before us. Specifically, we are forging ahead with the integration of Animal Health International into Patterson Companies . We are moving forward with the pilot phase of our new ERP system. We are heavily concentrated on the sales front to make the most of the stable to strengthening market environment in front of us, and doing all of this while maintain a the high levels of customer support and service we are known for. Not only are we succeeding, we are accelerating through these challenges and opportunities and focusing on what we do best, which will be critical to achieving our growth goals. 
As we close out the year, I look forward towards 2017, its ultimately the people of Patterson that make us successful and we continue to demonstrate the ability to attract top-tier talent. Recently, we made some key additions to our already strong management team. Doug Jones joined us as President of our companion animal group. Doug comes to us from Maryland North America where he serve as U.S. pet sales and national accounts team and most recently the President of Mariel North America. Doug's exceptional track record speaks for itself and he will play a central role in enhancing our product and service offerings to our animal veterinarians. 
And Kelly Baker came on board as Chief Human Resources Officer. Kelly joined Patterson from General Mills where she most recently served as Vice President of Human Resources for General Mills U.S. retail operating segments. Her depth of experience and talent acquisition and development, and workforce planning will be invaluable as we continue to grow. Looking at our markets. In dental, we believe we are bringing to customers the right combination of product and technical support that will allow us to be the partner of choice for dental operations of all sizes. 
In Animal Health, I'm excited about the unity we have achieved within our team, and at the synergies we are capturing and how we are positioned within both the companion animal and production animal markets. The diversity of end markets in combinations of long-term growth opportunities and catalysts will be critical to us in the years ahead. Finally, we remain committed to our three-pronged capital allocation strategy and believe that our ability to propel the dividend and share repurchases while continuing to invest in the business reflects the strong financial platform we have built.

A very strong performance across our whole digital portfolio in terms of Kono being panoramic and internal Digital Products as well as really nice growth on the traditional chair unit light, cabinet core equipment growth with multiple partners. So a really nice quarter with A-dec as well as some of our new partners. We did mention that we began training on the Sirona treatment centers, but I would say that, that didn't have a material impact in our results this quarter, but we look at that as a real catalyst to growing the top end of the market going forward. On the CEREC front, I'd say it's sort of 3 things to as we look at the quarter 1. We did have a, I would say may be a small drag coming out of the second quarter. Second quarter was our second largest CEREC quarter in the history of the company and very, very strong on the new user demand. We felt Section 179 passing late, if it impacted any area, it may have had a small impact on the CEREC area. And then as we got into January and we began to send out notices to our CEREC sales force about coming to Minneapolis for some training, that may have slowed down pipeline little bit towards the end of January. So we have a challenge out to our CEREC salespeople and our salespeople in general because we know there's robust demand for CEREC and really feel like the zirconia workflow is a game changer. We've talked for years about the CEREC system just becomes easier and easier to use with the improvements in software. Great material partners have helped on the clinical side. But what zirconia does is it really opens up a whole other customer base in terms of just really meat and potatoes dentistry. So it's very exciting and I think this is just another part of this ongoing CEREC story that we've been such a big part of for 15 years. And we're excited to drive demand with even, as I've said many times, CEREC is sort of the Swiss Army knife of dentistry. And now we just have one more tool in the kit. Moving on to Animal Health. As I said, we experienced similar conditions on the production side. The one thing I would point out is we have a great management team in our Animal Health business and this team is really part of due diligence. They know how to manage cycles very well. So they're managing the business very well through the current cycle. We feel like we're taking share. We're all over the integration plan. We probably see the conditions, Ann mentioned in her comments, potentially 2% to 3% growth in the production side going into fiscal 2017, but a common point that we've talked about in our Investor Day and many other times and I apologize for the long answer, but we're a key part of keeping animals healthy. And the producers are intent on keeping the animals healthy regardless of their profitability swings. So our cyclicality is much less than what our end consumers, producers experience and we're managing the business very well through this period."

You'll also see a little bit of a build in our long-term receivable and that's really some unsold finance contract.

I'll start on just some operational strategy questions and then maybe have Ann finish off. One of the things we stated about, while we feel this is a big investment to really create a modern digital platform for the company. To be able to bill, to take care of not only the customer today, but also the customer of the future, but also make us a much more nimble and flexible company to be able to drive investment in the right place but also drive returns to owners, regardless of what end markets look like. Could not be more pleased with the initial launch. We have, I would say 3 things. One, is we have a very stable system. Two, the fact that we're fully operational in 2 fulfillment centers and personally visiting our facility and seeing that work going on in '15 [indiscernible] myself. I'm excited about the efficiencies there. And then the third good sign is all of our pilot sales branches are seeing sales growth. It's not without a lot of effort by our employees. Anytime you make a major organizational change like this, but we are off to a good start. Maybe I'll have Ann put a little more color at the end of that."

So the total investment in the technology is around $85 million. If we look out in terms of the return on that investment and what we talked about initially, I think Scott talked a lot about that already on his comments. What I would add to that is we have a very detailed plan. Specifically, by business function, by person in terms of what we're expecting in terms of efficiency gains or operating margin expansion opportunities or working capital improvements, we have not quantified those publicly. What I would say in terms of will it be at a full run rate in 2018? I hate to say it depends. But it will depend as we get into full-scale rollout later this summer, how well that goes, right? So if it's going as well as the pilot, we think we can accelerate that and be in a really good position to begin harvesting at the very beginning of 2018. If we hit any umps in the road, it might be a little later into 2018 until we start harvesting some of those synergies. And I think as we get closer, we can provide a little bit more color on how much of that $25 million we think we can mitigate throughout our operational efficiencies next year, and then how much we think we can take out to 2018. So I think we need a little more time orders in our strategic planning cycle right now."

During the third quarter, we focused intently on making the most of the fundamental strengths in both of our businesses and capitalize on the generally favorable market conditions affecting our dental and Animal Health segments. We are pleased with our third quarter results with our broad sales momentum and our execution. 
Since we closed the acquisition of Animal Health International last June, we have made it a high priority to preserve our focus on customer service and sales effectiveness as we move through this critical period of integration. Across our entire organization, I am pleased to say that we have done this and it is paying off. We achieved several additional integration milestones in the fiscal 2016 third quarter.
We made additional progress on the headquarters relocations to our new Animal Health segment and consolidating functions to Greeley, Colorado. We further strengthened what we believe to be the deepest leadership team in the Animal Health industry and we unified our marketing and operations team. Today, we are truly operating as one business with our vendor partners, nearly all of whom have products across the entire Animal Health segment. Certainly, this is an important early integration win. 
Also of note, at the end of the quarter, we moved forward with our first pilot implementations for our next-generation systems initiative. This multiyear initiative will, over time, significantly enhance our efficiency and help drive bottom line performance. To date, we have 6 branches, 2 fulfillment centers and several corporate functions directly involved -- involving more than 1,000 employees on the new system. Overall, these early pilots are going well and I want to acknowledge the invaluable contribution of all Patterson employees involved. 
I personally visited a branch office and fulfillment center as we went live, and was very encourage to see the commitment and determination of our employees first-hand. Let me also thank our new colleagues from Animal Health International, who bring valuable experience having made this system's journey. They have been incredibly helpful to our launch, and we believe their guidance and input will continue to be very valuable as we learn from these early pilots and ultimately extend the implementation across our entire organization. 
Looking now at our markets. The stable to steadily improving conditions we have experienced in the past several quarters largely continued in quarter 3. Both segments of our business are sound underlying dynamics, which served as tailwinds for our dental and companion animal businesses. Improving employment levels and consumer spending continue to benefit both dental service utilization and spending on pets. 
On the production animal side, the end market conditions we witnessed in the second quarter largely continued in quarter 3. By combining our new production animal strength with our companion animal leadership, we have clearly created the markets most formidable Animal Health platform. Moreover, we've positioned Patterson to benefit from a new growth catalyst, the ever-increasing global demand for animal protein.
Now looking at our results for the quarter. We turned in a strong performance. Consolidated sales from continuing operations rose 48% on a constant currency basis to $1.4 billion, reflecting the Animal Health International acquisition. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations rose 39% to $0.68 per diluted share. 
Let's examine our 2 segments starting with dental. U.S. dental market fundamentals were healthy during the quarter, and we executed well. Sales from consumables expanded significantly during the period of more than 5% on a constant currency basis. This is also a nice sequential improvement to our increase in the first half of the year and we remain encouraged by the momentum here. 
Sales in our dental equipment category, which can be more variable quarter-to-quarter, posted solid gains. Equipment sales rose 6.8% in constant currency. Technology remains a high priority area for investments of dentists. During the quarter, sales of digital radiography and traditional core equipment were particularly strong although CEREC sales were below our internal expectations for the period. 
However, just this morning, Sirona announce their new CEREC zirconia workflow, which combines CAD/CAM technology support with full contour zirconia material. This exciting new product offering will allow for single visit restorations using its high strength material and we are very enthusiastic about this enhancement to the CEREC platform. We feel confident in saying that the interest in CAD/CAM offerings is building across dental offices of all sizes. 
Today's product announcement once again expands the potential for CEREC chairside single visit dentistry. Our leadership in digital dental technology as well as traditional equipment is driven by a particular philosophy and approach to serving the customer that we believe has growing appeal. In addition to the many advantages this technology can provide dentists helping patients, dental offices of all sizes are increasingly seeking a worry-free approach to leveraging technology into their business. 
We are speaking to you today from the Chicago Dental Society Midwinter Meeting and this technology and equipment partnership is a common and compelling desire among our dental customers. The importance of superior technical support and service infrastructure needed to support this technology cannot be overestimated. Patterson has invested significantly in these resources over the past 15 years, and we believe our service and support infrastructure give us a distinct competitive advantage to serve an ever evolving customer. 
Looking now at traditional equipment. Our quarter 3 performance was particularly strong. For several quarters, we have been describing our goal to build on the important strategic relationship we have with A-dec and improve our ability to address a wider range of customer needs with expanded offerings. Those offerings include new partnerships with Pelton & Crane and the Belmont Co. as well as the new Sirona line of treatment centers and traditional equipment. 
Our results this quarter show that our execution in this area is clearly starting to pay off. Sales of core equipment on a constant currency basis improved double-digits year-over-year. We began training on the Sirona treatment centers last quarter. Customer reactions so far has been enthusiastic. We are confident that these lines will be welcomed additions to what we believe to be the most compelling portfolio of traditional equipment products in the dental community. 
Now let me provide some perspective on this year's extension of Section 179 tax benefits. Naturally, we're pleased to see the extension of these tax benefits for capital purchases made permanent and we believe this certainly helps our customers with capital purchase planning in the years to come. The extension of Section 179 benefits this year came at roughly the same time as last year. So we view our growth and equipment sales in quarter 3 as largely a function of market demand and sales execution rather than tax incentivized purchases. 
Now turning to our Animal Health segment. During the quarter, sales in this segment more than doubled year-over-year on a constant currency basis. As I mentioned earlier, our sales team in this segment has focused on a thorough and timely integration, and these critical efforts are paying off across the entire Animal Health platform. Companion Animal continues to benefit from stable to improving market conditions and favorable pet ownership trends. Sales in the legacy companion animal business, excluding revenue from the acquisition and the impact of the shift in veterinary diagnostic vendor relationships improved 6.2% in constant currency during the quarter. 
U.S. companion animal is particularly strong expanding by more than 11%. I need to emphasize that this growth is a direct result of our efforts to rapidly integrate our companion animal management and sales teams and strong execution. As you have seen in the press release, sales from Animal Health International added nearly $407 million to our Animal Health segment in the quarter. Similar to last quarter, end market pricing and customer profitability across the beef, dairy and swine species remain somewhat soft. These factors are part of production animal market cyclicality and they impacted growth in our production animal business. However, it's important to remember that regardless of market conditions, producers must continue to manage the health of their animals and we play a critical role in helping them achieve this important objective. 
And key to long-term growth, we now possess the foremost animal production business in North America and we are especially pleased at how well we executed in the market, while advancing all the integration activities involved with the acquisition. All in all, we continue to make substantial progress in this all-important first year of integration in our Animal Health segment and are optimistic about the prospects ahead. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials."

As Scott mentioned, we are pleased with the broad sales momentum and execution during our third quarter. Again, on this call, I will discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations focused on the transformed Patterson Compa",1377,"Thank you, Scott. As Scott mentioned, we are pleased with the broad sales momentum and execution during our third quarter. Again, on this call, I will discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations focused on the transformed Patterson Company. Also, bear in mind that today's results reflect the second full quarter of contributions from Animal Health International. So where appropriate, I will refer to organic sales, which strip out the impact of the acquisition to provide a more normalized view of operations. 
Looking at the top line. We reported consolidated sales of $1.4 billion, up 48% on a constant currency basis. Organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis rose 6.2%, excluding the impact from the change in diagnostic manufacturers in our companion animal business. Also, this is up sequentially from 3.3% organic growth in Q2. The effects of foreign currency translation moderated slightly during the quarter. On a consolidated basis, currency translation sales reduced sales by approximately 1.7%. We continue to anticipate that 15% to 20% of our total revenue will come from international sources.
Now let's look at margin. As a reminder, when we announced the acquisition of Animal Health International and the sale of Patterson Medical last year, the central rationale was to gain a broader platform for growth and improve our return on invested capital profile in exchange for some margin dilution. Consolidated operating margins during the third quarter reflected that impact declining 70 basis points. However, with the additional earnings power from Animal Health International, our operating income rose by $28 million to $108 million, up 35% over third quarter last year. 
Organic consolidated operating margin in the third quarter averaged 8.9%. We had another good quarter of operating margin expansion, which involves our dental and Animal Health businesses. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS from continuing operations totaled $0.68. Now let's move on to our segments. In our dental segment, sales rose 5.9% on a constant currency basis. On the same basis, consumables grew more than 5% as we saw solid gains and utilization. Equipment sales were up 6.8% in constant currency, reflecting strength in both core equipment and technology sales. 
While we certainly believe the appetite for technology among practitioners is healthy and expanding, CEREC sales fell short of our internal expectations as Scott noted. However, with the new product innovation and focused promotional offering, we anticipate a stronger CEREC performance in Q4. 
Operating margins increased 15 basis points over the prior year in dental, driven by gross margins. Specifically, earning additional manufacture rebates, which resulted from our efforts to broaden our core equipment portfolio as well as mix. We are on track to deliver operating margin expansion of between 20 and 30 basis points in dental for the full year. 
Now turning to our Animal Health segment. In this discussion, organic sales metrics exclude both the contribution from Animal Health International and the impact of the change in veterinary diagnostic manufacturers. Note that this is the last time we will adjust for this change because it has now been annualized. On a constant currency basis, organic sales in the segment rose more than 6% for the quarter, driven by strength in the U.S. Sales from the legacy U.S. companion animal business expanded 11.3%. This was partially offset by growth of less than 1% in constant currency sales in the U.K. 
The sales contribution from Animal Health International during the period totaled $407 million. With that contribution, sales for the consolidated Patterson Animal Health segment more than doubled from the prior year. As Scott mentioned, the production animal market is currently impacted by some softness across beef and dairy cattle as well as the swine species. We currently expect these conditions to continue into fiscal 2017 with expected revenue growth rates in the 2% to 3% range for this business. 
Operating margin within the Animal Health segment increased by 80 basis points led by improvements in our legacy companion animal business and synergies capture. And we expect operating margins here to continue to expand going forward. For the full year, we continue to anticipate operating margins on an adjusted basis of 4% to 5% in the Animal Health segment as we said previously. We are pleased with our progress in capturing synergies during the quarter. Specifically, we have made strides in several areas, including the integration of our companion animal sales force lowering facility expenses and reducing logistics costs among others. 
Our efforts so far this year demonstrate that we are on track to achieve our stated goal of realizing between $20 million and $30 million in synergies over a 3-year period. 
Now a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. We used $47.5 million of operating cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter versus generating $119.4 million in the prior period. The increase in working capital is due to a few factors. Investment in inventories at our pilot locations in preparation for the new ERP system; inventory build with CEREC units; and purchasing opportunities from our consumable vendors at their year-end. 
Working capital levels should come down over the next few quarters as we work through consolidation activities from the acquisition, stabilize business processes connected to our ERP initiatives and work down the safety stock we use to ensure we would properly serve our customers during our pilot phase. 
As a result, we expect our net income to free cash flow conversion to still be positive for fiscal 2016, but lower than our historical performance. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities. FX in the third quarter totaled $15 million and included investments for normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiative. For the 2016 fiscal year, we are currently estimating CapEx to be approximately $65 million to $75 million. 
In terms of shareholder returns year-to-date we have returned a total of $267 million to our shareholders through a combination of $67 million in dividends and $200 million of share buybacks. 
I'll wrap up this discussion with a few comments on fiscal 2016 guidance. Based on our performance in the first 9 months of fiscal 2016, we are narrowing our adjusted earnings guidance range to $2.42 to $2.48 per diluted share. I'll remind you that this range assumes stable North American and International markets, it includes the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2016 and excludes any impact of additional share repurchases for the balance of the year. 
Our guidance excludes onetime transaction-related costs, integration expense and deal amortization non-returning IP training costs and tax costs related to cash repatriation. Before I turn it back to Scott, a note about our next-generation systems initiative and expense levels going forward. Today, we are actively shipping product on a new system. We are using it across a representative section of Patterson and ultimately, this will lead to new efficiencies and cost savings. 
However, this investment will begin depreciating in fiscal 2017 as we move further into implementation. We are currently in the stabilization phase with our pilot activity and are totally committed to ensuring a smooth transition to the new system. This pilot phase will continue through the end of the fiscal year then move into broader implementation during the late summer or early fall. We have significantly reduced our implementation risk by deploying the new technology gradually throughout our system rather than flipping the switch all at once. But this comes with a cost in FY '17 as we are essentially running on 2 technology platforms. 
Additionally, some efficiencies cannot be fully realized until the ERP platform is totally implemented. As a result, we expect approximately a $25 million step up in operating expense pretax associated with the ERP implementation in 2017. Although we are not providing specific guidance for fiscal 2017 today, we expect that momentum in the underlying business combined with efficiency initiatives should enable us to partially offset this step up in expense. We will provide additional detail around this when we provide fiscal 2017 guidance during our year-end conference call in May. All in all, we are on track for a solid fiscal 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments."

We are proud of our many accomplishments thus far in 2016 especially when I consider the range of initiatives we have before us. Specifically, we are forging ahead with the integration of Animal Health International into Patterson Companies. We are moving forward with the pilot phase of our new ERP system. We are heavily concentrating on the sales front to make the most of the stable to strengthening market environment in front of us, and doing all of this while maintaining the high levels of customer support and service we are known for. Not only are we succeeding, we are accelerating through these challenges and opportunities and focusing on what we do best, which will be critical to achieving our growth goals. 
As we close out the year and look forward towards 2017, its ultimately the people of Patterson that make us successful and we continue to demonstrate the ability to attract top-tier talent. Recently, we made some key additions to our already strong management team. Doug Jones joined us as President of our companion animal group. Doug comes to us from Merial North America where he served as Head of Merial's U.S. Pet Sales and National Accounts team and most recently as President of Merial North America. Doug's exceptional track record speaks for itself and he will play a central role in enhancing our product and service offerings to our companion animal veterinarians. 
And Kelly Baker came on board as Chief Human Resources Officer. Kelly joined Patterson from General Mills, where she most recently served as Vice President of Human Resources for General Mills U.S. Retail Operating Segments. Her depth of experience in talent acquisition and development, and workforce planning will be invaluable as we continue to grow. 
Looking at our markets. In dental, we believe we are bringing to customers the right combination of product and technical support that will allow us to be the partner of choice for dental operations of all sizes. 
In Animal Health, I'm excited about the unity we have achieved within our team, and at the synergies we are capturing and how we are positioned within both the companion animal and production animal markets. The diversity of end markets in combinations of long-term growth opportunities and catalysts will be critical to us in the years ahead. Finally, we remain committed to our three-pronged capital allocation strategy and believe that our ability to propel the dividend and share repurchases while continuing to invest in the business reflects the strong financial platform we have built.

Strong performance in a number of areas in North American dental equipment. A very strong performance across our whole digital portfolio in terms of cone being panoramics and internal Digital Products as well as really nice growth on the traditional chair unit light, cabinet core equipment growth with multiple partners. So a really nice quarter with A-dec as well as some of our new partners. Did mention that we began training on the Sirona treatment centers, but I would say that, that didn't have a material impact in our results in this quarter, but we look at that as a real catalyst to growing that top end of the market going forward. On the CEREC front, I'd say it's sort of 3 things to as we look at the quarter 1. We did have a, I would say, maybe a small drag coming out of second quarter. Second quarter was our second largest CEREC quarter in the history of the company and very, very strong on the new user demand. We felt Section 179 passing late, if it impacted any area of it, it may have had a small impact on the CEREC area. And then as we got into January and we began to send out notices to our CEREC sales force about coming to Minneapolis for some training, that may have slowed down the pipeline a little bit towards the end of January. So we have a challenge out to our CEREC salespeople and our salespeople in general because we know there's robust demand for CEREC and really feel like the zirconia workflow is a game changer. We've talked for years about the CEREC system just becomes easier and easier to use with the improvements in software. Great material partners have helped on the clinical side. But what zirconia does is it really opens up a whole other customer base in terms of just really meat and potatoes dentistry. So it's very exciting and I think this is just another part of this ongoing CEREC story that we've been such a big part of for 15 years. And we're excited to drive demand with even, as I've said many times, CEREC is sort of the Swiss Army knife of dentistry. And now we just have one more tool in the kit. Moving on to Animal Health. As I said, we experienced similar conditions on the production side. The one thing I would point out is we have a great management team in our Animal Health business and this team is really part of due diligence. They know how to manage cycles very well. So they're managing the business very well through the trend cycle. We feel like we're taking share. We're all over the integration plan. We probably see the conditions, Ann mentioned in her comments, potentially 2% to 3% growth on the production side going into fiscal 2017, but a common point that we've talked about in our Investor Day and many other times and I apologize for the long answer, but we're a key part of keeping the animals healthy. And the producers are intent on keeping the animals healthy regardless of their profitability swings. So our cyclicality is much less than what our end consumers, producers experience and we're managing the business very well through this period."

You might recall last quarter, we said we think we can get to the upper end of the range but that would be getting some tailwinds from Section 179, which as Scott noted, we really had no effect and passed it about the same time this year versus last. And then part of the other thing is we had some onetime expenses in the first 2 quarters of the year. We had the health insurance expense with the higher claims experienced in Q2 of about $5 million, and then you might recall we had a bad debt write-off in Q1. So I kind of look at the share repurchases kind of offsetting a couple of unusual items in Q1 and Q2."

So obviously, I would say, sitting here right now, we need more lift out of the sales force. We are spending a lot of time around training. We have the national sales meeting where we spend a lot of time talking about CEREC, but also another piece of this is innovation, and that's where my confidence in Sirona could not be higher and I also believe the combination of Sirona and den supply can be a catalyst towards driving our stated goals further. And something like the zirconia workflow launch really opens up CEREC to pretty much every dentist in North America regardless of their clinical preference, which is a big deal. So I would not couch that goal at all. But it is an aspirational goal. But we feel like this is a product on the verge of a major tipping point."

Two, the fact that we're fully operational in 2 fulfillment centers and personally visiting our South Bend facility and seeing that work going on and picking some orders myself. I'm excited about the efficiencies there. And then the third good sign is all of our pilot sales branches are seeing sales growth. It's not without a lot of effort by our employees.

So the total investment in the technology is around $85 million. If we look out in terms of the return on that investment and what we talked about initially, I think Scott talked a lot about that already in his comments. What I would add to that is we do have a very detailed plan. Specifically, by business function, by person in terms of what we're expecting in terms of efficiency gains or operating margin expansion opportunities or working capital improvements, we have not quantified those publicly. What I would say in terms of will we be at a full run rate in 2018? I hate to say it depends. But it depends. So it will depend as we get into full-scale rollout later this summer, how well that goes, right? So if it's going as well as the pilot, we think we could accelerate that and be in a really good position to begin harvesting at the very beginning of 2018. If we hit any bumps in the road, it might be a little later into 2018 until we start harvesting some of those synergies. And I think as we get closer, we can provide a little bit more color on how much of that $25 million we think we can mitigate through other operational efficiencies next year, and then how much we think we can take out into 2018. So I think we need a little more time. We're just in our strategic planning cycle right now."

During the third quarter, we focused intently on making the most of the fundamental strengths in both of our businesses and capitalize on the generally favorable market conditions affecting our dental and Animal Health segments. We are pleased with our third quarter results with our broad sales momentum and our execution. 
Since we closed the acquisition of Animal Health International last June, we have made it a high priority to preserve our focus on customer service and sales effectiveness as we move through this critical period of integration. Across our entire organization, I am pleased to say that we have done this and it is paying off. We achieved several additional integration milestones in the fiscal 2016 third quarter.
We made additional progress on the headquarters relocations to our new Animal Health segment and consolidating functions to Greeley, Colorado. We further strengthened what we believe to be the deepest leadership team in the Animal Health industry and we unified our marketing and operations team. Today, we are truly operating as one business with our vendor partners, nearly all of whom have products across the entire Animal Health segment. Certainly, this is an important early integration win. 
Also of note, at the end of the quarter, we moved forward with our first pilot implementations for our next-generation systems initiative. This multiyear initiative will, over time, significantly enhance our efficiency and help drive bottom line performance. To date, we have 6 branches, 2 fulfillment centers and several corporate functions directly involved -- involving more than 1,000 employees on the new system. Overall, these early pilots are going well and I want to acknowledge the invaluable contribution of all Patterson employees involved. 
I personally visited a branch office and fulfillment center as we went live, and was very encourage to see the commitment and determination of our employees first-hand. Let me also thank our new colleagues from Animal Health International, who bring valuable experience having made this system's journey. They have been incredibly helpful to our launch, and we believe their guidance and input will continue to be very valuable as we learn from these early pilots and ultimately extend the implementation across our entire organization. 
Looking now at our markets. The stable to steadily improving conditions we have experienced in the past several quarters largely continued in quarter 3. Both segments of our business saw sound underlying dynamics, which served as tailwinds for our dental and companion animal businesses. Improving employment levels and consumer spending continue to benefit both dental service utilization and spending on pets. 
On the production animal side, the end market conditions we witnessed in the second quarter largely continued in quarter 3. By combining our new production animal strength with our companion animal leadership, we have clearly created the markets most formidable Animal Health platform. Moreover, we've positioned Patterson to benefit from a new growth catalyst, the ever-increasing global demand for animal protein.
Now looking at our results for the quarter. We turned in a strong performance. Consolidated sales from continuing operations rose 48% on a constant currency basis to $1.4 billion, reflecting the Animal Health International acquisition. Our adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations rose 39% to $0.68 per diluted share. 
Let's examine our 2 segments starting with dental. U.S. dental market fundamentals were healthy during the quarter, and we executed well. Sales from consumables expanded significantly during the period, up more than 5% on a constant currency basis. This is also a nice sequential improvement to our increase in the first half of the year and we remain encouraged by the momentum here. 
Sales in our dental equipment category, which can be more variable quarter-to-quarter, posted solid gains. Equipment sales rose 6.8% in constant currency. Technology remains a high priority area for investments of dentists. During the quarter, sales of digital radiography and traditional core equipment were particularly strong although CEREC sales were below our internal expectations for the period. 
However, just this morning, Sirona announce their new CEREC zirconia workflow, which combines CAD/CAM technology support with full contour zirconia material. This exciting new product offering will allow for single visit restorations using this high strength material and we are very enthusiastic about this enhancement to the CEREC platform. We feel confident in saying that the interest in CAD/CAM offerings is building across dental offices of all sizes. 
Today's product announcement once again expands the potential for CEREC chairside single visit dentistry. Our leadership in digital dental technology as well as traditional equipment is driven by a particular philosophy and approach to serving the customer that we believe has growing appeal. In addition to the many advantages this technology can provide dentists helping patients, dental offices of all sizes are increasingly seeking a worry-free approach to leveraging technology into their business. 
We are speaking to you today from the Chicago Dental Society Midwinter Meeting and this technology and equipment partnership is a common and compelling desire among our dental customers. The importance of superior technical support and service infrastructure needed to support this technology cannot be overestimated. Patterson has invested significantly in these resources over the past 15 years, and we believe our service and support infrastructure give us a distinct competitive advantage to serve an ever evolving customer. 
Looking now at traditional equipment. Our quarter 3 performance was particularly strong. For several quarters, we have been describing our goal to build on the important strategic relationship we have with A-dec and improve our ability to address a wider range of customer needs with expanded offerings. Those offerings include new partnerships with Pelton & Crane and the Belmont Co. as well as the new Sirona line of treatment centers and traditional equipment. 
Our results this quarter show that our execution in this area is clearly starting to pay off. Sales of core equipment on a constant currency basis improved double-digits year-over-year. We began training on the Sirona treatment centers last quarter. Customer reaction so far has been enthusiastic. We are confident that these lines will be welcomed additions to what we believe to be the most compelling portfolio of traditional equipment products in the dental community. 
Now let me provide some perspective on this year's extension of Section 179 tax benefits. Naturally, we're pleased to see the extension of these tax benefits for capital purchases made permanent and we believe this certainly helps our customers with capital purchase planning in the years to come. The extension of Section 179 benefits this year came at roughly the same time as last year. So we view our growth and equipment sales in quarter 3 as largely a function of market demand and sales execution rather than tax incentivized purchases. 
Now turning to our Animal Health segment. During the quarter, sales in this segment more than doubled year-over-year on a constant currency basis. As I mentioned earlier, our sales team in this segment has focused on a thorough and timely integration, and these critical efforts are paying off across the entire Animal Health platform. Companion Animal continues to benefit from stable to improving market conditions and favorable pet ownership trends. Sales in the legacy companion animal business, excluding revenue from the acquisition and the impact of the shift in veterinary diagnostic vendor relationships improved 6.2% in constant currency during the quarter. 
U.S. companion animal is particularly strong expanding by more than 11%. I need to emphasize that this growth is a direct result of our efforts to rapidly integrate our companion animal management and sales teams and strong execution. As you have seen in the press release, sales from Animal Health International added nearly $407 million to our Animal Health segment in the quarter. Similar to last quarter, end market pricing and customer profitability across the beef, dairy and swine species remain somewhat soft. These factors are part of production animal market cyclicality and they impacted growth in our production animal business. However, it's important to remember that regardless of market conditions, producers must continue to manage the health of their animals and we play a critical role in helping them achieve this important objective. 
And key to long-term growth, we now possess the foremost animal production business in North America and we are especially pleased at how well we executed in the market, while advancing all the integration activities involved with the acquisition. All in all, we continue to make substantial progress in this all-important first year of integration in our Animal Health segment and are optimistic about the prospects ahead. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials."
320186,325491320,941076,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. As Scott mentioned, we are pleased with the broad sales momentum and execution during our third quarter. Again, on this call, I will discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations focused on the transformed Patterson Compa",1377,"Thank you, Scott. As Scott mentioned, we are pleased with the broad sales momentum and execution during our third quarter. Again, on this call, I will discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations focused on the transformed Patterson Company. Also, bear in mind that today's results reflect the second full quarter of contributions from Animal Health International. So where appropriate, I will refer to organic sales, which strip out the impact of the acquisition to provide a more normalized view of operations. 
Looking at the top line. We reported consolidated sales of $1.4 billion, up 48% on a constant currency basis. Organic revenue growth on a constant currency basis rose 6.2%, excluding the impact from the change in diagnostic manufacturers in our companion animal business. Also, this is up sequentially from 3.3% organic growth in Q2. The effects of foreign currency translation moderated slightly during the quarter. On a consolidated basis, currency translation sales reduced sales by approximately 1.7%. We continue to anticipate that 15% to 20% of our total revenue will come from international sources.
Now let's look at margins. As a reminder, when we announced the acquisition of Animal Health International and the sale of Patterson Medical last year, the central rationale was to gain a broader platform for growth and improve our return on invested capital profile in exchange for some margin dilution. Consolidated operating margins during the third quarter reflected that impact declining 70 basis points. However, with the additional earnings power from Animal Health International, our operating income rose by $28 million to $108 million, up 35% over third quarter last year. 
Organic consolidated operating margin in the third quarter averaged 8.9%. We had another good quarter of operating margin expansion within both our dental and Animal Health businesses. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS from continuing operations totaled $0.68. Now let's move on to our segments. In our dental segment, sales rose 5.9% on a constant currency basis. On the same basis, consumables grew more than 5% as we saw solid gains in utilization. Equipment sales were up 6.8% in constant currency, reflecting strength in both core equipment and technology sales. 
While we certainly believe the appetite for technology among practitioners is healthy and expanding, CEREC sales fell short of our internal expectations as Scott noted. However, with the new product innovation and focused promotional offerings, we anticipate a stronger CEREC performance in Q4. 
Operating margins increased 15 basis points over the prior year in dental, driven by gross margins. Specifically, earning additional manufacture rebates, which resulted from our efforts to broaden our core equipment portfolio as well as mix. We are on track to deliver operating margin expansion of between 20 and 30 basis points in dental for the full year. 
Now turning to our Animal Health segment. In this discussion, organic sales metrics exclude both the contribution from Animal Health International and the impact of the change in veterinary diagnostic manufacturers. Note that this is the last time we will adjust for this change because it has now been annualized. On a constant currency basis, organic sales in the segment rose more than 6% for the quarter, driven by strength in the U.S. Sales from the legacy U.S. companion animal business expanded 11.3%. This was partially offset by growth of less than 1% in constant currency sales in the U.K. 
The sales contribution from Animal Health International during the period totaled $407 million. With that contribution, sales for the consolidated Patterson Animal Health segment more than doubled from the prior year. As Scott mentioned, the production animal market is currently impacted by some softness across beef and dairy cattle as well as the swine species. We currently expect these conditions to continue into fiscal 2017 with expected revenue growth rates in the 2% to 3% range for this business. 
Operating margin within the Animal Health segment increased by 80 basis points led by improvements in our legacy companion animal business and synergies capture. And we expect operating margins here to continue to expand going forward. For the full year, we continue to anticipate operating margins on an adjusted basis of 4% to 5% in the Animal Health segment as we said previously. We are pleased with our progress in capturing synergies during the quarter. Specifically, we have made strides in several areas, including the integration of our companion animal sales force lowering facility expenses and reducing logistics costs among others. 
Our efforts so far this year demonstrate that we are on track to achieve our stated goal of realizing between $20 million and $30 million in synergies over a 3-year period. 
Now a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. We used $47.5 million of operating cash flow from continuing operations in the quarter versus generating $119.4 million in the prior period. The increase in working capital is due to a few factors. Investment in inventories at our pilot locations in preparation for the new ERP system; inventory build with CEREC units; and purchasing opportunities from our consumable vendors at their year-end. 
Working capital levels should come down over the next few quarters as we work through consolidation activities from the acquisition, stabilize business processes connected to our ERP initiatives and work down the safety stock we use to ensure we would properly serve our customers during our pilot phase. 
As a result, we expect our net income to free cash flow conversion to still be positive for fiscal 2016, but lower than our historical performance. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns on our business investments and growth opportunities. CapEx in the third quarter totaled $15 million and included investments for normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiative. For the 2016 fiscal year, we are currently estimating CapEx to be approximately $65 million to $75 million. 
In terms of shareholder returns year-to-date we have returned a total of $267 million to our shareholders through a combination of $67 million in dividends and $200 million of share buybacks. 
I'll wrap up this discussion with a few comments on fiscal 2016 guidance. Based on our performance in the first 9 months of fiscal 2016, we are narrowing our adjusted earnings guidance range to $2.42 to $2.48 per diluted share. I'll remind you that this range assumes stable North American and International markets, it includes the impact of an extra week in fiscal 2016 and excludes any impact of additional share repurchases for the balance of the year. 
Our guidance excludes onetime transaction-related costs, integration expense and deal amortization, non-recurring IT training costs and tax costs related to cash repatriation. Before I turn it back to Scott, a note about our next-generation systems initiative and expense levels going forward. Today, we are actively shipping product on a new system. We are using it across a representative section of Patterson and ultimately, this will lead to new efficiencies and cost savings. 
However, this investment will begin depreciating in fiscal 2017 as we move further into implementation. We are currently in the stabilization phase with our pilot activity and are totally committed to ensuring a smooth transition to the new system. This pilot phase will continue through the end of the fiscal year then move into broader implementation during the late summer or early fall. We have significantly reduced our implementation risk by deploying the new technology gradually throughout our system rather than flipping the switch all at once. But this comes with a cost in FY '17 as we are essentially running on 2 technology platforms. 
Additionally, some efficiencies cannot be fully realized until the ERP platform is totally implemented. As a result, we expect approximately a $25 million step up in operating expense pretax associated with the ERP implementation in 2017. Although we are not providing specific guidance for fiscal 2017 today, we expect that momentum in the underlying business combined with efficiency initiatives should enable us to partially offset this step up in expense. We will provide additional detail around this when we provide fiscal 2017 guidance during our year-end conference call in May. All in all, we are on track for a solid fiscal 2016. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments."

We are proud of our many accomplishments thus far in 2016 especially when I consider the range of initiatives we have before us. Specifically, we are forging ahead with the integration of Animal Health International into Patterson Companies. We are moving forward with the pilot phase of our new ERP system. We are heavily concentrating on the sales front to make the most of the stable to strengthening market environment in front of us, and doing all of this while maintaining the high levels of customer support and service we are known for. Not only are we succeeding, we are accelerating through these challenges and opportunities and focusing on what we do best, which will be critical to achieving our growth goals. 
As we close out the year and look forward towards 2017, its ultimately the people of Patterson that make us successful and we continue to demonstrate the ability to attract top-tier talent. Recently, we made some key additions to our already strong management team. Doug Jones joined us as President of our companion animal group. Doug comes to us from Merial North America where he served as Head of Merial's U.S. Pet Sales and National Accounts team and most recently as President of Merial North America. Doug's exceptional track record speaks for itself and he will play a central role in enhancing our product and service offerings to our companion animal veterinarians. 
And Kelly Baker came on board as Chief Human Resources Officer. Kelly joined Patterson from General Mills, where she most recently served as Vice President of Human Resources for General Mills U.S. Retail Operating Segments. Her depth of experience in talent acquisition and development, and workforce planning will be invaluable as we continue to grow. 
Looking at our markets. In dental, we believe we are bringing to customers the right combination of product and technical support that will allow us to be the partner of choice for dental operations of all sizes. 
In Animal Health, I'm excited about the unity we have achieved within our team, and at the synergies we are capturing and how we are positioned within both the companion animal and production animal markets. The diversity of end markets in combinations of long-term growth opportunities and catalysts will be critical to us in the years ahead. Finally, we remain committed to our three-pronged capital allocation strategy and believe that our ability to propel the dividend and share repurchases while continuing to invest in the business reflects the strong financial platform we have built. 
Now we'd like to take questions. I'll turn the call back over to Jason."

Strong performance in a number of areas in North American dental equipment. A very strong performance across our whole digital portfolio in terms of cone beam panoramics and intraoral digital products as well as really nice growth on the traditional chair unit, light, cabinet, core equipment growth with multiple partners. So a really nice quarter with A-dec as well as some of our new partners. Did mention that we began training on the Sirona treatment centers, but I would say that, that didn't have a material impact in our results in this quarter, but we look at that as a real catalyst to growing that top end of the market going forward. 
On the CEREC front, I'd say it's sort of 3 things to -- as we look at the quarter; 1, we did have a, I would say, maybe a small drag coming out of second quarter. Second quarter was our second largest CEREC quarter in the history of the company and very, very strong on the new user demand. We felt Section 179 passing late, if it impacted any area, it may have had a small impact on the CEREC area. And then as we got into January and we began to send out notices to our CEREC sales force about coming to Minneapolis for some training, that may have slowed down the pipeline a little bit towards the end of January. So we have a challenge out to our CEREC salespeople and our salespeople in general because we know there's robust demand for CEREC and really feel like the zirconia workflow is a game changer. We've talked for years about the CEREC system just becomes easier and easier to use with the improvements in software. Great material partners have helped on the clinical side. But what zirconia does is it really opens up a whole other customer base in terms of just really meat and potatoes dentistry. So it's very exciting and I think this is just another part of this ongoing CEREC story that we've been such a big part of for 15 years. And we're excited to drive demand with even -- as I've said many times, CEREC is sort of the Swiss Army knife of dentistry. And now we just have one more tool in the kit. 
Moving on to Animal Health. As I said, we experienced similar conditions on the production side. The one thing I would point out is we have a great management team in our Animal Health business and this team -- and it was really part of due diligence. They know how to manage cycles very well. So they're managing the business very well through the current cycle. We feel like we're taking share. We're all over the integration plan. We probably see the conditions -- Ann mentioned in her comments, potentially 2% to 3% growth on the production side going into fiscal 2017, but a common point that we've talked about in our Investor Day and many other times and I apologize for the long answer, but we're a key part of keeping the animals healthy. And the producers are intent on keeping the animals healthy regardless of their profitability swings. So our cyclicality is much less than what our end consumers, producers experience and we're managing the business very well through this period."

Part of it is the CEREC build, just due to the sales performance in the current year, we had built higher inventory levels up at the end of the second quarter and into the third quarter expecting a better performance. And then the third area is just as we consolidate warehouses in the Animal Health space, we just kept a little bit of a build in inventory there to maintain service levels as we're bringing one facility up and another down. You'll also see a little bit of a build in our long-term receivables and that's really some unsold finance contracts. That's really a timing issue, but does have to do with the business process transition to shared services for accounts receivable, collections and processing, and that is part of the SAP implementation as well. So we'll be able to bring those levels down over time. But it's going to take us a couple of quarters. So I think we'll be positive in Q4, but not to the same extent as last year."

And then part of the other thing is we had some onetime expenses in the first 2 quarters of the year. We had the health insurance expense with the higher claims experienced in Q2 of about $5 million, and then you might recall we had a bad debt write-off in Q1. So I kind of look at the share repurchase as kind of offsetting a couple of unusual items in Q1 and Q2."

We have the national sales meeting where we spend a lot of time talking about CEREC, but also another piece of this is innovation, and that's where my confidence in Sirona could not be higher and I also believe the combination of Sirona and den supply can be a catalyst towards driving our stated goals further. And something like the zirconia workflow launch really opens up CEREC to pretty much every dentist in North America regardless of their clinical preference, which is a big deal. So I would not couch that goal at all. But it is an aspirational goal. But we feel like this is a product on the verge of a major tipping point."

I'm excited about the efficiencies there. And then the third good sign is all of our pilot sales branches are seeing sales growth.

Specifically, by business function, by person in terms of what we're expecting in terms of efficiency gains or operating margin expansion opportunities or working capital improvements, we have not quantified those publicly. What I would say in terms of will we be at a full run rate in 2018? I hate to say it depends, but it depends. So it will depend as we get into full-scale rollout later this summer, how well that goes, right? So if it's going as well as the pilot, we think we could accelerate that and be in a really good position to begin harvesting at the very beginning of 2018. If we hit any bumps in the road, it might be a little later into 2018 until we start harvesting some of those synergies. And I think as we get closer, we can provide a little bit more color on how much of that $25 million we think we can mitigate through other operational efficiencies next year, and then how much we think we can take out into 2018. So I think we need a little more time. We're just in our strategic planning cycle right now."

I'd like to begin my remarks by discussing where Patterson Companies is today from a strategic standpoint, highlight the journey we are on and put our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 into some important perspectives. 
As we concluded fiscal 2015 a year ago and embarked been fiscal 2016, we set out on a path to transform Patterson Companies for a future of more sustainable and profitable growth. Our path to where we are today and where we are going is thoughtful, well planned and multidimensional. We know that to fully realize our ambitions, it will require strategies designed to transform Patterson in multiple ways. It involves ensuring that we are technologically-advanced to not only serve the customers of today and tomorrow, but to take Patterson to increasing levels of efficiency; fundamentally repositioning our portfolio of businesses around stronger long-term growth markets and go-to-market approaches that are highly compatible; closely scrutinizing our existing operations as part of our portfolio evaluation to make sure we are fully optimized and positioned for the future, even in areas where we believe we are traditionally very strong; and lastly, ensuring that as we drive this change, we preserve and enhance the high performance culture that has made Patterson a leader and employer of choice. In our 140 years as a company, Patterson has seen its fair share of market changes and has always stepped up to lead our chosen markets. 
Fiscal 2016 was arguably one of the most ambitious years of large-scale change we have undertaken in our nearly century and a half. We took our initial transformational steps during the fiscal year, beginning with the refocusing of our portfolio on 2 highly compatible growth-focused businesses and consummating the largest transaction in our history. We move forward with the pilot of our new ERP system, which we believe will lead to a whole new levels of operational effectiveness. We made significant strides in integrating our new Animal Health platform, which is roughly 50% of our business and capturing the synergies we committed to this fiscal year, all while preserving our cultural strengths and we strengthened our leadership, attracting seasoned high-level executives to our bench and balancing our management team with both inside and outside perspective. 
Given the scope and sophistication of the initiatives we are pursuing and pressured top line performance in some areas, I am pleased to report that we were able to finish the year strong on the bottom line. Consolidated sales from continuing operations rose nearly 42% on a constant currency basis to $1.5 billion, reflecting the Animal Health International acquisition. And we ended the year with adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.47. Looking at our markets. Conditions are roughly unchanged compared to the last quarter, but there were some subtle changes in the complexion in our end markets during the fourth quarter that are worth noting. In Dental, we continue to see relative, stable to steadily improving conditions. Looking at market segment conditions affecting our Animal Health segment, the Companion Animal market, like Dental continued to show stable to steadily improving characteristics. Certainly, the milder winter conditions provided some tailwind in our third quarter. However, the cooler damper spring conditions we experienced in our Q4 especially in the Northeast in the United States weighed on sales of certain products. We remain confident in the prevailing market conditions that reflect solid employment levels and consumer resilience. 
Performance in production animal continues to reflect softness in the livestock industry, especially in dairy and beef cattle markets. We are beginning to see some signs of end market improvement especially in the swine market. This is part of the cyclicality of the livestock market and we anticipate gradual improvement as we head over to fiscal 2017. Against this backdrop, I'll now provide some insights in the segment performance starting with Dental. While we are generally pleased with the bottom line results within Dental for the quarter, our sales performance was mixed, even in spite of the tough comparable and fell short of our internal expectations. Sales of consumables were generally in line with market and with the exception of our fiscal 2016 third quarter consistent with sales performance trends over the past several quarters. 
The sales performance and equipment, Digital Equipment more specifically is where we were more challenged and also were faced with the toughest comparable. Overall, equipment sales fell 6.9% in constant currency, driven by lower digital X-ray equipment sales. In some ways, we believe these results are a function of our own success. These intraoral digital technologies have penetrated approximately 70% to 80% of the market and Patterson Dental is donned as the largest market share. Going forward we see many opportunities across our digital platforms, particularly for Colombian technologies. 
As I stated last quarter, the importance of properly supporting these technology investments is critical today and we'll only beat them as we move forward and dental offices become even more digitized, providing support, which help makes technology investments worry-free for the practitioner so they can focus on patient care, which will be an increasingly important differentiator for Patterson in the future. Dental offices that are embracing digital dentistry are looking for partners that can make integrating these technologies into their practice environment and supporting them seamless. This means investing in and delivering best-in-class training programs and highly effective technical back end support. The Patterson Companies center provides our customers with the length of that seamless experience. 
The PPC is currently supporting over 100,000 end product users both in the dental and veterinary businesses. They took more than 1 million customer interactions annually or about 5,000 daily from current practitioners who have placed a premium on the digital backbone of their practices. We fully expect the volume and value of these services to grow. Turning now to core equipment. Sales were largely flat and in line with our internal expectations. Throughout fiscal 2016, we proved our ability to enrich our basic equipment portfolio in a way that gives us a more sustainable long-term platform for future growth. A-dec has been and remains a very important partner to us and we have a strong year with them. 
Our broader manufacturer relationships, which included the new additions of Pelton & Crane, Belmont and the Sirona line of treatment centers, helps us to be more flexible and support the needs of a wider range of customers. Looking now at CEREC sales. Our momentum in this category was very strong in the fourth quarter. Even in spite of the difficult year-over-year comparables, CEREC sales hit record levels. Clearly, there is tremendous enthusiasm for Sirona's new zirconia workflow for CEREC and we capitalize on this recent production. The zirconia workflow combines CAD/CAM technology support with full contours of zirconia material. The prospects of adding high strengths zirconia materials to single visit restorations has created fresh interest in and demand for chairside restorations, and we do not see this abating. If there's any source of a disappointment within CEREC sales for the full year, that would be in the smaller pace of trade ups. However, as we have said in the past, this is a testament to the strength of the Sirona platforms and the high-level of customer satisfaction with their products and our support infrastructure. 
As we move forward, our focus will be on expanding its new customer segments, seeking fresh opportunities to gain more reach and intensifying our focus on sales execution. Turning now to Animal Health segment. During the quarter, we posted solid top and bottom line results in both Companion Animal and Production Animal that were in line with expectations and reflect current end market dynamics. We need to keep in mind that while production animal market cyclicality can prompt producers to adjust herd size, producers must continue to manage the health of their animals regardless of market conditions and we are the market leaders in helping them achieve this important objective. 
As we head into fiscal 2017, we anticipate improvements in producer level economics as animal pricing strengthens and producers look to increase breeding activity especially in beef cattle. This quarter, in addition to favorable performance in our U.S. Companion Animal business, we saw encouraging growth once again, out of our U.K. division NVS. Sales in our Companion Animal business grew 8.2% in constant currency during the quarter. Sales growth at NVS, our U.K. division, added 5% on the same basis. We remain very impressed with the management team and team at NVS. Their commitment execution keeps us optimistic with the momentum in their business. 
Sales from the acquisition contributed an additional $404 million to our Animal Health segment in the fourth quarter. Naturally, our ongoing integration efforts in our Animal Health segment, our intense focus and we continue to concentrate on both operational refinement and sales execution across our entire platform. In terms of synergy capture. Today, our sales, marketing and operations support functions are fully integrated and we are presenting one voice to the industry. We are fully rationalized, all the core functions within Animal Health and now can move against optimizing our distribution footprint. I am very pleased with assertive and positive approach the entire team has taken on this. 
We recently completed strategic planning sessions for Animal Health segment, and it's encouraging to see such an intense focus on the customer and open sharing of ideas to better propel the business. This dynamic, coupled with our success thus far in capturing synergies, gives us optimism that we can further build on the strong leadership position we already have. 
With that I'll ask Ann to review the financials."

During the quarter, these effor",1658,"Thank you, Scott. As Scott mentioned, our efforts to improve our operational discipline paid off during our fourth quarter and will continue to play an important role as we move forward toward sustained profitable growth. 
During the quarter, these efforts were clearly reflected across a number of metrics, such as operating margin expansion, improvement in working capital levels and of course, our bottom line. We are pleased to have met our annual guidance range for adjusted EPS from continuing operations for a second consecutive year. As we've done in the past, I will again discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to focus on our current portfolio of businesses. 
This past quarter was the third full quarter of contribution from Animal Health International, so where appropriate, I will highlight organic sales, which strip out the contribution from the acquisition, currency effects and the change in selling arrangements from [indiscernible] to provide a more normalized view of the results. Let's start with the top line. Consolidated sales for the quarter totaled $1.5 billion, up nearly 42% on a constant currency basis. Organic revenue growth rose 1.6%. Again, for this quarter, the impact of currency translation moderated slightly. 
On a consolidated basis, currency translation reduced sales by approximately 1.1%, which is down sequentially from 1.7% last quarter. We continue to anticipate that between 15% to 20% of our total revenue will come from international sources. Turning now to margins. When examining margins, it's helpful to keep in mind that the core rationale for our portfolio move over the last -- past year was to begin to build platforms for long-term growth and return on invested capital in exchange for some margin dilution. Consolidated operating margin during the fourth quarter reflected that impact, declining 80 basis points. However, with the additional earnings contribution from Animal Health International, our operating income tops $119 million, up 28% over the prior year. 
The fourth quarter was solid in terms of operating margin expansion in both our dental and legacy Companion Animal businesses, reflecting a range of factors from changes in product mix, synergy capture and improved operational discipline. Finally on the bottom line, we posted quarterly adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $0.77 per diluted share. Now let's move on to our segments. In Dental, they are essentially flat on a constant currency basis in the quarter. On that same basis, consumable sales were up 3.3% growing slightly faster than the end markets in the categories we serve. As Scott mentioned, equipment sales were mixed and we had a large year-over-year sales comparable to overcome, 23.3% growth in last year's Q4. Overall, equipment sales declined 6.9% in constant currency on that tough comparable. The decline mainly reflects lower digital X-ray sales both in terms of volume and lower price point offerings. 
As we discussed during our call last quarter, we expected new product innovation and focused promotional offerings to enhance our Q4 CEREC sales, and we are very pleased with our performance this quarter. CEREC sales were up low to mid-single digits, reaching an all-time quarterly high. Dental operating margins rose more than 50 basis points over the prior year. Again, this improvement was largely due to a blend of factors, including mix and operational effectiveness. Last quarter, we had forecasted that we were on track to deliver operating margin expansion between 20 and 30 basis points in Dental for the full fiscal year. We ended the year with 26 basis points of improvement, right in the middle of our range. 
Now turning to our Animal Health segment. For the sake of clarity in this discussion, organic sales metrics exclude the contributions from acquisition and currency, but includes the benefit of the change in selling arrangement for certain products from agencies to. Please note that this change will continue to impact sales results going forward. Organic sales in this segment rose 8.2% for the quarter, driven by solid sales performance in both the U.S. and the U.K. Specifically, sales from the legacy U.S. Companion Animal business were up 10.5% and U.K. sales grew by 5% in constant currency. U.S. sales reflected that change in selling arrangements, which added 2 to 3 percentage points of growth to consolidated Animal Health results. 
The sales contribution from the acquisition during the period totaled roughly $404 million. With that contribution, sales for the consolidated Animal Health segment more than doubled from the prior year. The production animal market continues to be impacted by softness in some markets, particularly beef and dairy cattle. We anticipate some end market strengthening as we move into fiscal 2017 especially in the back half of the fiscal year. Operating margins, excluding the acquisition and our legacy Companion Animal business, improved nearly 50 basis points, primarily reflecting higher sales levels and synergies. After factoring in the acquisition, consolidated operating margin within the Animal Health segment increased nearly 10 basis points. 
We expect operating margins to continue to expand going forward. For the full year, we had forecasted operating margins on an adjusted basis of 4% to 5% in this segment. Adjusted operating margins rose 24 basis points to 4.6%, which is right in the range. Regarding synergies. We make good progress and we estimate that our synergy capture came in on target for the year. Our synergy focus since fiscal 2016 was on the integration of our Companion Animal sales forces, reducing our facility expenses and lowering logistics cost. Moving into fiscal 2017. Our focus will turn to more effectively leveraging our supply chain across both of our businesses and further consolidation of our back-office functions. We remain on track to achieve our stated goal of capturing between $20 million and $30 million in annualized synergies over a 3-year period. Now a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. 
Last quarter, we said that working capital levels should come down over the next few quarters and we finished the year strong. During the quarter, we more effectively managed working capital and generated solid cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was over $242 million in Q4, improvement over the first 9 months of the year. For the full fiscal year, we generated cash flow from operations of about $195 million compared to $205 million during the last fiscal year. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns in our business and expect to return to converting between 85% and 100% of net income into free cash flow in fiscal 2017. 
CapEx totaled $22 million in Q4 and included investments for normal replacements as well as our corporatewide information technology initiative. For the 2015 fiscal year, total CapEx came in at $79 million. A quick look at tax rate. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.3%. While we did see some benefits during the quarter from a contingency reserve, for the full year, our adjusted tax rate was unchanged compared to fiscal 2015. Looking ahead, we anticipate an uptick in the rate next year at around 35%. 
In terms of shareholder return. Year-to-date, we have returned a total of $291 million to our shareholders through a combination of $91 million in dividends and $200 million of share buybacks. I'll wrap up with a discussion of our fiscal 2017 guidance. First, I'd like to echo Scott. Patterson is in midstream in the process of repositioning itself for larger growth goals ahead. In fiscal 2017, we will continue to move through a period of intense execution on a range of initiatives that we believe are critical to top and bottom line expansion. It is also helpful to consider the market dynamics we expect to face. 
As we head into fiscal 2017, we currently expect the Dental market to continue growing at a pace of 2% to 3%. In Companion Animal, we anticipate 4% to 5% market growth, and in Production Animal, we are expecting underlying market growth of roughly 2%. The guidance range we are providing today does include as we began to discuss last quarter, our pretax $25 million step up in operating expense associated with the ERP implementation. As we explained, this investment will start depreciating as we move further into broader implementation during the fall. During this period, we will essentially be running redundant systems to help ensure a seamless transition to our new platform. This step up in expense, which will begin in the late fall includes cost of depreciation, rollouts and infrastructure support. 
We believe our new ERP platform will lead to new efficiencies. However, some of them cannot be realized until the platform is fully implemented. That said, we believe we have a sound process in place for migrating to our new system in a way that ensures business continuity, and high levels of customer support and leads to significant future efficiencies once the transition is complete. I'd also like to provide some framework on operating margin expectation. For fiscal year 2017, we expect consolidated operating margins to be flat to down slightly after absorbing the $25 million step up in ERP expenses, the majority of which will be allocated back to our business segments. 
In Dental, we are targeting our operating margins between 13% and 13.5%. And for Animal Health, we expect operating margins to be flat with fiscal 2016. With all of this in mind, we are establishing our fiscal 2017 guidance range for adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations at $2.60 to $2.70 per share. Our guidance range assumes stable North American and International markets, and excludes the following: the impact of additional share repurchases, new acquisitions and transaction-related costs, integration and business restructuring expense, and deal amortization. Lastly, we anticipate that the additional earnings per share that we expect to generate in fiscal 2017 will be relatively evenly distributed across the fourth quarter -- across the 4 quarters. 
With that, I will turn it back to Scott for some further comments."

As I mentioned at the beginning of our call, Patterson will celebrate 140 years as a company in fiscal 2017. We have achieved countless milestones in that time and intend to reach many more as we move ahead. In fiscal 2016, we topped $5 billion in annual sales for the first time. We're confident we met our first year synergy goals for the integration in our Animal Health segment. Last quarter, we began the first pilot implementations for our next-generation systems initiative. This involves 6 branches, 2 fulfillment centers, and several corporate functions directly involving more than 1,000 employees. The volumes in these branches are testing well and we continue to refine this system weekly. 
I believe we will -- are well on our way to establishing a stable, modern, scalable ERP platform that will better allow us to succeed in any growth environment. In Dental, we are bullish on the opportunities that lie ahead. We have built a product and technical competency in dental that I believe will provide system differentiation and value for customers, especially those who strive to transform their patient experiences. However, we need to find ways to be more effectively shape our approach to today's market and better address the needs of our customers. And in Animal Health, we are headed towards completing our first full year after adding Animal Health International to the Patterson family. 
We can clearly see when you compare the customer profile and their needs across both of our business segments that our customer profiles are evolving towards small, midsized and large customer categories. Each has unique needs and different step needs for value and our business model is well suited to address all of them. Finally, we remain committed to our three-pronged capital allocation strategy. We believe there are more acquisition opportunities out there that can allow us to build on the platform we have created in a capital efficient way. We will continue to explore these opportunities along with supporting our dividend and share repurchases. 
Now we'd like to take your questions. I'll turn the call back over to Leanne."

In fact, our entire equipment sales forces in the process of being trained on these products at A-dec's factories in Oregon.

I would say that we were disappointed as we looked at our third quarter, which is the calendar fourth quarter that the Section 179 issue did not get resolved.

I would say there's still is a segment of our customer base that uses film and probably use film until they retire. But I don't want to have anyone think that there is not growth opportunity here because you'll see manufacturers innovate. You'll see process get better and the digital workflow will be a huge part of the modern practice."

Thanks, John. I'll talk to some of the early feedback on zirconia. I think this is a story that's going to slide out over the long-term and we take a long-term perspective on this relationship, having been doing it for well over a decade. The initial feedback is the zirconia really opened up doors once again for a large segment of the dental population to look at CEREC again. And we always get excited when the innovation curve allows us to do that because many times, the impression of CEREC may be -- a dentist, if you look at the product 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago. So we have a lot of activity. Very pleased -- I would say, if there was a risk going into the fourth quarter when you have a new product launch, you have to train everyone up, and you have to get the supply chain right and get the products in the right spot to serve the demand. There's a lot of risk in that side. But I could not be more pleased with our dental team and how they particularly our focus in the field and the branches, on how they met that demand for the customer. So what generally historically, summer can be a quieter period of time. I think we'll have a lot of interaction with customers over the summer about zirconia.

So certainly, we saw good reductions in our investment and working capital both in inventory and long-term receivables, certainly CEREC was a portion of that and inventory in total, came down nicely about $90 million. I think there's still room to improve in terms of working capital in total, as we move into FY '17, I think there's room to improve upon that.

About 25% is rollout and implementation costs, so that's the piece that you can think about that would go away right in the back half of '18 as we complete the rollout.

I think when you think about 2018 and how much comes out, we expect to see some benefits in the back half of '18 because the training and implementation is done. You're fully up and running, and so now you can turn off the legacy systems, and you can also now clearly harness the benefits of the new system, but I'm not ready to really publicly quantify dollar at this time.

I'd like to begin my remarks by discussing where Patterson Companies is today from a strategic standpoint, highlight the journey we are on and put our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 into some important perspectives. 
As we concluded fiscal 2015 a year ago and embarked on fiscal 2016, we set out on a path to transform Patterson Companies for a future of more sustainable, profitable growth. Our path to where we are today and where we are going is thoughtful, well planned and multidimensional. We know that to fully realize our ambitions, it will require strategies designed to transform Patterson in multiple ways. It involves ensuring that we are technologically advanced to not only serve the customers of today and tomorrow but to take Patterson to increasing levels of efficiency; fundamentally repositioning our portfolio of businesses around stronger, long-term growth markets and go-to-market approaches that are highly compatible; closely scrutinizing our existing operations as part of our portfolio evaluation to make sure we are fully optimized and positioned for the future, even in areas where we believe we are traditionally very strong; and lastly, ensuring that as we drive this change, we preserve and enhance the high-performance culture that has made Patterson a leader and employer of choice. In our 140 years as a company, Patterson has seen its fair share of market changes and has always stepped up to lead our chosen markets. 
Fiscal 2016 was arguably one of the most ambitious years of large-scale change we have undertaken in our nearly 1.5 centuries. We took our initial transformational steps during the fiscal year, beginning with the refocusing of our portfolio on 2 highly compatible, growth-focused businesses and consummating the largest transaction in our history. We moved forward with the pilot of our new ERP system, which we believe will lead to a whole new levels of operational effectiveness. We made significant strides in integrating our new Animal Health platform, which is roughly 50% of our business, and capturing the synergies we committed to this fiscal year, all while preserving our cultural strengths. And we strengthened our leadership, attracting seasoned, high-level executives to our bench and balancing our management team with both inside and outside perspective. 
Given the scope and sophistication of the initiatives we are pursuing and pressured top line performance in some areas, I'm pleased to report that we were able to finish the year strong on the bottom line. Consolidated sales from continuing operations rose nearly 42% on a constant currency basis to $1.5 billion, reflecting the Animal Health International acquisition. And we ended the year with adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.47. 
Looking at our markets. Conditions were roughly unchanged compared to the last quarter, but there were some subtle changes in the complexion in our end markets during the fourth quarter that are worth noting. In Dental, we continued to see relative stable to steadily improving conditions. Looking at market segment conditions affecting our Animal Health segment, the companion animal market, like Dental, continued to show stable to steadily improving characteristics. Certainly, the milder winter conditions provided some tailwind in our third quarter. However, the cooler, damper spring conditions we experienced in our Q4, especially in the Northeastern United States, weighed on sales of certain products. We remain confident in the prevailing market conditions that reflect solid employment levels and consumer resilience. 
Performance in production animal continues to reflect the softness in the livestock industry, especially in dairy and beef cattle markets. We are beginning to see some signs of end market improvement, especially in the swine market. This is part of the cyclicality of the livestock market, and we anticipate gradual improvement as we head into fiscal 2017. 
Against this backdrop, I'll now provide some insights in the segment performance, starting with Dental. While we are generally pleased with the bottom line results within Dental for the quarter, our sales performance was mixed, even in spite of the tough comparable, and fell short of our internal expectations. Sales of consumables were generally in line with market and, with the exception of our fiscal 2016 third quarter, consistent with sales performance trends over the past several quarters. 
Sales performance in equipment, digital equipment, more specifically, is where we were more challenged and also were faced with the toughest comparable. Overall, equipment sales fell 6.9% in constant currency, driven by lower digital X-ray equipment sales. In some ways, we believe these results are a function of our own success. These intraoral digital technologies have penetrated approximately 70% to 80% of the market, and Patterson Dental has garnered the largest market share. Going forward, we see many opportunities across our digital platforms, particularly for cone beam technologies. 
As I stated last quarter, the importance of properly supporting these technology investments is critical today, and we'll only beat them as we move forward and dental offices become even more digitized, providing support which help makes technology investments worry-free for the practitioner, so they can focus on patient care, which will be an increasingly important differentiator for Patterson in the future. Dental offices that are embracing digital dentistry are looking for partners that can make integrating these technologies into their practice environment and supporting them seamless. This means investing in and delivering best-in-class training programs and highly effective technical back-end support. 
The Patterson Technology Center provides our customers with the length of that seamless experience. The PTC is currently supporting over 100,000 end product users both in the dental and veterinary businesses. They took more than 1 million customer interactions annually or about 5,000 daily from current practitioners who have placed a premium on the digital backbone of their practices. We fully expect the volume and value of these services to grow. 
Turning now to core equipment. Sales were largely flat and in line with our internal expectations. Throughout fiscal 2016, we proved our ability to enrich our basic equipment portfolio in a way that gives us a more sustainable, long-term platform for future growth. A-dec has been and remains a very important partner to us, and we had a strong year with them. Our broader manufacturer relationships, which included the new additions of Pelton & Crane, Belmont and the Sirona line of treatment centers, helps us to be more flexible and support the needs of a wider range of customers. 
Looking now at CEREC sales. Our momentum in this category was very strong in the fourth quarter. Even in spite of the difficult year-over-year comparables, CEREC sales hit record levels. Clearly, there is tremendous enthusiasm for Sirona's new zirconia workflow for CEREC, and we capitalized on this recent product introduction. The zirconia workflow combines CAD/CAM technology support with full-contour zirconia material. The prospects of adding high-strength zirconia materials to single visit restorations has created fresh interest in and demand for chairside restorations, and we do not see this abating. If there's any source of disappointment within CEREC sales for the full year, it would be in the slower pace of trade-ups. However, as we have said in the past, this is a testament to the strength of the Sirona platforms and the high level of customer satisfaction with their products and our support infrastructure. As we move forward, our focus will be on expanding its new customer segments, seeking fresh opportunities to gain more reach and intensifying our focus on sales execution. 
Turning now to Animal Health segment. During the quarter, we posted solid top and bottom line results in both companion animal and production animal that were in line with expectations and reflect current end market dynamics. We need to keep in mind that while production animal market cyclicality can prompt producers to adjust herd size, producers must continue to manage the health of their animals regardless of market conditions, and we are the market leaders in helping them achieve this important objective. As we head into fiscal 2017, we anticipate improvements in producer level economics as animal pricing strengthens and producers look to increase breeding activity, especially in beef cattle. 
This quarter, in addition to favorable performance in our U.S. companion animal business, we saw encouraging growth once again out of our U.K. division, NVS. Sales in our companion animal business grew 8.2% in constant currency during the quarter. Sales growth at NVS, our U.K. division, added 5% on the same basis. We remain very impressed with the management and team at NVS. Their commitment to execution keeps us optimistic with the momentum in their business. 
Sales from the acquisition contributed an additional $404 million to our Animal Health segment in the fourth quarter. Naturally, our ongoing integration efforts in our Animal Health segment are our intense focus, and we continue to concentrate on both operational refinement and sales execution across our entire platform. 
In terms of synergy capture, today, our sales, marketing and operation support functions are fully integrated, and we are presenting one voice to the industry. We have fully rationalized all the core functions within Animal Health and now can move towards optimizing our distribution footprint. I am very pleased with the assertive and positive approach the entire team has taken on this. 
We recently completed strategic planning sessions for our Animal Health segment, and it's encouraging to see such an intense focus on the customer and open sharing of ideas to better propel the business. This dynamic, coupled with our success thus far in capturing synergies, gives us optimism that we can further build on the strong leadership position we already have. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials."

During the quarter, these effo",1658,"Thank you, Scott. As Scott mentioned, our efforts to improve our operational discipline paid off during our fourth quarter and will continue to play an important role as we move forward toward sustained, profitable growth. 
During the quarter, these efforts were clearly reflected across a number of metrics such as operating margin expansion, improvement in working capital levels and, of course, our bottom line. We are pleased to have met our annual guidance range for adjusted EPS from continuing operations for a second consecutive year. As I've done in the past, I will again discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to focus on our current portfolio of businesses. 
This past quarter was the third full quarter of contribution from Animal Health International, so where appropriate, I will highlight organic sales, which strip out the contribution from the acquisition, currency effects and a change in selling arrangement from agency to buy/sell to provide a more normalized view of results. 
Let's start with the top line. Consolidated sales for the quarter totaled $1.5 billion, up nearly 42% on a constant currency basis. Organic revenue growth rose 1.6%. Again, for this quarter, the impact of currency translation moderated slightly. 
On a consolidated basis, currency translation reduced sales by approximately 1.1%, which is down sequentially from 1.7% last quarter. We continue to anticipate that between 15% to 20% of our total revenue will come from international sources. 
Turning now to margins. When examining margins, it's helpful to keep in mind that the core rationale for our portfolio move over the last  past year was to begin to build platforms for long-term growth and return on invested capital in exchange for some margin dilution. Consolidated operating margin during the fourth quarter reflected that impact, declining 80 basis points. However, with the additional earnings contribution from Animal Health International, our operating income topped $119 million, up 28% over the prior year. 
The fourth quarter was solid in terms of operating margin expansion in both our Dental and legacy companion animal businesses, reflecting a range of factors from changes in product mix, synergy capture and improved operational discipline. 
Finally, on the bottom line, we posted quarterly adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $0.77 per diluted share. 
Now let's move on to our segments. In Dental, sales were essentially flat on a constant currency basis in the quarter. On that same basis, consumable sales were up 3.3%, growing slightly faster than the end markets and the categories we serve. As Scott mentioned, equipment sales were mixed, and we had a large year-over-year sales comparable to overcome, 23.3% growth in last year's Q4. Overall, equipment sales declined 6.9% in constant currency on that tough comparable. The decline mainly reflects lower digital X-ray sales both in terms of volume and lower price point offerings. 
As we discussed during our call last quarter, we expected new product innovation and focused promotional offerings to enhance our Q4 CEREC sales, and we are very pleased with our performance this quarter. CEREC sales were up low to mid-single digits, reaching an all-time quarterly high. Dental operating margins rose more than 50 basis points over the prior year. Again, this improvement was largely due to a blend of factors, including mix and operational effectiveness. Last quarter, we had forecasted that we were on track to deliver operating margin expansion between 20 and 30 basis points in Dental for the full fiscal year. We ended the year with 26 basis points of improvement, right in the middle of our range. 
Now turning to our Animal Health segment. For the sake of clarity in this discussion, organic sales metrics exclude the contribution from the acquisition and currency but include the benefit of the change in selling arrangement for certain products from agency to buy/sell. Please note that this change will continue to impact sales results going forward. Organic sales in the segment rose 8.2% for the quarter, driven by solid sales performance in both the U.S. and the U.K. Specifically, sales from the legacy U.S. companion animal business were up 10.5%, and U.K. sales grew by 5% in constant currency. U.S. sales reflected that change in selling arrangements, which added 2 to 3 percentage points of growth to consolidated Animal Health results. 
The sales contribution from the acquisition during the period totaled roughly $404 million. With that contribution, sales for the consolidated Animal Health segment more than doubled from the prior year. The production animal market continues to be impacted by softness in some markets, particularly beef and dairy cattle. We anticipate some end market strengthening as we move into fiscal 2017, especially in the back half of the fiscal year. Operating margin excluding the acquisition and our legacy companion animal business improved nearly 50 basis points, primarily reflecting higher sales levels and synergies. After factoring in the acquisition, consolidated operating margin within the Animal Health segment increased nearly 10 basis points. We expect operating margins to continue to expand going forward. For the full year, we had forecasted operating margins on an adjusted basis of 4% to 5% in this segment. 
Adjusted operating margins rose 24 basis points to 4.6%, which is right in the range. Regarding synergies, we make good progress, and we estimate that our synergy capture came in on target for the year. Our synergy focus since fiscal 2016 was on the integration of our companion animal sales forces, reducing our facility expenses and lowering logistics cost. 
Moving into fiscal 2017, our focus will turn to more effectively leveraging our supply chain across both of our businesses and further consolidation of our back-office functions. We remain on track to achieve our stated goal of capturing between $20 million and $30 million in annualized synergies over a 3-year period. 
Now a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. Last quarter, we said that working capital level should come down over the next few quarters, and we finished the year strong. During the quarter, we more effectively managed working capital and generated solid cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was over $242 million in Q4, an improvement over the first 9 months of the year. For the full fiscal year, we generated cash flow from operations of about $195 million compared to $205 million during the last fiscal year. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns in our business and expect to return to converting between 85% and 100% of net income into free cash flow in fiscal 2017. 
CapEx totaled $22 million in Q4 and included investments for normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiative. For the 2016 fiscal year, total CapEx came in at $79 million. 
A quick look at tax rates. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.3%. While we did see some benefit during the quarter from the   [indiscernible] contingency reserve, for the full year, our adjusted tax rate was unchanged compared to fiscal 2015. Looking ahead, we anticipate an uptick in the rate next year at around 35%. 
In terms of shareholder return, year-to-date, we have returned a total of $291 million to our shareholders through a combination of $91 million in dividends and $200 million of share buybacks. 
I'll wrap up with a discussion of our fiscal 2017 guidance. First, I'd like to echo Scott. Patterson is in midstream in the process of repositioning itself for larger growth goals ahead. In fiscal 2017, we will continue to move through a period of intense execution on a range of initiatives that we believe are critical to top and bottom line expansion. It is also helpful to consider the market dynamics we expect to face. 
As we head into fiscal 2017, we currently expect the Dental market to continue growing at a pace of 2% to 3%. In companion animal, we anticipate 4% to 5% market growth, and in production animal, we are expecting underlying market growth of roughly 2%. 
The guidance range we are providing today does include, as we began to discuss last quarter, a pretax $25 million step-up in operating expense associated with the ERP implementation. As we explained, this investment will start depreciating as we move further into broader implementation during the fall. During this period, we will essentially be running redundant systems to help ensure a seamless transition to our new platform. This step-up in expense, which will begin in the late fall, includes costs for depreciation, rollout and infrastructure support. 
We believe our new ERP platform will lead to new efficiencies. However, some of them cannot be realized until the platform is fully implemented. That said, we believe we have a sound process in place for migrating to our new system in a way that ensures business continuity and high levels of customer support and leads to significant future efficiencies once the transition is complete. 
I'd also like to provide some framework on operating margin expectations. For fiscal year 2017, we expect consolidated operating margins to be flat to down slightly after absorbing the $25 million step-up in ERP expenses, a majority of which will be allocated back to our business segments. 
In Dental, we are targeting operating margins between 13% and 13.5%. And for Animal Health, we expect operating margins to be flat with fiscal 2016. With all of this in mind, we are establishing our fiscal 2017 guidance range for adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations at $2.60 to $2.70 per share. Our guidance range assumes stable North American and international markets and excludes the following: the impact of additional share repurchases, new acquisitions and transaction-related costs, integration and business restructuring expense and deal amortization. 
Lastly, we anticipate that the additional earnings per share that we expect to generate in fiscal 2017 will be relatively evenly distributed across the fourth quarter -- across the 4 quarters. 
With that, I will turn it back to Scott for some further comments."

We're confident we met our first year synergy goals for the integration in our Animal Health segment. Last quarter, we began the first pilot implementation for our next-generation systems initiative. This involves 6 branches, 2 fulfillment centers and several corporate functions directly involving more than 1,000 employees. The volumes in these branches are testing well, and we continue to refine this system weekly. I believe we will -- are well on our way to establishing a stable, modern, scalable ERP platform that will better allow us to succeed in any growth environment. 
In Dental, we are bullish on the opportunities that lie ahead. We have built a product and technical competency in Dental that I believe will provide substantial differentiation and value for customers, especially those who strive to transform their patient experiences. However, we need to find ways to more effectively shape our approach to today's market and better address the needs of our customers. And in Animal Health, we are headed towards completing our first full year after adding Animal Health International to the Patterson family. 
We can clearly see, when you compare the customer profiles and their needs across both of our business segments, that our customer profiles are evolving towards small, midsize and large customer categories. Each has unique needs and different definitions for value, and our business model is well suited to address all of them. 
Finally, we remain committed to our three-pronged capital allocation strategy. We believe there are more acquisition opportunities out there that can allow us to build on the platform we have created in a capital-efficient way.

I think when we look at the full year, I'll put in some context where -- as I said in my prepared remarks, I think we're very pleased in how we transition to a more expanded portfolio of traditional equipment partners. We have a fantastic partner, legacy partner in A-dec. And when we looked at the transition and put our internal projections together, we actually exceeded those internal projections. And sort of looking forward instead of looking backwards, we're really excited about the upcoming year. A-dec has some significant new product launches. In fact, our entire equipment sales force is in the process of being trained on these products at A-dec's factories in Oregon. And I'd say bottom line with the portfolio is we have more access to more customers. That's the constant feedback I have. I would say we were disappointed as we looked at our third quarter, which is the calendar fourth quarter, that the Section 179 issue did not get resolved but are very excited that, that is resolved, and it's part of the discussion today with our customers. So as we look forward, we think the fundamentals are building and the foundation is building for dentists to actively invest in our products, and Patterson's always taking the leadership area in terms of technology and equipment sales."

And I think this is a story that's going to play out over the long term, and we take a long-term perspective on this relationship, having been doing it for well over a decade. The initial feedback is that zirconia really opened up doors, once again, for a large segment of the dental population to look at CEREC again. And we always get excited when the innovation curve allows us to do that because many times, the impression of CEREC may be a dentist to look at the product 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago. So we have a lot of activity. I'm very pleased. I would say if there was a risk going into the fourth quarter when you have a new product launch and you have to train everyone up and you have to get the supply chain right and get the products in the right spot to serve the demand, there's a lot of risk in that side. I could not be more pleased with our Dental team and how they -- particularly our folks in the field and the branches, on how they met that demand for the customer.

So certainly, we saw good reductions in our investments in working capital, both in inventory and long-term receivables. Certainly, CEREC was a portion of that, and you'll see inventory, in total, came down nicely about $90 million. I think there's still room to improve in terms of working capital in total.

So we continue to be very excited about that, and within the construct of our go-to-market, Abaxis continues to be a very important partner to us."

The diagnostics change actually annualized into our results last quarter. But I think within that Animal Health segment, the terms and selling arrangements with the manufacturers do change from time to time. So what you saw this quarter with 1 manufacturer, their sales move from an agency relationship with us to a more traditional distributor role, which we refer to as buy/sell, and so that change that happened this quarter did add about 2 to 3 percentage points of revenue growth to that total Animal Health segment. And that change will continue to affect us for the next 4 -- or next 3 quarters."

So where are you with inventory or ability to get your hands on that product? And how do we think about the opportunity potentially to do a dry meal upgrade over the next few quarters?

But about 20% to 25% of that $25 million -- 20% to 25% of the $25 million step-up is depreciation. About 25% is rollout and implementation costs, so that's the piece that you can think about that would go away, right, in the back half of '18 as we complete the rollout. And then the balance is what's required to support the system. I think when you think about 2018 and how much comes out, we expect to see some benefits in the back half of '18 because the training and implementation is done. You're fully up and running, and so now you can turn off the legacy systems, and you can also now clearly harness the benefits of the new system. But I'm not ready to really publicly quantify dollar amounts at this time. We're still working on those estimates, refining them."

As I look at futures, it looks like beef and dairy futures have both taken a bit of a step-down even in the last month, 1.5 months. So how much of that 2% market growth is subject to we need to see a rebound in protein prices? Or can that be tagged more back to just if we bounce along at these levels?

I'd like to begin my remarks by discussing where Patterson Companies is today from a strategic standpoint, highlight the journey we are on and put our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 into some important perspectives. 
As we concluded fiscal 2015 a year ago and embarked on fiscal 2016, we set out on a path to transform Patterson Companies for a future of more sustainable, profitable growth. Our path to where we are today and where we are going is thoughtful, well planned and multidimensional. We know that to fully realize our ambitions, it will require strategies designed to transform Patterson in multiple ways. It involves ensuring that we are technologically advanced to not only serve the customers of today and tomorrow but to take Patterson to increasing levels of efficiency; fundamentally repositioning our portfolio of businesses around stronger, long-term growth markets and go-to-market approaches that are highly compatible; closely scrutinizing our existing operations as part of our portfolio evaluation to make sure we are fully optimized and positioned for the future, even in areas where we believe we are traditionally very strong; and lastly, ensuring that as we drive this change, we preserve and enhance the high-performance culture that has made Patterson a leader and employer of choice. 
In our 140 years as a company, Patterson has seen its fair share of market changes and has always stepped up to lead our chosen markets. 
Fiscal 2016 was arguably one of the most ambitious years of large-scale change we have undertaken in our nearly 1.5 centuries. We took our initial transformational steps during the fiscal year, beginning with the refocusing of our portfolio on 2 highly compatible, growth-focused businesses and consummating the largest transaction in our history. We moved forward with the pilot of our new ERP system, which we believe will lead to a whole new level of operational effectiveness. We made significant strides in integrating our new Animal Health platform, which is roughly 50% of our business, and capturing the synergies we committed to this fiscal year, all while preserving our cultural strengths. And we strengthened our leadership, attracting seasoned, high-level executives to our bench and balancing our management team with both inside and outside perspective. 
Given the scope and sophistication of the initiatives we are pursuing and pressured top line performance in some areas, I'm pleased to report that we were able to finish the year strong on the bottom line. Consolidated sales from continuing operations rose nearly 42% on a constant currency basis to $1.5 billion, reflecting the Animal Health International acquisition. And we ended the year with adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.47. 
Looking at our markets. Conditions were roughly unchanged compared to the last quarter, but there were some subtle changes in the complexion in our end markets during the fourth quarter that are worth noting. In Dental, we continued to see relative stable to steadily improving conditions. Looking at market segment conditions affecting our Animal Health segment, the companion animal market, like Dental, continued to show stable to steadily improving characteristics. 
Certainly, the milder winter conditions provided some tailwind in our third quarter. However, the cooler, damper spring conditions we experienced in our Q4, especially in the Northeastern United States, weighed on sales of certain products. We remain confident in the prevailing market conditions that reflect solid employment levels and consumer resilience. 
Performance in production animal continues to reflect the softness in the livestock industry, especially in dairy and beef cattle markets. We are beginning to see some signs of end market improvement, especially in the swine market. This is part of the cyclicality of the livestock market, and we anticipate gradual improvement as we head into fiscal 2017. 
Against this backdrop, I'll now provide some insights in the segment performance, starting with Dental. While we are generally pleased with the bottom line results within Dental for the quarter, our sales performance was mixed, even in spite of the tough comparable, and fell short of our internal expectations. Sales of consumables were generally in line with market and, with the exception of our fiscal 2016 third quarter, consistent with sales performance trends over the past several quarters. 
Sales performance in equipment, digital equipment, more specifically, is where we were more challenged and also were faced with the toughest comparable. Overall, equipment sales fell 6.9% in constant currency, driven by lower digital X-ray equipment sales. In some ways, we believe these results are a function of our own success. These intraoral digital technologies have penetrated approximately 70% to 80% of the market, and Patterson Dental has garnered the largest market share. Going forward, we see many opportunities across our digital platforms, particularly for cone beam technologies. 
As I stated last quarter, the importance of properly supporting these technology investments is critical today, and we'll only beat them as we move forward and dental offices become even more digitized, providing support which help makes technology investments worry-free for the practitioner, so they can focus on patient care, which will be an increasingly important differentiator for Patterson in the future. Dental offices that are embracing digital dentistry are looking for partners that can make integrating these technologies into their practice environment and supporting them seamless. This means investing in and delivering best-in-class training programs and highly effective technical back-end support. 
The Patterson Technology Center provides our customers with the link to that seamless experience. The PTC is currently supporting over 100,000 end product users both in the dental and veterinary businesses. They took more than 1 million customer interactions annually or about 5,000 daily from practitioners who have placed a premium on the digital backbone of their practices. We fully expect the volume and value of these services to grow. 
Turning now to core equipment. Sales were largely flat and in line with our internal expectations. Throughout fiscal 2016, we proved our ability to enrich our basic equipment portfolio in a way that gives us a more sustainable, long-term platform for future growth. A-dec has been and remains a very important partner to us, and we had a strong year with them. Our broader manufacturer relationships, which included the new additions of Pelton & Crane, Belmont and the Sirona line of treatment centers, helps us to be more flexible and support the needs of a wider range of customers. 
Looking now at CEREC sales. Our momentum in this category was very strong in the fourth quarter. Even in spite of the difficult year-over-year comparables, CEREC sales hit record levels. Clearly, there is tremendous enthusiasm for Sirona's new zirconia workflow for CEREC, and we capitalized on this recent product introduction. The zirconia workflow combines CAD/CAM technology support with full-contour zirconia material. The prospects of adding high-strength zirconia materials to single visit restorations has created fresh interest in and demand for chairside restorations, and we do not see this abating. 
If there's any source of disappointment within CEREC sales for the full year, it would be in the slower pace of trade-ups. However, as we have said in the past, this is a testament to the strength of the Sirona platforms and the high level of customer satisfaction with their products and our support infrastructure. As we move forward, our focus will be on expanding into new customer segments, seeking fresh opportunities to gain more reach and intensifying our focus on sales execution. 
Turning now to Animal Health segment. During the quarter, we posted solid top and bottom line results in both companion animal and production animal that were in line with expectations and reflect current end market dynamics. We need to keep in mind that while production animal market cyclicality can prompt producers to adjust herd size, producers must continue to manage the health of their animals regardless of market conditions, and we are the market leaders in helping them achieve this important objective. As we head into fiscal 2017, we anticipate improvements in producer level economics as animal pricing strengthens and producers look to increase breeding activity, especially in beef cattle. 
This quarter, in addition to favorable performance in our U.S. companion animal business, we saw encouraging growth once again out of our U.K. division, NVS. Sales in our companion animal business grew 8.2% in constant currency during the quarter. Sales growth at NVS, our U.K. division, added 5% on the same basis. We remain very impressed with the management and team at NVS. Their commitment to execution keeps us optimistic with the momentum in their business. 
Sales from the acquisition contributed an additional $404 million to our Animal Health segment in the fourth quarter. Naturally, our ongoing integration efforts in our Animal Health segment are intense-focused and we continue to concentrate on both operational refinement and sales execution across our entire platform. 
In terms of synergy capture, today, our sales, marketing and operation support functions are fully integrated, and we are presenting one voice to the industry. We have fully rationalized all the core functions within Animal Health and now can move towards optimizing our distribution footprint. I am very pleased with the assertive and positive approach the entire team has taken on this. 
We recently completed strategic planning sessions for our Animal Health segment, and it's encouraging to see such an intense focus on the customer and open sharing of ideas to better propel the business. This dynamic, coupled with our success thus far in capturing synergies, gives us optimism that we can further build on the strong leadership position we already have. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials."

During the quarter, these effo",1660,"Thank you, Scott. As Scott mentioned, our efforts to improve our operational discipline paid off during our fourth quarter and will continue to play an important role as we move forward toward sustained, profitable growth. 
During the quarter, these efforts were clearly reflected across a number of metrics such as operating margin expansion, improvement in working capital levels and, of course, our bottom line. We are pleased to have met our annual guidance range for adjusted EPS from continuing operations for a second consecutive year. As I've done in the past, I will again discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to focus on our current portfolio of businesses. 
This past quarter was the third full quarter of contribution from Animal Health International, so where appropriate, I will highlight organic sales, which strip out the contribution from the acquisition, currency effects and a change in selling arrangement from agency to buy/sell to provide a more normalized view of results. 
Let's start with the top line. Consolidated sales for the quarter totaled $1.5 billion, up nearly 42% on a constant currency basis. Organic revenue growth rose 1.6%. Again, for this quarter, the impact of currency translation moderated slightly. 
On a consolidated basis, currency translation reduced sales by approximately 1.1%, which is down sequentially from 1.7% last quarter. We continue to anticipate that between 15% to 20% of our total revenue will come from international sources. 
Turning now to margins. When examining margins, it's helpful to keep in mind that the core rationale for our portfolio move over the last -- past year was to begin to build platforms for long-term growth and return on invested capital in exchange for some margin dilution. Consolidated operating margin during the fourth quarter reflected that impact, declining 80 basis points. However, with the additional earnings contribution from Animal Health International, our operating income topped $119 million, up 28% over the prior year. 
The fourth quarter was solid in terms of operating margin expansion in both our Dental and legacy companion animal businesses, reflecting a range of factors from changes in product mix, synergy capture and improved operational discipline. 
Finally, on the bottom line, we posted quarterly adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $0.77 per diluted share. 
Now let's move on to our segments. In Dental, sales were essentially flat on a constant currency basis in the quarter. On that same basis, consumable sales were up 3.3%, growing slightly faster than the end markets in the categories we serve. As Scott mentioned, equipment sales were mixed, and we had a large year-over-year sales comparable to overcome, 23.3% growth in last year's Q4. Overall, equipment sales declined 6.9% in constant currency on that tough comparable. The decline mainly reflects lower digital X-ray sales both in terms of volume and lower price point offerings. 
As we discussed during our call last quarter, we expected new product innovation and focused promotional offerings to enhance our Q4 CEREC sales, and we are very pleased with our performance this quarter. CEREC sales were up low to mid-single digits, reaching an all-time quarterly high. Dental operating margins rose more than 50 basis points over the prior year. Again, this improvement was largely due to a blend of factors, including mix and operational effectiveness. Last quarter, we had forecasted that we were on track to deliver operating margin expansion between 20 and 30 basis points in Dental for the full fiscal year. We ended the year with 26 basis points of improvement, right in the middle of our range. 
Now turning to our Animal Health segment. For the sake of clarity in this discussion, organic sales metrics exclude the contribution from the acquisition and currency but include the benefit of the change in selling arrangement for certain products from agency to buy/sell. Please note that this change will continue to impact sales results going forward. 
Organic sales in the segment rose 8.2% for the quarter, driven by solid sales performance in both the U.S. and the U.K. Specifically, sales from the legacy U.S. companion animal business were up 10.5%, and U.K. sales grew by 5% in constant currency. U.S. sales reflected that change in selling arrangements, which added 2 to 3 percentage points of growth to consolidated Animal Health results. 
The sales contribution from the acquisition during the period totaled roughly $404 million. With that contribution, sales for the consolidated Animal Health segment more than doubled from the prior year. The production animal market continues to be impacted by softness in some markets, particularly beef and dairy cattle. We anticipate some end market strengthening as we move into fiscal 2017, especially in the back half of the fiscal year. 
Operating margin excluding the acquisition and our legacy companion animal business improved nearly 50 basis points, primarily reflecting higher sales levels and synergies. After factoring in the acquisition, consolidated operating margin within the Animal Health segment increased nearly 10 basis points. We expect operating margins to continue to expand going forward. For the full year, we had forecasted operating margins on an adjusted basis of 4% to 5% in this segment. 
Adjusted operating margins rose 24 basis points to 4.6%, which is right in the range. Regarding synergies, we make good progress, and we estimate that our synergy capture came in on target for the year. Our synergy focus in fiscal 2016 was on the integration of our companion animal sales forces, reducing our facility expenses and lowering logistics cost. 
Moving into fiscal 2017, our focus will turn to more effectively leveraging our supply chain across both of our businesses and further consolidation of our back-office functions. We remain on track to achieve our stated goal of capturing between $20 million and $30 million in annualized synergies over a 3-year period. 
Now a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. Last quarter, we said that working capital level should come down over the next few quarters, and we finished the year strong. During the quarter, we more effectively managed working capital and generated solid cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was over $242 million in Q4, an improvement over the first 9 months of the year. For the full fiscal year, we generated cash flow from operations of about $195 million compared to $205 million during the last fiscal year. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns in our business and expect to return to converting between 85% and 100% of net income into free cash flow in fiscal 2017. 
CapEx totaled $22 million in Q4 and included investments for normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiative. For the 2016 fiscal year, total CapEx came in at $79 million. 
A quick look at tax rates. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.3%. While we did see some benefit during the quarter from the TRBA [ph] contingency reserves, for the full year, our adjusted tax rate was unchanged compared to fiscal 2015. Looking ahead, we anticipate an uptick in the rate next year at around 35%. 
In terms of shareholder return, year-to-date, we have returned a total of $291 million to our shareholders through a combination of $91 million in dividends and $200 million of share buybacks. 
I'll wrap up with a discussion of our fiscal 2017 guidance. First, I'd like to echo Scott. Patterson is in midstream, in the process of repositioning itself for larger growth goals ahead. In fiscal 2017, we will continue to move through a period of intense execution on a range of initiatives that we believe are critical to top and bottom line expansion. It is also helpful to consider the market dynamics we expect to face. 
As we head into fiscal 2017, we currently expect the Dental market to continue growing at a pace of 2% to 3%. In companion animal, we anticipate 4% to 5% market growth, and in production animal, we are expecting underlying market growth of roughly 2%. 
The guidance range we are providing today does include, as we began to discuss last quarter, a pretax $25 million step-up in operating expense associated with the ERP implementation. As we explained, this investment will start depreciating as we move further into broader implementation during the fall. During this period, we will essentially be running redundant systems to help ensure a seamless transition to our new platform. This step-up in expense, which will begin in the late fall, includes costs for depreciation, rollout and infrastructure support. 
We believe our new ERP platform will lead to new efficiencies. However, some of them cannot be realized until the platform is fully implemented. That said, we believe we have a sound process in place for migrating to our new system in a way that ensures business continuity and high levels of customer support and leads to significant future efficiencies once the transition is complete. 
I'd also like to provide some framework on operating margin expectations. For fiscal year 2017, we expect consolidated operating margins to be flat to down slightly after absorbing the $25 million step-up in ERP expenses, a majority of which will be allocated back to our business segments. 
In Dental, we are targeting operating margins between 13% and 13.5%. And for Animal Health, we expect operating margins to be flat with fiscal 2016. With all of this in mind, we are establishing our fiscal 2017 guidance range for adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations at $2.60 to $2.70 per share. Our guidance range assumes stable North American and international markets and excludes the following: the impact of additional share repurchases, new acquisitions and transaction-related costs, integration and business restructuring expense and deal amortization. 
Lastly, we anticipate that the additional earnings per share that we expect to generate in fiscal 2017 will be relatively evenly distributed across the fourth quarter -- across the 4 quarters. 
With that, I will turn it back to Scott for some further comments."

As I mentioned at the beginning of our call, Patterson will celebrate 140 years as a company in fiscal 2017. We have achieved countless milestones in that time and intend to reach many more as we move ahead. In fiscal 2016, we topped $5 billion in annual sales for the first time. We confidently met our first year synergy goals for the integration in our Animal Health segment. Last quarter, we began the first pilot implementation for our next-generation systems initiative. This involves 6 branches, 2 fulfillment centers and several corporate functions directly involving more than 1,000 employees. The volumes in these branches are testing well, and we continue to refine this system weekly. I believe we will -- are well on our way to establishing a stable, modern, scalable ERP platform that will better allow us to succeed in any growth environment. 
In Dental, we are bullish on the opportunities that lie ahead. We have built a product and technical competency in Dental that I believe will provide substantial differentiation and value for customers, especially those who strive to transform their patient experiences. However, we need to find ways to more effectively shape our approach to today's market and better address the needs of our customers. And in Animal Health, we are headed towards completing our first full year after adding Animal Health International to the Patterson family. 
We can clearly see, when you compare the customer profiles and their needs across both of our business segments, that our customer profiles are evolving towards small, midsize and large customer categories. Each has unique needs and different definitions for value, and our business model is well suited to address all of them. 
Finally, we remain committed to our 3-pronged capital allocation strategy. We believe there are more acquisition opportunities out there that can allow us to build on the platform we have created in a capital-efficient way. We will continue to explore these opportunities along with supporting our dividend and share repurchases.

In fact, our entire equipment sales force is in the process of being trained on these products at A-dec's factories in Oregon.

I would say we were disappointed as we looked at our third quarter, which is the calendar fourth quarter, that the Section 179 issue did not get resolved but are very excited that, that is resolved, and it's part of the discussion today with our customers.

So when we look at how do we use the power of Patterson and the relationships we have with our manufacturers to serve those customers, we know that it is not a one-size-fits-all strategy. So we're building and continue to build ways that we can serve dentistry and the Animal Health segment because there are a lot of synergies in terms of business models, how we can serve those different business models incredibly effectively and really ensure customer success regardless of practice size."

Thanks, Jon. I'll talk to some of the early feedback on zirconia. And I think this is a story that's going to play out over the long term, and we take a long-term perspective on this relationship, having been doing it for well over a decade. The initial feedback is that zirconia really opened up doors, once again, for a large segment of the dental population to look at CEREC again. And we always get excited when the innovation curve allows us to do that because many times, the impression of CEREC may be a dentist to look at the product 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago. So we have a lot of activity. I'm very pleased. I would say if there was a risk going into the fourth quarter when you have a new product launch and you have to train everyone up and you have to get the supply chain right and get the products in the right spot to serve the demand, there's a lot of risk in that side. I could not be more pleased with our Dental team and how they -- particularly our folks in the field and the branches, on how they met that demand for the customer. So what generally -- historically, summer can be a quieter period of time, I think we'll have a lot of interaction with customers over the summer about zirconia.

So certainly, we saw good reductions in our investments in working capital, both in inventory and long-term receivables. Certainly, CEREC was a portion of that, and you'll see inventory, in total, came down nicely about $90 million. I think there's still room to improve in terms of working capital in total. As we move into FY '17, I think there's room to improve upon that. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we expect to get back to that 85% to 100% of net income to free cash flow conversion next year."

About 25% is rollout and implementation costs, so that's the piece that you can think about that would go away, right, in the back half of '18 as we complete the rollout. And then the balance is what's required to support the system. I think when you think about 2018 and how much comes out, we expect to see some benefits in the back half of '18 because the training and implementation is done. You're fully up and running, and so now you can turn off the legacy systems, and you can also now clearly harness the benefits of the new system.

But probably, I would say leaning towards optimism, that this could be a year where we could begin to see growth trajectory move back up to a more traditional level."

Without doubt, the biggest promotion that is out there for small business owners is the benefits from Section 179. So the fact that those -- that extension was made permanent, and it's something we are talking about every day today with customers, I would say it's probably the biggest potential tailwind for the industry in whole."

I'd like to begin my remarks by discussing where Patterson Companies is today from a strategic standpoint, highlight the journey we are on and put our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 into some important perspectives. 
As we concluded fiscal 2015 a year ago and embarked on fiscal 2016, we set out on a path to transform Patterson Companies for a future of more sustainable, profitable growth. Our path to where we are today and where we are going is thoughtful, well planned and multidimensional. We know that to fully realize our ambitions, it will require strategies designed to transform Patterson in multiple ways. It involves ensuring that we are technologically advanced to not only serve the customers of today and tomorrow but to take Patterson to increasing levels of efficiency; fundamentally repositioning our portfolio of businesses around stronger, long-term growth markets and go-to-market approaches that are highly compatible; closely scrutinizing our existing operations as part of our portfolio evaluation to make sure we are fully optimized and positioned for the future, even in areas where we believe we are traditionally very strong; and lastly, ensuring that as we drive this change, we preserve and enhance the high-performance culture that has made Patterson a leader and employer of choice. 
In our 140 years as a company, Patterson has seen its fair share of market changes and has always stepped up to lead our chosen markets. 
Fiscal 2016 was arguably one of the most ambitious years of large-scale change we have undertaken in our nearly 1.5 centuries. We took our initial transformational steps during the fiscal year, beginning with the refocusing of our portfolio on 2 highly compatible, growth-focused businesses and consummating the largest transaction in our history. We moved forward with the pilot of our new ERP system, which we believe will lead to a whole new level of operational effectiveness. We made significant strides in integrating our new Animal Health platform, which is roughly 50% of our business, and capturing the synergies we committed to this fiscal year, all while preserving our cultural strengths. And we strengthened our leadership, attracting seasoned, high-level executives to our bench and balancing our management team with both inside and outside perspective. 
Given the scope and sophistication of the initiatives we are pursuing and pressured top line performance in some areas, I'm pleased to report that we were able to finish the year strong on the bottom line. Consolidated sales from continuing operations rose nearly 42% on a constant currency basis to $1.5 billion, reflecting the Animal Health International acquisition. And we ended the year with adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.47. 
Looking at our markets. Conditions were roughly unchanged compared to the last quarter, but there were some subtle changes in the complexion in our end markets during the fourth quarter that are worth noting. In Dental, we continued to see relative stable to steadily improving conditions. Looking at market segment conditions affecting our Animal Health segment, the companion animal market, like Dental, continued to show stable to steadily improving characteristics. 
Certainly, the milder winter conditions provided some tailwind in our third quarter. However, the cooler, damper spring conditions we experienced in our Q4, especially in the Northeastern United States, weighed on sales of certain products. We remain confident in the prevailing market conditions that reflect solid employment levels and consumer resilience. 
Performance in production animal continues to reflect the softness in the livestock industry, especially in dairy and beef cattle markets. We are beginning to see some signs of end market improvement, especially in the swine market. This is part of the cyclicality of the livestock market, and we anticipate gradual improvement as we head into fiscal 2017. 
Against this backdrop, I'll now provide some insights in the segment performance, starting with Dental. While we are generally pleased with the bottom line results within Dental for the quarter, our sales performance was mixed, even in spite of the tough comparable, and fell short of our internal expectations. Sales of consumables were generally in line with market and, with the exception of our fiscal 2016 third quarter, consistent with sales performance trends over the past several quarters. 
Sales performance in equipment, digital equipment, more specifically, is where we were more challenged and also were faced with the toughest comparable. Overall, equipment sales fell 6.9% in constant currency, driven by lower digital X-ray equipment sales. In some ways, we believe these results are a function of our own success. These intraoral digital technologies have penetrated approximately 70% to 80% of the market, and Patterson Dental has garnered the largest market share. Going forward, we see many opportunities across our digital platforms, particularly for cone beam technologies. 
As I stated last quarter, the importance of properly supporting these technology investments is critical today, and we'll only beat them as we move forward and dental offices become even more digitized, providing support which help makes technology investments worry-free for the practitioner, so they can focus on patient care, which will be an increasingly important differentiator for Patterson in the future. Dental offices that are embracing digital dentistry are looking for partners that can make integrating these technologies into their practice environment and supporting them seamless. This means investing in and delivering best-in-class training programs and highly effective technical back-end support. 
The Patterson Technology Center provides our customers with the link to that seamless experience. The PTC is currently supporting over 100,000 end product users both in the dental and veterinary businesses. They took more than 1 million customer interactions annually or about 5,000 daily from practitioners who have placed a premium on the digital backbone of their practices. We fully expect the volume and value of these services to grow. 
Turning now to core equipment. Sales were largely flat and in line with our internal expectations. Throughout fiscal 2016, we proved our ability to enrich our basic equipment portfolio in a way that gives us a more sustainable, long-term platform for future growth. A-dec has been and remains a very important partner to us, and we had a strong year with them. Our broader manufacturer relationships, which included the new additions of Pelton & Crane, Belmont and the Sirona line of treatment centers, helps us to be more flexible and support the needs of a wider range of customers. 
Looking now at CEREC sales. Our momentum in this category was very strong in the fourth quarter. Even in spite of the difficult year-over-year comparables, CEREC sales hit record levels. Clearly, there is tremendous enthusiasm for Sirona's new zirconia workflow for CEREC, and we capitalized on this recent product introduction. The zirconia workflow combines CAD/CAM technology support with full-contour zirconia material. The prospects of adding high-strength zirconia materials to single visit restorations has created fresh interest in and demand for chairside restorations, and we do not see this abating. 
If there's any source of disappointment within CEREC sales for the full year, it would be in the slower pace of trade-ups. However, as we have said in the past, this is a testament to the strength of the Sirona platforms and the high level of customer satisfaction with their products and our support infrastructure. As we move forward, our focus will be on expanding into new customer segments, seeking fresh opportunities to gain more reach and intensifying our focus on sales execution. 
Turning now to Animal Health segment. During the quarter, we posted solid top and bottom line results in both companion animal and production animal that were in line with expectations and reflect current end market dynamics. We need to keep in mind that while production animal market cyclicality can prompt producers to adjust herd size, producers must continue to manage the health of their animals regardless of market conditions, and we are the market leaders in helping them achieve this important objective. As we head into fiscal 2017, we anticipate improvements in producer level economics as animal pricing strengthens and producers look to increase breeding activity, especially in beef cattle. 
This quarter, in addition to favorable performance in our U.S. companion animal business, we saw encouraging growth once again out of our U.K. division, NVS. Sales in our companion animal business grew 8.2% in constant currency during the quarter. Sales growth at NVS, our U.K. division, added 5% on the same basis. We remain very impressed with the management and team at NVS. Their commitment to execution keeps us optimistic with the momentum in their business. 
Sales from the acquisition contributed an additional $404 million to our Animal Health segment in the fourth quarter. Naturally, our ongoing integration efforts in our Animal Health segment are intense-focused and we continue to concentrate on both operational refinement and sales execution across our entire platform. 
In terms of synergy capture, today, our sales, marketing and operation support functions are fully integrated, and we are presenting one voice to the industry. We have fully rationalized all the core functions within Animal Health and now can move towards optimizing our distribution footprint. I am very pleased with the assertive and positive approach the entire team has taken on this. 
We recently completed strategic planning sessions for our Animal Health segment, and it's encouraging to see such an intense focus on the customer and open sharing of ideas to better propel the business. This dynamic, coupled with our success thus far in capturing synergies, gives us optimism that we can further build on the strong leadership position we already have. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials."

During the quarter, these effo",1660,"Thank you, Scott. As Scott mentioned, our efforts to improve our operational discipline paid off during our fourth quarter and will continue to play an important role as we move forward toward sustained, profitable growth. 
During the quarter, these efforts were clearly reflected across a number of metrics such as operating margin expansion, improvement in working capital levels and, of course, our bottom line. We are pleased to have met our annual guidance range for adjusted EPS from continuing operations for a second consecutive year. As I've done in the past, I will again discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to focus on our current portfolio of businesses. 
This past quarter was the third full quarter of contribution from Animal Health International, so where appropriate, I will highlight organic sales, which strip out the contribution from the acquisition, currency effects and a change in selling arrangement from agency to buy/sell to provide a more normalized view of results. 
Let's start with the top line. Consolidated sales for the quarter totaled $1.5 billion, up nearly 42% on a constant currency basis. Organic revenue growth rose 1.6%. Again, for this quarter, the impact of currency translation moderated slightly. 
On a consolidated basis, currency translation reduced sales by approximately 1.1%, which is down sequentially from 1.7% last quarter. We continue to anticipate that between 15% to 20% of our total revenue will come from international sources. 
Turning now to margins. When examining margins, it's helpful to keep in mind that the core rationale for our portfolio move over the last -- past year was to begin to build platforms for long-term growth and return on invested capital in exchange for some margin dilution. Consolidated operating margin during the fourth quarter reflected that impact, declining 80 basis points. However, with the additional earnings contribution from Animal Health International, our operating income topped $119 million, up 28% over the prior year. 
The fourth quarter was solid in terms of operating margin expansion in both our Dental and legacy companion animal businesses, reflecting a range of factors from changes in product mix, synergy capture and improved operational discipline. 
Finally, on the bottom line, we posted quarterly adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $0.77 per diluted share. 
Now let's move on to our segments. In Dental, sales were essentially flat on a constant currency basis in the quarter. On that same basis, consumable sales were up 3.3%, growing slightly faster than the end markets in the categories we serve. As Scott mentioned, equipment sales were mixed, and we had a large year-over-year sales comparable to overcome, 23.3% growth in last year's Q4. Overall, equipment sales declined 6.9% in constant currency on that tough comparable. The decline mainly reflects lower digital X-ray sales both in terms of volume and lower price point offerings. 
As we discussed during our call last quarter, we expected new product innovation and focused promotional offerings to enhance our Q4 CEREC sales, and we are very pleased with our performance this quarter. CEREC sales were up low to mid-single digits, reaching an all-time quarterly high. Dental operating margins rose more than 50 basis points over the prior year. Again, this improvement was largely due to a blend of factors, including mix and operational effectiveness. Last quarter, we had forecasted that we were on track to deliver operating margin expansion between 20 and 30 basis points in Dental for the full fiscal year. We ended the year with 26 basis points of improvement, right in the middle of our range. 
Now turning to our Animal Health segment. For the sake of clarity in this discussion, organic sales metrics exclude the contribution from the acquisition and currency but include the benefit of the change in selling arrangement for certain products from agency to buy/sell. Please note that this change will continue to impact sales results going forward. 
Organic sales in the segment rose 8.2% for the quarter, driven by solid sales performance in both the U.S. and the U.K. Specifically, sales from the legacy U.S. companion animal business were up 10.5%, and U.K. sales grew by 5% in constant currency. U.S. sales reflected that change in selling arrangements, which added 2 to 3 percentage points of growth to consolidated Animal Health results. 
The sales contribution from the acquisition during the period totaled roughly $404 million. With that contribution, sales for the consolidated Animal Health segment more than doubled from the prior year. The production animal market continues to be impacted by softness in some markets, particularly beef and dairy cattle. We anticipate some end market strengthening as we move into fiscal 2017, especially in the back half of the fiscal year. 
Operating margin excluding the acquisition and our legacy companion animal business improved nearly 50 basis points, primarily reflecting higher sales levels and synergies. After factoring in the acquisition, consolidated operating margin within the Animal Health segment increased nearly 10 basis points. We expect operating margins to continue to expand going forward. For the full year, we had forecasted operating margins on an adjusted basis of 4% to 5% in this segment. 
Adjusted operating margins rose 24 basis points to 4.6%, which is right in the range. Regarding synergies, we make good progress, and we estimate that our synergy capture came in on target for the year. Our synergy focus in fiscal 2016 was on the integration of our companion animal sales forces, reducing our facility expenses and lowering logistics cost. 
Moving into fiscal 2017, our focus will turn to more effectively leveraging our supply chain across both of our businesses and further consolidation of our back-office functions. We remain on track to achieve our stated goal of capturing between $20 million and $30 million in annualized synergies over a 3-year period. 
Now a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. Last quarter, we said that working capital level should come down over the next few quarters, and we finished the year strong. During the quarter, we more effectively managed working capital and generated solid cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was over $242 million in Q4, an improvement over the first 9 months of the year. For the full fiscal year, we generated cash flow from operations of about $195 million compared to $205 million during the last fiscal year. We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns in our business and expect to return to converting between 85% and 100% of net income into free cash flow in fiscal 2017. 
CapEx totaled $22 million in Q4 and included investments for normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiative. For the 2016 fiscal year, total CapEx came in at $79 million. 
A quick look at tax rates. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.3%. While we did see some benefit during the quarter from the TRBA [ph] contingency reserves, for the full year, our adjusted tax rate was unchanged compared to fiscal 2015. Looking ahead, we anticipate an uptick in the rate next year at around 35%. 
In terms of shareholder return, year-to-date, we have returned a total of $291 million to our shareholders through a combination of $91 million in dividends and $200 million of share buybacks. 
I'll wrap up with a discussion of our fiscal 2017 guidance. First, I'd like to echo Scott. Patterson is in midstream, in the process of repositioning itself for larger growth goals ahead. In fiscal 2017, we will continue to move through a period of intense execution on a range of initiatives that we believe are critical to top and bottom line expansion. It is also helpful to consider the market dynamics we expect to face. 
As we head into fiscal 2017, we currently expect the Dental market to continue growing at a pace of 2% to 3%. In companion animal, we anticipate 4% to 5% market growth, and in production animal, we are expecting underlying market growth of roughly 2%. 
The guidance range we are providing today does include, as we began to discuss last quarter, a pretax $25 million step-up in operating expense associated with the ERP implementation. As we explained, this investment will start depreciating as we move further into broader implementation during the fall. During this period, we will essentially be running redundant systems to help ensure a seamless transition to our new platform. This step-up in expense, which will begin in the late fall, includes costs for depreciation, rollout and infrastructure support. 
We believe our new ERP platform will lead to new efficiencies. However, some of them cannot be realized until the platform is fully implemented. That said, we believe we have a sound process in place for migrating to our new system in a way that ensures business continuity and high levels of customer support and leads to significant future efficiencies once the transition is complete. 
I'd also like to provide some framework on operating margin expectations. For fiscal year 2017, we expect consolidated operating margins to be flat to down slightly after absorbing the $25 million step-up in ERP expenses, a majority of which will be allocated back to our business segments. 
In Dental, we are targeting operating margins between 13% and 13.5%. And for Animal Health, we expect operating margins to be flat with fiscal 2016. With all of this in mind, we are establishing our fiscal 2017 guidance range for adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations at $2.60 to $2.70 per share. Our guidance range assumes stable North American and international markets and excludes the following: the impact of additional share repurchases, new acquisitions and transaction-related costs, integration and business restructuring expense and deal amortization. 
Lastly, we anticipate that the additional earnings per share that we expect to generate in fiscal 2017 will be relatively evenly distributed across the fourth quarter -- across the 4 quarters. 
With that, I will turn it back to Scott for some further comments."

As I mentioned at the beginning of our call, Patterson will celebrate 140 years as a company in fiscal 2017. We have achieved countless milestones in that time and intend to reach many more as we move ahead. In fiscal 2016, we topped $5 billion in annual sales for the first time. We confidently met our first year synergy goals for the integration in our Animal Health segment. Last quarter, we began the first pilot implementation for our next-generation systems initiative. This involves 6 branches, 2 fulfillment centers and several corporate functions directly involving more than 1,000 employees. The volumes in these branches are testing well, and we continue to refine this system weekly. I believe we will -- are well on our way to establishing a stable, modern, scalable ERP platform that will better allow us to succeed in any growth environment. 
In Dental, we are bullish on the opportunities that lie ahead. We have built a product and technical competency in Dental that I believe will provide substantial differentiation and value for customers, especially those who strive to transform their patient experiences. However, we need to find ways to more effectively shape our approach to today's market and better address the needs of our customers. And in Animal Health, we are headed towards completing our first full year after adding Animal Health International to the Patterson family. 
We can clearly see, when you compare the customer profiles and their needs across both of our business segments, that our customer profiles are evolving towards small, midsize and large customer categories. Each has unique needs and different definitions for value, and our business model is well suited to address all of them. 
Finally, we remain committed to our 3-pronged capital allocation strategy. We believe there are more acquisition opportunities out there that can allow us to build on the platform we have created in a capital-efficient way. We will continue to explore these opportunities along with supporting our dividend and share repurchases. 
Now we'd like to take your questions. I'll turn the call back over to Leanne."

And sort of looking forward instead of looking backwards, we're really excited about the upcoming year. A-dec has some significant new product launches. In fact, our entire equipment sales force is in the process of being trained on these products at A-dec's factories in Oregon. And I'd say bottom line with the portfolio is we have more access to more customers. That's the constant feedback I have. I would say we were disappointed as we looked at our third quarter, which is the calendar fourth quarter, that the Section 179 issue did not get resolved but are very excited that, that is resolved, and it's part of the discussion today with our customers.

And I think this is a story that's going to play out over the long term, and we take a long-term perspective on this relationship, having been doing it for well over a decade. The initial feedback is that zirconia really opened up doors, once again, for a large segment of the dental population to look at CEREC again. And we always get excited when the innovation curve allows us to do that because many times, the impression of CEREC may be a dentist to look at the product 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago. So we have a lot of activity. I'm very pleased. I would say if there was a risk going into the fourth quarter when you have a new product launch and you have to train everyone up and you have to get the supply chain right and get the products in the right spot to serve the demand, there's a lot of risk in that side. I could not be more pleased with our Dental team and how they -- particularly our folks in the field and the branches, on how they met that demand for the customer.

So you might recall we were carrying higher levels of inventory but also higher levels in our long-term receivables for a number of reasons. You mentioned CEREC being one, which was certainly the case because of the delay in Section 179. But we also were carrying inventory levels higher than normal because of the consolidation and integration activities within the Animal Health business and the SAP implementation. So certainly, we saw good reductions in our investments in working capital, both in inventory and long-term receivables. Certainly, CEREC was a portion of that, and you'll see inventory, in total, came down nicely about $90 million. I think there's still room to improve in terms of working capital in total. As we move into FY '17, I think there's room to improve upon that. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we expect to get back to that 85% to 100% of net income to free cash flow conversion next year."

With that being said, I think one of the really exciting things that is coming out of the transformation of our Animal Health business is a real sense of excitement inside our companion business about what we can do to help our customers. So we think it's a great market with really strong underlying dynamics. And we think the Patterson position is going to a position that's going to grab market share over the coming year. So we continue to be very excited about that, and within the construct of our go-to-market, Abaxis continues to be a very important partner to us."

The diagnostics change actually annualized into our results last quarter. But I think, as you know, within that Animal Health segment, the terms and selling arrangements with the manufacturers do change from time to time. So what you saw this quarter with one manufacturer, their sales move from an agency relationship with us to a more traditional distributor role, which we refer to as buy/sell, and so that change that happened this quarter did add about 2 to 3 percentage points of revenue growth to that total Animal Health segment. And that change will continue to affect us for the next 4 -- or next 3 quarters."

But about 20% to 25% of that $25 million -- 20% to 25% of the $25 million step-up is depreciation. About 25% is rollout and implementation costs, so that's the piece that you can think about that would go away, right, in the back half of '18 as we complete the rollout. And then the balance is what's required to support the system. I think when you think about 2018 and how much comes out, we expect to see some benefits in the back half of '18 because the training and implementation is done. You're fully up and running, and so now you can turn off the legacy systems, and you can also now clearly harness the benefits of the new system. But I'm not ready to really publicly quantify dollar amounts at this time. We're still working on those estimates, refining them."

As I look at futures, it looks like beef and dairy futures have both taken a bit of a step-down even in the last month, 1.5 months. So how much of that 2% market growth is subject to we need to see a rebound in protein prices? Or can that be tagged more back to just if we bounce along at these levels?

It's been nearly 1 year since we completed the combination of portfolio changes that have led to the more aligned and focused Patterson Companies that we have today. The same boldness that led to broadening our view of our end markets and reshaping our business is now driving a renewed and intensified effort to look deeply at every aspect of our operations. We are driving to ensure that we are serving our customers with maximum effectiveness, anticipating and capitalizing on changes in our industry and running our business with optimal efficiency. This is the enterprisewide mindset at Patterson today, and it is carrying us forward in this fiscal 2017. Ensuring that our go-to-market approach is best aligned with and anticipates changes in the market will be a centerpiece of our growth efforts. I'd like to share some perspective on how that is playing out, especially in our dental business. 
Patterson Dental has been the market leader in transforming the customer experience. Through the years, we have implemented multiple initiatives that improves the lives of our customers and employees. Our early leadership in e-commerce help evolved the Patterson sales force to a truly value-added business partner. Today, our customers are ever more technology focused, relying on a combination of e-commerce and high touch consultative sales support to accommodate their needs and desired purchasing patterns. This means a significant opportunity for Patterson, and we intend to be at the forefront of this change. 
We have been laying the foundation for several quarters. And during the first quarter, we once again began the process of transforming the market with the realignment of our field sales force in our dental division. For some time, we have underscored our clear strengths and market leadership in technology and equipment sales. We have made clear the importance of our resource planning initiative, and we have committed to obtaining the necessary talent and skill sets needed to enhance our competitiveness. 
All of these efforts are components of a larger strategy to modernize and optimize our go-to-market strategy for successful future. Our new ERP system will provide the backbone and tool sets for a more expansive an effective e-commerce platform designed to accommodate the evolving buying patterns of our customers. You likely saw that we recently made a strategic hire in Todd Marshall, who joined us from Target Corp. as Chief Marketing and Digital Officer. Todd is responsible for further building out our enterprisewide marketing and e-commerce platforms. He is leading our efforts to enhance our digital road map and strategy. Todd will also be responsible for taking the business intelligence gained from our new business systems and help shape the customer experience across our businesses. We welcome Todd to our team.
The realignment of our sales force leverages our strongest performers and broadens their responsibilities. Our goal with this initiative is to generate higher productivity per salesperson and deeper market penetration. But most importantly, it is to deliver to our customers the sales experience they increasingly need. While creating more opportunity for our best-in-class sales force, it also allows us to increase investment in our technical service capabilities. We believe that enhancing our go-to-market strategy in dental will not only address a changing marketplace and customer but play directly to Patterson's strengths. 
Our passion for customer success is unwavering. We are committed to serving customers with the best sales, technical service and customer service expertise involving [indiscernible] best-in-class experience, we're excited to serve the needs of all types of dental professionals. 
Now some perspective on our markets and overall performance. Our first quarter results reflect a combination of general stability in our markets, Patterson's strengths and our willingness to make the short-term sacrifices to capture long-term opportunity. During the quarter, we continued to see overall stability in the dental market, and our results support that view. Consumer sales were slightly lower sequentially during the quarter. And while we did witness some end market softness in the sales category, we believe a significant portion of this impact resulted from the disruption caused by our sales force realignment initiative. As I mentioned earlier, we believe the longer-term benefits we intend to realize from this initiative are worth the short-term revenue impact. In fact, we are already experiencing some upside opportunities, particularly around equipment and technology purchases. 
In equipment, sales during the period were solid and our pipeline trends are positive. We believe this supports our view that dental practitioners are generally confident in patient volumes and remain willing to invest for the future success of their business. Within the category, volumes of basic equipment were healthy this quarter, and we were pleased with how our broader product portfolio is performing. 
Technology sales this quarter were led by CEREC, which had another outstanding quarter. Clearly, there are still considerable excitement about the Zirconia workflow for CEREC, and we are delighted by the level of traffic and buying interest at the CEREC world event this month. This was a highly successful event for us, and we expect the momentum we have to -- that we have built to continue. 
In the internal digital X-ray category, the softness we experienced last quarter continued. As I stated last quarter, the market in this category is substantially penetrated, and Patterson has earned significant share over time. However, we continue to see opportunities here and expect our go-to-market initiatives to generate momentum as we move forward and access new customers. 
Now I'll look at our Animal Health segment. Once again this quarter, we executed well against stable to steadily improving market conditions across both our companion and production animal businesses. We believe this is a direct result of our integration success and our team's ability to unify under the Patterson Animal Health banner. I'll remind you that the summer months are typically the softest for the production animal industry as animals have yet to be brought into feedlots. Considering this, we are particularly encouraged by the sales performance in our production animal business this quarter, which outpaced our expected and market growth rates. Like last quarter, we saw improvement in swine end markets and stable to improving conditions in beef cattle. 
In companion animal, we continued to execute well against severally improving market conditions in all regions. In the U.S. our companion animal business recorded double-digit organic growth. And NVS, our U.K. division, posted solid currency-adjusted gains this quarter. We are confident in our market position and ability to execute within our Animal Health segment and believe we are off to a right start in fiscal 2017. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials."
320186,379731157,1038928,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and thank you all for joining us today. Overall, we are pleased with the company's performance relative to the current market conditions across our businesses. Patterson continues to be very competitive in our chosen markets. And as Scot",1580,"Thank you, Scott, and thank you all for joining us today. Overall, we are pleased with the company's performance relative to the current market conditions across our businesses. Patterson continues to be very competitive in our chosen markets. And as Scott mentioned, we make continued progress in our efforts to build a platform for long-term growth and efficiency in an evolving marketplace. In reviewing the company's first quarter performance, I will discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to focus on our current portfolio of businesses as I've done in the past.
Please note that we had 1 less selling week in the fiscal 2017 first quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. Our first quarter sales also include a full quarter contribution from our acquisition of Animal Health International. As of June, this acquisition is now annualized into our results. Our contribution from Animal Health International was only 6 weeks in the prior period. Where appropriate, I will highlight organic sales, which strip out the contribution from the Animal Health acquisition, currency effects and the extra week. This will provide a more normalized view of results.
Taking a look at our top line performance. Consolidated sales for fiscal 2017 first quarter increased 16.6% to $1.3 billion on a GAAP basis. The extra week in last year's first quarter reduced this years reported sales by 5% to 6%, and currency translation negatively impacted the figure by about 2%. Organic revenue was in line with our trailing 12-month performance and grew 6.1%.
Turning to margins. As we previously stated, the core rationale for our portfolio realignment over the past year is to begin building platforms for long-term growth and return on invested capital. In exchange, we anticipated some margin dilution. Our consolidated operating margins reflected this. And with 1 less selling week in this year's fiscal first quarter, we had lower operating leverage. Our consolidated operating margin declined 110 basis points compared to the prior year quarter consistent with our expectations. 
On the bottom line. GAAP net income from continuing operations grew to $38.9 million, roughly doubling to $0.40 per diluted share compared to $20.3 million or $0.20 per diluted share a year ago. Adjusted net income from continuing operations, which excludes certain nonrecurring and deal amortization costs, totaled $48.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations rose 8.5% to $0.51 per diluted share, reflecting the company's solid performance in the current market.
Now let's move to our segments. In dental, we experienced stable markets in the 2017 first quarter. Patterson Dental sales declined 3.5% on a GAAP basis, but expanded by 2.1% organically. As Scott mentioned, we were pleased with our dental equipment sales, which grew 5.4%. We believe our momentum in equipment helps support our confidence in the end market.  Equipment sales in the first quarter were driven by a combination of strong demand for CEREC CAD/CAM systems and solid volumes in basic equipment. 
On the consumables side, consumable dental supplies increased about 1%. This growth reflects several factors, most notably the impact of our sales force realignment. As Scott said, dental [indiscernible] Patterson are evolving, and we are adapting to meet these needs. While we expect our dental sales force realignment will better position us for growth, it contributed, along with the extra selling week in last year's first quarter, to a 30 basis point contraction in dental operating margin. Patterson has a long tradition as an industry leader, and we expect to lead that this industry change in order to adapt to our customers shifting needs. Overall, we believe that our performance in the first quarter was strongly competitive relative to the industry.
Now turning to our Animal Health segment. Results in this business reflect a full quarter contribution from Animal Health International in the 2017 first quarter compared to a 6-week contribution from Animal Health International and the extra sales week in the year-ago period. At the end of June, the Animal Health International acquisition is annualized into our results.  Again in the first quarter, the company executed well in stable to steadily improving market conditions. And we saw solid performance in our Animal Health business in the 2017 first quarter, which outpaced our expected end market growth rates. Our Animal Health sales grew 36.8% on a GAAP basis. Currency translation lowered this number by 3%. 
We were pleased with the first quarter sales of our companion animal business. Organic companion animal sales grew 11.7%. Normalizing for changes in selling arrangements for certain products, U.S. companion animal sales grew 8.1%. 
Our performance in the production animal industry reflects encouraging improvement in the swine market. Overall, we believe we are well positioned in the production animal sector, and we expect that these end markets to continue to improve as the year moves on. The first quarter sales contribution from our production animal business totaled almost $362 million, a 3% increase on a pro forma basis. 
Operating margin for the Animal Health segment decreased 20 basis points to 3.2%. The first quarter margins reflect a combination of factors: a seasonally lowe sales quarter in production animal, the timing of product rebates and a less favorable product mix. 
In Animal Health, our ongoing activities and progress to planned synergies remains on track. Our synergies focus this fiscal year is more effectively leverage our supply chain across both of our businesses and further consolidate our back-office function. To this end, I'm pleased to say that we have achieved a major milestone and completely integrated the back office of operations of Animal Health International with Patterson. Further, we remain on target to achieve our stated goal of capturing between $20 million and $30 million in annualized synergies over a 3-year period. 
Now a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. Net cash used by operating activities from continuing operations was $72.8 million versus cash flow generated at $7.7 million in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, our first quarter is historically our lowest cash flow period. 
Additionally, inventories were up by $77 million year-over-year due to increased dental equipment purchases as well as higher inventory levels related to our ERP implementation to maintain service levels. 
We also continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy by returning cash for shareholders. Demonstrating our commitment to enhancing shareholder value, we returned approximately $49.2 million to our shareholder in dividends and share repurchases in the quarter. 
We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns in our business and expect to return to converting between 85% and 100% of net income into free cash flow in fiscal 2017.  CapEx totaled $15 million in the fiscal 2017 first quarter and included investments for normal replacements as well as our corporatewide information technology initiative. 
Turning now to tax rates. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 33%, which include the discrete tax benefit of $0.01 to $0.02 per diluted share relating to the new accounting standards on share-based compensation. Adjusted annual tax rate is expected to be in range of 34.5% to 35%. 
Now let me discuss our fiscal 2017 guidance. As we said, Patterson is midstream in a process of repositioning the company for larger growth [indiscernible] ahead. In fiscal 2017, we will continue to move through a period of intense execution on a range of initiatives that we believe are critical to top and bottom line expansion. It is also helpful to consider the market dynamics we expect to face.  At this early juncture in fiscal 2017, we currently anticipate stable markets in both dental and animal health. 
Our annual guidance range includes a pretax $25 million step up in operating expense associated with our ERP implementation. As we explained, this investment will start depreciating as we move further into broader implementation further this year. During this period, we will essentially be running redundant systems to help facilitate the transition to new platform. This step up in expense includes costs for depreciation, rollout and infrastructure support. We believe our new ERP platform will lead to efficiencies. However, some of them cannot be fully realized until the platform is completely implemented. That said, we believe we have a sound process in place to migrate to our new systems in a way that ensures business continuity and high levels of customer support and leads to significant future efficiencies once the transition is complete. 
We continue to make progress rolling out the ERP systems. After the first quarter end, 2 more pilot locations at dental branches went live in August. These sites are in addition to the previous 5 dental branches, 1 companion animal call center and 2 shared distribution centers that went live in our new ERP pilot program on February 1.  For fiscal year 2017, we expect consolidated operating margin to be flat to down slightly after absorbing the $25 million step up in ERP expenses, the majority of which will be allocated back to our business segments. 
We are monitoring various factors that can affect our end markets and therefore, Patterson's performance. With this in mind, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 guidance range for adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the range of $2.60 to $2.70 per diluted share. Our guidance range assumes normal international markets and excludes the impact of additional share repurchases, new acquisitions and transaction-related costs, integration and business restructuring expense and deal amortization. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments."

As Ann mentioned, pilot implementation for our enterprise resource planning initiative remains on track, and we're capitalizing on the learnings we are gaining from this process. While just the efficiency possibilities from this initiative is encouraging, the prospects of what this new systems holds for us as part of our go-to-market efforts in dental and animal health are truly exciting. Market conditions across our business continued to great opportunity for us. While we continue to closely monitor the health of our end markets, we are driving to build a Patterson Company that can compete in any market environment.

In looking at the North American consumable market, I would say we have seen some summer softness in the market, but really don't want to over react to it. Because if you look at it, there are really multiple signs towards the thesis that this will be short term in nature. I think we have a North American economy with strong consumer confidence. We have unemployment levels under 5%. We look internally to a strong pipeline for equipment and technology. And we also have done some pretty in-depth customer survey data that points to a rather encouraging outlook of our customers have going forward. So we obviously don't want to overreact to just a little softness over the summer months, but we'll continue to monitor the trend. Really some key months are August and September in terms of patient traffic. And remember, consumable sales lag patient traffic. So as the dentists get into with the sort of back the business time of mid-August to September and back to school, that will be something that we'll be watching very closely. But I would say, the underlying fundamentals of the market continued to be, we think, strong."

So what I would encourage you to do is if you look at last year's margin by quarter, and then you kind of take that 35 basis points increase that we're looking for and kind of spread it evenly throughout the back half of the year, that should get you close."

The inventories are up, but I would say this is really a continuation of really managing the technology and equipment supply chain and something we've worked through many times. I would say if I would point to anything, I would point back to our softer third quarter last year. And the one thing about technology products is you really want to make sure you're in a position to be able to fulfill demand, because selling cycles are shorter. So while we feel we're in a very good position going into the selling season, we're bullish about the opportunity ahead. But this is really more a function I think going back to the third quarter of last year. That being said, I would say we're very well positioned right now obviously in terms of inventory to meet the demand in what we think we will see in the second and third quarter."

Just from personal experience, if I go back to my days as a salesperson in San Francisco 20 years ago, we were installing electronic commerce systems before the Internet. We have been a leader. Over -- well over 80% of our consumables come electronically. That being said, when you think of all of technology our sales force has in front of us right now, and the productivity opportunities and how customers want to interact to us -- interact with us, both face-to-face but also digitally, it just leads to a model that we feel is going to evolve. And really this, at the end of the day, is about putting opportunity in front of our sales people and really be easy to do business with for a wide variety of customers. So we're pretty excited about how the market evolution will really play into the Patterson competitive strengths of great sales expertise, great customer service expertise and a technical services team with vast coverage in North America.

Let me give you a little context because I think it's important. Number one, we have a history of constantly evaluating the best way to leverage Patterson and our sales force in the most effective way for the customer. And two, I think it's very important to remind everyone. No company in North America as a wider sales and technical sales coverage than Patterson. And we have a history of doing this. So as a reminder, nearly 8 years ago, we took a hard look at our technology sales force, and we felt there was a more efficient way to sell digital technology products that made it easier to do business with. And we wanted to create more opportunity for our best salespeople. So we eliminated that sales role, and we moved the selling responsibilities to our established team. In doing so, we dramatically accelerated our digital X ray sales and Eaglesoft placements if you look at what we've done over the last 8 years. So bottom line is we created a better customer experience. The moves we made in June had a really similar underlying strategy. So we feel we can leverage technologies with our sales force. And we have an opportunity to become more productive, and we know we're leaders in e-commerce. So this is really about the customer and leading the market, not reacting to the market. But I want to be really clear, and don't want to have anyone misinterpret, that our sales force and our service coverage today is our competitive advantage, and it is incredibly important to our ongoing strategy. And bottom line, we're just putting our best people in front of more opportunities to drive the market and drive customer success."

It's been nearly 1 year since we completed the combination of portfolio changes that have led to the more aligned and focused Patterson Companies that we have today. The same boldness that led to broadening our view of our end markets and reshaping our business is now driving a renewed and intensified effort to look deeply at every aspect of our operations. We are driving to ensure that we are serving our customers with maximum effectiveness, anticipating and capitalizing on changes in our industry and running our business with optimal efficiency. This is the enterprisewide mindset at Patterson today, and it is carrying us forward in this fiscal 2017. Ensuring that our go-to-market approach is best aligned with and anticipates changes in the market will be a centerpiece of our growth efforts. I'd like to share some perspective on how that is playing out, especially in our dental business. 
Patterson Dental has been the market leader in transforming the customer experience. Through the years, we have implemented multiple initiatives that improves the lives of our customers and employees. Our early leadership in e-commerce help evolved the Patterson sales force to a truly value-added business partner. Today, our customers are ever more technology focused, relying on a combination of e-commerce and high touch consultative sales support to accommodate their needs and desired purchasing patterns. This means a significant opportunity for Patterson, and we intend to be at the forefront of this change. 
We have been laying the foundation for several quarters. And during the first quarter, we once again began the process of transforming the market with the realignment of our field sales force in our dental division. For some time, we have underscored our clear strengths and market leadership in technology and equipment sales. We have made clear the importance of our resource planning initiative, and we have committed to obtaining the necessary talent and skill sets needed to enhance our competitiveness. 
All of these efforts are components of a larger strategy to modernize and optimize our go-to-market strategy for successful future. Our new ERP system will provide the backbone and tool sets for a more expansive an effective e-commerce platform designed to accommodate the evolving buying patterns of our customers. You likely saw that we recently made a strategic hire in Todd Marshall, who joined us from Target Corp. as Chief Marketing and Digital Officer. Todd is responsible for further building out our enterprisewide marketing and e-commerce platforms. He is leading our efforts to enhance our digital road map and strategy. Todd will also be responsible for taking the business intelligence gained from our new business systems and help shape the customer experience across our businesses. We welcome Todd to our team.
The realignment of our sales force leverages our strongest performers and broadens their responsibilities. Our goal with this initiative is to generate higher productivity per salesperson and deeper market penetration. But most importantly, it is to deliver to our customers the sales experience they increasingly need. While creating more opportunity for our best-in-class sales force, it also allows us to increase investment in our technical service capabilities. We believe that enhancing our go-to-market strategy in dental will not only address a changing marketplace and customer but play directly to Patterson's strengths. 
Our passion for customer success is unwavering. We are committed to serving customers with the best sales, technical service and customer service expertise involving [indiscernible] best-in-class experience, we're excited to serve the needs of all types of dental professionals. 
Now some perspective on our markets and overall performance. Our first quarter results reflect a combination of general stability in our markets, Patterson's strengths and our willingness to make the short-term sacrifices to capture long-term opportunity. During the quarter, we continued to see overall stability in the dental market, and our results support that view. Consumer sales were slightly lower sequentially during the quarter. And while we did witness some end market softness in the sales category, we believe a significant portion of this impact resulted from the disruption caused by our sales force realignment initiative. As I mentioned earlier, we believe the longer-term benefits we intend to realize from this initiative are worth the short-term revenue impact. In fact, we are already experiencing some upside opportunities, particularly around equipment and technology purchases. 
In equipment, sales during the period were solid and our pipeline trends are positive. We believe this supports our view that dental practitioners are generally confident in patient volumes and remain willing to invest for the future success of their business. Within the category, volumes of basic equipment were healthy this quarter, and we were pleased with how our broader product portfolio is performing. 
Technology sales this quarter were led by CEREC, which had another outstanding quarter. Clearly, there are still considerable excitement about the Zirconia workflow for CEREC, and we are delighted by the level of traffic and buying interest at the CEREC world event this month. This was a highly successful event for us, and we expect the momentum we have to -- that we have built to continue. 
In the internal digital X-ray category, the softness we experienced last quarter continued. As I stated last quarter, the market in this category is substantially penetrated, and Patterson has earned significant share over time. However, we continue to see opportunities here and expect our go-to-market initiatives to generate momentum as we move forward and access new customers. 
Now I'll look at our Animal Health segment. Once again this quarter, we executed well against stable to steadily improving market conditions across both our companion and production animal businesses. We believe this is a direct result of our integration success and our team's ability to unify under the Patterson Animal Health banner. I'll remind you that the summer months are typically the softest for the production animal industry as animals have yet to be brought into feedlots. Considering this, we are particularly encouraged by the sales performance in our production animal business this quarter, which outpaced our expected and market growth rates. Like last quarter, we saw improvement in swine end markets and stable to improving conditions in beef cattle. 
In companion animal, we continued to execute well against severally improving market conditions in all regions. In the U.S. our companion animal business recorded double-digit organic growth. And NVS, our U.K. division, posted solid currency-adjusted gains this quarter. We are confident in our market position and ability to execute within our Animal Health segment and believe we are off to a right start in fiscal 2017. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials."
320186,379731157,1038950,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and thank you all for joining us today. Overall, we are pleased with the company's performance relative to the current market conditions across our businesses. Patterson continues to be very competitive in our chosen markets. And as Scot",1580,"Thank you, Scott, and thank you all for joining us today. Overall, we are pleased with the company's performance relative to the current market conditions across our businesses. Patterson continues to be very competitive in our chosen markets. And as Scott mentioned, we make continued progress in our efforts to build a platform for long-term growth and efficiency in an evolving marketplace. In reviewing the company's first quarter performance, I will discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to focus on our current portfolio of businesses as I've done in the past.
Please note that we had 1 less selling week in the fiscal 2017 first quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. Our first quarter sales also include a full quarter contribution from our acquisition of Animal Health International. As of June, this acquisition is now annualized into our results. Our contribution from Animal Health International was only 6 weeks in the prior period. Where appropriate, I will highlight organic sales, which strip out the contribution from the Animal Health acquisition, currency effects and the extra week. This will provide a more normalized view of results.
Taking a look at our top line performance. Consolidated sales for fiscal 2017 first quarter increased 16.6% to $1.3 billion on a GAAP basis. The extra week in last year's first quarter reduced this years reported sales by 5% to 6%, and currency translation negatively impacted the figure by about 2%. Organic revenue was in line with our trailing 12-month performance and grew 6.1%.
Turning to margins. As we previously stated, the core rationale for our portfolio realignment over the past year is to begin building platforms for long-term growth and return on invested capital. In exchange, we anticipated some margin dilution. Our consolidated operating margins reflected this. And with 1 less selling week in this year's fiscal first quarter, we had lower operating leverage. Our consolidated operating margin declined 110 basis points compared to the prior year quarter consistent with our expectations. 
On the bottom line. GAAP net income from continuing operations grew to $38.9 million, roughly doubling to $0.40 per diluted share compared to $20.3 million or $0.20 per diluted share a year ago. Adjusted net income from continuing operations, which excludes certain nonrecurring and deal amortization costs, totaled $48.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations rose 8.5% to $0.51 per diluted share, reflecting the company's solid performance in the current market.
Now let's move to our segments. In dental, we experienced stable markets in the 2017 first quarter. Patterson Dental sales declined 3.5% on a GAAP basis, but expanded by 2.1% organically. As Scott mentioned, we were pleased with our dental equipment sales, which grew 5.4%. We believe our momentum in equipment helps support our confidence in the end market.  Equipment sales in the first quarter were driven by a combination of strong demand for CEREC CAD/CAM systems and solid volumes in basic equipment. 
On the consumables side, consumable dental supplies increased about 1%. This growth reflects several factors, most notably the impact of our sales force realignment. As Scott said, dental [indiscernible] Patterson are evolving, and we are adapting to meet these needs. While we expect our dental sales force realignment will better position us for growth, it contributed, along with the extra selling week in last year's first quarter, to a 30 basis point contraction in dental operating margin. Patterson has a long tradition as an industry leader, and we expect to lead that this industry change in order to adapt to our customers shifting needs. Overall, we believe that our performance in the first quarter was strongly competitive relative to the industry.
Now turning to our Animal Health segment. Results in this business reflect a full quarter contribution from Animal Health International in the 2017 first quarter compared to a 6-week contribution from Animal Health International and the extra sales week in the year-ago period. At the end of June, the Animal Health International acquisition is annualized into our results.  Again in the first quarter, the company executed well in stable to steadily improving market conditions. And we saw solid performance in our Animal Health business in the 2017 first quarter, which outpaced our expected end market growth rates. Our Animal Health sales grew 36.8% on a GAAP basis. Currency translation lowered this number by 3%. 
We were pleased with the first quarter sales of our companion animal business. Organic companion animal sales grew 11.7%. Normalizing for changes in selling arrangements for certain products, U.S. companion animal sales grew 8.1%. 
Our performance in the production animal industry reflects encouraging improvement in the swine market. Overall, we believe we are well positioned in the production animal sector, and we expect that these end markets to continue to improve as the year moves on. The first quarter sales contribution from our production animal business totaled almost $362 million, a 3% increase on a pro forma basis. 
Operating margin for the Animal Health segment decreased 20 basis points to 3.2%. The first quarter margins reflect a combination of factors: a seasonally lowe sales quarter in production animal, the timing of product rebates and a less favorable product mix. 
In Animal Health, our ongoing activities and progress to planned synergies remains on track. Our synergies focus this fiscal year is more effectively leverage our supply chain across both of our businesses and further consolidate our back-office function. To this end, I'm pleased to say that we have achieved a major milestone and completely integrated the back office of operations of Animal Health International with Patterson. Further, we remain on target to achieve our stated goal of capturing between $20 million and $30 million in annualized synergies over a 3-year period. 
Now a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. Net cash used by operating activities from continuing operations was $72.8 million versus cash flow generated at $7.7 million in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, our first quarter is historically our lowest cash flow period. 
Additionally, inventories were up by $77 million year-over-year due to increased dental equipment purchases as well as higher inventory levels related to our ERP implementation to maintain service levels. 
We also continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy by returning cash for shareholders. Demonstrating our commitment to enhancing shareholder value, we returned approximately $49.2 million to our shareholder in dividends and share repurchases in the quarter. 
We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns in our business and expect to return to converting between 85% and 100% of net income into free cash flow in fiscal 2017.  CapEx totaled $15 million in the fiscal 2017 first quarter and included investments for normal replacements as well as our corporatewide information technology initiative. 
Turning now to tax rates. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 33%, which include the discrete tax benefit of $0.01 to $0.02 per diluted share relating to the new accounting standards on share-based compensation. Adjusted annual tax rate is expected to be in range of 34.5% to 35%. 
Now let me discuss our fiscal 2017 guidance. As we said, Patterson is midstream in a process of repositioning the company for larger growth [indiscernible] ahead. In fiscal 2017, we will continue to move through a period of intense execution on a range of initiatives that we believe are critical to top and bottom line expansion. It is also helpful to consider the market dynamics we expect to face.  At this early juncture in fiscal 2017, we currently anticipate stable markets in both dental and animal health. 
Our annual guidance range includes a pretax $25 million step up in operating expense associated with our ERP implementation. As we explained, this investment will start depreciating as we move further into broader implementation further this year. During this period, we will essentially be running redundant systems to help facilitate the transition to new platform. This step up in expense includes costs for depreciation, rollout and infrastructure support. We believe our new ERP platform will lead to efficiencies. However, some of them cannot be fully realized until the platform is completely implemented. That said, we believe we have a sound process in place to migrate to our new systems in a way that ensures business continuity and high levels of customer support and leads to significant future efficiencies once the transition is complete. 
We continue to make progress rolling out the ERP systems. After the first quarter end, 2 more pilot locations at dental branches went live in August. These sites are in addition to the previous 5 dental branches, 1 companion animal call center and 2 shared distribution centers that went live in our new ERP pilot program on February 1.  For fiscal year 2017, we expect consolidated operating margin to be flat to down slightly after absorbing the $25 million step up in ERP expenses, the majority of which will be allocated back to our business segments. 
We are monitoring various factors that can affect our end markets and therefore, Patterson's performance. With this in mind, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 guidance range for adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the range of $2.60 to $2.70 per diluted share. Our guidance range assumes normal international markets and excludes the impact of additional share repurchases, new acquisitions and transaction-related costs, integration and business restructuring expense and deal amortization. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments."

On balance, we are entering fiscal 2017 with several positive dynamics in our business that we believe put us in position to have a successful fiscal year. We face a full plate of initiatives designed to improve our top and bottom lines. We continue to make the progress and achieve the milestones we set for ourselves on the integration of our Animal Health platform. Today, we have a unified culture and a single voice in the market and we are poised to capitalize on market conditions as they improve throughout fiscal 2017. 
As Ann mentioned, pilot implementation for our enterprise resource planning initiative remains on track, and we're capitalizing on the learnings we are gaining from this process. While just the efficiency possibilities from this initiative is encouraging, the prospects of what this new systems holds for us as part of our go-to-market efforts in dental and animal health are truly exciting. Market conditions across our business continued to great opportunity for us. While we continue to closely monitor the health of our end markets, we are driving to build a Patterson Company that can compete in any market environment. 
Now with that, we'd like to take some questions, and I'll turn the call over to Don."

In looking at the North American consumable market, I would say we have seen some summer softness in the market, but really don't want to over react to it. Because if you look at it, there are really multiple signs towards the thesis that this will be short term in nature. I think we have a North American economy with strong consumer confidence. We have unemployment levels under 5%. We look internally to a strong pipeline for equipment and technology. And we also have done some pretty in-depth customer survey data that points to a rather encouraging outlook of our customers have going forward. So we obviously don't want to overreact to just a little softness over the summer months, but we'll continue to monitor the trend. Really some key months are August and September in terms of patient traffic. And remember, consumable sales lag patient traffic. So as the dentists get into with the sort of back the business time of mid-August to September and back to school, that will be something that we'll be watching very closely. But I would say, the underlying fundamentals of the market continued to be, we think, strong."

And two, I think it's very important to remind everyone. No company in North America as a wider sales and technical sales coverage than Patterson. And we have a history of doing this. So as a reminder, nearly 8 years ago, we took a hard look at our technology sales force, and we felt there was a more efficient way to sell digital technology products that made it easier to do business with. And we wanted to create more opportunity for our best salespeople. So we eliminated that sales role, and we moved the selling responsibilities to our established team.

So bottom line is we created a better customer experience. The moves we made in June had a really similar underlying strategy. So we feel we can leverage technologies with our sales force. And we have an opportunity to become more productive, and we know we're leaders in e-commerce. So this is really about the customer and leading the market, not reacting to the market. But I want to be really clear, and don't want to have anyone misinterpret, that our sales force and our service coverage today is our competitive advantage, and it is incredibly important to our ongoing strategy. And bottom line, we're just putting our best people in front of more opportunities to drive the market and drive customer success."

It's been nearly 1 year since we completed the combination of portfolio changes that have led to the more aligned and focused Patterson Companies that we have today. The same boldness that led to broadening our view of our end markets and reshaping our business is now driving a renewed and intensified effort to look deeply at every aspect of our operations. We are striving to ensure that we are serving our customers with maximum effectiveness, anticipating and capitalizing on changes in our industry and running our business with optimal efficiency. This is the enterprise-wide mindset at Patterson today, and it is carrying us forward into fiscal 2017. 
Ensuring that our go-to-market approach is best aligned with and anticipates changes in the market will be a centerpiece of our growth efforts. I'd like to share some perspective on how that is playing out, especially in our Dental business. 
Patterson Dental has been the market leader in transforming the customer experience. Through the years, we have implemented multiple initiatives that improve the lives of our customers and employees. Our early leadership in e-commerce helped evolve the Patterson sales force to a truly value-added business partner. Today, our customers are ever more technology-focused, relying on a combination of e-commerce and high-touch consultative sales support to accommodate their needs and desired purchasing patterns. This means a significant opportunity for Patterson, and we intend to be at the forefront of this change. 
We have been laying the foundation for several quarters, and during the first quarter, we once again began the process of transforming the market with the realignment of our field sales force in our Dental division. For some time, we have underscored our clear strengths and market leadership in technology and equipment sales. We have made clear the importance of our enterprise resource planning initiative, and we have committed to obtaining the necessary talent and skill sets needed to enhance our competitiveness. 
All of these efforts are components of a larger strategy to modernize and optimize our go-to-market strategy for a successful future. Our new ERP system will provide the backbone and tool sets for a more expansive and effective e-commerce platform designed to accommodate the evolving buying patterns of our customers. You likely saw that we recently made a strategic hire in Todd Marshall, who joined us from Target Corporation, as Chief Marketing and Digital Officer. Todd is responsible for further building out our enterprise-wide marketing and e-commerce platforms. He is leading our efforts to enhance our digital road map and strategy. Todd will also be responsible for taking the business intelligence gained from our new systems and help shape the customer experience across our businesses. We welcome Todd to our team.
The realignment of our sales force leverages our strongest performers and broadens their responsibilities. Our goal with this initiative is to generate higher productivity per salesperson and deeper market penetration. But most importantly, it is to deliver our customers the sales experience they increasingly need. While creating more opportunity for our best-in-class sales force, it also allows us to increase investment in our technical service capabilities. We believe that enhancing our go-to-market strategy in Dental will not only address a changing marketplace and customer but plays directly to Patterson's strengths. 
Our passion for customer success is unwavering. We are committed to serving customers with the best sales, technical service and customer service expertise. Combined with an evolving best-in-class digital experience, we are excited to serve the needs of all types of dental professionals. 
Now some perspective on our markets and overall performance. Our first quarter results reflect a combination of general stability in our markets, Patterson's strengths and our willingness to make the short-term sacrifices to capture long-term opportunity. During the quarter, we continued to see overall stability in the dental market, and our results support that view. 
Consumable sales were slightly lower sequentially during the quarter. And while we did witness some end market softness in the sales category, we believe a significant portion of this impact resulted from the disruption caused by our sales force realignment initiative. As I mentioned earlier, we believe the longer-term benefits we intend to realize from this initiative are worth the short-term revenue impact. In fact, we are already experiencing some upside opportunities, particularly around equipment and technology purchases. 
In equipment, sales during the period were solid and our pipeline trends are positive. We believe this supports our view that dental practitioners are generally confident in patient volumes and remain willing to invest for the future success of their business. Within the category, volumes of basic equipment were healthy this quarter, and we were pleased with how our broader product portfolio is performing. 
Technology sales this quarter were led by CEREC, which had another outstanding quarter. Clearly, there is still considerable excitement about the Zirconia workflow for CEREC, and we were delighted by the level of traffic and buying interest at the [indiscernible] world event earlier this month. This was a highly successful event for us, and we expect the momentum we have to -- that we have built to continue. 
In the internal digital X-ray category, the softness we experienced last quarter continued. As I stated last quarter, the market in this category is substantially penetrated, and Patterson has earned significant share over time. However, we continue to see opportunities here and expect our go-to-market initiative to generate momentum as we move forward and access new customers. 
Now a look at our Animal Health segment. Once again, this quarter, we executed well against stable to steadily improving market conditions across both our companion and production animal businesses. We believe this is a direct result of our integration success and our team's ability to unify under the Patterson Animal Health banner. I'll remind you that the summer months are typically the softest for the production animal industry as animals have yet to be brought into feedlots. Considering this, we are particularly encouraged by the sales performance in our production animal business this quarter, which outpaced our expected end market growth rates. Like last quarter, we saw improvement in swine end markets and stable to improving conditions in beef cattle. 
In companion animal, we continue to execute well against steadily improving market conditions in all of our regions. In the U.S., our companion animal business recorded double-digit organic growth. And NVS, our U.K. division, posted solid currency-adjusted gains this quarter. We are confident in our market position and ability to execute within our Animal Health segment and believe we are off to the right start in fiscal 2017. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials."

Overall, we are pleased with the company's performance relative to the current market conditions across our businesses. Patterson continues to be very competitive in our chosen markets. And as Scot",1583,"Thank you, Scott, and thank you all for joining us today. Overall, we are pleased with the company's performance relative to the current market conditions across our businesses. Patterson continues to be very competitive in our chosen markets. And as Scott mentioned, we made continued progress in our efforts to build a platform for long-term growth and efficiency in an evolving marketplace. 
In reviewing the company's first quarter performance, I will discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to focus on our current portfolio of businesses, as I've done in the past.
Please note that we had 1 less selling week in the fiscal 2017 first quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. Our first quarter sales also include a full quarter contribution from our acquisition of Animal Health International. As of June, this acquisition is now annualized into our results. Our contribution from Animal Health International was only 6 weeks in the prior period. Where appropriate, I will highlight organic sales, which strip out the incremental contribution from the Animal Health acquisition, currency effects and the extra week. This will provide a more normalized view of results.
Taking a look at our top line performance. Consolidated sales for fiscal 2017 first quarter increased 16.6% to $1.3 billion on a GAAP basis. The extra week in last year's first quarter reduced this years reported sales by 5% to 6%, and currency translation negatively impacted the figure by about 2%. Organic revenue was in line with our trailing 12-month performance and grew 6.1%.
Turning to margins. As we've previously stated, the core rationale for our portfolio realignment over the past year is to begin building platforms for long-term growth and return on invested capital. In exchange, we anticipated some margin dilution. Our consolidated operating margins reflect this, and with 1 less selling week in this year's fiscal first quarter, we had lower operating leverage. Our consolidated operating margin declined 110 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, consistent with our expectations. 
On the bottom line, GAAP net income from continuing operations grew to $38.9 million, roughly doubling to $0.40 per diluted share, compared to $20.3 million or $0.20 per diluted share a year ago. Adjusted net income from continuing operations, which excludes certain nonrecurring and deal amortization costs, totaled $48.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations rose 8.5% to $0.51 per diluted share, reflecting the company's solid performance in the current market.
Now let's move to our segments. In Dental, we experienced stable markets in the 2017 first quarter. Patterson Dental sales declined 3.5% on a GAAP basis but expanded by 2.1% organically. As Scott mentioned, we were pleased with our dental equipment sales, which grew 5.4%. We believe our momentum in equipment helps support our confidence in the end market. Equipment sales in the first quarter were driven by a combination of strong demand for CEREC CAD/CAM systems and solid volumes in basic equipment. 
On the consumable side, consumable dental supplies increased about 1%. This growth reflects several factors, most notably the impact of our sales force realignment. As Scott said, dental purchasing patterns are evolving, and we are adapting to meet these needs. While we expect our Dental sales force realignment will better position us for growth, it contributed, along with the extra selling week in last year's first quarter, to a 30 basis point contraction in Dental operating margin. Patterson has a long tradition as an industry leader, and we expect to lead this industry change in order to adapt to our customers' shifting needs. Overall, we believe that our performance in the first quarter was strongly competitive relative to the industry.
Now turning to our Animal Health segment. Results in this business reflect a full quarter contribution from Animal Health International in the 2017 first quarter compared to a 6-week contribution from Animal Health International and the extra sales week in the year-ago period. At the end of June, the Animal Health International acquisition is annualized into our results. Again, in the first quarter, the company executed well in stable to steadily improving market conditions, and we saw solid performance in our Animal Health business in the 2017 first quarter, which outpaced our expected end market growth rates. Our Animal Health sales grew 36.8% on a GAAP basis. Currency translation lowered this number by 3%. 
We were pleased with the first quarter sales of our companion animal business. Organic companion animal sales grew 11.7%. Normalizing for changes in selling arrangements for certain products, U.S. companion animal sales grew 8.1%. 
Our performance in the production animal industry reflects encouraging improvement in the swine market. Overall, we believe we are well positioned in the production animal sector, and we expect the beef end markets to continue to improve as the year moves on. The first quarter sales contribution from our production animal business totaled almost $362 million, a 3% increase on a pro forma basis. 
Operating margin for the Animal Health segment decreased 20 basis points to 3.2%. The first quarter margins reflect a combination of factors: a seasonally low sales quarter in production animal, the timing of product rebates and a less favorable product mix. 
In Animal Health, our ongoing integration activities and progress to our planned synergies remains on track. Our synergy focus this fiscal year is more effectively leverage our supply chain across both of our businesses and further consolidate our back-office functions. To this end, I'm pleased to say that we've achieved a major milestone and completely integrated the back-office operations of Animal Health International with Patterson. Further, we remain on target to achieve our stated goal of capturing between $20 million and $30 million in annualized synergies over a 3-year period. 
Now a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. Net cash used by operating activities from continuing operations was $72.8 million versus cash flow generated of $7.7 million in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, our first quarter is historically our lowest cash flow period. 
Additionally, inventories were up by $77 million year-over-year due to increased dental equipment purchases as well as higher inventory levels related to our ERP implementation to maintain service levels. 
We also continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy by returning cash to our shareholders. Demonstrating our commitment to enhancing shareholder value, we returned approximately $49.2 million to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. 
We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns in our business and expect to return to converting between 85% and 100% of net income to free cash flow in fiscal 2017. CapEx totaled $15 million in the fiscal 2017 first quarter and included investments for normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiative. 
Turning now to tax rates. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 33%, which includes the discrete tax benefit of $0.01 to $0.02 per diluted share related to the new accounting standard on share-based compensation. The adjusted annual tax rate is expected to be in the range of 34.5% to 35%. 
Now let me discuss our fiscal 2017 guidance. As we've said, Patterson is midstream in a process of repositioning the company for larger growth goals ahead. In fiscal 2017, we will continue to move through a period of intense execution on a range of initiatives that we believe are critical to top and bottom line expansion. It is also helpful to consider the market dynamics we expect to face.  At this early juncture in fiscal 2017, we currently anticipate stable markets in both Dental and Animal Health. 
Our annual guidance range includes a pretax $25 million step-up in operating expense associated with our ERP implementation. As we explained, this investment will start depreciating as we move further into broader implementation  later this year. During this period, we will essentially be running redundant systems to help facilitate the transition to our new platform. This step-up in expense includes costs for depreciation, rollout and infrastructure support. We believe our new ERP platform will lead to new efficiencies. However, some of them cannot be fully realized until the platform is completely implemented. That said, we believe we have a sound process in place to migrate to our new systems in a way that ensures business continuity and high levels of customer support and leads to significant future efficiencies once the transition is complete. 
We continue to make progress rolling out the ERP system. After the first quarter-end, 2 more pilot locations and dental branches went live in August. These sites are in addition to the previous 5 dental branches, 1 companion animal call center and 2 shared distribution centers that went live in our new ERP pilot program on February 1.  For fiscal year 2017, we expect consolidated operating margins to be flat to down slightly after absorbing the $25 million step-up in ERP expenses, the majority of which will be allocated back to our business segments. 
We are monitoring various factors that can affect our end markets and, therefore, Patterson's performance. With this in mind, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 guidance range for adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the range of $2.60 to $2.70 per diluted share. Our guidance range assumes stable North American and international markets and excludes the impact of additional share repurchases, new acquisitions and transaction-related costs, integration and business restructuring expense and deal amortization. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments."

When looking at the North American consumable market, I would say we have seen some summer softness to the market but really don't want to overreact to it because when you look at it, there are really multiple signs towards the thesis that this will be short-term in nature. I think we have a North American economy with strong consumer confidence. We have unemployment levels under 5%. We look internally to a strong pipeline for equipment and technology. And we also have done some pretty in-depth customer survey data that points towards a rather encouraging outlook that our customers have going forward. So we obviously don't want to overreact to just a little softness over the summer months, but we'll continue to monitor the trend. Really, some key months are August and September in terms of patient traffic. And remember, consumable sales lag patient traffic. So as the dentists get into what the -- sort of the back-to-business time of mid-August to September and back-to-school, that will be something that we'll be watching very closely. But I would say the underlying fundamentals of the market continue to be, we think, strong."

So just trying to figure out -- I heard what you said on pipeline, but as we're all trying to figure out end markets here, is any of that inventory moving up a reflection of the equipment sales out the door have slowed here in the last month or 2? I could also imagine a scenario where -- when you we were making the sales force changes in June, that maybe you were a little hesitant to buy equipment then. So it was just July equipment purchase, and that kind of caused some timing issues with how your balance sheet closes in the quarter in that.

Just from personal experience, if I go back to my days as a salesperson in San Francisco 20 years ago, we were installing electronic commerce systems before the Internet. We have been a leader. Over -- well over 80% of our consumables come electronically. That being said, when you think of all of the technology our sales force has in front of us right now and the productivity opportunities and how customers want to interact to us -- interact with us, both face-to-face but also digitally, it just leads to a model that we feel is going to evolve. And really, this, at the end of the day, is about putting more opportunity in front of our best sales people and really being easy to do business with for a wide variety of customers. So we're pretty excited about how the market evolution will really play into the Patterson competitive strengths of great sales expertise, great customer service expertise and a technical service team with vast coverage in North America.

Let me give you a little context because I think it's important. Number one, we have a history of constantly evaluating the best way to leverage Patterson and our sales force in the most effective way for the customer. And two, I think it's very important to remind everyone. No company in North America has a wider sales and technical service coverage than Patterson. And we have a history of doing this. So as a reminder, nearly 8 years ago, we took a hard look at our technology sales force, and we felt there was a more efficient way to sell digital technology products that made us easier to do business with. And we wanted to create more opportunity for our best salespeople. So we eliminated that sales role, and we moved the selling responsibilities to our established team. In doing so, we dramatically accelerated our digital X-ray sales and Eaglesoft placements if you look at what we've done over the last 8 years. So bottom line is we created a better customer experience. The moves we made in June had a really similar underlying strategy, so we feel we can leverage technology with our sales force, and we have an opportunity to become more productive. And we know we're leaders in e-commerce, so this is really about the customer and leading a market, not reacting to a market. But I want to be really clear and don't want to have anyone misinterpret that our sales force and our service coverage, today, is our competitive advantage, and it is incredibly important to our ongoing strategy. And bottom line, we're just putting our best people in front of more opportunities to drive the market and drive customer success."

It's been nearly 1 year since we completed the combination of portfolio changes that have led to the more aligned and focused Patterson Companies that we have today. The same boldness that led to broadening our view of our end markets and reshaping our business is now driving a renewed and intensified effort to look deeply at every aspect of our operations. We are striving to ensure that we are serving our customers with maximum effectiveness, anticipating and capitalizing on changes in our industry and running our business with optimal efficiency. This is the enterprise-wide mindset at Patterson today, and it is carrying us forward into fiscal 2017. 
Ensuring that our go-to-market approach is best aligned with and anticipates changes in the market will be a centerpiece of our growth efforts. I'd like to share some perspective on how that is playing out, especially in our Dental business. 
Patterson Dental has been the market leader in transforming the customer experience. Through the years, we have implemented multiple initiatives that improve the lives of our customers and employees. Our early leadership in e-commerce helped evolve the Patterson sales force to a truly value-added business partner. Today, our customers are ever more technology-focused, relying on a combination of e-commerce and high-touch consultative sales support to accommodate their needs and desired purchasing patterns. This means a significant opportunity for Patterson, and we intend to be at the forefront of this change. 
We have been laying the foundation for several quarters, and during the first quarter, we once again began the process of transforming the market with the realignment of our field sales force in our Dental division. For some time, we have underscored our clear strengths and market leadership in technology and equipment sales. We have made clear the importance of our enterprise resource planning initiative, and we have committed to obtaining the necessary talent and skill sets needed to enhance our competitiveness. 
All of these efforts are components of a larger strategy to modernize and optimize our go-to-market strategy for a successful future. Our new ERP system will provide the backbone and tool sets for a more expansive and effective e-commerce platform designed to accommodate the evolving buying patterns of our customers. You likely saw that we recently made a strategic hire in Todd Marshall, who joined us from Target Corporation, as Chief Marketing and Digital Officer. Todd is responsible for further building out our enterprise-wide marketing and e-commerce platforms. He is leading our efforts to enhance our digital road map and strategy. Todd will also be responsible for taking the business intelligence gained from our new systems and help shape the customer experience across our businesses. We welcome Todd to our team.
The realignment of our sales force leverages our strongest performers and broadens their responsibilities. Our goal with this initiative is to generate higher productivity per salesperson and deeper market penetration. But most importantly, it is to deliver our customers the sales experience they increasingly need. While creating more opportunity for our best-in-class sales force, it also allows us to increase investment in our technical service capabilities. We believe that enhancing our go-to-market strategy in Dental will not only address a changing marketplace and customer but plays directly to Patterson's strengths. 
Our passion for customer success is unwavering. We are committed to serving customers with the best sales, technical service and customer service expertise. Combined with an evolving best-in-class digital experience, we are excited to serve the needs of all types of dental professionals. 
Now some perspective on our markets and overall performance. Our first quarter results reflect a combination of general stability in our markets, Patterson's strengths and our willingness to make the short-term sacrifices to capture long-term opportunity. During the quarter, we continued to see overall stability in the dental market, and our results support that view. 
Consumable sales were slightly lower sequentially during the quarter. And while we did witness some end market softness in the sales category, we believe a significant portion of this impact resulted from the disruption caused by our sales force realignment initiative. As I mentioned earlier, we believe the longer-term benefits we intend to realize from this initiative are worth the short-term revenue impact. In fact, we are already experiencing some upside opportunities, particularly around equipment and technology purchases. 
In equipment, sales during the period were solid and our pipeline trends are positive. We believe this supports our view that dental practitioners are generally confident in patient volumes and remain willing to invest for the future success of their business. Within the category, volumes of basic equipment were healthy this quarter, and we were pleased with how our broader product portfolio is performing. 
Technology sales this quarter were led by CEREC, which had another outstanding quarter. Clearly, there is still considerable excitement about the Zirconia workflow for CEREC, and we were delighted by the level of traffic and buying interest at the CERO World [ph] event earlier this month. This was a highly successful event for us, and we expect the momentum we have to -- that we have built to continue. 
In the internal digital X-ray category, the softness we experienced last quarter continued. As I stated last quarter, the market in this category is substantially penetrated, and Patterson has earned significant share over time. However, we continue to see opportunities here and expect our go-to-market initiative to generate momentum as we move forward and access new customers. 
Now a look at our Animal Health segment. Once again, this quarter, we executed well against stable to steadily improving market conditions across both our companion and production animal businesses. We believe this is a direct result of our integration success and our teams' ability to unify under the Patterson Animal Health banner. I'll remind you that the summer months are typically the softest for the production animal industry as animals have yet to be brought into feedlots. Considering this, we are particularly encouraged by the sales performance in our production animal business this quarter, which outpaced our expected end market growth rates. Like last quarter, we saw improvement in swine end markets and stable to improving conditions in beef cattle. 
In companion animal, we continue to execute well against steadily improving market conditions in all of our regions. In the U.S., our companion animal business recorded double-digit organic growth. And NVS, our U.K. division, posted solid currency-adjusted gains this quarter. We are confident in our market position and ability to execute within our Animal Health segment and believe we are off to the right start in fiscal 2017. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials."

Patterson continues to be very competitive in our chosen markets. And as Scott mentioned, we made continued progress in our efforts to build a platform for long-term growth and efficiency in an evolving marketplace. 
In reviewing the company's first quarter performance, I will discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to focus on our current portfolio of businesses, as I've done in the past.
Please note that we had 1 less selling week in the fiscal 2017 first quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. Our first quarter sales also include a full quarter contribution from our acquisition of Animal Health International. As of June, this acquisition is now annualized into our results. Our contribution from Animal Health International was only 6 weeks in the prior period. Where appropriate, I will highlight organic sales, which strip out the incremental contribution from the Animal Health acquisition, currency effects and the extra week. This will provide a more normalized view of results.
Taking a look at our top line performance. Consolidated sales for fiscal 2017 first quarter increased 16.6% to $1.3 billion on a GAAP basis. The extra week in last year's first quarter reduced this years reported sales by 5% to 6%, and currency translation negatively impacted the figure by about 2%. Organic revenue was in line with our trailing 12-month performance and grew 6.1%.
Turning to margins. As we've previously stated, the core rationale for our portfolio realignment over the past year is to begin building platforms for long-term growth and return on invested capital. In exchange, we anticipated some margin dilution. Our consolidated operating margins reflect this, and with 1 less selling week in this year's fiscal first quarter, we had lower operating leverage. Our consolidated operating margin declined 110 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, consistent with our expectations. 
On the bottom line, GAAP net income from continuing operations grew to $38.9 million, roughly doubling to $0.40 per diluted share, compared to $20.3 million or $0.20 per diluted share a year ago. Adjusted net income from continuing operations, which excludes certain nonrecurring and deal amortization costs, totaled $48.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations rose 8.5% to $0.51 per diluted share, reflecting the company's solid performance in the current market.
Now let's move to our segments. In Dental, we experienced stable markets in the 2017 first quarter. Patterson Dental sales declined 3.5% on a GAAP basis but expanded by 2.1% organically. As Scott mentioned, we were pleased with our dental equipment sales, which grew 5.4%. We believe our momentum in equipment helped support our confidence in the end market. Equipment sales in the first quarter were driven by a combination of strong demand for CEREC CAD/CAM systems and solid volumes in basic equipment. 
On the consumable side, consumable dental supplies increased about 1%. This growth reflects several factors, most notably the impact of our sales force realignment. As Scott said, dental purchasing patterns are evolving, and we are adapting to meet these needs. While we expect our Dental sales force realignment will better position us for growth, it contributed, along with the extra selling week in last year's first quarter, to a 30 basis point contraction in Dental operating margin. Patterson has a long tradition as an industry leader, and we expect to lead this industry change in order to adapt to our customers' shifting needs. Overall, we believe that our performance in the first quarter was strongly competitive relative to the industry.
Now turning to our Animal Health segment. Results in this business reflect a full quarter contribution from Animal Health International in the 2017 first quarter compared to a 6-week contribution from Animal Health International and the extra sales week in the year-ago period. At the end of June, the Animal Health International acquisition is annualized into our results. 
Again, in the first quarter, the company executed well in stable to steadily improving market conditions, and we saw solid performance in our Animal Health business in the 2017 first quarter, which outpaced our expected end market growth rates. Our Animal Health sales grew 36.8% on a GAAP basis. Currency translation lowered this number by 3%. 
We were pleased with the first quarter sales of our companion animal business. Organic companion animal sales grew 11.7%. Normalizing for changes in selling arrangements for certain products, U.S. companion animal sales grew 8.1%. 
Our performance in the production animal industry reflects encouraging improvement in the swine market. Overall, we believe we are well positioned in the production animal sector, and we expect the beef end markets to continue to improve as the year moves on. The first quarter sales contribution from our production animal business totaled almost $362 million, a 3% increase on a pro forma basis. 
Operating margin for the Animal Health segment decreased 20 basis points to 3.2%. The first quarter margins reflect a combination of factors: a seasonally low sales quarter in production animal, the timing of product rebates and a less favorable product mix. 
In Animal Health, our ongoing integration activities and progress to our planned synergies remains on track. Our synergy focus this fiscal year is more effectively leverage our supply chain across both of our businesses and further consolidate our back-office functions. To this end, I'm pleased to say that we've achieved a major milestone and completely integrated the back-office operations of Animal Health International with Patterson. Further, we remain on target to achieve our stated goal of capturing between $20 million and $30 million in annualized synergies over a 3-year period. 
Now a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. Net cash used by operating activities from continuing operations was $72.8 million versus cash flow generated of $7.7 million in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, our first quarter is historically our lowest cash flow period. 
Additionally, inventories were up by $77 million year-over-year due to increased dental equipment purchases as well as higher inventory levels related to our ERP implementation to maintain service levels. 
We also continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy by returning cash to our shareholders. Demonstrating our commitment to enhancing shareholder value, we returned approximately $49.2 million to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. 
We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns in our business and expect to return to converting between 85% and 100% of net income to free cash flow in fiscal 2017. CapEx totaled $15 million in the fiscal 2017 first quarter and included investments for normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiative. 
Turning now to tax rates. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 33%, which includes the discrete tax benefit of $0.01 to $0.02 per diluted share related to the new accounting standard on share-based compensation. The adjusted annual tax rate is expected to be in the range of 34.5% to 35%. 
Now let me discuss our fiscal 2017 guidance. As we've said, Patterson is midstream in a process of repositioning the company for larger growth goals ahead. In fiscal 2017, we will continue to move through a period of intense execution on a range of initiatives that we believe are critical to top and bottom line expansion. It is also helpful to consider the market dynamics we expect to face. At this early juncture in fiscal 2017, we currently anticipate stable markets in both Dental and Animal Health. 
Our annual guidance range includes a pretax $25 million step-up in operating expense associated with our ERP implementation. As we explained, this investment will start depreciating as we move further into broader implementation later this year. During this period, we will essentially be running redundant systems to help facilitate the transition to our new platform. This step-up in expense includes costs for depreciation, rollout and infrastructure support. We believe our new ERP platform will lead to new efficiencies. However, some of them cannot be fully realized until the platform is completely implemented. That said, we believe we have a sound process in place to migrate to our new systems in a way that ensures business continuity and high levels of customer support and leads to significant future efficiencies once the transition is complete. 
We continue to make progress rolling out the ERP system. After the first quarter-end, 2 more pilot locations and dental branches went live in August. These sites are in addition to the previous 5 dental branches, 1 companion animal call center and 2 shared distribution centers that went live in our new ERP pilot program on February 1. For fiscal year 2017, we expect consolidated operating margins to be flat to down slightly after absorbing the $25 million step-up in ERP expenses, the majority of which will be allocated back to our business segments. 
We are monitoring various factors that can affect our end markets and, therefore, Patterson's performance. With this in mind, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 guidance range for adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the range of $2.60 to $2.70 per diluted share. Our guidance range assumes stable North American and international markets and excludes the impact of additional share repurchases, new acquisitions and transaction-related costs, integration and business restructuring expense and deal amortization. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments."

Today, we have a unified culture and a single voice in the market, and we are poised to capitalize on market conditions as they improve throughout fiscal 2017. 
As Ann mentioned, pilot implementation for our enterprise resource planning initiative remains on track, and we are capitalizing on the learnings we are gaining from this process. While just the efficiency possibilities from this initiative is encouraging, the prospects of what this new systems (sic) [system] holds for us as part of our go-to-market efforts in Dental and Animal Health are truly exciting. Market conditions across our business continue to create opportunity for us. While we continue to closely monitor the health of our end markets, we are striving to build a Patterson Companies that can compete in any market environment. 
Now with that, we'd like to take any questions, and I'll turn the call over to Don."

Thanks, Jon. When looking at the North American consumable market, I would say we have seen some summer softness to the market but really don't want to overreact to it because when you look at it, there are really multiple signs towards the thesis that this will be short-term in nature. I think we have a North American economy with strong consumer confidence. We have unemployment levels under 5%. We look internally to a strong pipeline for equipment and technology. And we also have done some pretty in-depth customer survey data that points towards a rather encouraging outlook that our customers have going forward. So we obviously don't want to overreact to just a little softness over the summer months, but we'll continue to monitor the trend. Really, some key months are August and September in terms of patient traffic. And remember, consumable sales lag patient traffic. So as the dentists get into what the -- sort of the back-to-business time of mid-August to September and back-to-school, that will be something that we'll be watching very closely. But I would say the underlying fundamentals of the market continue to be, we think, strong."

And I think this is one area where Patterson has always been a leader. Just from personal experience, if I go back to my days as a salesperson in San Francisco 20 years ago, we were installing electronic commerce systems before the Internet. We have been a leader. Over -- well over 80% of our consumables come electronically. That being said, when you think of all of the technology our sales force has in front of us right now and the productivity opportunities and how customers want to interact to us -- interact with us, both face-to-face but also digitally, it just leads to a model that we feel is going to evolve. And really, this, at the end of the day, is about putting more opportunity in front of our best sales people and really being easy to do business with for a wide variety of customers. So we're pretty excited about how the market evolution will really play into the Patterson competitive strengths of great sales expertise, great customer service expertise and a technical service team with vast coverage in North America. So it's really a continued evolution of a strategy that we've really played out over 20 years."

Let me give you a little context because I think it's important. Number one, we have a history of constantly evaluating the best way to leverage Patterson and our sales force in the most effective way for the customer. And two, I think it's very important to remind everyone. No company in North America has a wider sales and technical service coverage than Patterson. And we have a history of doing this. So as a reminder, nearly 8 years ago, we took a hard look at our technology sales force, and we felt there was a more efficient way to sell digital technology products that made us easier to do business with. And we wanted to create more opportunity for our best salespeople. So we eliminated that sales role, and we moved the selling responsibilities to our established team. In doing so, we dramatically accelerated our digital X-ray sales and Eaglesoft placements if you look at what we've done over the last 8 years. So bottom line is we created a better customer experience. The moves we made in June had a really similar underlying strategy, so we feel we can leverage technology with our sales force, and we have an opportunity to become more productive. And we know we're leaders in e-commerce, so this is really about the customer and leading a market, not reacting to a market. But I want to be really clear and don't want to have anyone misinterpret that our sales force and our service coverage, today, is our competitive advantage, and it is incredibly important to our ongoing strategy. And bottom line, we're just putting our best people in front of more opportunities to drive the market and drive customer success."

It's been nearly 1 year since we completed the combination of portfolio changes that have led to the more aligned and focused Patterson Companies that we have today. The same boldness that led to broadening our view of our end markets and reshaping our business is now driving a renewed and intensified effort to look deeply at every aspect of our operations. We are striving to ensure that we are serving our customers with maximum effectiveness, anticipating and capitalizing on changes in our industry and running our business with optimal efficiency. This is the enterprise-wide mindset at Patterson today, and it is carrying us forward into fiscal 2017. 
Ensuring that our go-to-market approach is best aligned with and anticipates changes in the market will be a centerpiece of our growth efforts. I'd like to share some perspective on how that is playing out, especially in our Dental business. 
Patterson Dental has been the market leader in transforming the customer experience. Through the years, we have implemented multiple initiatives that improve the lives of our customers and employees. Our early leadership in e-commerce helped evolve the Patterson sales force to a truly value-added business partner. Today, our customers are ever more technology-focused, relying on a combination of e-commerce and high-touch consultative sales support to accommodate their needs and desired purchasing patterns. This means a significant opportunity for Patterson, and we intend to be at the forefront of this change. 
We have been laying the foundation for several quarters, and during the first quarter, we once again began the process of transforming the market with the realignment of our field sales force in our Dental division. For some time, we have underscored our clear strengths and market leadership in technology and equipment sales. We have made clear the importance of our enterprise resource planning initiative, and we have committed to obtaining the necessary talent and skill sets needed to enhance our competitiveness. 
All of these efforts are components of a larger strategy to modernize and optimize our go-to-market strategy for a successful future. Our new ERP system will provide the backbone and tool sets for a more expansive and effective e-commerce platform designed to accommodate the evolving buying patterns of our customers. You likely saw that we recently made a strategic hire in Todd Marshall, who joined us from Target Corporation, as Chief Marketing and Digital Officer. Todd is responsible for further building out our enterprise-wide marketing and e-commerce platforms. He is leading our efforts to enhance our digital road map and strategy. Todd will also be responsible for taking the business intelligence gained from our new systems and help shape the customer experience across our businesses. We welcome Todd to our team.
The realignment of our sales force leverages our strongest performers and broadens their responsibilities. Our goal with this initiative is to generate higher productivity per salesperson and deeper market penetration. But most importantly, it is to deliver our customers the sales experience they increasingly need. While creating more opportunity for our best-in-class sales force, it also allows us to increase investment in our technical service capabilities. We believe that enhancing our go-to-market strategy in Dental will not only address a changing marketplace and customer but plays directly to Patterson's strengths. 
Our passion for customer success is unwavering. We are committed to serving customers with the best sales, technical service and customer service expertise. Combined with an evolving best-in-class digital experience, we are excited to serve the needs of all types of dental professionals. 
Now some perspective on our markets and overall performance. Our first quarter results reflect a combination of general stability in our markets, Patterson's strengths and our willingness to make the short-term sacrifices to capture long-term opportunity. During the quarter, we continued to see overall stability in the dental market, and our results support that view. 
Consumable sales were slightly lower sequentially during the quarter. And while we did witness some end market softness in the sales category, we believe a significant portion of this impact resulted from the disruption caused by our sales force realignment initiative. As I mentioned earlier, we believe the longer-term benefits we intend to realize from this initiative are worth the short-term revenue impact. In fact, we are already experiencing some upside opportunities, particularly around equipment and technology purchases. 
In equipment, sales during the period were solid and our pipeline trends are positive. We believe this supports our view that dental practitioners are generally confident in patient volumes and remain willing to invest for the future success of their business. Within the category, volumes of basic equipment were healthy this quarter, and we were pleased with how our broader product portfolio is performing. 
Technology sales this quarter were led by CEREC, which had another outstanding quarter. Clearly, there is still considerable excitement about the Zirconia workflow for CEREC, and we were delighted by the level of traffic and buying interest at the CERO World [ph] event earlier this month. This was a highly successful event for us, and we expect the momentum we have to -- that we have built to continue. 
In the internal digital X-ray category, the softness we experienced last quarter continued. As I stated last quarter, the market in this category is substantially penetrated, and Patterson has earned significant share over time. However, we continue to see opportunities here and expect our go-to-market initiative to generate momentum as we move forward and access new customers. 
Now a look at our Animal Health segment. Once again, this quarter, we executed well against stable to steadily improving market conditions across both our companion and production animal businesses. We believe this is a direct result of our integration success and our teams' ability to unify under the Patterson Animal Health banner. I'll remind you that the summer months are typically the softest for the production animal industry as animals have yet to be brought into feedlots. Considering this, we are particularly encouraged by the sales performance in our production animal business this quarter, which outpaced our expected end market growth rates. Like last quarter, we saw improvement in swine end markets and stable to improving conditions in beef cattle. 
In companion animal, we continue to execute well against steadily improving market conditions in all of our regions. In the U.S., our companion animal business recorded double-digit organic growth. And NVS, our U.K. division, posted solid currency-adjusted gains this quarter. We are confident in our market position and ability to execute within our Animal Health segment and believe we are off to the right start in fiscal 2017. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials."
320186,379731157,1039419,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott, and thank you all for joining us today. Overall, we are pleased with the company's performance relative to the current market conditions across our businesses. Patterson continues to be very competitive in our chosen markets.

Patterson continues to be very competitive in our chosen markets. And as Scott mentioned, we made continued progress in our efforts to build a platform for long-term growth and efficiency in an evolving marketplace. 
In reviewing the company's first quarter performance, I will discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to focus on our current portfolio of businesses, as I've done in the past.
Please note that we had 1 less selling week in the fiscal 2017 first quarter compared to the year-ago quarter. Our first quarter sales also include a full quarter contribution from our acquisition of Animal Health International. As of June, this acquisition is now annualized into our results. Our contribution from Animal Health International was only 6 weeks in the prior period. Where appropriate, I will highlight organic sales, which strip out the incremental contribution from the Animal Health acquisition, currency effects and the extra week. This will provide a more normalized view of results.
Taking a look at our top line performance. Consolidated sales for fiscal 2017 first quarter increased 16.6% to $1.3 billion on a GAAP basis. The extra week in last year's first quarter reduced this years reported sales by 5% to 6%, and currency translation negatively impacted the figure by about 2%. Organic revenue was in line with our trailing 12-month performance and grew 6.1%.
Turning to margins. As we've previously stated, the core rationale for our portfolio realignment over the past year is to begin building platforms for long-term growth and return on invested capital. In exchange, we anticipated some margin dilution. Our consolidated operating margins reflect this, and with 1 less selling week in this year's fiscal first quarter, we had lower operating leverage. Our consolidated operating margin declined 110 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, consistent with our expectations. 
On the bottom line, GAAP net income from continuing operations grew to $38.9 million, roughly doubling to $0.40 per diluted share, compared to $20.3 million or $0.20 per diluted share a year ago. Adjusted net income from continuing operations, which excludes certain nonrecurring and deal amortization costs, totaled $48.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations rose 8.5% to $0.51 per diluted share, reflecting the company's solid performance in the current market.
Now let's move to our segments. In Dental, we experienced stable markets in the 2017 first quarter. Patterson Dental sales declined 3.5% on a GAAP basis but expanded by 2.1% organically. As Scott mentioned, we were pleased with our dental equipment sales, which grew 5.4%. We believe our momentum in equipment helped support our confidence in the end market. Equipment sales in the first quarter were driven by a combination of strong demand for CEREC CAD/CAM systems and solid volumes in basic equipment. 
On the consumable side, consumable dental supplies increased about 1%. This growth reflects several factors, most notably the impact of our sales force realignment. As Scott said, dental purchasing patterns are evolving, and we are adapting to meet these needs. While we expect our Dental sales force realignment will better position us for growth, it contributed, along with the extra selling week in last year's first quarter, to a 30 basis point contraction in Dental operating margin. Patterson has a long tradition as an industry leader, and we expect to lead this industry change in order to adapt to our customers' shifting needs. Overall, we believe that our performance in the first quarter was strongly competitive relative to the industry.
Now turning to our Animal Health segment. Results in this business reflect a full quarter contribution from Animal Health International in the 2017 first quarter compared to a 6-week contribution from Animal Health International and the extra sales week in the year-ago period. At the end of June, the Animal Health International acquisition is annualized into our results. 
Again, in the first quarter, the company executed well in stable to steadily improving market conditions, and we saw solid performance in our Animal Health business in the 2017 first quarter, which outpaced our expected end market growth rates. Our Animal Health sales grew 36.8% on a GAAP basis. Currency translation lowered this number by 3%. 
We were pleased with the first quarter sales of our companion animal business. Organic companion animal sales grew 11.7%. Normalizing for changes in selling arrangements for certain products, U.S. companion animal sales grew 8.1%. 
Our performance in the production animal industry reflects encouraging improvement in the swine market. Overall, we believe we are well positioned in the production animal sector, and we expect the beef end markets to continue to improve as the year moves on. The first quarter sales contribution from our production animal business totaled almost $362 million, a 3% increase on a pro forma basis. 
Operating margin for the Animal Health segment decreased 20 basis points to 3.2%. The first quarter margins reflect a combination of factors: a seasonally low sales quarter in production animal, the timing of product rebates and a less favorable product mix. 
In Animal Health, our ongoing integration activities and progress to our planned synergies remains on track. Our synergy focus this fiscal year is more effectively leverage our supply chain across both of our businesses and further consolidate our back-office functions. To this end, I'm pleased to say that we've achieved a major milestone and completely integrated the back-office operations of Animal Health International with Patterson. Further, we remain on target to achieve our stated goal of capturing between $20 million and $30 million in annualized synergies over a 3-year period. 
Now a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. Net cash used by operating activities from continuing operations was $72.8 million versus cash flow generated of $7.7 million in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, our first quarter is historically our lowest cash flow period. 
Additionally, inventories were up by $77 million year-over-year due to increased dental equipment purchases as well as higher inventory levels related to our ERP implementation to maintain service levels. 
We also continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy by returning cash to our shareholders. Demonstrating our commitment to enhancing shareholder value, we returned approximately $49.2 million to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. 
We remain confident in our ability to generate growing cash returns in our business and expect to return to converting between 85% and 100% of net income to free cash flow in fiscal 2017. CapEx totaled $15 million in the fiscal 2017 first quarter and included investments for normal replacements as well as our corporate-wide information technology initiative. 
Turning now to tax rates. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 33%, which includes the discrete tax benefit of $0.01 to $0.02 per diluted share related to the new accounting standard on share-based compensation. The adjusted annual tax rate is expected to be in the range of 34.5% to 35%. 
Now let me discuss our fiscal 2017 guidance. As we've said, Patterson is midstream in a process of repositioning the company for larger growth goals ahead. In fiscal 2017, we will continue to move through a period of intense execution on a range of initiatives that we believe are critical to top and bottom line expansion. It is also helpful to consider the market dynamics we expect to face. At this early juncture in fiscal 2017, we currently anticipate stable markets in both Dental and Animal Health. 
Our annual guidance range includes a pretax $25 million step-up in operating expense associated with our ERP implementation. As we explained, this investment will start depreciating as we move further into broader implementation later this year. During this period, we will essentially be running redundant systems to help facilitate the transition to our new platform. This step-up in expense includes costs for depreciation, rollout and infrastructure support. We believe our new ERP platform will lead to new efficiencies. However, some of them cannot be fully realized until the platform is completely implemented. That said, we believe we have a sound process in place to migrate to our new systems in a way that ensures business continuity and high levels of customer support and leads to significant future efficiencies once the transition is complete. 
We continue to make progress rolling out the ERP system. After the first quarter-end, 2 more pilot locations and dental branches went live in August. These sites are in addition to the previous 5 dental branches, 1 companion animal call center and 2 shared distribution centers that went live in our new ERP pilot program on February 1. For fiscal year 2017, we expect consolidated operating margins to be flat to down slightly after absorbing the $25 million step-up in ERP expenses, the majority of which will be allocated back to our business segments. 
We are monitoring various factors that can affect our end markets and, therefore, Patterson's performance. With this in mind, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2017 guidance range for adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the range of $2.60 to $2.70 per diluted share. Our guidance range assumes stable North American and international markets and excludes the impact of additional share repurchases, new acquisitions and transaction-related costs, integration and business restructuring expense and deal amortization. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments."

When looking at the North American consumable market, I would say we have seen some summer softness to the market but really don't want to overreact to it because when you look at it, there are really multiple signs towards the thesis that this will be short-term in nature. I think we have a North American economy with strong consumer confidence. We have unemployment levels under 5%. We look internally to a strong pipeline for equipment and technology. And we also have done some pretty in-depth customer survey data that points towards a rather encouraging outlook that our customers have going forward. So we obviously don't want to overreact to just a little softness over the summer months, but we'll continue to monitor the trend. Really, some key months are August and September in terms of patient traffic. And remember, consumable sales lag patient traffic. So as the dentists get into what the -- sort of the back-to-business time of mid-August to September and back-to-school, that will be something that we'll be watching very closely.

So I think I caught all that, but you might have to remind me at the end. So the total sales for Animal Health International is a little bit tricky because, of course, you've got 6 weeks sort of annualized into our results, and then you have 6 weeks of incremental impact. So if I look at the production animal business only, the revenues were $362 million. And then you're right. There's about $50 [ph] million of incremental revenue that you'd have to add to that, that would be coming in from the companion animal. So I think that was part 1 of your question. Production animal business on a pro forma grew 3% versus the prior year. But I feel like you had one more question that I maybe didn't hit on, something related to 2015."

We saw some margin contraction in the current quarter on an adjusted basis of about 30 basis points. And I would say that's simply a function of the extra week and that margins were actually in line with our expectations for the quarter. So we do continue to expect operating margins to be between 13% and 13.5% for the year. As you know, with our model, our margins do increase as the year goes on, in line with increasing volumes. And then we have some rebate activity in the back half of the year. So what I would encourage you to do is if you look at last year's margins by quarter and then you kind of take that 35 basis point increase that we're looking for and kind of spread it evenly throughout the back half of the year, that should get you close."

I could also imagine a scenario where -- when you we were making the sales force changes in June, that maybe you were a little hesitant to buy equipment then.

So while we feel we're in a very good position going into the selling season, we're bullish about the opportunity ahead.

Just from personal experience, if I go back to my days as a salesperson in San Francisco 20 years ago, we were installing electronic commerce systems before the Internet. We have been a leader. Over -- well over 80% of our consumables come electronically. That being said, when you think of all of the technology our sales force has in front of us right now and the productivity opportunities and how customers want to interact to us -- interact with us, both face-to-face but also digitally, it just leads to a model that we feel is going to evolve. And really, this, at the end of the day, is about putting more opportunity in front of our best sales people and really being easy to do business with for a wide variety of customers.

Let me give you a little context because I think it's important. Number one, we have a history of constantly evaluating the best way to leverage Patterson and our sales force in the most effective way for the customer. And two, I think it's very important to remind everyone. No company in North America has a wider sales and technical service coverage than Patterson. And we have a history of doing this. So as a reminder, nearly 8 years ago, we took a hard look at our technology sales force, and we felt there was a more efficient way to sell digital technology products that made us easier to do business with. And we wanted to create more opportunity for our best salespeople. So we eliminated that sales role, and we moved the selling responsibilities to our established team. In doing so, we dramatically accelerated our digital X-ray sales and Eaglesoft placements if you look at what we've done over the last 8 years. So bottom line is we created a better customer experience. The moves we made in June had a really similar underlying strategy, so we feel we can leverage technology with our sales force, and we have an opportunity to become more productive. And we know we're leaders in e-commerce, so this is really about the customer and leading a market, not reacting to a market. But I want to be really clear and don't want to have anyone misinterpret that our sales force and our service coverage, today, is our competitive advantage, and it is incredibly important to our ongoing strategy. And bottom line, we're just putting our best people in front of more opportunities to drive the market and drive customer success."

I'd like to begin by first discussing how some of the market dynamics we are currently seeing and the strategic shifts we are making are influencing our fiscal 2017 outlook and forecast.",2074,"Thank you, John, and welcome, everyone, to today's conference call. I'd like to begin by first discussing how some of the market dynamics we are currently seeing and the strategic shifts we are making are influencing our fiscal 2017 outlook and forecast. Our end markets are currently presenting us with some unique near-term challenges on both sides of our business. 
First in our Dental business. The soft but stable market conditions we experienced in our fiscal first quarter extended into our second quarter. And on the Animal Health side, we are experiencing the effects of consolidation among the branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. While we believe this consolidation dynamic is short term in nature, it has resulted in a softer manufacture pricing environment, which had impacted our margins in the Animal Health segment. 
Importantly, our current outlook also needs to factor in our recent strategic decision making. Today, we announced that we will change the nature of our relationship with Sirona towards a goal of opening up new opportunities for Patterson and our customers. As we transition toward a new working relationship with Sirona, we can expect some near-term headwinds in exchange for longer-term growth opportunities. 
To reflect these dynamics, we have modified our fiscal 2017 adjusted non-GAAP earnings guidance from continuing operations to a range of $2.25 to $2.35 per diluted share. As we work through these factors, we're committed to taking the steps necessary to improve our earnings performance. 
And we remain confident in Patterson's long-term prospects. We operate in compelling markets and are building a business model that will be increasingly relevant to our customers. I'll remind everyone that there are important long-term demographic trends that underpin our business, and in our view, remain very attractive. 
In the dental market, the long-term fundamentals and trend lines are unchanged. Several factors, including a generally stable employment market and aging population and dentists seeking new ways to improve both the patient experience and how their practices operate form the basis for our optimism in dental. 
We have different but equally compelling factors on the animal health side of our business. One is the global expansion of the middle class that will result in an increase in animal protein demand. We expect the U.S. production animal market to have a global leadership role in satisfying that demand. We believe our entry into this market just over a year ago and into the position as the leading animal health distribution company in North America is a compelling long-term growth catalyst. 
Relatedly, we continue to have a lot of optimism in the long-term growth trends in the companion animal market. We believe stable market conditions and a persistent rise in both pet ownership and spending per pet will continue to generate long-term opportunities for us. This component of our growth plan remains unchanged. 
For the next few minutes, however, I'd like to provide some additional perspective on the dental market, how it's changing and how we are responding. The various ways that practitioners of all sizes need to address the requirements of dental consumers are evolving. These are changes we have been anticipating. We have been adjusting our approach to the market and our business to better position our dental operations for long-term success. These efforts have been methodical, multiyear and expansive. 
They have included: changes in our basic equipment portfolio with the intent to bring a wider range of product offerings to the entire market of customers within the market; our commitment to our new ERP platform to ensure that we are building maximum efficiency into our operations and providing the backbone and tool set for a more expansive and effective e-commerce platform that will accommodate modern-buying habits; and the investment we have made in our technical service and support capabilities, which we believe represent untapped value and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. Our adaptation continues today. 
Three other factors in Dental are impacting how we view opportunities and how we are changing to capture them. But first to our trends, evolving practice models in the North American dental market and the continued evolution of digital dentistry. The third is the voice of our current and potential customers. We are listening very closely to our customers, and in many ways, their feedback is directly influencing our change. This has led to several important decisions and exciting developments over the past several months. 
First, in June, we took steps to optimize our sales force in Dental with a goal of building a team that is better aligned with where we believe customer needs are moving. We have gone to great lengths to build a value proposition around outstanding sales support with an emphasis on technical and operational needs of our customers. We believe these needs will become more pronounced in the future as practitioner environments of all sizes become increasingly digital. Our sales force needs to reflect this change. We have always been a destination for the best sales professionals in the business, and these efforts are putting more opportunity in front of our best people. 
Second, regarding digital dentistry. We believe we have a unique perspective. Today, we are having conversations about technological need and preference in digital workflow with a much wider range of customers. Our leading position as a distributor and enabler of dental technology gives us insights into the aspirations and decision-making considerations of practices of all sizes, and more importantly, how this is changing. 
The reality is the dental market is -- the definition of digital workflow is evolving. It means something different across the practitioner spectrum. Being the distributor of choice across the full spectrum need -- means Patterson needs to evolve and leverage our superior support platform to customers. 
Therefore, to better address the needs of the full dental market, we have made the decision not to extend the exclusivity of our relationship with Sirona beyond September of 2017. This decision is consistent with our strategy of serving the evolving needs of all of our customers and will allow us to better serve the full range of practice models. We believe the modern customer wants a partner like Patterson, who can combine both the superior technology support platform with the full range of product options. 
Our global, best-in-class support structure for technology is a critical asset. It has been a great -- it has been of great interest to many other product manufacturers who recognize the importance of this back-end support to the adoption of their technology. Patterson's technical service and support has been a major differentiator in the adoption of chairside technology. We believe that with a wider portfolio of product offerings, this asset will become even more valuable and an even stronger differentiator. We are confident that this deliberate shift away from manufacturer exclusives will unlock opportunities for everyone involved in the dental supply chain. 
I want to be very clear. We are immensely proud of our 20-year relationship with Sirona and have great admiration for their technology and history of innovation. Through this relationship, Patterson Dental effectively built the North American market for chairside technology. The combination of Sirona's CAD/CAM technology and Patterson sales, service and support has set a very high standard. Sirona's chairside solutions, like the rest of their product portfolio, will remain a very important part of our offerings. 
For practitioners that seek single-visit solutions, I believe we will remain a clear supplier of choice. We are fully committed to driving sales performance through the completion of our exclusivity period and then selling their products on a nonexclusive basis with the same commitment to driving mutual success. 
For practitioners and operations that need more flexibility and a wider range of technology options, they will now find that in Patterson. And we will eventually carry the necessary products that will allow us to meet the digital workflow needs for the entire range of customers in the market. 
Lastly, we believe our expanded product and support offering will enhance our ability to serve the full spectrum of customers. That, of course, includes the DSO community. We are very excited by our new relationship with Heartland Dental, the largest dental support organization in the United States. The hallmarks of Patterson Dental: Superior sale, service and support with technical applications, played a large role in this win. In our conversations with Heartland, it was clear they were seeking a business partner that shared the same philosophy of bringing best-in-class products and solutions to their network, with a strong focus and commitment to helping them improve in the operational areas they outlined for us. 
Our respective teams immediately began working together to begin delivering the solutions that form the basis of our partnership, and the collaboration and cultural fit have been outstanding. This is just the beginning of what we expect to be a broader and more fruitful period of engagement with dental support organizations and one that dovetails with our efforts to adapt to a changing market. 
In terms of capital deployment. Many DSOs choose to deploy their resources to expand their reach with additional offices and elect to outsource some of their capabilities to their lab partners. Some of our DSO partners already have or will embrace full chairside restoration capability. Our superior service and technical support in that arena will be of critical importance to these DSOs and the local success of their practices. 
A value-added distributor such as Patterson needs to be able to address the entire market with whatever the individual customer needs to make their professional office more successful. Undoubtedly, this is the start of a very exciting time for our customers, our sales force and the product manufacturing community. We expect this shift within Patterson Dental to create new opportunities for us and for our customers and to highlight the competitive advantage we demonstrate in the market every day. 
As I mentioned earlier, we continued to see relatively stable but soft end markets in dental in the second quarter. As with our first quarter, this was generally in line with what has been more widely reported within the North American dental market, and the effects were most evident in consumable sales levels. However, we still believe our portion of this impact resulted from disruption caused by our sales force realignment initiative. As we work through the transition caused by this realignment, we expect this impact to moderate. 
On the equipment side. We are pleased with our performance during the quarter, especially considering the different -- difficult year-over-year comparable we faced with CEREC. From our point of view, we are encouraged that practitioners remain willing to invest for the future success of their businesses. 
Within the category, volumes on basic equipment and digital X-ray were solid during the second quarter. In particular, we are pleased with how our broader basic equipment product portfolio is performing. You'll recall that our basic equipment product category also experienced a change in manufacturer relationships. Adding more product manufacturer options has benefited our customers and has strengthened this category for Patterson Dental. 
Now a look at our Animal Health segment. We continue to see stable to strengthening conditions across the segment during the quarter. In production animal, we saw overall recovery in end markets, with the swine market leading the way. We also saw strength in the beef cattle market. However, recovery in dairy end markets is proving to be more protracted than anticipated. Companion health markets continued to perform well during the quarter. 
As we mentioned last quarter, sales execution has been a significant priority for us, and we are pleased to see substantial sales growth and share gains across the segment. This is certainly a reflection of our efforts to unify our sales teams and present one Patterson Animal Health segment to the market. 
However, we currently face a challenging pricing environment with branded pharmaceutical companies, which is the result of market consolidation. This has impacted our ability to translate the significant sales momentum into profit contributions we want to see. I'll remind you that Patterson Animal Health is the North American leader in this space. We believe that our scale and scope are important assets, and as we work through this period of consolidation, we will emerge as the partner of choice for pharmaceutical manufacturers. And as we do so, we continue to be intently focused on our customers and operational excellence. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials."

During the fiscal 2017 second quarter, our growth agenda and sales execution were key focal points for Patterson. Overall, we remained competitive in our markets during the quarter. We broadened",1786,"Thank you, Scott, and thank you all for joining us today. During the fiscal 2017 second quarter, our growth agenda and sales execution were key focal points for Patterson. 
Overall, we remained competitive in our markets during the quarter. We broadened our markets in the Dental business and saw substantial sales growth and gained market share in Animal Health. However, certain strategic initiatives, combined with challenging marketplace dynamics in both Dental and Animal Health, adversely affected our year-over-year quarterly financial results and our outlook for the balance of the year. 
As I've done in the past, I will discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to focus on our current portfolio of businesses. Where appropriate, I will make note of our adjusted results which, as John explained, excludes the impact of certain nonrecurring and noncash items. Also, our sales discussions for each business segment will exclude foreign currency impact to provide a more normalized view of our results. 
Taking a look at our top line performance. Consolidated sales for the fiscal 2017 second quarter increased 2.1% to $1.4 billion on a reported basis. Excluding the foreign currency translation impact, revenue grew 4.1%. 
Turning to margins. Our second quarter consolidated operating margin was 6.5%, which was 50 basis points lower compared to the prior year quarter. The operating margin decline was chiefly due to decreased profitability in our Animal Health business, which accounted for the largest percentage of our consolidated net sales. I'll expand on this more in a moment. 
On the bottom line, reported net income from continuing operations was $45.8 million, up 12% to $0.48 per diluted share compared to $42.6 million or $0.43 per diluted share a year ago. Adjusted net income from continuing operations declined 3.2% to $53.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was flat versus the prior year quarter at $0.56 per diluted share. 
Now let's move to our segments. As Scott explained, in Dental, we saw a softer but relatively stable market in the 2017 second quarter, which led to essentially flat sales on a GAAP and constant currency basis. On the consumable side, the dental market continued to reflect somewhat slower than historic growth. Patterson sales of consumable dental supplies decreased 2.5% in the second quarter. We believe, however, that the sales force realignment that we implemented in the first quarter primarily contributed to the consumables decline. While this initiative is important to better address the needs of the dental customer, it is causing some disruption in the channel. 
Turning to equipment. Patterson has a long tradition as an industry leader, and our equipment category was a bright spot in the quarter. We were pleased with our sales in this category, which grew 4.2% in the second quarter. Sales were led by double-digit increases in core equipment and digital X-ray products, which offset lower CEREC sales. 
Looking at segment margins. Operating margin improved 30 basis points, led by our sales force realignment initiative and lower incremental expense. Overall, we believe that the performance of our Dental business in the second quarter was competitive relative to the industry. 
As Scott mentioned, at the end of the second quarter, we elected not to extend exclusivity with Sirona [Audio Gap] on September 2017. As a result, we expect to record a pretax noncash impairment charge in the third quarter of approximately $36 million or $0.24 per diluted share related to the distribution fee associated with the CEREC product component of this arrangement. 
While this noncash accounting charge will not affect Patterson's liquidity, cash flows or compliance with debt covenants, we expect this decision could negatively affect near-term operation. This impact is reflected in our updated fiscal 2017 earnings guidance. 
Now turning to our Animal Health segment. We saw sales expansion and share gains in our Animal Health business in the 2017 second quarter. Our Animal Health sales grew 4.2% over the prior quarter on a reported basis. After adjusting for the impact of foreign currency, Animal Health segment sales increased 7.8%. 
Second quarter reported sales in our companion animal business rose 3.6%. Adjusting for currency, companion animal sales increased 10.8% over last year. Looking more specifically at the U.S. companion animal sales, reported growth was up 15.8% and 9.8% when adjusted for agency buy-sell. Growth in production animal sales in the 2017 second quarter improved 4.9% versus a year ago. Our overall performance in production animal reflects a stronger swine market, an improved beef market and continued softness within the dairy portion of the business. 
Looking at segment margins. While we generated solid sales volume increases, that growth did not translate to the bottom line improvement. We are capturing market share, although it's not at the profit margin we'd like. A reason for this is a more challenging environment related to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers' pricing trends, which contributed an 80 basis point decline in operating margins during the quarter. We are implementing programs to respond to these challenges and remain focused on our customers, along with disciplined execution and integration synergy capture. 
Our ongoing Animal Health integration and progress to our planned synergies remain on track. We are focused this fiscal year on more effectively leveraging logistics across both of our businesses and further consolidating our back-office functions. We still expect to deliver between $18 million and $20 million in run rate savings by the end of this fiscal year, which will enable us to meet the $20 million to $30 million run rate of synergies in year 3 that we announced at the time of the acquisition. 
Now a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. Net cash generated from continuing operations was $17.5 million compared to using $21.7 million in the prior year quarter. We believe that cash flow will continue to improve for the balance of the year. We remain confident in our ability to generate cash returns in our business and expect to return to converting between 85% and 100% of net income into free cash flow in fiscal 2017. 
CapEx totaled $14 million in the fiscal 2017 second quarter and included investments in our corporate-wide information technology initiative. Inventories were up by $40 million year-over-year. Dental equipment inventories came down in the quarter, but higher inventories remain in our Animal Health business and to maintain service levels through our integration and ERP implementation. 
Regarding our ERP initiative. During this period, we are essentially running redundant systems to help facilitate the transition to our new platform. We believe that our new ERP platform will lead to new efficiencies. However, some of them cannot be fully realized until the platform is totally implemented. That said, we believe we have a sound process in place to migrate to our new system in a way that ensures business continuity and high levels of customer support and leads to significant future efficiencies once the transition is complete. 
We continue to make good progress on the implementation. Our investments enabled 9 additional locations to go live in the second quarter: 3 fulfillment centers, 1 vet call center, 2 Animal Health branches and 3 Animal Health branches. Together this resulted in a $3 million expense increase for the quarter. 
As previously disclosed, we continue to expect a pretax $25 million step-up in the operating expense for the full year. This expense will accelerate in the back half of the year as we begin to depreciate the investment and scale up deployment. 
We continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy by continuing -- or by returning cash to our shareholders. Demonstrating our commitment to enhancing shareholder value, we returned approximately $48.5 million to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter and nearly $100 million on a year-to-date basis. We remain fully committed to our dividend. 
Our strong cash flow generation is an asset and allows us to fully support our capital allocation strategy, which includes returning capital to our shareholders. Given our continued position of financial strength, we have the ability to step up our share repurchases to deliver additional value to our shareholders. We have approximately 15 million shares remaining under our current board authorization. Our strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it makes sense to do so. 
Now turning to taxes. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.7%. The adjusted annual tax rate is expected to be in the range of 34.5% to 35.5%. 
Now I will review our revised fiscal 2017 guidance. As mentioned in our earnings release, in light of both external factors and our strategic decisions, we have reexamined our financial outlook for the year. When we entered fiscal 2017, our guidance was predicated on end markets similar to those experienced in 2016. However, Patterson and others in our industry have seen softness in the U.S. dental market and challenges with branded pharmaceutical companies in our Animal Health business. 
Just as important as these external factors are the strategic decisions we made in the first half of fiscal 2017: First, to realign our dental sales force to enhance our effectiveness; and more recently, to move away from exclusive manufacturer relationships to leverage our support infrastructure across a broader range of products and customers. While both of these decisions are key to evolving the customer-centric approach for which we are known and realizing our grow conditions longer term, we recognize they will affect near-term financial performance. Therefore, we are updating our guidance as follows. 
As Scott noted, we now anticipate adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 per diluted share. Our adjusted guidance excludes the impact of onetime transaction-related cost, integration and business restructuring expenses, deal amortization and noncash impairment charges totaling $0.60 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, we expect fiscal 2017 earnings from continuing operations in the range of $1.65 to $1.75 per diluted share. 
While we are only off a few cents from our internal plan to the first half, we are reducing our guidance to this new range based on what we see in the back half of fiscal '17. Specifically, in Dental, the softness in the market, coupled with the transition of our exclusive relationship with Sirona; and in Animal Health, the impact of the margin decline experienced in the current quarter will continue in the near term as we diligently work to improve margins. 
Our guidance range assumes North American and international market conditions similar to those experienced in the first half of fiscal 2017 and includes a $25 million pretax step-up in operating expense associated with the ERP system implementation. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments."

As I mentioned, recently, Patterson is in the middle of an important period of change. Our portfolio moves, technology investments and shifts in how we address the needs of our customers are all part of an important evolution. But I'd like to emphasize that just as we have demonstrated our commitment to positioning Patterson in the future, we are equally committed to restoring Patterson to a more profitable growth in the near term and have multiple levers to pull to do so. 
Fortunately, we are able to do this from a position of operational and financial strength. Keys to our operational strength are our enterprise resource planning initiative and our sales and support infrastructure. We expect our ERP initiative to significantly improve our ability to help Patterson stay in front of our customers' needs and pace of change. I have visited various locations where the cutovers to our new system are taking place, and I am pleased with our progress and operational continuity. 
I commend all of our hard-working employees who have dedicated themselves to pursuing the smooth implementation of this system. We have built a very robust sales, service and technical support structure that customers truly value as they increase their dependence on technology to run their operations. 
Our financial strengths gives us the ability to support each aspect of our capital allocation strategy, and this will continue. While we face some short-term market challenges and navigate the change we have strategically elected, I am confident in the actions we are taking to position Patterson for the future and optimistic for the prospects of our customers, employees and shareholders. 
Now we'd like to take any questions you may have, so I'll turn the call back over to Catherine."

And then I'll turn it over to Ann to maybe talk some of the economics. But I think it's critical that as I talk about our decision, we also talk about the history and partnership because we do have people who are newer to the story, and I think it gives very important context. If you go back to the 1990s, it really was a vision towards the future that the Patterson management team had as they approached Siemens Dental with the offer that we would sell and service the CEREC 2 exclusively. At the time, Siemens had a game-changing idea with single-visit chairside dentistry but really had very limited commercial success to sell the product. We like to say that agreement was the beginning of what we call a 20-year overnight success story, as we partnered with the eventual spin-out of Siemens Dental, which we -- became Sirona, to really do true pioneer work to change dentistry. And I would say we could not be more proud, and I speak for all of the employees of Patterson, about the work we've done together. Now more -- or more excited about what we are going to accomplish together in the future. I think it's important that everyone knows our executive teams, both at Patterson and Sirona for years, have been very consistent in our approach that there would be a day where Patterson will need to expand the portfolio of products we sell to meet the needs of our customers, and also Sirona will want to access more of the market through potential expanded distribution. This is the critical point. I think we both, as partners, feel now is the perfect time at the end of our contract to move our relationship to the next level. And really, this is predicated on our mutual confidence, and I would say, strong confidence in our ability to compete in the marketplace. As a reminder, we've seen this scenario. We've -- it's playing out right now in our chair business. And our great partner, A-dec, we remain their largest partner. We have the ability to sell more product, which has helped us access more customers. So the other piece is really unlocking growth for both companies and the commitment of both companies of helping the profession accelerate the adoption of digital dentistry. So a key part of this strategic decision is we both feel an increased interest in activity that will come from expanded distribution will lead to a potential acceleration of sales. Bottom line is more people are going to be talking about digital dentistry. More people will be talking about CEREC. And we think we can sell 7 out of 10 instead of 5 out of 5. And over time, net-net, this will be a real positive for Patterson and Sirona."

Where we are implementing programs immediately to respond to these challenges, but it will take some time to work through. And as a result, we're taking down guidance for the back half the year to more closely align with our current quarter performance.

But talk a bit about sort of post the expiration of this exclusivity, what do you think it'll do to kind of -- the sales force and how do you expect them to react and whether or not this could actually be sort of a rallying event for folks versus maybe something that leads to, I don't know, departures or more transitionary challenges?"

And I would say, we've had a very thorough communication plan. And we had over 100 of our general managers in Minneapolis last week walking through the strategy of what we're doing and why now is the right time. And I would tell you, there is the sense of a rallying cry both for and I think I want to be clear, for both the support of Sirona and our long-term prospects, but also, we talked about one Patterson. And we have some tenets around one Patterson, and one of those is customers first. And really the feedback I've gotten, and we've done some focus groups as well with some of our top salespeople, is the ability to at every point with a customer first in the decision-making process is incredibly powerful. And I think the exclusivity, particularly on CEREC, serve Patterson and Sirona so well historically. Because you need focus and commitment to make a market. And we made a market together. But we feel now there's momentum and actually a real chance for acceleration in the space that's going to let both Patterson and Sirona win. So we learn this through the A-dec decision, which has been very powerful. And I talked to our salespeople all over the country. And I can't tell you how many times our best salespeople say, let me compete. Just give me all the products and we'll do what's best for the customer. And then that also puts, I think, a really excited competitive spirit back on the manufacturer that best product wins the most effective, most efficient product wins. So in my previous answer, I talked about the confidence that Sirona and Patterson share, and I have been in this relationship for 20 years. We make this decision together as partners because of our confidence to compete and our confidence that this is right for customers."

We have quite the asset of the Patterson Technology Center in terms of providing first-class support, and we just want to make sure that we're doing the right thing. And so there'll be some additional investment there to make sure that we protect that IP. As it relates a sales disruption. I think when we put the guidance together, we wanted to make sure that we were conservative. And as we've gone through other transitions in the past historically, whether that's the A-dec change or the change when we changed how we sold other technology products with the software days. Sometimes if you're going to a transition, there is some of your terms, disruption in the yield. So from a conservative standpoint, we did use the top line and our outlook just to account for that.

So if we think about what's changed in the marketplace and how those recent events are impacting our second quarter results and then the implications to 2017. You touched on 2 factors with unexpected changes in the marketplace that negatively impacts the balance of the year. So there is a softness in the U.S. dental market and then challenges with branded pharmaceutical pricing in our Animal Health business. And then in addition to those factors, it's a strategic decisions we made in the first half of the year most recently the move towards nonexclusive manufacturing relationships within our technology portfolio. So when I think about breaking that down, what I can tell you is about half of the reduction in guidance is due to Animal Health, and the other half is due to Dental. And when I think about Dental, Jeff, I would say probably 1/2 to 2/3 is really more on the consumer market softening and some disruption from the sales force restructuring. And the other 1/3 is probably around the Sirona piece, that's rough buckets."

I would say on the general market commentary that the soft less -- the softness we experienced in the entire industry experienced in the summer, continued through the fall. And as we look at the back half of the year, we decided to take a conservative approach thing that there wouldn't be any market improvement. I would say the market is stable. And if I had to look at a growth rate, I would say it's probably 0 to 100 basis points. So a lethargic market. So while we're disappointed that it didn't swing back posts summer, I think we have really strong potential fundamentals for the market that give us optimism going forward. You've heard this it's stable to improving consumer confidence. It's low unemployment levels. It's continued trend of customers investing in the technology. And then it's the demand driven for favorable North American demographics. So on the sales force side, and I think this is an important part of the strategy because we absolutely are committed to it and feel like we made the right move to move the business towards where the market is going. The sales erosion is contained to a certain number of customers. But when you look at the upside opportunity of almost 19,000 new customers that we've assigned some of our best salespeople to, we look at the long-term growth opportunity as being substantial and material.

But unfortunately, the softness has continued with similar results in Q2. I think as we look at our Q2, our Q2 actually improved throughout the quarter. And I think that really speaks more to the sales rep realignment settled down and begin to clawback our customers that we lost and win back that share. So I think for us we thought -- and again, as Scott said, it's a narrow band. But we did see some improvement in October."

320186,409241663,1090535,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 22, 2016",2016-11-22,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and welcome, everyone, to today's conference call. I'd like to begin by first discussing how some of the market dynamics we are currently seeing and the strategic shifts we are making are influencing our fiscal 2017 outlook and forecast.",2074,"Thank you, John, and welcome, everyone, to today's conference call. I'd like to begin by first discussing how some of the market dynamics we are currently seeing and the strategic shifts we are making are influencing our fiscal 2017 outlook and forecast. Our end markets are currently presenting us with some unique near-term challenges on both sides of our business. 
First in our Dental business. The soft but stable market conditions we experienced in our fiscal first quarter extended into our second quarter. And on the Animal Health side, we are experiencing the effects of consolidation among the branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. While we believe this consolidation dynamic is short term in nature, it has resulted in a softer manufacture pricing environment, which had impacted our margins in the Animal Health segment. 
Importantly, our current outlook also needs to factor in our recent strategic decision making. Today, we announced that we will change the nature of our relationship with Sirona towards a goal of opening up new opportunities for Patterson and our customers. As we transition toward a new working relationship with Sirona, we can expect some near-term headwinds in exchange for longer-term growth opportunities. 
To reflect these dynamics, we have modified our fiscal 2017 adjusted non-GAAP earnings guidance from continuing operations to a range of $2.25 to $2.35 per diluted share. As we work through these factors, we're committed to taking the steps necessary to improve our earnings performance. 
And we remain confident in Patterson's long-term prospects. We operate in compelling markets and are building a business model that will be increasingly relevant to our customers. I'll remind everyone that there are important long-term demographic trends that underpin our business, and in our view, remain very attractive. 
In the dental market, the long-term fundamentals and trend lines are unchanged. Several factors, including a generally stable employment market and aging population and dentists seeking new ways to improve both the patient experience and how their practices operate form the basis for our optimism in dental. 
We have different but equally compelling factors on the animal health side of our business. One is the global expansion of the middle class that will result in an increase in animal protein demand. We expect the U.S. production animal market to have a global leadership role in satisfying that demand. We believe our entry into this market just over a year ago and into the position as the leading animal health distribution company in North America is a compelling long-term growth catalyst. 
Relatedly, we continue to have a lot of optimism in the long-term growth trends in the companion animal market. We believe stable market conditions and a persistent rise in both pet ownership and spending per pet will continue to generate long-term opportunities for us. This component of our growth plan remains unchanged. 
For the next few minutes, however, I'd like to provide some additional perspective on the dental market, how it's changing and how we are responding. The various ways that practitioners of all sizes need to address the requirements of dental consumers are evolving. These are changes we have been anticipating. We have been adjusting our approach to the market and our business to better position our dental operations for long-term success. These efforts have been methodical, multiyear and expansive. 
They have included: changes in our basic equipment portfolio with the intent to bring a wider range of product offerings to the entire market of customers within the market; our commitment to our new ERP platform to ensure that we are building maximum efficiency into our operations and providing the backbone and tool set for a more expansive and effective e-commerce platform that will accommodate modern-buying habits; and the investment we have made in our technical service and support capabilities, which we believe represent untapped value and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. Our adaptation continues today. 
Three other factors in Dental are impacting how we view opportunities and how we are changing to capture them. But first to our trends, evolving practice models in the North American dental market and the continued evolution of digital dentistry. The third is the voice of our current and potential customers. We are listening very closely to our customers, and in many ways, their feedback is directly influencing our change. This has led to several important decisions and exciting developments over the past several months. 
First, in June, we took steps to optimize our sales force in Dental with a goal of building a team that is better aligned with where we believe customer needs are moving. We have gone to great lengths to build a value proposition around outstanding sales support with an emphasis on technical and operational needs of our customers. We believe these needs will become more pronounced in the future as practitioner environments of all sizes become increasingly digital. Our sales force needs to reflect this change. We have always been a destination for the best sales professionals in the business, and these efforts are putting more opportunity in front of our best people. 
Second, regarding digital dentistry. We believe we have a unique perspective. Today, we are having conversations about technological need and preference in digital workflow with a much wider range of customers. Our leading position as a distributor and enabler of dental technology gives us insights into the aspirations and decision-making considerations of practices of all sizes, and more importantly, how this is changing. 
The reality is the dental market is -- the definition of digital workflow is evolving. It means something different across the practitioner spectrum. Being the distributor of choice across the full spectrum need -- means Patterson needs to evolve and leverage our superior support platform to customers. 
Therefore, to better address the needs of the full dental market, we have made the decision not to extend the exclusivity of our relationship with Sirona beyond September of 2017. This decision is consistent with our strategy of serving the evolving needs of all of our customers and will allow us to better serve the full range of practice models. We believe the modern customer wants a partner like Patterson, who can combine both the superior technology support platform with the full range of product options. 
Our global, best-in-class support structure for technology is a critical asset. It has been a great -- it has been of great interest to many other product manufacturers who recognize the importance of this back-end support to the adoption of their technology. Patterson's technical service and support has been a major differentiator in the adoption of chairside technology. We believe that with a wider portfolio of product offerings, this asset will become even more valuable and an even stronger differentiator. We are confident that this deliberate shift away from manufacturer exclusives will unlock opportunities for everyone involved in the dental supply chain. 
I want to be very clear. We are immensely proud of our 20-year relationship with Sirona and have great admiration for their technology and history of innovation. Through this relationship, Patterson Dental effectively built the North American market for chairside technology. The combination of Sirona's CAD/CAM technology and Patterson sales, service and support has set a very high standard. Sirona's chairside solutions, like the rest of their product portfolio, will remain a very important part of our offerings. 
For practitioners that seek single-visit solutions, I believe we will remain a clear supplier of choice. We are fully committed to driving sales performance through the completion of our exclusivity period and then selling their products on a nonexclusive basis with the same commitment to driving mutual success. 
For practitioners and operations that need more flexibility and a wider range of technology options, they will now find that in Patterson. And we will eventually carry the necessary products that will allow us to meet the digital workflow needs for the entire range of customers in the market. 
Lastly, we believe our expanded product and support offering will enhance our ability to serve the full spectrum of customers. That, of course, includes the DSO community. We are very excited by our new relationship with Heartland Dental, the largest dental support organization in the United States. The hallmarks of Patterson Dental: Superior sale, service and support with technical applications, played a large role in this win. In our conversations with Heartland, it was clear they were seeking a business partner that shared the same philosophy of bringing best-in-class products and solutions to their network, with a strong focus and commitment to helping them improve in the operational areas they outlined for us. 
Our respective teams immediately began working together to begin delivering the solutions that form the basis of our partnership, and the collaboration and cultural fit have been outstanding. This is just the beginning of what we expect to be a broader and more fruitful period of engagement with dental support organizations and one that dovetails with our efforts to adapt to a changing market. 
In terms of capital deployment. Many DSOs choose to deploy their resources to expand their reach with additional offices and elect to outsource some of their capabilities to their lab partners. Some of our DSO partners already have or will embrace full chairside restoration capability. Our superior service and technical support in that arena will be of critical importance to these DSOs and the local success of their practices. 
A value-added distributor such as Patterson needs to be able to address the entire market with whatever the individual customer needs to make their professional office more successful. Undoubtedly, this is the start of a very exciting time for our customers, our sales force and the product manufacturing community. We expect this shift within Patterson Dental to create new opportunities for us and for our customers and to highlight the competitive advantage we demonstrate in the market every day. 
As I mentioned earlier, we continued to see relatively stable but soft end markets in dental in the second quarter. As with our first quarter, this was generally in line with what has been more widely reported within the North American dental market, and the effects were most evident in consumable sales levels. However, we still believe our portion of this impact resulted from disruption caused by our sales force realignment initiative. As we work through the transition caused by this realignment, we expect this impact to moderate. 
On the equipment side. We are pleased with our performance during the quarter, especially considering the different -- difficult year-over-year comparable we faced with CEREC. From our point of view, we are encouraged that practitioners remain willing to invest for the future success of their businesses. 
Within the category, volumes on basic equipment and digital X-ray were solid during the second quarter. In particular, we are pleased with how our broader basic equipment product portfolio is performing. You'll recall that our basic equipment product category also experienced a change in manufacturer relationships. Adding more product manufacturer options has benefited our customers and has strengthened this category for Patterson Dental. 
Now a look at our Animal Health segment. We continue to see stable to strengthening conditions across the segment during the quarter. In production animal, we saw overall recovery in end markets, with the swine market leading the way. We also saw strength in the beef cattle market. However, recovery in dairy end markets is proving to be more protracted than anticipated. Companion health markets continued to perform well during the quarter. 
As we mentioned last quarter, sales execution has been a significant priority for us, and we are pleased to see substantial sales growth and share gains across the segment. This is certainly a reflection of our efforts to unify our sales teams and present one Patterson Animal Health segment to the market. 
However, we currently face a challenging pricing environment with branded pharmaceutical companies, which is the result of market consolidation. This has impacted our ability to translate the significant sales momentum into profit contributions we want to see. I'll remind you that Patterson Animal Health is the North American leader in this space. We believe that our scale and scope are important assets, and as we work through this period of consolidation, we will emerge as the partner of choice for pharmaceutical manufacturers. And as we do so, we continue to be intently focused on our customers and operational excellence. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials."

During the fiscal 2017 second quarter, our growth agenda and sales execution were key focal points for Patterson. Overall, we remained competitive in our markets during the quarter. We broadened",1786,"Thank you, Scott, and thank you all for joining us today. During the fiscal 2017 second quarter, our growth agenda and sales execution were key focal points for Patterson. 
Overall, we remained competitive in our markets during the quarter. We broadened our markets in the Dental business and saw substantial sales growth and gained market share in Animal Health. However, certain strategic initiatives, combined with challenging marketplace dynamics in both Dental and Animal Health, adversely affected our year-over-year quarterly financial results and our outlook for the balance of the year. 
As I've done in the past, I will discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to focus on our current portfolio of businesses. Where appropriate, I will make note of our adjusted results which, as John explained, excludes the impact of certain nonrecurring and noncash items. Also, our sales discussions for each business segment will exclude foreign currency impact to provide a more normalized view of our results. 
Taking a look at our top line performance. Consolidated sales for the fiscal 2017 second quarter increased 2.1% to $1.4 billion on a reported basis. Excluding the foreign currency translation impact, revenue grew 4.1%. 
Turning to margins. Our second quarter consolidated operating margin was 6.5%, which was 50 basis points lower compared to the prior year quarter. The operating margin decline was chiefly due to decreased profitability in our Animal Health business, which accounted for the largest percentage of our consolidated net sales. I'll expand on this more in a moment. 
On the bottom line, reported net income from continuing operations was $45.8 million, up 12% to $0.48 per diluted share compared to $42.6 million or $0.43 per diluted share a year ago. Adjusted net income from continuing operations declined 3.2% to $53.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was flat versus the prior year quarter at $0.56 per diluted share. 
Now let's move to our segments. As Scott explained, in Dental, we saw a softer but relatively stable market in the 2017 second quarter, which led to essentially flat sales on a GAAP and constant currency basis. On the consumable side, the dental market continued to reflect somewhat slower than historic growth. Patterson sales of consumable dental supplies decreased 2.5% in the second quarter. We believe, however, that the sales force realignment that we implemented in the first quarter primarily contributed to the consumables decline. While this initiative is important to better address the needs of the dental customer, it is causing some disruption in the channel. 
Turning to equipment. Patterson has a long tradition as an industry leader, and our equipment category was a bright spot in the quarter. We were pleased with our sales in this category, which grew 4.2% in the second quarter. Sales were led by double-digit increases in core equipment and digital X-ray products, which offset lower CEREC sales. 
Looking at segment margins. Operating margin improved 30 basis points, led by our sales force realignment initiative and lower incremental expense. Overall, we believe that the performance of our Dental business in the second quarter was competitive relative to the industry. 
As Scott mentioned, at the end of the second quarter, we elected not to extend exclusivity with Sirona [Audio Gap] on September 2017. As a result, we expect to record a pretax noncash impairment charge in the third quarter of approximately $36 million or $0.24 per diluted share related to the distribution fee associated with the CEREC product component of this arrangement. 
While this noncash accounting charge will not affect Patterson's liquidity, cash flows or compliance with debt covenants, we expect this decision could negatively affect near-term operation. This impact is reflected in our updated fiscal 2017 earnings guidance. 
Now turning to our Animal Health segment. We saw sales expansion and share gains in our Animal Health business in the 2017 second quarter. Our Animal Health sales grew 4.2% over the prior quarter on a reported basis. After adjusting for the impact of foreign currency, Animal Health segment sales increased 7.8%. 
Second quarter reported sales in our companion animal business rose 3.6%. Adjusting for currency, companion animal sales increased 10.8% over last year. Looking more specifically at the U.S. companion animal sales, reported growth was up 15.8% and 9.8% when adjusted for agency buy-sell. Growth in production animal sales in the 2017 second quarter improved 4.9% versus a year ago. Our overall performance in production animal reflects a stronger swine market, an improved beef market and continued softness within the dairy portion of the business. 
Looking at segment margins. While we generated solid sales volume increases, that growth did not translate to the bottom line improvement. We are capturing market share, although it's not at the profit margin we'd like. A reason for this is a more challenging environment related to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers' pricing trends, which contributed an 80 basis point decline in operating margins during the quarter. We are implementing programs to respond to these challenges and remain focused on our customers, along with disciplined execution and integration synergy capture. 
Our ongoing Animal Health integration and progress to our planned synergies remain on track. We are focused this fiscal year on more effectively leveraging logistics across both of our businesses and further consolidating our back-office functions. We still expect to deliver between $18 million and $20 million in run rate savings by the end of this fiscal year, which will enable us to meet the $20 million to $30 million run rate of synergies in year 3 that we announced at the time of the acquisition. 
Now a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. Net cash generated from continuing operations was $17.5 million compared to using $21.7 million in the prior year quarter. We believe that cash flow will continue to improve for the balance of the year. We remain confident in our ability to generate cash returns in our business and expect to return to converting between 85% and 100% of net income into free cash flow in fiscal 2017. 
CapEx totaled $14 million in the fiscal 2017 second quarter and included investments in our corporate-wide information technology initiative. Inventories were up by $40 million year-over-year. Dental equipment inventories came down in the quarter, but higher inventories remain in our Animal Health business and to maintain service levels through our integration and ERP implementation. 
Regarding our ERP initiative. During this period, we are essentially running redundant systems to help facilitate the transition to our new platform. We believe that our new ERP platform will lead to new efficiencies. However, some of them cannot be fully realized until the platform is totally implemented. That said, we believe we have a sound process in place to migrate to our new system in a way that ensures business continuity and high levels of customer support and leads to significant future efficiencies once the transition is complete. 
We continue to make good progress on the implementation. Our investments enabled 9 additional locations to go live in the second quarter: 3 fulfillment centers, 1 vet call center, 2 Animal Health branches and 3 Animal Health branches. Together this resulted in a $3 million expense increase for the quarter. 
As previously disclosed, we continue to expect a pretax $25 million step-up in the operating expense for the full year. This expense will accelerate in the back half of the year as we begin to depreciate the investment and scale up deployment. 
We continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy by continuing -- or by returning cash to our shareholders. Demonstrating our commitment to enhancing shareholder value, we returned approximately $48.5 million to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter and nearly $100 million on a year-to-date basis. We remain fully committed to our dividend. 
Our strong cash flow generation is an asset and allows us to fully support our capital allocation strategy, which includes returning capital to our shareholders. Given our continued position of financial strength, we have the ability to step up our share repurchases to deliver additional value to our shareholders. We have approximately 15 million shares remaining under our current board authorization. Our strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it makes sense to do so. 
Now turning to taxes. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.7%. The adjusted annual tax rate is expected to be in the range of 34.5% to 35.5%. 
Now I will review our revised fiscal 2017 guidance. As mentioned in our earnings release, in light of both external factors and our strategic decisions, we have reexamined our financial outlook for the year. When we entered fiscal 2017, our guidance was predicated on end markets similar to those experienced in 2016. However, Patterson and others in our industry have seen softness in the U.S. dental market and challenges with branded pharmaceutical companies in our Animal Health business. 
Just as important as these external factors are the strategic decisions we made in the first half of fiscal 2017: First, to realign our dental sales force to enhance our effectiveness; and more recently, to move away from exclusive manufacturer relationships to leverage our support infrastructure across a broader range of products and customers. While both of these decisions are key to evolving the customer-centric approach for which we are known and realizing our grow conditions longer term, we recognize they will affect near-term financial performance. Therefore, we are updating our guidance as follows. 
As Scott noted, we now anticipate adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 per diluted share. Our adjusted guidance excludes the impact of onetime transaction-related cost, integration and business restructuring expenses, deal amortization and noncash impairment charges totaling $0.60 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, we expect fiscal 2017 earnings from continuing operations in the range of $1.65 to $1.75 per diluted share. 
While we are only off a few cents from our internal plan to the first half, we are reducing our guidance to this new range based on what we see in the back half of fiscal '17. Specifically, in Dental, the softness in the market, coupled with the transition of our exclusive relationship with Sirona; and in Animal Health, the impact of the margin decline experienced in the current quarter will continue in the near term as we diligently work to improve margins. 
Our guidance range assumes North American and international market conditions similar to those experienced in the first half of fiscal 2017 and includes a $25 million pretax step-up in operating expense associated with the ERP system implementation. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments."

Fortunately, we are able to do this from a position of operational and financial strength. Keys to our operational strength are our enterprise resource planning initiative and our sales and support infrastructure. We expect our ERP initiative to significantly improve our ability to help Patterson stay in front of our customers' needs and pace of change. I have visited various locations where the cutovers to our new system are taking place, and I am pleased with our progress and operational continuity.

Our financial strengths gives us the ability to support each aspect of our capital allocation strategy, and this will continue.

If you go back to the 1990s, it really was a vision towards the future that the Patterson management team had as they approached Siemens Dental with the offer that we would sell and service the CEREC 2 exclusively. At the time, Siemens had a game-changing idea with single-visit chairside dentistry but really had very limited commercial success to sell the product. We like to say that agreement was the beginning of what we call a 20-year overnight success story, as we partnered with the eventual spin-out of Siemens Dental, which we -- became Sirona, to really do true pioneer work to change dentistry. And I would say we could not be more proud, and I speak for all of the employees of Patterson, about the work we've done together. Now more -- or more excited about what we are going to accomplish together in the future. I think it's important that everyone knows our executive teams, both at Patterson and Sirona for years, have been very consistent in our approach that there would be a day where Patterson will need to expand the portfolio of products we sell to meet the needs of our customers, and also Sirona will want to access more of the market through potential expanded distribution. This is the critical point. I think we both, as partners, feel now is the perfect time at the end of our contract to move our relationship to the next level. And really, this is predicated on our mutual confidence, and I would say, strong confidence in our ability to compete in the marketplace. As a reminder, we've seen this scenario. We've -- it's playing out right now in our chair business. And our great partner, A-dec, we remain their largest partner. We have the ability to sell more product, which has helped us access more customers. So the other piece is really unlocking growth for both companies and the commitment of both companies of helping the profession accelerate the adoption of digital dentistry. So a key part of this strategic decision is we both feel an increased interest in activity that will come from expanded distribution will lead to a potential acceleration of sales. Bottom line is more people are going to be talking about digital dentistry. More people will be talking about CEREC. And we think we can sell 7 out of 10 instead of 5 out of 5. And over time, net-net, this will be a real positive for Patterson and Sirona."

So as we think about our updated guidance for 2017, it does anticipate some headwinds regarding Sirona. Specifically, we anticipate there could be some near-term distractions with our field sales force around the Sirona announcement. And then in addition to that, we anticipate we'll incur some incremental cost to protect the technology assets we've built over the last 20 years. When you think longer term out to 2018, at this point, there's still a lot of moving pieces. In addition to Sirona, we plan to add additional technology products to the portfolio. We're onboarding large new customers. And then, of course, we should start to benefit from our ERP investment in the back half of 2018. So we'll continue to work through the challenges that we're facing over the next 90 days. And our plan is to update you on our longer-term outlook next quarter. But I would just emphasize that longer term, we do believe that the underlying business organically will be able to grow and continue generating significant amounts of cash."

And I don't want to call out specific manufacturers, but it's clear that we are in the midst of a significant realignment of some of our key partners. With that said, we really think long term. And I think the important thing is that we have repeatedly demonstrated our ability to move share in the market. And that with our scale reaching both companion and production animal customers really gives us confidence that we'll be the partner of choice among manufacturers as consolidation settles in. So I'll turn it over to Ann to talk -- walk you through the financial impact, and then I want to talk about mitigation."

Where we are implementing programs immediately to respond to these challenges, but it will take some time to work through. And as a result, we're taking down guidance for the back half the year to more closely align with our current quarter performance. So while we're initially targeting operating margins for the segment to be flat for the year after absorbing and allocation for the step up in expense associated with the ERP implementation, we now expect margins for the full year to decline between 40 and 60 basis points for the year in Animal Health."

And really, the feedback I've gotten, and we've done some focus groups as well with some of our top salespeople, is the ability to, at every point, put the customer first in the decision-making process is incredibly powerful. And I think the exclusivity, particularly on CEREC, served Patterson and Sirona so well historically because you need focus and commitment to make a market, and we made a market together. But we feel now there's momentum and actually a real chance for acceleration in the space that's going to let both Patterson and Sirona win. So we learned this through the A-dec decision, which had been very powerful. And I talked to our salespeople all over the country, and I can't tell you how many times our best salespeople say, ""Let me compete. Just give me all the products and we'll do what's best for the customer."" And then it also puts, I think, a really excited, competitive spirit back on the manufacturer, that best product wins and most effective, most efficient product wins. So in my previous answer, I talked about the confidence that Sirona and Patterson share, and I have been in this relationship for 20 years. We make this decision together as partners because of our confidence to compete and our confidence that this is right for customers."

And then it's really the intellectual property around the processes that we've built around training and after-sales support. We have quite the asset at the Patterson Technology Center in terms of providing first-class support, and we just want to make sure that we're doing the right things. And so there'll be some additional investment there to make sure that we protect that IP. As it relates a sales disruption. I think when we put the guidance together, we wanted to make sure that we were conservative. And as we've gone through other transitions in the past historically, whether that's the A-dec change or the change when we changed how we sold other technology products with the Eaglesoft software days, sometimes, when you're going through a transition, there is some near-term disruption in the yield. So from a conservative standpoint, we did mute the top line in our outlook just to account for that.

Sirona is family to Patterson, and Patterson is family to Sirona. And it is our intent that we use this as an opportunity to finish off the chapter of the 20-year exclusive but also use this as a launching pad for what we think is going to be a very exciting time of competition.

So if we think about what's changed in the marketplace and how those recent events are impacting our second quarter results and then the implications to 2017. You touched on 2 factors with unexpected changes in the marketplace that negatively impacts the balance of the year. So there's the softness in the U.S. dental market and then challenges with branded pharmaceutical pricing in our Animal Health business. And then in addition to those factors is the strategic decisions we made in the first half of the year, most recently the move towards nonexclusive manufacturer relationships within our technology portfolio. So when I think about breaking that down, what I can tell you is about half of the reduction in guidance is due to Animal Health and the other half is due to Dental. And when I think about Dental, Jeff, I would say probably 1/2 to 2/3 is really more on the consumable market softening and some disruption from the sales force restructuring. And then the other 1/3 is probably around the Sirona piece. That's rough buckets."

I would say on the general market commentary that the soft was -- softness we experienced and the entire industry experienced in the summer continued through the fall. And as we looked at the back half of the year, we decided to take a conservative approach, saying that there wouldn't be any market improvement. I would say the market is stable. And if I had to look at a growth rate, I would say it's probably 0 to 100 basis points. So a lethargic market. So while we're disappointed that it didn't swing back post-summer, I think we have really strong potential fundamentals for the market that give us optimism going forward. You've heard this before. It's stable to improving consumer confidence. It's low unemployment levels. It's continued trend of customers investing in technology. And then it's the demand driven for favorable North American demographics.

But when you look at the upside opportunity of almost 19,000 new customers that we've assigned some of our best salespeople to, we look at the long-term growth opportunity as being substantial and material. What we did not anticipate in the front end, and maybe I'll turn it over to Ann to talk about just what consumable softening does to our operating model."

I think what we didn't account for is the continued end softening of the markets -- or end market softening. And if we look across the industry, by my estimate, we're off by about 200 basis points from the trailing 12 months. And it's really that factor that's causing the reduction in guidance. When you go back to my script, what we were trying to stay there when we were talking about the rep restructuring accounting for most of the decline is that if you added the rep restructuring back and didn't factor that in, we'd be growing with the market."

So when I think about the size and scale of our organization with the combination of production animal and companion animal and really serving both those markets and the value that we bring to the manufacturer community, I really think that as the consolidation settles down, we will be the partner of choice. But I think that's a little bit longer term. When I think about what we can do in the shorter term, while we're lowering guidance, we are promptly taking steps to address the headwinds that we've identified. There are many levers we can pull to offset some of the profit pressure. For example, we've identified additional and we have ongoing cost management initiatives underway to bring savings to the company. But of course, it's a balance, right? Because we also have the incremental step up in expense from our IT investment, and of course, we're just ramping up that implementation. So it's definitely a balance. We also are continuing to work on our integration activities and pushing hard to drive incremental synergies. So we are all over this, but it will take some time to work through."

320186,409241663,1090692,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 22, 2016",2016-11-22,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and welcome, everyone, to today's conference call. I'd like to begin by first discussing how some of the market dynamics we are currently seeing and the strategic shifts we are making are influencing our fiscal 2017 outlook and forecast.",2075,"Thank you, John, and welcome, everyone, to today's conference call. I'd like to begin by first discussing how some of the market dynamics we are currently seeing and the strategic shifts we are making are influencing our fiscal 2017 outlook and forecast. Our end markets are currently presenting us with some unique near-term challenges on both sides of our business. 
First in our Dental business. The soft but stable market conditions we experienced in our fiscal first quarter extended into our second quarter. And on the Animal Health side, we are experiencing the effects of consolidation among the branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. While we believe this consolidation dynamic is short term in nature, it has resulted in a softer manufacturer pricing environment, which has impacted our margins in the Animal Health segment. 
Importantly, our current outlook also needs to factor in our recent strategic decision-making. Today, we announced that we will change the nature of our relationship with Sirona towards a goal of opening up new opportunities for Patterson and our customers. As we transition toward a new working relationship with Sirona, we can expect some near-term headwinds in exchange for longer-term growth opportunities. 
To reflect these dynamics, we have modified our fiscal 2017 adjusted non-GAAP earnings guidance from continuing operations to a range of $2.25 to $2.35 per diluted share. As we work through these factors, we're committed to taking the steps necessary to improve our earnings performance. 
And we remain confident in Patterson's long-term prospects. We operate in compelling markets and are building a business model that will be increasingly relevant to our customers. I'll remind everyone that there are important long-term demographic trends that underpin our business, and in our view, remain very attractive. 
In the dental market, the long-term fundamentals and trend lines are unchanged. Several factors, including a generally stable employment market and aging population and dentists seeking new ways to improve both the patient experience and how their practices operate form the basis for our optimism in dental. 
We have different but equally compelling factors on the animal health side of our business. One is the global expansion of the middle class that will result in an increase in animal protein demand. We expect the U.S. production animal market to have a global leadership role in satisfying that demand. We believe our entry into this market just over a year ago and into the position as the leading animal health distribution company in North America is a compelling long-term growth catalyst. 
Relatedly, we continue to have a lot of optimism in the long-term growth trends in the companion animal market. We believe stable market conditions and a persistent rise in both pet ownership and spending per pet will continue to generate long-term opportunities for us. This component of our growth plan remains unchanged. 
For the next few minutes, however, I'd like to provide some additional perspective on the dental market, how it's changing and how we are responding. The various ways that practitioners of all sizes need to address the requirements of dental consumers are evolving. These are changes we have been anticipating. We have been adjusting our approach to the market and our business to better position our dental operations for long-term success. These efforts have been methodical, multiyear and expansive. 
They have included: changes in our basic equipment portfolio with the intent to bring a wider range of product offerings to the entire market of customers within the market; our commitment to our new ERP platform to ensure that we are building maximum efficiency into our operations and providing the backbone and tool set for a more expansive and effective e-commerce platform that will accommodate modern buying habits; and the investment we have made in our technical service and support capabilities, which we believe represent untapped value and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. Our adaptation continues today. 
Three other factors in Dental are impacting how we view opportunities and how we are changing to capture them. The first 2 are trends: evolving practice models in the North American dental market and the continued evolution of digital dentistry. The third is the voice of our current and potential customers. We are listening very closely to our customers, and in many ways, their feedback is directly influencing our change. This has led to several important decisions and exciting developments over the past several months. 
First, in June, we took steps to optimize our sales force in Dental with a goal of building a team that is better aligned with where we believe customer needs are moving. We have gone to great lengths to build a value proposition around outstanding sales support with an emphasis on technical and operational needs of our customers. We believe these needs will become more pronounced in the future as practitioner environments of all sizes become increasingly digital. Our sales force needs to reflect this change. We have always been a destination for the best sales professionals in the business, and these efforts are putting more opportunity in front of our best people. 
Second, regarding digital dentistry. We believe we have a unique perspective. Today, we are having conversations about technological need and preference and digital workflow with a much wider range of customers. Our leading position as a distributor and enabler of dental technology gives us insights into the aspirations and decision-making considerations of practices of all sizes, and more importantly, how this is changing. 
The reality is the dental market is -- the definition of digital workflow is evolving. It means something different across the practitioner spectrum. Being the distributor of choice across the full spectrum need -- means Patterson needs to evolve and leverage our superior support platform to customers. 
Therefore, to better address the needs of the full dental market, we have made the decision not to extend the exclusivity of our relationship with Sirona beyond September of 2017. This decision is consistent with our strategy of serving the evolving needs of all of our customers and will allow us to better serve the full range of practice models. We believe the modern customer wants a partner like Patterson, who can combine both the superior technology support platform with the full range of product options. 
Our global, best-in-class support structure for technology is a critical asset. It has been a great -- it has been of great interest to many other product manufacturers who recognize the importance of this back-end support to the adoption of their technology. Patterson's technical service and support has been a major differentiator in the adoption of chairside technology. We believe that with a wider portfolio of product offerings, this asset will become even more valuable and an even stronger differentiator. We are confident that this deliberate shift away from manufacturer exclusives will unlock opportunities for everyone involved in the dental supply chain. 
I want to be very clear. We are immensely proud of our 20-year relationship with Sirona and have great admiration for their technology and history of innovation. Through this relationship, Patterson Dental effectively built the North American market for chairside technology. The combination of Sirona's CAD/CAM technology and Patterson sales, service and support has set a very high standard. Sirona's chairside solutions, like the rest of their product portfolio, will remain a very important part of our offerings. 
For practitioners that seek single-visit solutions, I believe we will remain the clear supplier of choice. We are fully committed to driving sales performance through the completion of our exclusivity period and then selling their products on a nonexclusive basis with the same commitment to driving mutual success. 
For practitioners and operations that need more flexibility and a wider range of technology options, they will now find that in Patterson. And we will eventually carry the necessary products that will allow us to meet the digital workflow needs for the entire range of customers in the market. 
Lastly, we believe our expanded product and support offering will enhance our ability to serve the full spectrum of customers. That, of course, includes the DSO community. We are very excited by our new relationship with Heartland Dental, the largest dental support organization in the United States. The hallmarks of Patterson Dental: superior sale, service and support with technical applications, played a large role in this win. In our conversations with Heartland, it was clear they were seeking a business partner that shared the same philosophy of bringing best-in-class products and solutions to their network, with a strong focus and commitment to helping them improve in the operational areas they outlined for us. 
Our respective teams immediately began working together to begin delivering the solutions that form the basis of our partnership, and the collaboration and cultural fit have been outstanding. This is just the beginning of what we expect to be a broader and more fruitful period of engagement with dental support organizations and one that dovetails with our efforts to adapt to a changing market. 
In terms of capital deployment. Many DSOs choose to deploy their resources to expand their reach with additional offices and elect to outsource some of their capabilities to their lab partners. Some of our DSO customers already have or will embrace full chairside restoration capability. Our superior service and technical support in that arena will be of critical importance to these DSOs and the local success of their practices. 
A value-added distributor such as Patterson needs to be able to address the entire market with whatever the individual customer needs to make their professional office the most successful. Undoubtedly, this is the start of a very exciting time for our customers, our sales force and the product manufacturing community. We expect this shift within Patterson Dental to create new opportunities for us and for our customers and to highlight the competitive advantage we demonstrate in the market every day. 
As I mentioned earlier, we continued to see relatively stable but soft end markets in dental in the second quarter. As with our first quarter, this was generally in line with what has been more widely reported within the North American dental market, and the effects were most evident in consumable sales levels. However, we still believe a portion of this impact resulted from disruption caused by our sales force realignment initiative. As we work through the transition caused by this realignment, we expect this impact to moderate. 
On the equipment side. We are pleased with our performance during the quarter, especially considering the different -- difficult year-over-year comparable we faced with CEREC. From our point of view, we are encouraged that practitioners remain willing to invest for the future success of their businesses. 
Within the category, volumes on basic equipment and digital X-ray were solid during the second quarter. In particular, we are pleased with how our broader basic equipment product portfolio is performing. You'll recall that our basic equipment product category also experienced a change in manufacturer relationships. Adding more product manufacturer options has benefited our customers and has strengthened this category for Patterson Dental. 
Now a look at our Animal Health segment. We continue to see stable to strengthening conditions across the segment during the quarter. In production animal, we saw overall recovery in end markets, with the swine market leading the way. We also saw strength in the beef cattle market. However, recovery in dairy end markets is proving to be more protracted than anticipated. Companion health markets continued to perform well during the quarter. 
As we mentioned last quarter, sales execution has been a significant priority for us, and we are pleased to see substantial sales growth and share gains across the segment. This is certainly a reflection of our efforts to unify our sales teams and present one Patterson Animal Health segment to the market. 
However, we currently face a challenging pricing environment with branded pharmaceutical companies, which is the result of market consolidation. This has impacted our ability to translate the significant sales momentum into profit contributions we want to see. I'll remind you that Patterson Animal Health is the North American leader in this space. We believe that our scale and scope are important assets, and as we work through this period of consolidation, we will emerge as the partner of choice for pharmaceutical manufacturers. And as we do so, we continue to be intently focused on our customers and operational excellence. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials."

During the fiscal 2017 second quarter, our growth agenda and sales execution were key focal points for Patterson. Overall, we remained competitive in our markets during the quarter. We broadened",1785,"Thank you, Scott, and thank you all for joining us today. During the fiscal 2017 second quarter, our growth agenda and sales execution were key focal points for Patterson. 
Overall, we remained competitive in our markets during the quarter. We broadened our markets in the Dental business and saw substantial sales growth and gained market share in Animal Health. However, certain strategic initiatives, combined with challenging marketplace dynamics in both Dental and Animal Health, adversely affected our year-over-year quarterly financial results and our outlook for the balance of the year. 
As I've done in the past, I will discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to focus on our current portfolio of businesses. Where appropriate, I will make note of our adjusted results which, as John explained, excludes the impact of certain nonrecurring and noncash items. Also, our sales discussions for each business segment will exclude foreign currency impact to provide a more normalized view of our results. 
Taking a look at our top line performance. Consolidated sales for the fiscal 2017 second quarter increased 2.1% to $1.4 billion on a reported basis. Excluding the foreign currency translation impact, revenue grew 4.1%. 
Turning to margins. Our second quarter consolidated operating margin was 6.5%, which was 50 basis points lower compared to the prior year quarter. The operating margin decline was chiefly due to decreased profitability in our Animal Health business, which accounted for the largest percentage of our consolidated net sales. I'll expand on this more in a moment. 
On the bottom line, reported net income from continuing operations was $45.8 million, up 12% to $0.48 per diluted share compared to $42.6 million or $0.43 per diluted share a year ago. Adjusted net income from continuing operations declined 3.2% to $53.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was flat versus the prior year quarter at $0.56 per diluted share. 
Now let's move to our segments. As Scott explained, in Dental, we saw a softer but relatively stable market in the 2017 second quarter, which led to essentially flat sales on a GAAP and constant currency basis. On the consumable side, the dental market continued to reflect somewhat slower than historic growth. Patterson sales of consumable dental supplies decreased 2.5% in the second quarter. We believe, however, that the sales force realignment that we implemented in the first quarter primarily contributed to the consumables decline. While this initiative is important to better address the needs of the dental customer, it is causing some disruption in the channel. 
Turning to equipment. Patterson has a long tradition as an industry leader, and our equipment category was a bright spot in the quarter. We were pleased with our sales in this category, which grew 4.2% in the second quarter. Sales were led by double-digit increases in core equipment and digital X-ray products, which offset lower CEREC sales. 
Looking at segment margins. Operating margin improved 30 basis points, led by our sales force realignment initiative and lower incremental expense. Overall, we believe that the performance of our Dental business in the second quarter was competitive relative to the industry. 
As Scott mentioned, at the end of the second quarter, we elected not to extend exclusivity with Sirona beyond September 2017. As a result, we expect to record a pretax noncash impairment charge in the third quarter of approximately $36 million or $0.24 per diluted share related to the distribution fee associated with the CEREC product component of this arrangement. 
While this noncash accounting charge will not affect Patterson's liquidity, cash flows or compliance with debt covenants, we expect this decision could negatively affect near-term operation. This impact is reflected in our updated fiscal 2017 earnings guidance. 
Now turning to our Animal Health segment. We saw sales expansion and share gains in our Animal Health business in the 2017 second quarter. Our Animal Health sales grew 4.2% over the prior quarter on a reported basis. After adjusting for the impact of foreign currency, Animal Health segment sales increased 7.8%. 
Second quarter reported sales in our companion animal business rose 3.6%. Adjusting for currency, companion animal sales increased 10.8% over last year. Looking more specifically at the U.S. companion animal sales, reported growth was up 15.8% and 9.8% when adjusted for agency buy-sell. Growth in production animal sales in the 2017 second quarter improved 4.9% versus a year ago. Our overall performance in production animal reflects a stronger swine market, an improved beef market and continued softness within the dairy portion of the business. 
Looking at segment margins. While we generated solid sales volume increases, that growth did not translate to the bottom line improvement. We are capturing market share, although it's not at the profit margin we'd like. A reason for this is a more challenging environment related to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers' pricing trends, which contributed to an 80 basis point decline in operating margins during the quarter. We are implementing programs to respond to these challenges and remain focused on our customers, along with disciplined execution and integration synergy capture. 
Our ongoing Animal Health integration and progress to our planned synergies remain on track. We are focused this fiscal year on more effectively leveraging logistics across both of our businesses and further consolidating our back-office functions. We still expect to deliver between $18 million and $20 million in run rate savings by the end of this fiscal year, which will enable us to meet the $20 million to $30 million run rate of synergies in year 3 that we announced at the time of the acquisition. 
Now a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. Net cash generated from continuing operations was $17.5 million compared to using $21.7 million in the prior year quarter. We believe that cash flow will continue to improve for the balance of the year. We remain confident in our ability to generate cash returns in our business and expect to return to converting between 85% and 100% of net income into free cash flow in fiscal 2017. 
CapEx totaled $14 million in the fiscal 2017 second quarter and included investments in our corporate-wide information technology initiative. Inventories were up by $40 million year-over-year. Dental equipment inventories came down in the quarter, but higher inventories remain in our Animal Health business and to maintain service levels through our integration and ERP implementation. 
Regarding our ERP initiative. During this period, we are essentially running redundant systems to help facilitate the transition to our new platform. We believe that our new ERP platform will lead to new efficiencies. However, some of them cannot be fully realized until the platform is totally implemented. That said, we believe we have a sound process in place to migrate to our new system in a way that ensures business continuity and high levels of customer support and leads to significant future efficiencies once the transition is complete. 
We continue to make good progress on the implementation. Our investments enabled 9 additional locations to go live in the second quarter: 3 fulfillment centers, 1 vet call center, 2 Animal Health branches and 3 Dental branches. Together this resulted in a $3 million expense increase for the quarter. 
As previously disclosed, we continue to expect a pretax $25 million step-up in the operating expense for the full year. This expense will accelerate in the back half of the year as we begin to depreciate the investment and scale up deployment. 
We continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy by continuing -- or by returning cash to our shareholders. Demonstrating our commitment to enhancing shareholder value, we returned approximately $48.5 million to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter and nearly $100 million on a year-to-date basis. We remain fully committed to our dividend. 
Our strong cash flow generation is an asset and allows us to fully support our capital allocation strategy, which includes returning capital to our shareholders. Given our continued position of financial strength, we have the ability to step up our share repurchases to deliver additional value to our shareholders. We have approximately 15 million shares remaining under our current board authorization. Our strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it makes sense to do so. 
Now turning to taxes. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.7%. The adjusted annual tax rate is expected to be in the range of 34.5% to 35.5%. 
Now I will review our revised fiscal 2017 guidance. As mentioned in our earnings release, in light of both external factors and our strategic decisions, we have reexamined our financial outlook for the year. When we entered fiscal 2017, our guidance was predicated on end markets similar to those experienced in fiscal 2016. However, Patterson and others in our industry have seen softness in the U.S. dental market and challenges with branded pharmaceutical companies in our Animal Health business. 
Just as important as these external factors are the strategic decisions we made in the first half of fiscal 2017: First, to realign our dental sales force to enhance our effectiveness; and more recently, to move away from exclusive manufacturer relationships to leverage our support infrastructure across a broader range of products and customers. While both of these decisions are key to evolving the customer-centric approach for which we are known and realizing our grow conditions longer term, we recognize they will affect near-term financial performance. Therefore, we are updating our guidance as follows. 
As Scott noted, we now anticipate adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 per diluted share. Our adjusted guidance excludes the impact of onetime transaction-related cost, integration and business restructuring expenses, deal amortization and noncash impairment charges totaling $0.60 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, we expect fiscal 2017 earnings from continuing operations in the range of $1.65 to $1.75 per diluted share. 
While we are only off a few cents from our internal plan through the first half, we are reducing our guidance to this new range based on what we see in the back half of fiscal '17. Specifically, in Dental, the softness in the market, coupled with the transition of our exclusive relationship with Sirona; and in Animal Health, the impact of the margin decline experienced in the current quarter will continue in the near term as we diligently work to improve margins. 
Our guidance range assumes North American and international market conditions similar to those experienced in the first half of fiscal 2017 and includes a $25 million pretax step-up in operating expense associated with the ERP system implementation. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments."

As I mentioned, recently, Patterson is in the middle of an important period of change. Our portfolio moves, technology investments and shifts in how we address the needs of our customers are all part of an important evolution. But I'd like to emphasize that just as we have demonstrated our commitment to positioning Patterson in the future, we are equally committed to restoring Patterson to a more profitable growth in the near term and have multiple levers to pull to do so. 
Fortunately, we are able to do this from a position of operational and financial strength. Keys to our operational strength are our enterprise resource planning initiative and our sales and support infrastructure. We expect our ERP initiative to significantly improve our ability to help Patterson stay in front of our customers' needs and pace of change. I have visited various locations where the cutovers to our new system are taking place, and I am pleased with our progress and operational continuity. 
I commend all of our hard-working employees who have dedicated themselves to pursuing the smooth implementation of this system. We have built a very robust sales, service and technical support structure that customers truly value as they increase their dependence on technology to run their operations. 
Our financial strengths gives us the ability to support each aspect of our capital allocation strategy, and this will continue. While we face some short-term market challenges and navigate the change we have strategically elected, I am confident in the actions we are taking to position Patterson for the future and optimistic for the prospects of our customers, employees and shareholders. 
Now we'd like to take any questions you may have, so I'll turn the call back over to Catherine."

And then I'll turn it over to Ann to maybe talk some of the economics. But I think it's critical that as I talk about our decision, we also talk about the history and partnership because we do have people who are newer to the story, and I think it gives very important context. If you go back to the 1990s, it really was a vision towards the future that the Patterson management team had as they approached Siemens Dental with the offer that we would sell and service the CEREC 2 exclusively. At the time, Siemens had a game-changing idea with single-visit chairside dentistry but really had very limited commercial success to sell the product. We like to say that agreement was the beginning of what we call a 20-year overnight success story, as we partnered with the eventual spin-out of Siemens Dental, which we -- became Sirona, to really do true pioneer work to change dentistry. And I would say we could not be more proud, and I speak for all of the employees of Patterson, about the work we've done together. Now more -- or more excited about what we are going to accomplish together in the future. I think it's important that everyone knows our executive teams, both at Patterson and Sirona for years, have been very consistent in our approach that there would be a day where Patterson will need to expand the portfolio of products we sell to meet the needs of our customers, and also Sirona will want to access more of the market through potential expanded distribution. This is the critical point. I think we both, as partners, feel now is the perfect time at the end of our contract to move our relationship to the next level. And really, this is predicated on our mutual confidence, and I would say, strong confidence in our ability to compete in the marketplace. As a reminder, we've seen this scenario. We've -- it's playing out right now in our chair business. And our great partner, A-dec, we remain their largest partner. We have the ability to sell more product, which has helped us access more customers. So the other piece is really unlocking growth for both companies and the commitment of both companies of helping the profession accelerate the adoption of digital dentistry. So a key part of this strategic decision is we both feel an increased interest in activity that will come from expanded distribution will lead to a potential acceleration of sales. Bottom line is more people are going to be talking about digital dentistry. More people will be talking about CEREC. And we think we can sell 7 out of 10 instead of 5 out of 5. And over time, net-net, this will be a real positive for Patterson and Sirona."

And then in addition to that, we anticipate we'll incur some incremental cost to protect the technology assets we've built over the last 20 years. When you think longer term out to 2018, at this point, there's still a lot of moving pieces. In addition to Sirona, we plan to add additional technology products to the portfolio. We're onboarding large new customers. And then, of course, we should start to benefit from our ERP investment in the back half of 2018. So we'll continue to work through the challenges that we're facing over the next 90 days. And our plan is to update you on our longer-term outlook next quarter.

And I don't want to call out specific manufacturers, but it's clear that we are in the midst of a significant realignment of some of our key partners. With that said, we really think long term. And I think the important thing is that we have repeatedly demonstrated our ability to move share in the market. And that with our scale reaching both companion and production animal customers really gives us confidence that we'll be the partner of choice among manufacturers as consolidation settles in. So I'll turn it over to Ann to talk -- walk you through the financial impact, and then I want to talk about mitigation."

And it's a variety of factors, John. Whether it's rebates, mix, and just kind of overall, the changes that we're seeing in the terms of the agreements. Where -- we are implementing programs immediately to respond to these challenges, but it will take some time to work through. And as a result, we're taking down guidance for the back half of the year to more closely align with our current quarter performance. So while we're initially targeting operating margins for the segment to be flat for the year after absorbing an allocation for the step up in expense associated with the ERP implementation, we now expect margins for the full year to decline between 40 and 60 basis points for the year in Animal Health."

And really, the feedback I've gotten, and we've done some focus groups as well with some of our top salespeople, is the ability to, at every point, put the customer first in the decision-making process is incredibly powerful. And I think the exclusivity, particularly on CEREC, served Patterson and Sirona so well historically because you need focus and commitment to make a market, and we made a market together. But we feel now there's momentum and actually a real chance for acceleration in the space that's going to let both Patterson and Sirona win. So we learned this through the A-dec decision, which has been very powerful. And I talked to our salespeople all over the country, and I can't tell you how many times our best salespeople say, ""Let me compete. Just give me all the products and we'll do what's best for the customer."" And then it also puts, I think, a really excited, competitive spirit back on the manufacturer, that best product wins and most effective, most efficient product wins. So in my previous answer, I talked about the confidence that Sirona and Patterson share, and I have been in this relationship for 20 years.

You mentioned in one of your answers that some of the disruption here may be protecting the technology assets you've built around the CEREC platform and the Sirona platform. I just -- I'm not quite sure I understand what you mean there. If you can maybe clarify that. And then also wondering on the sales disruption side for CEREC, if that is indeed an issue you're kind of imputing in guidance. Why would there be a sales disruption in the near term? I would think reps would want to be out there selling this, especially before more competition comes in. And I've heard you put a quota in now this morning for the next 9 months or so before the change happens. So why the top line impact? I'm a little unclear on that as well."

But I think as it relates to protecting the assets that we've built, this is really around a couple of areas. One is our people. We've been selling this product for 20-plus years. We have deep expertise. So just making sure that we're doing the right thing for our people in terms of as we transition to a competitive environment. And then it's really the intellectual property around the processes that we've built around training and after-sales support. We have quite the asset at the Patterson Technology Center in terms of providing first-class support, and we just want to make sure that we're doing the right things. And so there'll be some additional investment there just to make sure that we protect that IP. As it relates to the sales disruption. I think when we put the guidance together, we wanted to make sure that we were conservative. And as we've gone through other transitions in the past historically, whether that's the A-dec change or the change when we changed how we sold other technology products back with the Eaglesoft software days, sometimes, when you're going through a transition, there is some near-term disruption in the field. So from a conservative standpoint, we did mute the top line in our outlook just to account for that. But with that said, we fully intend to execute on the contract for the balance of our exclusivity and leave no rock unturned in terms of sales leads. But I'll turn it over to Scott to add to that."

And we will do that at every turn because we feel it's an absolute competitive advantage today and it's only going to grow with time. Now three, to the sales force. And I would say, I have great confidence in our managers, in our salespeople, to absolutely, as you said, use this as a rallying cry. We have incredibly deep relationships with Sirona. Sirona is family to Patterson, and Patterson is family to Sirona. And it is our intent that we use this as an opportunity to finish off the chapter of the 20-year exclusive but also use this as a launching pad for what we think is going to be a very exciting time of competition. And when I had our people in Minneapolis last week, what got me the most energized is the confidence of our managers and how excited they are to compete and leverage what we've put blood, sweat and tears into over the last 20 years. So I think you're right on in terms of the conservatism in the guidance, but it is our absolute intent that we exceed those conservative targets."

So if we think about what's changed in the marketplace and how those recent events are impacting our second quarter results and then the implications to 2017. You touched on 2 factors with unexpected changes in the marketplace that negatively impacts the balance of the year. So there's the softness in the U.S. dental market and then challenges with branded pharmaceutical pricing in our Animal Health business. And then in addition to those factors is the strategic decisions we made in the first half of the year, most recently the move towards nonexclusive manufacturer relationships within our technology portfolio. So when I think about breaking that down, what I can tell you is about half of the reduction in guidance is due to Animal Health and the other half is due to Dental. And when I think about Dental, Jeff, I would say probably 1/2 to 2/3 is really more on the consumable market softening and some disruption from the sales force restructuring. And then the other 1/3 is probably around the Sirona piece. That's rough buckets."

I would say on the general market commentary that the soft was -- softness we experienced and the entire industry experienced in the summer continued through the fall. And as we looked at the back half of the year, we decided to take a conservative approach, saying that there wouldn't be any market improvement. I would say the market is stable. And if I had to look at a growth rate, I would say it's probably 0 to 100 basis points. So a lethargic market. So while we're disappointed that it didn't swing back post-summer, I think we have really strong potential fundamentals for the market that give us optimism going forward. You've heard this before. It's stable to improving consumer confidence. It's low unemployment levels. It's continued trend of customers investing in technology. And then it's the demand driven for favorable North American demographics. So on the sales force side, and I think this is an important part of the strategy because we absolutely are committed to it and feel like we made the right move to move the business towards where the market is going, the sales erosion is contained to a certain number of customers. But when you look at the upside opportunity of almost 19,000 new customers that we've assigned some of our best salespeople to, we look at the long-term growth opportunity as being substantial and material. What we did not anticipate in the front end, and maybe I'll turn it over to Ann to talk about just what consumable softening does to our operating model."

So certainly, when we put together our guidance for the year, knowing that we were going to do the rep realignment, we absolutely factored in some distraction in the field. I think what we didn't account for is the continued end softening of the markets -- or end market softening. And if we look across the industry, by my estimate, we're off by about 200 basis points from the trailing 12 months. And it's really that factor that's causing the reduction in guidance. When you go back to my script, what we were trying to say there when we were talking about the rep restructuring accounting for most of the decline is that if you added the rep restructuring back and didn't factor that in, we'd be growing with the market."

But I think that's a little bit longer term. When I think about what we can do in the shorter term, while we're lowering guidance, we are promptly taking steps to address the headwinds that we've identified. There are many levers we can pull to offset some of the profit pressure. For example, we've identified additional and we have ongoing cost management initiatives underway to bring savings to the company. But of course, it's a balance, right? Because we also have the incremental step up in expense from our IT investment, and of course, we're just ramping up that implementation. So it's definitely a balance. We also are continuing to work on integration activities and pushing hard to drive incremental synergies. So we are all over this, but it will take some time to work through."

320186,409241663,1090930,"Patterson Companies, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 22, 2016",2016-11-22,"Earnings Calls","Patterson Companies, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and welcome, everyone, to today's conference call. I'd like to begin by first discussing how some of the market dynamics we are currently seeing and the strategic shifts we are making are influencing our fiscal 2017 outlook and forecast.",2075,"Thank you, John, and welcome, everyone, to today's conference call. I'd like to begin by first discussing how some of the market dynamics we are currently seeing and the strategic shifts we are making are influencing our fiscal 2017 outlook and forecast. Our end markets are currently presenting us with some unique near-term challenges on both sides of our business. 
First in our Dental business. The soft but stable market conditions we experienced in our fiscal first quarter extended into our second quarter. And on the Animal Health side, we are experiencing the effects of consolidation among the branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. While we believe this consolidation dynamic is short term in nature, it has resulted in a softer manufacturer pricing environment, which has impacted our margins in the Animal Health segment. 
Importantly, our current outlook also needs to factor in our recent strategic decision-making. Today, we announced that we will change the nature of our relationship with Sirona towards a goal of opening up new opportunities for Patterson and our customers. As we transition toward a new working relationship with Sirona, we can expect some near-term headwinds in exchange for longer-term growth opportunities. 
To reflect these dynamics, we have modified our fiscal 2017 adjusted non-GAAP earnings guidance from continuing operations to a range of $2.25 to $2.35 per diluted share. As we work through these factors, we're committed to taking the steps necessary to improve our earnings performance. 
And we remain confident in Patterson's long-term prospects. We operate in compelling markets and are building a business model that will be increasingly relevant to our customers. I'll remind everyone that there are important long-term demographic trends that underpin our business, and in our view, remain very attractive. 
In the dental market, the long-term fundamentals and trend lines are unchanged. Several factors, including a generally stable employment market and aging population and dentists seeking new ways to improve both the patient experience and how their practices operate form the basis for our optimism in dental. 
We have different but equally compelling factors on the animal health side of our business. One is the global expansion of the middle class that will result in an increase in animal protein demand. We expect the U.S. production animal market to have a global leadership role in satisfying that demand. We believe our entry into this market just over a year ago and into the position as the leading animal health distribution company in North America is a compelling long-term growth catalyst. 
Relatedly, we continue to have a lot of optimism in the long-term growth trends in the companion animal market. We believe stable market conditions and a persistent rise in both pet ownership and spending per pet will continue to generate long-term opportunities for us. This component of our growth plan remains unchanged. 
For the next few minutes, however, I'd like to provide some additional perspective on the dental market, how it's changing and how we are responding. The various ways that practitioners of all sizes need to address the requirements of dental consumers are evolving. These are changes we have been anticipating. We have been adjusting our approach to the market and our business to better position our dental operations for long-term success. These efforts have been methodical, multiyear and expansive. 
They have included: changes in our basic equipment portfolio with the intent to bring a wider range of product offerings to the entire market of customers within the market; our commitment to our new ERP platform to ensure that we are building maximum efficiency into our operations and providing the backbone and tool set for a more expansive and effective e-commerce platform that will accommodate modern buying habits; and the investment we have made in our technical service and support capabilities, which we believe represent untapped value and will play an increasingly important role in the years ahead. Our adaptation continues today. 
Three other factors in Dental are impacting how we view opportunities and how we are changing to capture them. The first 2 are trends: evolving practice models in the North American dental market and the continued evolution of digital dentistry. The third is the voice of our current and potential customers. We are listening very closely to our customers, and in many ways, their feedback is directly influencing our change. This has led to several important decisions and exciting developments over the past several months. 
First, in June, we took steps to optimize our sales force in Dental with a goal of building a team that is better aligned with where we believe customer needs are moving. We have gone to great lengths to build a value proposition around outstanding sales support with an emphasis on technical and operational needs of our customers. We believe these needs will become more pronounced in the future as practitioner environments of all sizes become increasingly digital. Our sales force needs to reflect this change. We have always been a destination for the best sales professionals in the business, and these efforts are putting more opportunity in front of our best people. 
Second, regarding digital dentistry. We believe we have a unique perspective. Today, we are having conversations about technological need and preference and digital workflow with a much wider range of customers. Our leading position as a distributor and enabler of dental technology gives us insights into the aspirations and decision-making considerations of practices of all sizes, and more importantly, how this is changing. 
The reality is the dental market is -- the definition of digital workflow is evolving. It means something different across the practitioner spectrum. Being the distributor of choice across the full spectrum need -- means Patterson needs to evolve and leverage our superior support platform to customers. 
Therefore, to better address the needs of the full dental market, we have made the decision not to extend the exclusivity of our relationship with Sirona beyond September of 2017. This decision is consistent with our strategy of serving the evolving needs of all of our customers and will allow us to better serve the full range of practice models. We believe the modern customer wants a partner like Patterson, who can combine both the superior technology support platform with the full range of product options. 
Our global, best-in-class support structure for technology is a critical asset. It has been a great -- it has been of great interest to many other product manufacturers who recognize the importance of this back-end support to the adoption of their technology. Patterson's technical service and support has been a major differentiator in the adoption of chairside technology. We believe that with a wider portfolio of product offerings, this asset will become even more valuable and an even stronger differentiator. We are confident that this deliberate shift away from manufacturer exclusives will unlock opportunities for everyone involved in the dental supply chain. 
I want to be very clear. We are immensely proud of our 20-year relationship with Sirona and have great admiration for their technology and history of innovation. Through this relationship, Patterson Dental effectively built the North American market for chairside technology. The combination of Sirona's CAD/CAM technology and Patterson sales, service and support has set a very high standard. Sirona's chairside solutions, like the rest of their product portfolio, will remain a very important part of our offerings. 
For practitioners that seek single-visit solutions, I believe we will remain the clear supplier of choice. We are fully committed to driving sales performance through the completion of our exclusivity period and then selling their products on a nonexclusive basis with the same commitment to driving mutual success. 
For practitioners and operations that need more flexibility and a wider range of technology options, they will now find that in Patterson. And we will eventually carry the necessary products that will allow us to meet the digital workflow needs for the entire range of customers in the market. 
Lastly, we believe our expanded product and support offering will enhance our ability to serve the full spectrum of customers. That, of course, includes the DSO community. We are very excited by our new relationship with Heartland Dental, the largest dental support organization in the United States. The hallmarks of Patterson Dental: superior sale, service and support with technical applications, played a large role in this win. In our conversations with Heartland, it was clear they were seeking a business partner that shared the same philosophy of bringing best-in-class products and solutions to their network, with a strong focus and commitment to helping them improve in the operational areas they outlined for us. 
Our respective teams immediately began working together to begin delivering the solutions that form the basis of our partnership, and the collaboration and cultural fit have been outstanding. This is just the beginning of what we expect to be a broader and more fruitful period of engagement with dental support organizations and one that dovetails with our efforts to adapt to a changing market. 
In terms of capital deployment. Many DSOs choose to deploy their resources to expand their reach with additional offices and elect to outsource some of their capabilities to their lab partners. Some of our DSO customers already have or will embrace full chairside restoration capability. Our superior service and technical support in that arena will be of critical importance to these DSOs and the local success of their practices. 
A value-added distributor such as Patterson needs to be able to address the entire market with whatever the individual customer needs to make their professional office the most successful. Undoubtedly, this is the start of a very exciting time for our customers, our sales force and the product manufacturing community. We expect this shift within Patterson Dental to create new opportunities for us and for our customers and to highlight the competitive advantage we demonstrate in the market every day. 
As I mentioned earlier, we continued to see relatively stable but soft end markets in dental in the second quarter. As with our first quarter, this was generally in line with what has been more widely reported within the North American dental market, and the effects were most evident in consumable sales levels. However, we still believe a portion of this impact resulted from disruption caused by our sales force realignment initiative. As we work through the transition caused by this realignment, we expect this impact to moderate. 
On the equipment side. We are pleased with our performance during the quarter, especially considering the different -- difficult year-over-year comparable we faced with CEREC. From our point of view, we are encouraged that practitioners remain willing to invest for the future success of their businesses. 
Within the category, volumes on basic equipment and digital X-ray were solid during the second quarter. In particular, we are pleased with how our broader basic equipment product portfolio is performing. You'll recall that our basic equipment product category also experienced a change in manufacturer relationships. Adding more product manufacturer options has benefited our customers and has strengthened this category for Patterson Dental. 
Now a look at our Animal Health segment. We continue to see stable to strengthening conditions across the segment during the quarter. In production animal, we saw overall recovery in end markets, with the swine market leading the way. We also saw strength in the beef cattle market. However, recovery in dairy end markets is proving to be more protracted than anticipated. Companion health markets continued to perform well during the quarter. 
As we mentioned last quarter, sales execution has been a significant priority for us, and we are pleased to see substantial sales growth and share gains across the segment. This is certainly a reflection of our efforts to unify our sales teams and present one Patterson Animal Health segment to the market. 
However, we currently face a challenging pricing environment with branded pharmaceutical companies, which is the result of market consolidation. This has impacted our ability to translate the significant sales momentum into profit contributions we want to see. I'll remind you that Patterson Animal Health is the North American leader in this space. We believe that our scale and scope are important assets, and as we work through this period of consolidation, we will emerge as the partner of choice for pharmaceutical manufacturers. And as we do so, we continue to be intently focused on our customers and operational excellence. 
With that, I'll ask Ann to review the financials."

During the fiscal 2017 second quarter, our growth agenda and sales execution were key focal points for Patterson. Overall, we remained competitive in our markets during the quarter. We broadened",1785,"Thank you, Scott, and thank you all for joining us today. During the fiscal 2017 second quarter, our growth agenda and sales execution were key focal points for Patterson. 
Overall, we remained competitive in our markets during the quarter. We broadened our markets in the Dental business and saw substantial sales growth and gained market share in Animal Health. However, certain strategic initiatives, combined with challenging marketplace dynamics in both Dental and Animal Health, adversely affected our year-over-year quarterly financial results and our outlook for the balance of the year. 
As I've done in the past, I will discuss sales and adjusted results from continuing operations to focus on our current portfolio of businesses. Where appropriate, I will make note of our adjusted results which, as John explained, excludes the impact of certain nonrecurring and noncash items. Also, our sales discussions for each business segment will exclude foreign currency impact to provide a more normalized view of our results. 
Taking a look at our top line performance. Consolidated sales for the fiscal 2017 second quarter increased 2.1% to $1.4 billion on a reported basis. Excluding the foreign currency translation impact, revenue grew 4.1%. 
Turning to margins. Our second quarter consolidated operating margin was 6.5%, which was 50 basis points lower compared to the prior year quarter. The operating margin decline was chiefly due to decreased profitability in our Animal Health business, which accounted for the largest percentage of our consolidated net sales. I'll expand on this more in a moment. 
On the bottom line, reported net income from continuing operations was $45.8 million, up 12% to $0.48 per diluted share compared to $42.6 million or $0.43 per diluted share a year ago. Adjusted net income from continuing operations declined 3.2% to $53.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was flat versus the prior year quarter at $0.56 per diluted share. 
Now let's move to our segments. As Scott explained, in Dental, we saw a softer but relatively stable market in the 2017 second quarter, which led to essentially flat sales on a GAAP and constant currency basis. On the consumable side, the dental market continued to reflect somewhat slower than historic growth. Patterson sales of consumable dental supplies decreased 2.5% in the second quarter. We believe, however, that the sales force realignment that we implemented in the first quarter primarily contributed to the consumables decline. While this initiative is important to better address the needs of the dental customer, it is causing some disruption in the channel. 
Turning to equipment. Patterson has a long tradition as an industry leader, and our equipment category was a bright spot in the quarter. We were pleased with our sales in this category, which grew 4.2% in the second quarter. Sales were led by double-digit increases in core equipment and digital X-ray products, which offset lower CEREC sales. 
Looking at segment margins. Operating margin improved 30 basis points, led by our sales force realignment initiative and lower incremental expense. Overall, we believe that the performance of our Dental business in the second quarter was competitive relative to the industry. 
As Scott mentioned, at the end of the second quarter, we elected not to extend exclusivity with Sirona beyond September 2017. As a result, we expect to record a pretax noncash impairment charge in the third quarter of approximately $36 million or $0.24 per diluted share related to the distribution fee associated with the CEREC product component of this arrangement. 
While this noncash accounting charge will not affect Patterson's liquidity, cash flows or compliance with debt covenants, we expect this decision could negatively affect near-term operation. This impact is reflected in our updated fiscal 2017 earnings guidance. 
Now turning to our Animal Health segment. We saw sales expansion and share gains in our Animal Health business in the 2017 second quarter. Our Animal Health sales grew 4.2% over the prior quarter on a reported basis. After adjusting for the impact of foreign currency, Animal Health segment sales increased 7.8%. 
Second quarter reported sales in our companion animal business rose 3.6%. Adjusting for currency, companion animal sales increased 10.8% over last year. Looking more specifically at the U.S. companion animal sales, reported growth was up 15.8% and 9.8% when adjusted for agency buy-sell. Growth in production animal sales in the 2017 second quarter improved 4.9% versus a year ago. Our overall performance in production animal reflects a stronger swine market, an improved beef market and continued softness within the dairy portion of the business. 
Looking at segment margins. While we generated solid sales volume increases, that growth did not translate to the bottom line improvement. We are capturing market share, although it's not at the profit margin we'd like. A reason for this is a more challenging environment related to branded pharmaceutical manufacturers' pricing trends, which contributed to an 80 basis point decline in operating margins during the quarter. We are implementing programs to respond to these challenges and remain focused on our customers, along with disciplined execution and integration synergy capture. 
Our ongoing Animal Health integration and progress to our planned synergies remain on track. We are focused this fiscal year on more effectively leveraging logistics across both of our businesses and further consolidating our back-office functions. We still expect to deliver between $18 million and $20 million in run rate savings by the end of this fiscal year, which will enable us to meet the $20 million to $30 million run rate of synergies in year 3 that we announced at the time of the acquisition. 
Now a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. Net cash generated from continuing operations was $17.5 million compared to using $21.7 million in the prior year quarter. We believe that cash flow will continue to improve for the balance of the year. We remain confident in our ability to generate cash returns in our business and expect to return to converting between 85% and 100% of net income into free cash flow in fiscal 2017. 
CapEx totaled $14 million in the fiscal 2017 second quarter and included investments in our corporate-wide information technology initiative. Inventories were up by $40 million year-over-year. Dental equipment inventories came down in the quarter, but higher inventories remain in our Animal Health business and to maintain service levels through our integration and ERP implementation. 
Regarding our ERP initiative. During this period, we are essentially running redundant systems to help facilitate the transition to our new platform. We believe that our new ERP platform will lead to new efficiencies. However, some of them cannot be fully realized until the platform is totally implemented. That said, we believe we have a sound process in place to migrate to our new system in a way that ensures business continuity and high levels of customer support and leads to significant future efficiencies once the transition is complete. 
We continue to make good progress on the implementation. Our investments enabled 9 additional locations to go live in the second quarter: 3 fulfillment centers, 1 vet call center, 2 Animal Health branches and 3 Dental branches. Together this resulted in a $3 million expense increase for the quarter. 
As previously disclosed, we continue to expect a pretax $25 million step-up in the operating expense for the full year. This expense will accelerate in the back half of the year as we begin to depreciate the investment and scale up deployment. 
We continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy by continuing -- or by returning cash to our shareholders. Demonstrating our commitment to enhancing shareholder value, we returned approximately $48.5 million to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the quarter and nearly $100 million on a year-to-date basis. We remain fully committed to our dividend. 
Our strong cash flow generation is an asset and allows us to fully support our capital allocation strategy, which includes returning capital to our shareholders. Given our continued position of financial strength, we have the ability to step up our share repurchases to deliver additional value to our shareholders. We have approximately 15 million shares remaining under our current board authorization. Our strong balance sheet gives us the flexibility to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it makes sense to do so. 
Now turning to taxes. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.7%. The adjusted annual tax rate is expected to be in the range of 34.5% to 35.5%. 
Now I will review our revised fiscal 2017 guidance. As mentioned in our earnings release, in light of both external factors and our strategic decisions, we have reexamined our financial outlook for the year. When we entered fiscal 2017, our guidance was predicated on end markets similar to those experienced in fiscal 2016. However, Patterson and others in our industry have seen softness in the U.S. dental market and challenges with branded pharmaceutical companies in our Animal Health business. 
Just as important as these external factors are the strategic decisions we made in the first half of fiscal 2017: First, to realign our dental sales force to enhance our effectiveness; and more recently, to move away from exclusive manufacturer relationships to leverage our support infrastructure across a broader range of products and customers. While both of these decisions are key to evolving the customer-centric approach for which we are known and realizing our grow conditions longer term, we recognize they will affect near-term financial performance. Therefore, we are updating our guidance as follows. 
As Scott noted, we now anticipate adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the range of $2.25 to $2.35 per diluted share. Our adjusted guidance excludes the impact of onetime transaction-related cost, integration and business restructuring expenses, deal amortization and noncash impairment charges totaling $0.60 per diluted share. On a GAAP basis, we expect fiscal 2017 earnings from continuing operations in the range of $1.65 to $1.75 per diluted share. 
While we are only off a few cents from our internal plan through the first half, we are reducing our guidance to this new range based on what we see in the back half of fiscal '17. Specifically, in Dental, the softness in the market, coupled with the transition of our exclusive relationship with Sirona; and in Animal Health, the impact of the margin decline experienced in the current quarter will continue in the near term as we diligently work to improve margins. 
Our guidance range assumes North American and international market conditions similar to those experienced in the first half of fiscal 2017 and includes a $25 million pretax step-up in operating expense associated with the ERP system implementation. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Scott for some further comments."

As I mentioned, recently, Patterson is in the middle of an important period of change. Our portfolio moves, technology investments and shifts in how we address the needs of our customers are all part of an important evolution. But I'd like to emphasize that just as we have demonstrated our commitment to positioning Patterson in the future, we are equally committed to restoring Patterson to a more profitable growth in the near term and have multiple levers to pull to do so. 
Fortunately, we are able to do this from a position of operational and financial strength. Keys to our operational strength are our enterprise resource planning initiative and our sales and support infrastructure. We expect our ERP initiative to significantly improve our ability to help Patterson stay in front of our customers' needs and pace of change. I have visited various locations where the cutovers to our new system are taking place, and I am pleased with our progress and operational continuity. 
I commend all of our hard-working employees who have dedicated themselves to pursuing the smooth implementation of this system. We have built a very robust sales, service and technical support structure that customers truly value as they increase their dependence on technology to run their operations. 
Our financial strengths gives us the ability to support each aspect of our capital allocation strategy, and this will continue. While we face some short-term market challenges and navigate the change we have strategically elected, I am confident in the actions we are taking to position Patterson for the future and optimistic for the prospects of our customers, employees and shareholders. 
Now we'd like to take any questions you may have, so I'll turn the call back over to Catherine."

And then I'll turn it over to Ann to maybe talk some of the economics. But I think it's critical that as I talk about our decision, we also talk about the history and partnership because we do have people who are newer to the story, and I think it gives very important context. If you go back to the 1990s, it really was a vision towards the future that the Patterson management team had as they approached Siemens Dental with the offer that we would sell and service the CEREC 2 exclusively. At the time, Siemens had a game-changing idea with single-visit chairside dentistry but really had very limited commercial success to sell the product. We like to say that agreement was the beginning of what we call a 20-year overnight success story, as we partnered with the eventual spin-out of Siemens Dental, which we -- became Sirona, to really do true pioneer work to change dentistry. And I would say we could not be more proud, and I speak for all of the employees of Patterson, about the work we've done together. Now more -- or more excited about what we are going to accomplish together in the future. I think it's important that everyone knows our executive teams, both at Patterson and Sirona for years, have been very consistent in our approach that there would be a day where Patterson will need to expand the portfolio of products we sell to meet the needs of our customers, and also Sirona will want to access more of the market through potential expanded distribution. This is the critical point. I think we both, as partners, feel now is the perfect time at the end of our contract to move our relationship to the next level. And really, this is predicated on our mutual confidence, and I would say, strong confidence in our ability to compete in the marketplace. As a reminder, we've seen this scenario. We've -- it's playing out right now in our chair business. And our great partner, A-dec, we remain their largest partner. We have the ability to sell more product, which has helped us access more customers. So the other piece is really unlocking growth for both companies and the commitment of both companies of helping the profession accelerate the adoption of digital dentistry. So a key part of this strategic decision is we both feel an increased interest in activity that will come from expanded distribution will lead to a potential acceleration of sales. Bottom line is more people are going to be talking about digital dentistry. More people will be talking about CEREC. And we think we can sell 7 out of 10 instead of 5 out of 5. And over time, net-net, this will be a real positive for Patterson and Sirona."

And as a result, we're taking down guidance for the back half of the year to more closely align with our current quarter performance.

And really, the feedback I've gotten, and we've done some focus groups as well with some of our top salespeople, is the ability to, at every point, put the customer first in the decision-making process is incredibly powerful. And I think the exclusivity, particularly on CEREC, served Patterson and Sirona so well historically because you need focus and commitment to make a market, and we made a market together. But we feel now there's momentum and actually a real chance for acceleration in the space that's going to let both Patterson and Sirona win. So we learned this through the A-dec decision, which has been very powerful. And I talked to our salespeople all over the country, and I can't tell you how many times our best salespeople say, ""Let me compete. Just give me all the products and we'll do what's best for the customer."" And then it also puts, I think, a really excited, competitive spirit back on the manufacturer, that best product wins and most effective, most efficient product wins. So in my previous answer, I talked about the confidence that Sirona and Patterson share, and I have been in this relationship for 20 years. We make this decision together as partners because of our confidence to compete and our confidence that this is right for customers."

As Scott said, Heartland is all about the customer. It was great. I think it's going to be a win-win partnership.

We have deep expertise. So just making sure that we're doing the right thing for our people in terms of as we transition to a competitive environment. And then it's really the intellectual property around the processes that we've built around training and after-sales support. We have quite the asset at the Patterson Technology Center in terms of providing first-class support, and we just want to make sure that we're doing the right things. And so there'll be some additional investment there just to make sure that we protect that IP. As it relates to the sales disruption. I think when we put the guidance together, we wanted to make sure that we were conservative. And as we've gone through other transitions in the past historically, whether that's the A-dec change or the change when we changed how we sold other technology products back with the Eaglesoft software days, sometimes, when you're going through a transition, there is some near-term disruption in the field. So from a conservative standpoint, we did mute the top line in our outlook just to account for that. But with that said, we fully intend to execute on the contract for the balance of our exclusivity and leave no rock unturned in terms of sales leads. But I'll turn it over to Scott to add to that."

And I would say, I have great confidence in our managers, in our salespeople, to absolutely, as you said, use this as a rallying cry. We have incredibly deep relationships with Sirona. Sirona is family to Patterson, and Patterson is family to Sirona. And it is our intent that we use this as an opportunity to finish off the chapter of the 20-year exclusive but also use this as a launching pad for what we think is going to be a very exciting time of competition. And when I had our people in Minneapolis last week, what got me the most energized is the confidence of our managers and how excited they are to compete and leverage what we've put blood, sweat and tears into over the last 20 years. So I think you're right on in terms of the conservatism in the guidance, but it is our absolute intent that we exceed those conservative targets."

So if we think about what's changed in the marketplace and how those recent events are impacting our second quarter results and then the implications to 2017. You touched on 2 factors with unexpected changes in the marketplace that negatively impacts the balance of the year. So there's the softness in the U.S. dental market and then challenges with branded pharmaceutical pricing in our Animal Health business. And then in addition to those factors is the strategic decisions we made in the first half of the year, most recently the move towards nonexclusive manufacturer relationships within our technology portfolio. So when I think about breaking that down, what I can tell you is about half of the reduction in guidance is due to Animal Health and the other half is due to Dental. And when I think about Dental, Jeff, I would say probably 1/2 to 2/3 is really more on the consumable market softening and some disruption from the sales force restructuring. And then the other 1/3 is probably around the Sirona piece. That's rough buckets."

I would say on the general market commentary that the soft was -- softness we experienced and the entire industry experienced in the summer continued through the fall. And as we looked at the back half of the year, we decided to take a conservative approach, saying that there wouldn't be any market improvement. I would say the market is stable. And if I had to look at a growth rate, I would say it's probably 0 to 100 basis points. So a lethargic market. So while we're disappointed that it didn't swing back post-summer, I think we have really strong potential fundamentals for the market that give us optimism going forward. You've heard this before. It's stable to improving consumer confidence. It's low unemployment levels. It's continued trend of customers investing in technology. And then it's the demand driven for favorable North American demographics. So on the sales force side, and I think this is an important part of the strategy because we absolutely are committed to it and feel like we made the right move to move the business towards where the market is going, the sales erosion is contained to a certain number of customers. But when you look at the upside opportunity of almost 19,000 new customers that we've assigned some of our best salespeople to, we look at the long-term growth opportunity as being substantial and material. What we did not anticipate in the front end, and maybe I'll turn it over to Ann to talk about just what consumable softening does to our operating model."

And if we look across the industry, by my estimate, we're off by about 200 basis points from the trailing 12 months. And it's really that factor that's causing the reduction in guidance. When you go back to my script, what we were trying to say there when we were talking about the rep restructuring accounting for most of the decline is that if you added the rep restructuring back and didn't factor that in, we'd be growing with the market."

When I think about what we can do in the shorter term, while we're lowering guidance, we are promptly taking steps to address the headwinds that we've identified. There are many levers we can pull to offset some of the profit pressure. For example, we've identified additional and we have ongoing cost management initiatives underway to bring savings to the company. But of course, it's a balance, right? Because we also have the incremental step up in expense from our IT investment, and of course, we're just ramping up that implementation. So it's definitely a balance.
