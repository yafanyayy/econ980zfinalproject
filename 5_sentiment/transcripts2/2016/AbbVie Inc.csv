This morning, I'll briefly discuss our fourth quarter performance and our 2015 operational highlights. Mike will then provide updates on recent advancements across our R&D programs, and Bill will discuss the quarter and our 2016 guidance in more detail. As always, following our remarks, we'll take your questions. 
We delivered another strong performance in the fourth quarter with results ahead of our expectations, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.13, representing growth of 27% versus the fourth quarter of 2014. Our fourth quarter performance caps off a very strong year for AbbVie with sales and earnings well above our original projections for the year. We delivered 22% global operational sales growth in 2015, and we increased ongoing earnings per share by more than 29%. 
We've driven strong commercial, operational and R&D execution resulting in industry-leading performance, with both strong revenue growth and improvement in our operating margin profile. AbbVie's EPS growth for 2015 ranks us among the top growth companies in our industry. Clearly, 2015 was a year of excellent performance. We delivered outstanding results from our current portfolio with strong growth from HUMIRA, which grew 19% global operational growth in 2015, including U.S. growth of nearly 29% and international operational growth of 8.6%. We saw a continued strong momentum from IMBRUVICA with full year 2015 sales in excess of $1 billion. 
Global VIEKIRA performance, although below our original expectations, generated more than $1.6 billion in its first year on the market. And we had strong performance from other products in our portfolio, including Creon, Lupron and Duodopa. 
Over the past year, we have seen significant pipeline advancement and achieved a number of important development and regulatory milestones. We secured approvals for several assets, including HUMIRA as a treatment for HS, our once-daily HCV combination in Japan; and our partner received approval for elotuzumab for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We successfully completed registrational studies and submitted regulatory applications for a number of programs, including venetoclax for relapsed/refractory CLL, IMBRUVICA for first-line CLL, Zinbryta for multiple sclerosis and HUMIRA for uveitis. We successfully completed mid-stage clinical trials and transitioned into the registration-enabling phase of development for several key program, including our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494 in RA, our PAN-genotyping next-generation HCV combination, elagolix for and and ABT-414, our antibody drug conjugate for glioblastoma multiforme. We also reported compelling detail from several development programs, including elagolix pivotal data in endometriosis; the HELIOS and RESONATE-2 IMBRUVICA data, which we anticipate will be reflected in the product label this year; and venetoclax data in several cancer types, including robust results in CLL and AML. In fact, the data we presented on venetoclax this year has resulted in 3 breakthrough therapy designations, a status granted by the FDA when clinical evidence indicates that a medicine may demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing therapies. We believe venetoclax has significant potential across a wide range of blood cancers with the first of potentially numerous indications coming in the first half of this year. The progress we've made with our pipeline, including the impressive data we've shared over the past year has further increased our level of confidence and derisked many of our key R&D programs. Numerous assets in our late-stage pipeline have the opportunity to generate multibillion-dollar peak year sales and represent an opportunity for meaningful revenue growth in the years to come. 
2016 promises to be another milestone-filled year with significant activity across our pipeline, which Michael will discuss in more detail in just a few moments. 
In 2015, we also augmented our portfolio and our pipeline through strategic licensing and acquisition activity. The acquisition of Pharmacyclics provided a major new growth platform in a key strategic area, hematological oncology. IMBRUVICA, which is now a blockbuster therapy, offers significant growth potential through its existing and expanding list of indications and lines of therapy. We remain excited about the potential for IMBRUVICA, and we are pleased that our thesis is playing out as we expected. Within the hematological oncology segment, we have invested strategically to build a portfolio of medicines with the potential to transform the care of a large range of malignancies. Our portfolio includes 3 novel mechanisms of action: BTK inhibition, BCL-2 inhibition, PI3-kinase dual inhibition. These mechanisms are either on market, under regulatory review or in registration-enabling trials. We're well-positioned to build upon our leadership in this category with unique combinations of these and other agents. Over the past year, we delivered a strong return of capital to our investors, including a rapidly growing dividend, which has grown 42% since our inception as well as share repurchase. We remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, returning cash to shareholders while continuing to add strategically to our pipeline. 
Following our acquisition of Pharmacyclics last year, our focus in the near term is on continuing to augment our therapeutic areas of focus, especially oncology and immunology. We evaluate opportunities that fit our strategic criteria and can deliver strong returns. 
In 2015, we also drove improved efficiency across our operations, delivering significant operating margin expansion while continuing to invest in R&D and SG&A to drive future growth. We have delivered a significant level of margin expansion to date, and we remain committed to doing more to improve our operating margin profile going forward. Our focus in operating efficiencies will drive our adjusted operating margin profile to greater than 50% by 2020. 
We've entered 2016 with strong momentum, which we intend to build upon the drive a high level of performance across our operations and strong growth. Our full year 2016 EPS guidance of $4.90 to $5.10, represents growth of 16.5% at the midpoint, positioning AbbVie to be among the industry leaders for EPS growth once again this year. 
On our third quarter conference call, we outlined our long-term guidance for a number of key metrics, including our expectations for top and bottom line growth and margin expansion over our 5-year plan. We remain committed to delivering on these long-term objectives, which will generate double-digit EPS growth on average through 2020. So in summary, we're pleased with our strong execution and the significant advancements we made in 2015. Over the past year, we've demonstrated a strong track record of success with positive clinical data and regulatory outcomes, and we look forward to numerous important pipeline milestones in the year ahead. We've consistently delivered on our commitments and are positioned for another year of strong growth. We built a strong foundation, and we're focused on generating top-tier financial performance in the years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D program. Mike?"

In 2015, we significantly advanced and derisked our pipeline and achieved a number of important regulatory milestones, and we expect 2016 to be a very productive year as well, with the potential for several regulatory submissions and approvals, key data readouts and phase transitions. We have a broad pipeline that includes more than 50 active clinical development programs, including more than 20 new products or indications in late stage development around the regulatory review. 
Today, I'll highlight recent updates and discuss some of the milestones we anticipate in the year to come. I'll start with hematologic oncology, an area where we have invested heavily and are uniquely positioned. As Rick mentioned, we have built a strategic portfolio of assets, including multiple mechanisms of action that have significant potential alone and in combination. The development program for our flagship oncology product, IMBRUVICA, continues to progress nicely. Our next opportunity for label expansion is in the first-line CLL setting. Data from the RESONATE-2 trial in treatment-naïve CLL patients recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed treatment with IMBRUVICA resulted in an 84% reduction in the risk of disease progression versus chlorambucil, with 87% of patients remaining on single-agent IMBRUVICA treatment at 18 months. Additionally, treatment with IMBRUVICA showed an 84% reduction in overall mortality. We believe RESONATE-2 represents a practice-changing study that will set a new treatment standard for many treatment-naïve patients. We submitted a supplemental new drug application to the FDA, which is currently under priority review, and we anticipate approval in the first half of 2016. IMBRUVICA is also being evaluated in mid- to late-stage trials in follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, graft-versus-host disease and pancreatic cancer. At the recent ASH meeting, 65 IMBRUVICA-related abstracts were presented, including data from several studies and potential new indications. And there is potential for dataflow and possible regulatory submissions for this year for several indications, including treatment-naïve lymphoma, relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and treatment-naïve diffuse large B cell lymphoma with timing dependent on event-driven analysis of ongoing studies. 
In the area of immuno-oncology, ongoing trials evaluating IMBRUVICA in combination with checkpoint inhibitors are progressing well with the potential to see proof-of-concept data in solid tumors over the course of the year. 
Another important strategic asset in our oncology portfolio is venetoclax, our novel BCL-2 inhibitor, which has demonstrated strong efficacy, achieving deep levels of response and durable disease control both as monotherapy and in combination with Rituxan in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Venetoclax is currently under priority review for relapsed/refractory CLL, including patients whose tumors harbor the 17p deletion mutation, and we expect FDA action in the first half of 2016. 
At ASH, we presented data and the relapsed/refractory CLL patients in combination with Rituxan showing an overall response rate of 86% and a complete response rate of 47%. Additionally, minimal residual disease negativity in the bone marrow was observed in 55% of all patients treated with the combination. We're very encouraged by the depth of the responses driven by combination therapy in this patient population. Based on this data, earlier this month, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for venetoclax when used in combination with Rituxan. 
We also believe BCL-2 will be effective in other hematologic malignancies. We recently presented encouraging venetoclax data in treatment-naïve AML patients over 65 years of age who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. The early data showed combination treatment with venetoclax and hypomethalating agents resulted in complete response rates of approximately 71%, which is roughly double the response rate that would expected with the current standard of care. And based on these promising results, earlier this week, the FDA granted the third venetoclax breakthrough therapy designation. We are moving expeditiously into registrational trials for this indication. 
In addition to IMBRUVICA and venetoclax, we are developing a dual PI3-kinase inhibitor, currently in late stage development. In collaboration with our partner, Infinity, we'll see data on in duvelisib relapsed/refractory NHL and CLL in the second half of the year with potential regulatory submissions to follow. We are well-positioned to continue to evolve the treatment landscape in CLL and other blood cancers by exploring novel combinations including the programs and our pipeline and other mechanisms, with the goal to achieve deep durable disease control and/or remission while reducing or eliminating the use of toxic chemotherapy. To that end, we have numerous combination trials underway or starting in 2016. This includes our Phase III study of a chemotherapy-free combination in venetoclax and in first-line unfit CLL patients. This study is underway and enrolling well. A large Phase III study is being initiated in collaboration with the German CLL working group to evaluate treatment with venetoclax in combination with a variety of therapies, including GAZYVA and IMBRUVICA in previously untreated fit CLL patients. This study, which we expect to initiate mid-year will assess the ability of venetoclax-based combinations to drive achievement of minimal residual disease, which has been associated with improved survival in CLL patients. TO augment ongoing investigator-sponsored and collaborative groups studies evaluating venetoclax and IMBRUVICA combinations, we are designing company-sponsored studies to evaluate the combination in first-line CLL patients. In addition, AbbVie and venetoclax are finalizing plans to pursue registrational studies evaluating combinations of venetoclax with inhibitors and multiple myeloma, and as I mentioned previously, in combination in agents and AML. Finally, we are preparing to initiate a dose-finding study evaluating venetoclax and duvelisib patients with a variety of hematologic malignancies. 
In addition to our work in hematologic oncology, we have also been investing a number of programs for the treatment of solid tumors, including our PARP inhibitor, with 5 Phase III studies underway in lung, breast and ovarian cancer and ABT-414, which is in development for glioblastoma multiforme or GBM. GBM is the most and most aggressive type of malignant primary brain tumor. Previously reported interim results from a Phase I clinical trial of ABT-414 showed that roughly 25% of patients with EGFR amplification or the B3 variant treated with ABT-414 in addition to standard of care achieved an objective response. These results illustrate a level of efficacy not typically seen in this difficult-to-treat cancer where historic the top of response rates in our refractory population have been less than 10%. Later this year, we'll see additional data for ABT-414 in second-line GBM. If the data are consistent with earlier studies, these trials could represent a path to a regulatory submission in the second half of 2016. In parallel, larger randomized comparative registrational trials are ongoing in first- and second-line GBM. But also have an active program focused on driving the next wave of immuno-oncology development beyond checkpoint inhibitors. We recently entered into a collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center focused on the discovery and development of new immuno-oncology therapies. Through this agreement, we're Anderson's cutting edge preclinical translational and clinical capabilities with our strength in biology, protein engineering and chemistry with the goal to accelerate the development of new medicines. We anticipate a number of immuno-oncology assets moving into the clinic this year and look forward to sharing more details in our strategy in this area at our R&D day in June. 
Moving on to immunology, our strategy is centered upon identifying treatments that offer differentiated profiles relative to currently available therapies with the goal of continuing to raise the standard of care. We have multiple mid- and late stage pipeline assets with best-in-class potential. In late 2015, we initiated a Phase III program in rheumatoid arthritis for our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494, following positive results from our mid-stage clinical trials. We are particularly excited about the results of ABT-494 in a difficult-to-treat population and TNF-inadequate responders, a growing segment of the RA market. Results from the BALANCE-I trial in this patient population recently presented at ACR illustrate the agent's potential to be a best-in-class therapies with ACR20 responses up to 73% and ACR50 responses up to 44%. Additional data from our Phase II program will be presented over the course of 2016, and we expect to commercialize ABT-494 in 2019. We also have additional immunology candidates in development, and we'll see mid-stage data from multiple programs in 2016. 
Finally, in immunology, we continue to innovate with HUMIRA. Last year, we received EU and U.S. approval for a new formulation of HUMIRA. Additionally, we have submitted regulatory applications for an improved HUMIRA pen device. And our U.S. and European regulatory applications for uveitis are currently under review with decisions expected in the second half of this year. 
Moving now to virology where our goal is to develop a next-generation asset that offers high cure rates in ribavirin and regimen. Mid-stage data indicates that our new PAN-genotypic combination can deliver cure rates approaching 100%, and we believe the majority of patients will be well served with an 8-week treatment option. Late last year, we initiated a comprehensive registrational program, including 6 global Phase III studies. We'll start to see data from our registrational trials later this year, and this combination is poised for commercial entry next year. 
In neurology, we're focused on therapies for the treatment of conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, MS and other new regenerative conditions. Zinbryta is our first-in-class investigational biologic for relapse/remitting multiple sclerosis, which is correct under regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe with regulatory decisions expected in the first half of 2016. The filings are based upon strong pivotal trial results, which demonstrates the patients treated with Zinbryta had a statistically significant 45% reduction in the annualized relapse rate versus Avonex, an established standard of care. Given the product profile, novel mechanism of action and its once-monthly subcutaneous administration, we believe Zinbryta has the potential to be an important therapeutic option. Last year, we entered into a collaboration with Diagnostics to develop and commercialize the portfolio of antibodies for the treatment of serious neurodegenerative disorders. Last year, we initiated a Phase I program in patients with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, and we remain on track to start clinical development with in Alzheimer's disease in 2016. 
Finally, elagolix is our compound in Phase III development for endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Our goal with elagolix in endometriosis is to bring to market an oral therapy that provides a high level of efficacy with minimal menopausal side effects such as hot flash while preserving bone health. We've reported positive results from our first pivotal trials in endometriosis last year and plan to report top line results from the second pivotal study in the first quarter of 2016. We also plan to present more detailed findings from both registrational trials at the ASRN meeting in October. We also recently initiated a Phase III program investigating the effect of elagolix on bleeding related to uterine fibroids. 
So in summary, we continue to make significant progress with our pipeline and are on track to advance several programs in 2016. We built a promising late stage pipeline comprised of potentially transformational medicines, which will fuel our future growth. We look forward to covering our full pipeline in more detail and an R&D pipeline review to be held in Chicago during the 2016 ASCO Meeting in June. We hope you will join us. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on the quarter and our 2016 guidance. Bill?"

This morning, I'll share with you the highlights of our full year 2015 performance, provide an overview of our fourth quarter results and then walk through our outlook for 2016. We had a strong performance in 2015, allowing us to raise our full year EPS guidance range twice during the year and ultimately deliver sales, margin expansion and earnings projections that exceeded our original expectations. For the full year 2015, adjusted net revenues were $22.8 billion, up 22% on an operational basis. We expanded our adjusted operating margin profile to 42.3% in 2015, up 610 basis points for the year. And as Rick mentioned, we reported adjusted earnings per share results of $4.29, up more than 29% for the year. 
Turning to the fourth quarter. Total adjusted sales were $6.4 billion, up more than 24% on an operational basis. Unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange rate fluctuations reduced sales growth in the quarter by 6%. HUMIRA delivered global sales of $3.8 billion in the quarter, up 16% operationally, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales were more than $2.3 billion, increasing nearly 21%, reflecting exceptional growth across all 3 major categories: rheumatology, gastro and dermatology. Internationally, HUMIRA sales were nearly $1.4 billion in the quarter, up a strong 9.7% on an operational basis, excluding the unfavorable impact from exchange. Global HUMIRA sales for the full year 2015 were $14 billion, up 19.1% operationally versus the prior year. International HUMIRA sales in 2015 increased 8.6% on an operational basis. 
Global IMBRUVICA net revenues were $343 million in the quarter. U.S. sales were $295 million, and our international profit sharing was $48 million. Since the closing of the Pharmacyclics acquisition on May 26, IMBRUVICA has driven $754 million of new revenue for AbbVie, and we are pleased with its progress. A significant portion of our evaluation for Pharmacyclics is attributed to advancing into first-line therapy in treatment-naïve CLL patients and the submission of the strong RESONATE-2 data to the FDA this quarter bodes well for this assumption. 
Global VIEKIRA sales in the fourth quarter were $554 million. The international launch has exceeded our planning expectations resulting in a higher mix of international sales again this quarter. As expected, VIEKIRA, our 2-drug once-daily ribavirin-free combination for the treatment of type B in Japan launched late in the fourth quarter. 
Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 24.4% on an operational basis in the quarter. We saw a continued double-digit growth internationally for Duodopa, with a modest level of U.S. sales as expected. Global Duodopa sales for the full year 2015 were $231 million, up 23.5% operationally versus the prior year. 
Global Creon sales were $185 million, up 22.8%. Full year sales of Creon were $632 million, up 22.5% versus 2014. Creon maintains its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market with roughly 70% share. 
Global Lupron sales were $235 million in the fourth quarter, up 15.6% on an operational basis. For the full year, global Lupron sales were $826 million, up 9.3%, exceeding our expectations. Lupron continues to hold the leadership position and maintain significant share of the market. 
Turning to the P&L profile for the fourth quarter. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 80.5%, excluding amortization and other specified items. Excluding the impact of Pharmacyclics, we saw a nearly 100 basis improvement year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, adjusted R&D was 15.9% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 23.9% of sales, contributing to the improvement in our operating margin profile. Operating margin in the quarter was 40.1% of sales compared to 35.8% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusting for the negative impact of foreign exchange and the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, operating margin increased by 540 basis points. As a reminder, the fourth quarter margin profile is generally the lowest of any quarter during the year. This reflects favorable product mix impacts from higher sales of products like Synagis, a lower-margin partnered product. 
Net interest expense was $199 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 21.6% in the quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.13, excluding noncash amortization expense and specified items. On a GAAP basis, we posted EPS of $0.92. As we look ahead to 2016, we are confirming our previously issued full year adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.90 to $5.10. This guidance excludes $0.42 per share of noncash amortization and noncash Pharmacyclics acquisition impact as well as $0.03 per share of other specified. On the top line, we expect mid-teens revenue growth on an operational basis, excluding roughly 2% negative impact from exchange. Included in our top line guidance, our assumptions for our key products as follows. HUMIRA has averaged well over $1 billion of annual growth for a number of years. In 2016, we expect HUMIRA to once again be an important contributor to our performance with high teens growth expected in the U.S. Internationally, we are forecasting mid-single digit operational growth, reflecting the latest market dynamics, including the launch of large biosimilar for Enbrel. For IMBRUVICA, we expect revenues to AbbVie of at least $1.8 billion. We anticipate global VIEKIRA sales of approximately $2 billion for the year. This level of sales includes significant international growth with a full year of sales in Japan. We expect continued double-digit growth for Duodopa, including an increased U.S. sales contribution. As mentioned in previous calls, we anticipate a gradual ramp for product sales in the U.S. as physicians continue to get more familiar with the product. For Synagis, we expect mid-single-digit operational growth in 2016. Regarding we're forecasting 2016 sales of roughly $500 million. For Creon, we expect high single digits sales growth. For Lupron and Synthroid, we expect sales to be roughly flat year-over-year, and we expect declines in several products with continued lipid franchise erosion as well as negative market trends in HIV and other mature products. 
Turning back to the P&L for 2016, we are forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 82%. We are forecasting R&D expense above 15% of sales, and we expect to see sales leverage with SG&A levels at approximately 23% of sales, well below the 24.6% booked in 2015. As a result, in 2016, we are forecasting an increase in our operating margin profile of 100 basis points, reflecting ongoing initiatives and sales leverage. Excluding year-over-year impact of foreign exchange and Pharmacyclics, this operating margin improvement would exceed 300 basis points. We are forecasting net interest expense of about $800 million for the full year, and we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 21% to 22% in 2016. Regarding our first quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the quarter of $1.13 to $1.15. This guidance reflects growth of approximately 21% at the midpoint. Our first quarter adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.11 of noncash amortization and specified items. We are forecasting revenue growth in the first quarter just above 20%, excluding roughly 4% negative exchange. While our full year outlook for international HUMIRA growth is mid-single-digits, in the first quarter, we anticipate an operational international growth rate of 3%. This is a direct result of a difficult comparisons to the prior year quarter where we posted a 15% increase for the brand due to shipment timing. So as we look back, we're very pleased with AbbVie's performance in our first 3 years as an independent company. In 2015, we delivered sales, margin expansion and earnings well above our original outlook. And we expect to build on that momentum in 2016 with industry-leading growth and an exciting pipeline. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry."

I'll cover those 2. Let me do the HUMIRA first. So as we mentioned in our previous call, we are anticipating that we will see indirect biosimilar competition outside the U.S., meaning Enbrel biosimilars outside the U.S. of this year. So if you think about our growth rate, we finished this year internationally at about 8.6%, and we're guiding for next year at about mid-single-digits. And you can break it up at a sort of 2 components. One would be obviously the brand gets a little bit better, the growth rate as a percentage is slowing down a bit. And then we have built in what our set of assumptions of what kind of price impact we might see from Enbrel in certain markets, particularly in Europe I would say, and that represents about 2% of our growth. So it will be coming down about 2% based on that. So that's the HUMIRA piece. On the Amgen IPR and the other IPR is, I think, in general, across all of the litigation aspects of HUMIRA, I think it's important to recognize that we have now entered a new phase of our biosimilar strategy. And in our third quarter call, we laid out a detailed explanation of our patent estate in an effort to really provide the investment community with the conference is set of information around the IP and what we got the litigation time lines would look like going forward. But I can tell you that nothing has changed from that assessment. We still believe in everything that we've described to you as part of that. But now we're in the active litigation process with other players, whether that be IPR litigation or other that the typical start to play out. And it's just not for us to lay out for the world a play-by-play analysis of our positions around it. That's just not the -- that's not the smart thing to do from a litigation standpoint. So what I tell you if is the point that we made before. We have a large robust portfolio of IP. We have done significant work from an innovation standpoint in this area, and we have prosecuted all of this IP based on the work that we've done and the investment that we've made, and we feel good about the IP in our portfolio. And as we said before, we intend to vigorously defend our IP. This is going to be to play out over time. We're totally pleased with the decision of the patent office. But we're not going to basically do a play-by-play on this because that potentially could jeopardize our position."

If you look at the market, TRX growth right now in the quarter is about 13%. From an inventory standpoint, sequentially, quarter versus quarter, it stayed roughly flat. It's a little less than half a month. But one thing that is impacting this number is we had slightly higher inventory numbers in the channel in Q4 '14. And if you adjust that out, that pretty much gets you back to where guidance had us. We haven't seen anything in this brand that would lead us to pause and restate our expectations. And as I said in the call in my comments, we're expecting high teens growth. So it's going very well. But from a price perspective, it's normal for these sorts of products to take price increase toward the end of the year or the beginning of the year. We certainly have done that at the beginning of the year. So there is going to be a price dynamic is HUMIRA in 2016. And what I want to see how things pan out as the year progresses above and beyond that."

I think all of us in this industry recognized all of the headlines we see around price. And I think an important perspective to step back and think about our business, this is not a business that is highly dependent upon price, our business I'm talking about. So if you look at our operational growth in 2015 at 22%, only 2% of that was price across the business. And if you look at HUMIRA, roughly around 25% of the overall growth is driven by price. Now you do have certain managed care contracts that have some level of price protection, so all the price doesn't fall through at 100%. And depending upon where the price increases are and the magnitude of those price increases, less of that will fall through in a later price increase as an example. So -- but overall, the vast majority of our growth whether it be HUMIRA or other assets in our pipeline is driven by volume growth. And I think that's an important perspective for the investor community to understand. As far as HCV is concerned, as we planned out for 2016, I'd say the Merck label came in pretty much spot on where we had expected. So I think it's within our expectations. We had a built into our assumptions for HCV a level of competition and some level of price competition. We're going to have to see how that plays out. It's not the -- we don't believe we have any exposure there at all, so we're not concerned about that. But we have built in what we believe is an appropriate level of both pricing and volume competition that we could see in the marketplace in 2016. Japan, to your point, we launched very late in the fourth quarter. And so far, I had an update just a week or so ago from the team. Japan is growing well. It's tracking our expectations."

I think if we look at JAK inhibitors, there have been a fair amount of enthusiasm several years ago that actual results didn't the expectations for the first generation of those molecules such as But the current generation, I think, have very nice profiles and what I think it has generated a very nice profile base of the data that we see today. We'll see more as we see more than the regulatory review. And I think, the class is going to get used over time. What we see with this class is it tends to start slow and build over time and work from more resistant patients up to earlier lines of therapy and we see that with therapies and in immunology in general. So when I compare that to, I feel very encouraged by the results that we've seen with ABT-494. We have seen very strong efficacy not just as a ACR20 level but at much higher levels of response to ACR50, ACR70, remission, et cetera. And we see that across 2 large Phase IIb studies including the TNF inadequate responder study. And those are the results that I mentioned in our opening comments. And there, we see a level of response and TNF-inadequate responders that we believe has the potential to be best-in-class. And so if you link that up with what I said about how already dynamics play out, can be very important. And we believe that, that is a big opportunity for this molecule. We do believe over time that 494 will certainly have use in earlier lines of therapy. But when you look at the balanced profile of 494, we feel very good about it. So moving on to ABT-122 and Ablynx, those are in mid-stage trials, and we'll see data from ABT-122 midyear and from Ablynx towards the back end of the year. And once we have those data, then that will be the time to make decisions about next steps, and we'll be sharing those data as soon as it's reasonable to do so after we get them."

So what we're going to want to see is something that is over and above the level of efficacy that can be achieved with comparable agents, if you will. So ABT-122 combine 17 and TNF, so you're going to want to see something in the disease populations we've studied in RA and psoriatic arthritis. It's better than one can get with those mechanisms alone. And Ablynx is another approach at IL-6, and we want to see something that's better than the existing therapies that are out there. Now obviously, these aren't comparative studies, but we'll have the data we believe to make those assessments and determine whether we will advance those programs this year as I said. So with the there certainly a lot of talk around given its early stage of development. But I would say, first and foremost, is we've set a very high bar with IMBRUVICA. We've set a very high bar with efficacy and also with safety. I quoted some of the numbers from RESONATE-2. We don't believe we've left any room on the table for the story of improve efficacy. And we feel very good about the safety profile of IMBRUVICA. With we're looking at much earlier data. We're looking at Phase Ib/IIa studies. I think the study that's garnered the most attention is about a 61-patient dose-rising study with an expansion. And it's really just not possible to compare those trials for molecules make IMBRUVICA, which has multiples had that's been on the market now for considerable period of time. So we'll see as the program continues to progress, what they are able to demonstrate. We have comparative studies read out sort of in a couple of years time, and I think that's really the first time we'll be able to make any sort of comparative assessment. Those are open label studies, and that's the limitation of them. And also, certain comparative studies are in relapsed/refractory patients, and IMBRUVICA is moving to the front line over time, and that momentum is going to keep up. So we feel very confident in our position with IMBRUVICA."

When we did the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, we did it with the knowledge of so we thoroughly reviewed based on information that we have at that time, the compound, and evaluated whether or not we thought it was a risk. And I think one of the things to keep in mind is a follower strategy in oncology, at least historically, has not worked very well. And the reason it doesn't work very well is if the innovator keeps advancing the bar, the regulatory environment changes on the follower and what they need to do to be able to get their approvals, and it's more difficult, it takes more time, it's more expensive because they can't do single-arm studies to get approval. The second thing I'd say is there seems to be 2 theses out there. One would be improved efficacy. One would be improved safety profile, particularly around bleeding in AP. I wouldn't say that those are issues that are inhibiting our ability to be able to advance the brand and standard of care today. But what I also say is that we have evaluated it. We believe that the vast majority of the data would support that those are on-mechanism side effects. And so we'll have to see what their data proves out, and we'll have to see what the inclusion and exclusion criteria is on the trials that they want to make sure it's a balanced view to be able to demonstrate what the bleeding rate would be. And remember, we didn't in IMBRUVICA until we get to something like 1,500 patients or so. And I think we saw bleeding at about 500, 600, something like that, right? So we have to see a lot more data to see a real signal, and it has to be a population that's consistent with the population that's being treated, and we'll see what that data looks like. But I think the evidence today would suggest that those are on mechanism, and so we'll have to see how it plays out, but I will tell you is that we're confident in our position with IMBRUVICA."

As far as others that would infringe, I mean, we're certainly not in a position to be able to answer that question because we don't know what their formulations are. I guess, the best place to get that answer would be to ask them. But as I said, we're not going to talk a lot about how we're positioning things and how we plan on running the IPR process going forward. The most important thing here is that we prevail, and I realize that it probably doesn't give you great comfort. What you have to recognize our responsibility is to make sure we put the best position forward, and we don't get off our opponent and responses as to what our strategy is. And so I apologize for that part of it, but that's the trade-off we have to make here. And you're going to see more of this play out over time, and I think you'll get a feel for it, and you can get other people to evaluate what you think that will look like from an IP standpoint, although I'd say much like this particular patent, some people opine, didn't think it was very strong and you saw how the patent office made the decision, right? So I think that's about all we can talk about as it relates to the litigation. The second would be on duration of therapy on IMBRUVICA. If you look at the duration of therapy today, I think it's tracking on what we expected as part of the original deal model that we put together. To give you some flavor for that, I'd say it's about 75% of the critical trial duration. It has been increasing over time. There are a number of elements that basically we have analyzed and have programs in place. Some of those are payroll related and some other kinds of things that we have to continue to work through. I think one of the things that will be extremely helpful is the RESONATE-2 data here because now, you have absolute data that supports that if you keep these patients on therapy for a longer period of time, then you get very good outcomes. And so I think not only from the standpoint of allowing us to be able to move into front line but as another piece of strong credible evidence that maintaining therapy over a longer period of time gives patients the benefit that we're looking for. One of the things that we did see is in certain position populations from a duration standpoint, when blood counts improve, some physicians would take patients off of therapy and obviously, that's not something that we would want, right? And so I think RESONATE-2 is a strong supporting set of data that will help give physicians the knowledge and information they need to be convinced that they should keep them on therapy even after blood counts have improved. And on venetoclax, I don't know Mike, can you talk a little about that?"

So one was the VA volumes stayed very low through the fourth quarter because of the funding issue in the VA. And so that was one of the impact. But then the second one was what we saw from collateral impact on the label. And I'd say we lost about 1 share point. So there was some bleed-over impact to other segments because the Child-Pugh B is worth 1 share point.

If you think about what we described for you on the 2020 HUMIRA guidance ex U.S., we basically said that you will see direct biosimilar competition in the fourth quarter of 2018. We have some impact from indirect biosimilars startin",576,"So Alex, this is Rick. If you think about what we described for you on the 2020 HUMIRA guidance ex U.S., we basically said that you will see direct biosimilar competition in the fourth quarter of 2018. We have some impact from indirect biosimilars starting in 2016. I described earlier on the call what that impact assumption is for 2016. We'll obviously have a flow-through impact to '17 at that expands and basically flow through. But then, if you think about the erosion curve that I described on the third quarter call. So what we said was internationally, the brand will peak at 2018, and then it will gently start to decline. And if you get to the end of 2020, it's down about 15% or so. That's a combination of volume and price. But I'd also tell you that because of the category is still growing, obviously, then the growth would have been there, and some of that growth plan to a biosimilar player. So it basically says that about 30% of the total opportunity would have gone over that period of time. And that's the point at which we see some level of stabilization going forward. So I think that's the way you would characterize it and although we don't have direct knowledge of how each channel has not consensus around their international and U.S. that's up assumptions, what I would say is the biggest difference between consensus and our forecast says that some people are still forecasting that HUMIRA sees biosimilar competition in the United States. The number is too big to be anything other than that, the change. So after our guidance, what we did see is we saw HUMIRA move up pretty significantly but not all the way out to our 2020 forecast. So there is still some individuals who are assuming that they see biosimilar competition probably now in that 19 time frame. It's pretty much flat out to. Sit the difference between that and ultimately our assumption that will get through all 2022, right? And I think that's the biggest thing to impact. As far as the Remicade panel, I think as we talked about internationally, and we've been watching this play out and international markets and studying it carefully, and as we've indicated to the marketplace many, many times before, we're not seeing a direct impact on HUMIRA. And obviously, if you look at our growth rates in 2015 and you look at our growth in the fourth quarter, I think it's indicative of the fact that we're not seeing any substantial impact as well. And so we wouldn't assume that there would be an impact in the United States either that really fits in a different category. I think the one thing that will be interested to look at in the panel is we have assumed in our planning assumptions that biosimilar players get extrapolation. We don't agree with that. We think it's important for any drug to be tested in any indication that it's going to be used in and generate some clinical data. But I'd say we plan from a conservative standpoint that we will see extrapolation in all the major markets around the world. I think as we go forward here, if somehow we got an indication that, that will not be the case in United States, that will be positive to want. So that's one of the things that we'll be looking at."

This morning, I'll briefly discuss our fourth quarter performance and our 2015 operational highlights. Mike will then provide updates on recent advancements across our R&D programs, and Bill will discuss the quarter and our 2016 guidance in more detail. As always, following our remarks, we'll take your questions.
We delivered another strong performance in the fourth quarter with results ahead of our expectations, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.13, representing growth of 27% versus the fourth quarter of 2014. Our fourth quarter performance caps off a very strong year for AbbVie with sales and earnings well above our original projections for the year. We delivered 22% global operational sales growth in 2015, and we increased ongoing earnings per share by more than 29%.
We've driven strong commercial, operational and R&D execution resulting in industry-leading performance, with both strong revenue growth and improvement in our operating margin profile. AbbVie's EPS growth for 2015 ranks us among the top growth companies in our industry. Clearly, 2015 was a year of excellent performance. We delivered outstanding results from our current portfolio with strong growth from HUMIRA, which grew 19% global operational growth in 2015, including U.S. growth of nearly 29% and international operational growth of 8.6%. We saw a continued strong momentum from IMBRUVICA with full year 2015 sales in excess of $1 billion.
Global VIEKIRA performance, although below our original expectations, generated more than $1.6 billion in its first year on the market. And we had strong performance from other products in our portfolio, including Creon, Lupron and Duodopa.
Over the past year, we have seen significant pipeline advancement and achieved a number of important development and regulatory milestones. We secured approvals for several assets, including HUMIRA as a treatment for HS, our once-daily HCV combination in Japan; and our partner received approval for elotuzumab for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We successfully completed registrational studies and submitted regulatory applications for a number of programs, including venetoclax for relapsed/refractory CLL, IMBRUVICA for first-line CLL, Zinbryta for multiple sclerosis and HUMIRA for uveitis.
We successfully completed mid-stage clinical trials and transitioned into the registration-enabling phase of development for several key program, including our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494 in RA, our PAN-genotyping next-generation HCV combination, elagolix for uterine fibroids and ABT-414, our antibody drug conjugate for glioblastoma multiforme. We also reported compelling detail from several development programs, including elagolix pivotal data in endometriosis; the HELIOS and RESONATE-2 IMBRUVICA data, which we anticipate will be reflected in the product label this year; and venetoclax data in several cancer types, including robust results in CLL and AML. In fact, the data we presented on venetoclax this year has resulted in 3 breakthrough therapy designations, a status granted by the FDA when clinical evidence indicates that a medicine may demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing therapies. We believe venetoclax has significant potential across a wide range of blood cancers with the first of potentially numerous indications coming in the first half of this year. The progress we've made with our pipeline, including the impressive data we've shared over the past year has further increased our level of confidence and derisked many of our key R&D programs. Numerous assets in our late-stage pipeline have the opportunity to generate multibillion-dollar peak year sales and represent an opportunity for meaningful revenue growth in the years to come. 
2016 promises to be another milestone-filled year with significant activity across our pipeline, which Michael will discuss in more detail here in just a few moments.
In 2015, we also augmented our portfolio and our pipeline through strategic licensing and acquisition activity. The acquisition of Pharmacyclics provided a major new growth platform in a key strategic area, hematological oncology. IMBRUVICA, which is now a blockbuster therapy, offers significant growth potential through its existing and expanding list of indications and lines of therapy. We remain excited about the potential for IMBRUVICA, and we are pleased that our thesis is playing out as we expected. Within the hematological oncology segment, we have invested strategically to build a portfolio of medicines with the potential to transform the care of a large range of malignancies. Our portfolio includes 3 novel mechanisms of action: BTK inhibition, BCL-2 inhibition, PI3-kinase dual inhibition. These mechanisms are either on market, under regulatory review or in registration-enabling trials. We're well-positioned to build upon our leadership in this category with unique combinations of these and other agents. Over the past year, we delivered a strong return of capital to our investors, including a rapidly growing dividend, which has grown 42% since our inception as well as share repurchase. We remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, returning cash to shareholders while continuing to add strategically to our pipeline.
Following our acquisition of Pharmacyclics last year, our focus in the near term is on continuing to augment our therapeutic areas of focus, especially oncology and immunology. We evaluate opportunities that fit our strategic criteria and can deliver strong returns.
In 2015, we also drove improved efficiency across our operations, delivering significant operating margin expansion while continuing to invest in R&D and SG&A to drive future growth. We have delivered a significant level of margin expansion to date, and we remain committed to doing more to improve our operating margin profile going forward. Our focus on operating efficiencies will drive our adjusted operating margin profile to greater than 50% by 2020.
We've entered into 2016 with strong momentum, which we intend to build upon to drive a high level of performance across our operations and strong growth. Our full year 2016 EPS guidance of $4.90 to $5.10, represents growth of 16.5% at the midpoint, positioning AbbVie to be among the industry leaders for EPS growth once again this year.
On our third quarter conference call, we outlined our long-term guidance for a number of key metrics, including our expectations for top and bottom line growth and margin expansion over our 5-year plan. We remain committed to delivering on these long-term objectives, which will generate double-digit EPS growth on average through 2020.
So in summary, we're pleased with our strong execution and the significant advancements we made in 2015. Over the past year, we've demonstrated a strong track record of success with positive clinical data and regulatory outcomes, and we look forward to numerous important pipeline milestones in the year ahead. We've consistently delivered on our commitments and are positioned for another year of strong growth. We built a strong foundation, and we're focused on generating top-tier financial performance in the years to come.

In 2015, we significantly advanced and derisked our pipeline and achieved a number of important regulatory milestones, and we expect 2016 to be a very productive year as well, with the potential for several regulatory submissions and approvals, key data readouts and phase transitions. We have a broad pipeline that includes more than 50 active clinical development programs, including more than 20 new products or indications in late stage development around the regulatory review. 
Today, I'll highlight recent updates and discuss some of the milestones we anticipate in the year to come. I'll start with hematologic oncology, an area where we have invested heavily and are uniquely positioned. As Rick mentioned, we have built a strategic portfolio of assets, including multiple mechanisms of action that has significant potential alone and in combination. The development program for our flagship oncology product, IMBRUVICA, continues to progress nicely. Our next opportunity for label expansion is in the first-line CLL setting. Data from the RESONATE-2 trial in treatment-naïve CLL patients recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed treatment with IMBRUVICA resulted in an 84% reduction in the risk of disease progression versus chlorambucil, with 87% of patients remaining on single-agent IMBRUVICA treatment at 18 months.
Additionally, treatment with IMBRUVICA showed an 84% reduction in overall mortality. We believe RESONATE-2 represents a practice-changing study that will set a new treatment standard for many treatment-naïve patients. We submitted a supplemental new drug application to the FDA, which is currently under priority review, and we anticipate approval in the first half of 2016. IMBRUVICA is also being evaluated in mid- to late-stage trials in follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, graft-versus-host disease and pancreatic cancer.
At the recent ASH meeting, 65 IMBRUVICA-related abstracts were presented, including data from several studies and potential new indications. And there is potential for dataflow and possible regulatory submissions for this year for several indications, including treatment-naïve lymphoma, relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and treatment-naïve diffuse large B cell lymphoma with timing dependent on event-driven analysis of ongoing studies.
In the area of immuno-oncology, ongoing trials evaluating IMBRUVICA in combination with checkpoint inhibitors are progressing well, with the potential to see proof-of-concept data in solid tumors over the course of the year.
Another important strategic asset in our oncology portfolio is venetoclax, our novel BCL-2 inhibitor, which has demonstrated strong efficacy, achieving deep levels of response and durable disease control both as monotherapy and in combination with Rituxan in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Venetoclax is currently under priority review for relapsed/refractory CLL, including patients whose tumors harbor the 17p deletion mutation, and we expect FDA action in the first half of 2016.
At ASH, we presented data and in the relapsed/refractory CLL patients in combination with Rituxan showing an overall response rate of 86% and a complete response rate of 47%. Additionally, minimal residual disease negativity in the bone marrow was observed in 55% of all patients treated with the combination. We're very encouraged by the depth of the responses driven by combination therapy in this patient population. Based on this data, earlier this month, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for venetoclax when used in combination with Rituxan.
We also believe BCL-2 will be effective in other hematologic malignancies. We recently presented encouraging venetoclax data in treatment-naïve AML patients over 65 years of age, who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. The early data showed combination treatment with venetoclax and hypomethalating agents resulted in complete response rates of approximately 71%, which is roughly double the response rate that would expected with the current standard of care. And based on these promising results, earlier this week, the FDA granted the third venetoclax breakthrough therapy designation. We are moving expeditiously into registrational trials for this indication.
In addition to IMBRUVICA and venetoclax, we are developing a dual PI3-kinase inhibitor, duvelisib, currently in late stage development. In collaboration with our partner, Infinity, we'll see data on in duvelisib relapsed/refractory NHL and CLL in the second half of the year, with potential regulatory submissions to follow. We are well-positioned to continue to evolve the treatment landscape in CLL and other blood cancers by exploring novel combinations including the programs in our pipeline and other mechanisms, with the goal to achieve deep durable disease control and/or remission while reducing or eliminating the use of toxic chemotherapy. To that end, we have numerous combination trials underway or starting in 2016. This includes our Phase III study of a chemotherapy-free combination of venetoclax and GAZYVA in the first-line unfit CLL patients. This study is underway and enrolling well. A large Phase III study is being initiated in collaboration with the German CLL working group to evaluate treatment with venetoclax in combination with a variety of therapies, including GAZYVA and IMBRUVICA in previously untreated fit CLL patients. This study, which we expect to initiate mid-year will assess the ability of venetoclax-based combinations to drive achievement of minimal residual disease, which has been associated with improved survival in CLL patients. To augment ongoing investigator-sponsored and collaborative groups studies evaluating venetoclax and IMBRUVICA combinations, we are designing company-sponsored studies to evaluate the combination in first-line CLL patients.
In addition, AbbVie and venetoclax are finalizing plans to pursue registrational studies evaluating combinations of venetoclax with [indiscernible] inhibitors and multiple myeloma, and as I mentioned previously, in combination with hypomethylating agents and AML. Finally, we are preparing to initiate a dose-finding study evaluating venetoclax and duvelisib in patients with a variety of hematologic malignancies.
In addition to our work in hematologic oncology, we have also been investing in a number of programs with the treatment of solid tumors, including our PARP inhibitor, veliparib, with 5 Phase III studies underway in lung, breast and ovarian cancer. And ABT-414, which is in development for glioblastoma multiforme or GBM. GBM is the most common and most aggressive type of malignant primary brain tumor.
Previously reported interim results from a Phase I clinical trial of ABT-414 showed that roughly 25% of patients with EGFR amplification or the B3 variant treated with ABT-414 in addition to standard of care achieved an objective response. These results illustrate a level of efficacy not typically seen in this difficult-to-treat cancer where historic data of response rates in our refractory population have been less than 10%.
Later this year, we'll see additional data for ABT-414 in second-line GBM. If the data are consistent with earlier studies, these trials could represent a path to a regulatory submission in the second half of 2016. In parallel, larger randomized comparative registrational trials are ongoing in first- and second-line GBM. We also have an active program focused on driving the next wave of immuno-oncology development beyond checkpoint inhibitors. We recently entered into a collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center focused on the discovery and development of new immuno-oncology therapies. Through this agreement, we're pairing MD Anderson's cutting-edge preclinical, translational and clinical capabilities with our strength in biology, protein engineering and chemistry with the goal to accelerate the development of new medicines. We anticipate a number of immuno-oncology assets moving into the clinic this year, and we look forward to sharing more details on our strategy in this area at our R&D day in June.
Moving on to immunology, our strategy is centered upon identifying treatments that offer differentiated profiles relative to currently available therapies, with the goal of continuing to raise the standard of care. We have multiple mid- and late stage pipeline assets with best-in-class potential. In late 2015, we initiated a Phase III program in rheumatoid arthritis for our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494, following positive results from our mid-stage clinical trials. We are particularly excited about the results of ABT-494 in a difficult-to-treat population and TNF-inadequate responders, a growing segment of the RA market. Results from the BALANCE-I trial in this patient population recently presented at ACR illustrate the agent's potential to be a best-in-class therapy, with ACR20 responses up to 73% and ACR50 responses up to 44%. 
Additional data from our Phase II program will be presented over the course of 2016, and we expect to commercialize ABT-494 in 2019. We also have additional immunology candidates in development, and we'll see mid-stage data from multiple programs in 2016. 
Finally, in immunology, we continue to innovate with HUMIRA. Last year, we received EU and U.S. approval for a new formulation of HUMIRA. Additionally, we have submitted regulatory applications for an improved Humira Pen device. And our U.S. and European regulatory applications for uveitis are currently under review, with decisions expected in the second half of this year.
Moving now to virology, where our goal is to develop a next-generation asset that offers high cure rates in ribavirin and interferon-free regimen. Mid-stage data indicates that our new PAN-genotypic combination can deliver cure rates approaching 100% and we believe the majority of patients will be well served with an 8-week treatment option. Late last year, we initiated a comprehensive registrational program, including 6 global Phase III studies. We'll start to see data from our registrational trials later this year, and this combination is poised for commercial entry next year.
In neurology, we're focused on therapies for the treatment of conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, MS and other new regenerative conditions. Zinbryta is our first-in-class investigational biologic for relapse/remitting multiple sclerosis, which is currently under regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe, with regulatory decisions expected in the first half of 2016. The filings are based upon the strong pivotal trial results, which demonstrates the patients treated with Zinbryta had a statistically significant 45% reduction in the annualized relapse rate versus Avonex, an established standard of care. Given the product profile, novel mechanism of action and its once-monthly subcutaneous administration, we believe Zinbryta has the potential to be an important therapeutic option.
Last year, we entered into a collaboration with C2N Diagnostics to develop and commercialize the portfolio of anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of serious neurodegenerative disorders. Last year, we initiated a Phase I program in patients with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, and we remain on track to start clinical development with C2N in Alzheimer's disease in 2016.
Finally, elagolix is our compound in Phase III development for endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Our goal with elagolix in endometriosis is to bring to market an oral therapy that provides a high level of efficacy with a minimal menopausal side effects such as hot flash while preserving bone health. We've reported positive results from our first pivotal trials in endometriosis last year and plan to report top line results from the second pivotal study in the first quarter of 2016. We also plan to present more detailed findings from both registrational trials at the ASRN meeting in October. We also recently initiated a Phase III program investigating the effect of elagolix on bleeding related to uterine fibroids.
So in summary, we continue to make significant progress with our pipeline and are on track to advance several programs in 2016. We built a promising late stage pipeline comprised of potentially transformational medicines, which will fuel our future growth. We look forward to covering our full pipeline in more detail and an R&D pipeline review to be held in Chicago during the 2016 ASCO Meeting in June. We hope you will join us. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on the quarter and our 2016 guidance. Bill?"

This morning, I'll share with you the highlights of our full year 2015 performance, provide an overview of our fourth quarter results and then walk through our outlook for 2016.
We had a strong performance in 2015, allowing us to raise our full year EPS guidance range twice during the year and ultimately deliver sales, margin expansion and earnings projections that exceeded our original expectations. For the full year 2015, adjusted net revenues were $22.8 billion, up 22% on an operational basis. We expanded our adjusted operating margin profile to 42.3% in 2015, up 610 basis points for the year. And as Rick mentioned, we reported adjusted earnings per share results of $4.29, up more than 29% for the year.
Turning to the fourth quarter. Total adjusted sales were $6.4 billion, up more than 24% on an operational basis. Unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange rate fluctuations reduced sales growth in the quarter by 6%. HUMIRA delivered global sales of $3.8 billion in the quarter, up 16% operationally, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales were more than $2.3 billion, increasing nearly 21%, reflecting exceptional growth across all 3 major categories: rheumatology, gastro and dermatology. Internationally, HUMIRA sales were nearly $1.4 billion in the quarter, up a strong 9.7% on an operational basis, excluding an unfavorable impact from exchange. Global HUMIRA sales for the full year 2015 were $14 billion, up 19.1% operationally versus the prior year. International HUMIRA sales in 2015 increased 8.6% on an operational basis.
Global IMBRUVICA net revenues were $343 million in the quarter. U.S. sales were $295 million, and our international profit sharing was $48 million. Since the closing of the Pharmacyclics acquisition on May 26, IMBRUVICA has driven $754 million of new revenue for AbbVie, and we are pleased with its progress.
A significant portion of our evaluation for Pharmacyclics is attributed to advancing into first-line therapy in treatment-naïve CLL patients and the submission of the strong RESONATE-2 data to the FDA this quarter bodes well for this assumption.
Global VIEKIRA sales in the fourth quarter were $554 million. The international launch has exceeded our planning expectations resulting in a higher mix of international sales again this quarter. As expected, VIEKIRA, our 2-drug once-daily ribavirin-free combination for the treatment of type B in Japan launched late in the fourth quarter.
Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 24.4% on an operational basis in the quarter. We saw a continued double-digit growth internationally for Duodopa, with a modest level of U.S. sales as expected. Global Duodopa sales for the full year 2015 were $231 million, up 23.5% operationally versus the prior year.
Global Creon sales were $185 million, up 22.8%. Full year sales of Creon were $632 million, up 22.5% versus 2014. Creon maintains its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market with roughly 70% share.
Global Lupron sales were $235 million in the fourth quarter, up 15.6% on an operational basis. For the full year, global Lupron sales were $826 million, up 9.3%, exceeding our expectations. Lupron continues to hold the leadership position and maintain significant share of the market.
Turning to the P&L profile for the fourth quarter. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 80.5%, excluding amortization and other specified items. Excluding the impact of Pharmacyclics, we saw a nearly 100 basis improvement year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, adjusted R&D was 15.9% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 23.9% of sales, contributing to continued improvement in our operating margin profile. Operating margin in the quarter was 40.1% of sales compared to 35.8% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusting for the negative impacts of foreign exchange and the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, operating margin increased by 540 basis points. As a reminder, the fourth quarter margin profile is generally the lowest of any quarter during the year. This reflects seasonal product mix impacts from higher sales of products like Synagis, a lower-margin partnered product.
Net interest expense was $199 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 21.6% in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.13, excluding noncash amortization expense and specified items. On a GAAP basis, we posted EPS of $0.92. As we look ahead to 2016, we are confirming our previously issued full year adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.90 to $5.10. This guidance excludes $0.42 per share of noncash amortization and noncash Pharmacyclics acquisition impact, as well as $0.03 per share of other specified. On the top line, we expect mid-teens revenue growth on an operational basis, excluding roughly 2% negative impact from exchange.
Included in our top line guidance, our assumptions for our key products as follows. HUMIRA has averaged well over $1 billion of annual growth for a number of years. In 2016, we expect HUMIRA to once again be an important contributor to our performance with high teens growth expected in the U.S. Internationally, we are forecasting mid-single digit operational growth, reflecting the latest market dynamics, including the launch of a biosimilar for Enbrel. 
For IMBRUVICA, we expect revenues to AbbVie of at least $1.8 billion. We anticipate global VIEKIRA sales of approximately $2 billion for the year. This level of sales includes significant international growth with a full year of sales in Japan. We expect continued double-digit growth for Duodopa, including an increase to U.S. sales contribution. As mentioned on previous calls, we anticipate a gradual ramp for product sales in the U.S. as physicians continue to get more familiar with the product. 
For Synagis, we expect mid-single-digit operational growth in 2016. Regarding AndroGel, we're forecasting 2016 sales of roughly $500 million. For Creon, we expect high single-digits sales growth. For Lupron and Synthroid, we expect sales to be roughly flat year-over-year, and we expect declines in several products with continued lipid franchise erosion as well as negative market trends in HIV and other mature products.
Turning back to the P&L for 2016, we are forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 82%. We are forecasting R&D expense above 15% of sales, and we expect to see sales leverage with SG&A levels at approximately 23% of sales, well below the 24.6% booked in 2015. As a result, in 2016, we are forecasting an increase in our operating margin profile of 100 basis points, reflecting ongoing initiatives and sales leverage. Excluding year-over-year impacts of foreign exchange and Pharmacyclics, this operating margin improvement would exceed 300 basis points. We are forecasting net interest expense of about $800 million for the full year, and we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 21% to 22% in 2016. Regarding our first quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the quarter of $1.13 to $1.15. This guidance reflects growth of approximately 21% at the midpoint. Our first quarter adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.11 of noncash amortization and specified items. We are forecasting revenue growth in the first quarter just above 20%, excluding roughly 4% negative exchange. While our full year outlook for international HUMIRA growth is mid-single digits, in the first quarter, we anticipate an operational international growth rate of 3%. This is a direct result of a difficult comparisons to the prior year quarter, where we posted a 15% increase for the brand due to shipment timing. So as we look back, we're very pleased with AbbVie's performance in our first 3 years as an independent company. In 2015, we delivered sales, margin expansion and earnings well above our original outlook. And we expect to build on that momentum in 2016, with industry-leading growth and an exciting pipeline.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry."

So I'll cover those 2. Let me do the HUMIRA one first. So as we mentioned in our previous call, we are anticipating that we will see indirect biosimilar competition outside the U.S., meaning Enbrel biosimilar is outside the U.S. this year. So if you think about our growth rate, we finished this year internationally at about 8.6%, and we're guiding for next year at about mid single digits. And you can break it up into sort of 2 components. One would be, obviously, as the brand gets a little bit bigger, the growth rates as a percentage is slowing down a bit. And then we have built in what our set of assumptions of what kind of price impact we might see from Enbrel in certain markets, particularly in Europe I would say, and that represents about 2% of our growth. So you can think of it coming down about 2% based on that. So that's the HUMIRA piece. On the Amgen IPR and the other IPRs, I think, in general, across all of the litigation aspects of HUMIRA, I think it's important to recognize that we have now entered a new phase of our biosimilar strategy. And in our third quarter call, we laid out a detailed explanation of our patent estate in an effort to really provide the investment community with a comprehensive set of information around the IP and what we got the litigation time lines would look like going forward. What I can tell you is nothing has changed from that assessment. We still believe in everything that we've described to you as part of that. But now we're in the active litigation process with other players, whether that be IPR litigation or other kind of litigation that will start to play out. And it's just not prudent for us to lay out for the world a play-by-play analysis of our positions around it. That's just not the -- that's not the smart thing to do from a litigation standpoint. So what I tell you is, I reiterate the points that we made before. We have a large robust portfolio of IP. We have done significant work from an innovation standpoint in this area, and we have prosecuted all of this IP based on the work that we've done and the investment that we've made, and we feel good about the IP in our portfolio. And as we said before, we intend to vigorously defend our IP. And this is going to need to play out over time. We're totally pleased with the decision of the patent office, but we're not going to basically do a play-by-play on this because that potentially could jeopardize our position."

I mean, I think all of us in this industry recognized all of the headlines we seen around price. And I think an important perspective to step back and think about for our business, this is not a business that is highly dependent upon price -- our business, I'm talking about. So if you look at our operational growth in 2015 at 22%, only 2% of that was price across the business. And if you look at HUMIRA, roughly around 25% of the overall growth is driven by price. Now you do have certain managed care contracts that have some level of price protection, so all the price doesn't fall through at 100%. And depending upon where the price increases are and the magnitude of those price increases, less of that will fall through in a later price increase as an example. So -- but overall, the vast majority of our growth whether it be HUMIRA or other assets in our pipeline is driven by volume growth. And I think that's an important perspective for the investor community to understand. As far as HCV is concerned, as we planned out for 2016, I'd say the Merck label came in pretty much spot on what we had expected. So I think it's within our expectations. We had built into our assumptions for HCV a level of competition and some level of price competition. We're going to have to see how that plays out. It's not -- we don't believe we have any exposure there at all, so we're not concerned about that. But we have built in what we believe is an appropriate level of both pricing and volume competition that we could see in the marketplace in 2016. Japan, to your point, we launched very late in the fourth quarter. And so far -- and I had an update just a week or so ago from the team. Japan is going well. It's tracking on our expectations."

Your first question was about our JAK franchise and competition. I think that if we look at JAK inhibitors, there had been a fair amount of enthusiasm several years ago that actual results didn't up [indiscernible] the expectations for the first generation of those molecules, such as tofacitinib. But the current generation, I think, have very nice profiles. And I think, baricitinib has generated a nice profile based on the data that we've seen today. We'll see more as they proceed through the regulatory review. And I think the clock is going to get used over time. What we see with this class is it tends to start slow and build over time and work from more resistant patience up to all the other lines of therapy and we see that with therapies in RA and in immunology in general. So when I compare the 2, I feel very encouraged by the results that we've seen with ABT-494. We have seen very strong efficacy, not just as in the ACR20 level, but at much higher levels responding to ACR50, ACR70, DAS remission, et cetera. And we've seen that across 2 large Phase IIb studies including a TNF-inadequate responder study. And those are the results that I mentioned in our opening comments. And there, we see a level of response in TNF-inadequate responders that we believe has the potential to be best in class. And so if you link that up with what I said about how RA dynamics play out, those data can be very important. And we believe that, that is a big opportunity for this molecule. We do believe over time that 494 will certainly have use in earlier lines of therapy. But when you look at the balanced profile of 494, we feel very good about it. So moving on to ABT-122 and Ablynx, those are in mid-stage trials, and we'll see data from ABT-122 mid-year and from Ablynx towards the back end of the year. And once we have those data, then that will be the time to make decisions about next steps, and we'll be sharing those data as soon as it's reasonable to do so after we get them."

So what we're going to want to see is something that is over and above the level of efficacy that can be achieved with comparable agents, if you will. So ABT-122 combines 17 and TNF, so you're going to want to see something in the disease populations we've studied in RA and in psoriatic arthritis. It's better than one can get with those mechanisms alone. And Ablynx is another approach at IL-6. You don't want to see something that's better than the existing therapies that are out there. Now obviously, these aren't comparative studies, but we'll have the data we believe to make those assessments and to determine whether we will advance those programs this year as I said. So with the Acerta -- there's certainly has been a lot of talk about Acerta given its relatively early stage of development. What I would say, first and foremost, is we've set a very high bar with IMBRUVICA. We've set a very high bar with efficacy and also with safety. I quoted some of the numbers from RESONATE-2. We don't believe we've left any room on the table for there to be story of improved efficacy. And we feel very good about the safety profile of IMBRUVICA. With Acerta, we're looking at much earlier data. We're looking at Phase Ib/IIa studies. I think the study that's garnered the most attention is about a 61-patient dose-rising study with an expansion. And it's really just not possible to compare those very early trials to a molecule like IMBRUVICA, which has multiple face to read out and it's been on the market now for considerable period of time. So we'll see as our program continues to progress, what they are able to demonstrate. We have comparative studies that we'll read out in a couple of year's time, and I think that's really the first time we'll be able to make any sort of comparative assessment. Those are open label studies, so that's a limitation of them. And I'll also add that a certain comparative studies are in relapse/refractory patients, and IMBRUVICA is moving to the front line over time, and that momentum is going to keep up. So we feel very confident in our position with IMBRUVICA."

When we did the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, we did it with the knowledge of Acerta. So we thoroughly reviewed, based on the information that we had at that time, the compound, and evaluated whether or not we thought it was a risk. And I think one of the things to keep in mind is a follower strategy in oncology, at least historically, has not worked very well. And the reason it doesn't work very well is if the innovator keeps advancing the bar, the regulatory environment changes on the follower. And what they need to do to be able to get their approvals, and it's more difficult, it takes more time, it's more expensive because they can't do single-arm studies to get approval. The second thing I'd say is there seems to be 2 theses out there, one would be improved efficacy, one would be improved safety profile, particularly around bleeding in AFib. I wouldn't say that those are issues that are inhibiting our ability to be able to advance the brand and standard of care today, but what I'd also say is as we have evaluated it, we believe that the vast majority of the data would support that those are on-mechanism side effects. And so we'll have to see what their data proves out, and we'll have to see what their inclusion and exclusion criteria is on the trials that they want to make sure it's a balanced view to be able to demonstrate what the bleeding in AFib rate would be. And remember, we didn't see AFib in IMBRUVICA until we got to something like 1,500 patients or so. And I think we saw bleeding at about 500, 600, something like that, right? So we have to see a lot more data to see a real signal, and it has to be in a population that's consistent with the population that's being treated, and we'll see what that data looks like. But I think the evidence today would suggest that those are on-mechanism. And so we'll have to see how it plays out, but I would tell you that we're confident in our position with IMBRUVICA."

As far as others that would infringe, I mean, we're certainly not in a position to be able to answer that question because we don't know what their formulations are. I guess, the best place to get that answer would be to ask them. But as I said, we're not going to talk a lot about how we're positioning things and how we plan on running the IPR process going forward. The most important thing here is that we prevail. And I realize that it probably doesn't give you great comfort, but you have to recognize our responsibility is to make sure we put the best position forward, and that we don't tip-off our opponents in this process as to what our strategy is. And so I apologize for that part of it, but that's the trade-off we have to make here. And you're going to see more of this play out over time, and I think you'll get a feel for it, and you can get other people to evaluate what you think that will look like from an IP standpoint, although I'd say much like this particular patent, some people opine, that they didn't think it was very strong and you saw how the patent office made their decision, right? So I think that's about all we can talk about as it relates to the litigation. The second would be on duration of therapy on IMBRUVICA. If you look at the duration of therapy today, I think it's tracking on what we expected as part of the original deal model that we put together. To give you some flavor for that, I'd say it's about 75% of the clinical trial duration. It has been increasing over time. There are a number of elements that basically we have analyzed and have programs in place. Some of those are pay related and some other kinds of things that we have to continue to work through. I think one of the things will be extremely helpful is the RESONATE-2 data here because now you have absolute data that supports that if you keep these patients on therapy for a longer period of time, then you get very good outcomes. And so I think not only from a standpoint of allowing us to be able to move into frontline, but as another piece of strong credible evidence that maintaining therapy over a longer period of time gives patients the benefit that we're looking for. One of the things that we did see is in certain position populations from a duration standpoint, when blood counts improved, some physicians would take patients off of therapy and obviously, that's not something that we would want, right? And so I think RESONATE-2 is a strong supporting set of data that will help give physicians the knowledge and information they need to be convinced that they should keep them on therapy even though the blood counts have improved. And then on venetoclax, I don't know Mike, can you talk it all about that? I mean, it's a little hard to tell at this..."

I'd say in the fourth quarter, there were 2 impacts, and one of them is going to be the label change. That's why I'm going through this explanation for you. So one was the VA volumes stayed very low through the fourth quarter because of the funding issue in the VA. And so that was one of the impacts. But then the second one was what we saw from collateral impact on the label. And I'd say we lost about 1 share point. So there was some bleed-over impact to other segments because the Child-Pugh B isn't worth 1 share point. It has stabilized now at that level, and so I think the impact has flowed through, and we assume that in what we build for 2016. But that's been the overall impact."

If you think about what we described for you on the 2020 HUMIRA guidance ex U.S., we basically said that we would see direct biosimilar competition in the fourth quarter of 2018. We have some impact from indirect biosimilars starting in 2016. I described earlier in the call what that impact assumption is for 2016. It will obviously have a flow-through impact into '17, as that expands and basically flows through. But then, if you think about the erosion curve that I described on the third quarter call. So what we said was, internationally, the brand will peak at 2018 and then it will gently start to decline. And if you get to the end in 2020, it's down about 15% or so. That's a combination of volume and price. Now I'd also tell you that because of the category is still growing, obviously, then the growth would have been there, and some of that growth went to a biosimilar player. So it basically says that about 30% of the total opportunity would have gone over that period of time. And that's the point at which we see some level of stabilization going forward. So I think that's the way you would characterize it and although we don't have direct knowledge of how each channel has build consensus around their international and U.S. that's of assumptions, what I would say is the biggest difference between consensus and our forecast is that some people are still forecasting that HUMIRA sees biosimilar competition in the United States. The number is too big to be anything other than that, the change. So after our guidance, what we did see is we saw HUMIRA move up pretty significantly but not all the way out to our 2020 forecast. So there are still some individuals who are assuming that they see biosimilar competition, probably now in that 19 time frame, it's pretty much slid out too. So it's the difference between that and ultimately our assumption that we'll get through '20 to '22, right? And I think that's the biggest single impact. As far as the Remsima panel, I think as we talked about internationally and we've been watching this play out in the international markets and studying it carefully, and as we've indicated to the marketplace many, many times before, we're not seeing a direct impact on HUMIRA. And obviously, if you look at our growth rates in 2015 and you look at our growth in the fourth quarter, I think that's indicative of the fact that we're not seeing any substantial impact as well. And so we wouldn't assume that there would be an impact in the United States either that really fits in a different category. I think the one thing that will be interesting to look at in the panel is we have assumed in our planning assumptions that biosimilar players get extrapolation. We don't agree with that. We think it's important for any drug to be tested in the indication that it's going to be used in and generate some clinical data. But I'd say we plan from a conservative standpoint that we will see extrapolation in all the major markets around the world. I think as we go forward here, if somehow we got an indication that, that were not going to be the case in United States, that will be a positive to us. So that's one of the things that we'll be looking at."

This morning, I'll briefly discuss our fourth quarter performance and our 2015 operational highlights. Mike will then provide updates on recent advancements across our R&D programs, and Bill will discuss the quarter and our 2016 guidance in more detail. As always, following our remarks, we'll take your questions.
We delivered another strong performance in the fourth quarter with results ahead of our expectations, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.13, representing growth of 27% versus the fourth quarter of 2014. Our fourth quarter performance caps off a very strong year for AbbVie, with sales and earnings well above our original projections for the year. We delivered 22% global operational sales growth in 2015, and we increased ongoing earnings per share by more than 29%.
We've driven strong commercial, operational and R&D execution, resulting in industry-leading performance with both strong revenue growth and improvement in our operating margin profile. AbbVie's EPS growth for 2015 ranks us among the top growth companies in our industry. Clearly, 2015 was a year of excellent performance. We delivered outstanding results from our current portfolio with strong growth from HUMIRA, which drove 19% global operational growth in 2015, including U.S. growth of nearly 29% and international operational growth of 8.6%. We saw continued strong momentum from IMBRUVICA with full year 2015 sales in excess of $1 billion.
Global VIEKIRA performance, although below our original expectations, generated more than $1.6 billion in its first year on the market. And we had strong performance from other products in our portfolio, including Creon, Lupron and Duodopa.
Over the past year, we have seen significant pipeline advancement and achieved a number of important development and regulatory milestones. We secured approvals for several assets, including HUMIRA as a treatment for HS, our once-daily HCV combination in Japan, and our partner received approval for elotuzumab for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. We successfully completed registrational studies and submitted regulatory applications for a number of programs, including venetoclax for relapsed/refractory CLL, IMBRUVICA for first-line CLL, Zinbryta for multiple sclerosis and HUMIRA for uveitis.
We successfully completed mid-stage clinical trials and transitioned into the registration-enabling phase of development for several key programs, including our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494 in RA, our pan-genotypic next-generation HCV combination, elagolix for uterine fibroids, and ABT-414, our antibody-drug conjugate for glioblastoma multiforme. We also reported compelling data from several development programs, including elagolix pivotal data in endometriosis; the HELIOS and RESONATE-2 IMBRUVICA data, which we anticipate will be reflected in the product label this year; and venetoclax data in several cancer types, including robust results in CLL and AML. In fact, the data we presented on venetoclax this year has resulted in 3 breakthrough therapy designations, a status granted by the FDA when clinical evidence indicates that a medicine may demonstrate a substantial improvement over existing therapies. We believe venetoclax has significant potential across a wide range of blood cancers, with the first of potentially numerous indications coming in the first half of this year. The progress we've made with our pipeline, including the impressive data we've shared over the past year, has further increased our level of confidence and derisked many of our key R&D programs. Numerous assets in our late-stage pipeline have the opportunity to generate multibillion-dollar peak-year sales and represent an opportunity for meaningful revenue growth in the years to come. 
2016 promises to be another milestone-filled year with significant activity across our pipeline, which Michael will discuss in more detail here in just a few moments.
In 2015, we also augmented our portfolio and our pipeline through strategic licensing and acquisition activity. The acquisition of Pharmacyclics provided a major new growth platform in a key strategic area, hematological oncology. IMBRUVICA, which is now a blockbuster therapy, offers significant growth potential through its existing and expanding list of indications and lines of therapy. We remain excited about the potential for IMBRUVICA, and we are pleased that our thesis is playing out as we expected. Within the hematological oncology segment, we have invested strategically to build a portfolio of medicines with the potential to transform the care of a large range of malignancies. Our portfolio includes 3 novel mechanisms of action: BTK inhibition, BCL-2 inhibition, PI3-kinase dual inhibition. These mechanisms are either on market, under regulatory review, or in registration-enabling trials. We're well positioned to build upon our leadership in this category with unique combinations of these and other agents. Over the past year, we delivered a strong return of capital to our investors, including a rapidly growing dividend, which has grown 42% since our inception, as well as share repurchase. We remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy, returning cash to shareholders while continuing to add strategically to our pipeline.
Following our acquisition of Pharmacyclics last year, our focus in the near term is on continuing to augment our therapeutic areas of focus, especially oncology and immunology. We evaluate opportunities that fit our strategic criteria and can deliver strong returns.
In 2015, we also drove improved efficiency across our operations, delivering significant operating margin expansion while continuing to invest in R&D and SG&A to drive future growth. We have delivered a significant level of margin expansion to date, and we remain committed to doing more to improve our operating margin profile going forward. Our focus on operating efficiencies will drive our adjusted operating margin profile to greater than 50% by 2020.
We've entered 2016 with strong momentum, which we intend to build upon to drive a high level of performance across our operations and strong growth. Our full year 2016 EPS guidance of $4.90 to $5.10 represents growth of 16.5% at the midpoint, positioning AbbVie to be among the industry leaders for EPS growth once again this year.
On our third quarter conference call, we outlined our long-term guidance for a number of key metrics, including our expectations for top and bottom line growth and margin expansion over our 5-year plan. We remain committed to delivering on these long-term objectives, which will generate double-digit EPS growth on average through 2020.
So in summary, we're pleased with our strong execution and the significant advancements we made in 2015. Over the past year, we've demonstrated a strong track record of success with positive clinical data and regulatory outcomes, and we look forward to numerous important pipeline milestones in the year ahead. We've consistently delivered on our commitments and are positioned for another year of strong growth. We built a strong foundation, and we're focused on generating top-tier financial performance in the years to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?"

In 2015, we significantly advanced and derisked our pipeline and achieved a number of important regulatory milestones, and we expect 2016 to be a very productive year as well, with the potential for several regulatory submissions and approvals, key data readouts and phase transitions. We have a broad pipeline that includes more than 50 active clinical development programs, including more than 20 new products or indications in late-stage development or on to regulatory review. 
Today, I'll highlight recent updates and discuss some of the milestones we anticipate in the year to come. I'll start with hematologic oncology, an area where we have invested heavily and are uniquely positioned. As Rick mentioned, we have built a strategic portfolio of assets, including multiple mechanisms of action that has significant potential alone and in combination. The development program for our flagship oncology product, IMBRUVICA, continues to progress nicely. Our next opportunity for label expansion is in the first-line CLL setting. Data from the RESONATE-2 trial in treatment-naïve CLL patients recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed treatment with IMBRUVICA resulted in an 84% reduction in the risk of disease progression versus chlorambucil, with 87% of patients remaining on single-agent IMBRUVICA treatment at 18 months.
Additionally, treatment with IMBRUVICA showed an 84% reduction in overall mortality. We believe RESONATE-2 represents a practice-changing study that will set a new treatment standard for many treatment-naïve patients. We submitted a supplemental new drug application to the FDA, which is currently under priority review, and we anticipate approval in the first half of 2016. IMBRUVICA is also being evaluated in mid- to late-stage trials in follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, graft-versus-host disease and pancreatic cancer.
At the recent ASH meeting, 65 IMBRUVICA-related abstracts were presented, including data from several studies and potential new indications. And there is potential for dataflow and possible regulatory submissions this year for several indications, including treatment-naïve mantle cell lymphoma, relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and treatment-naïve diffuse large B cell lymphoma, with timing dependent on event-driven analyses of ongoing studies.
In the area of immuno-oncology, ongoing trials evaluating IMBRUVICA in combination with checkpoint inhibitors are progressing well, with the potential to see proof-of-concept data in solid tumors over the course of the year.
Another important strategic asset in our oncology portfolio is venetoclax, our novel BCL-2 inhibitor, which has demonstrated strong efficacy, achieving deep levels of response and durable disease control both as monotherapy and in combination with RITUXAN in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Venetoclax is currently under priority review for relapsed/refractory CLL, including patients whose tumors harbor the 17p deletion mutation, and we expect FDA action in the first half of 2016.
At ASH, we presented data in the relapsed/refractory CLL patients in combination with RITUXAN, showing an overall response rate of 86% and a complete response rate of 47%. Additionally, minimal residual disease negativity in the bone marrow was observed in 55% of all patients treated with the combination. We're very encouraged by the depth of the responses driven by combination therapy in this patient population. Based on these data, earlier this month, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation for venetoclax when used in combination with RITUXAN.
We also believe BCL-2 will be effective in other hematologic malignancies. We recently presented encouraging venetoclax data in treatment-naïve AML patients over 65 years of age, who are ineligible for intensive induction chemotherapy. The early data showed combination treatment with venetoclax and hypomethylating agents resulted in complete response rates of approximately 71%, which is roughly double the response rate that would be expected with the current standard of care. And based on these promising results, earlier this week, the FDA granted the third venetoclax breakthrough therapy designation. We are moving expeditiously into registrational trials for this indication.
In addition to IMBRUVICA and venetoclax, we are developing a dual PI3-kinase inhibitor, duvelisib, currently in late-stage development. In collaboration with our partner, Infinity, we'll see data on duvelisib in relapsed/refractory NHL and CLL in the second half of the year, with potential regulatory submissions to follow. We are well positioned to continue to evolve the treatment landscape in CLL and other blood cancers by exploring novel combinations, including the programs in our pipeline and other mechanisms, with the goal to achieve deep durable disease control and/or remission while reducing or eliminating the use of toxic chemotherapy. To that end, we have numerous combination trials underway or starting in 2016. This includes our Phase III study of a chemotherapy-free combination of venetoclax and GAZYVA in first-line unfit CLL patients. This study is underway and enrolling well. A large Phase III study is being initiated in collaboration with the German CLL working group to evaluate treatment with venetoclax in combination with a variety of therapies, including GAZYVA and IMBRUVICA in previously untreated fit CLL patients. This study, which we expect to initiate mid-year, will assess the ability of venetoclax-based combinations to drive achievement of minimal residual disease, which has been associated with improved survival in CLL patients. To augment ongoing investigator-sponsored and collaborative group studies evaluating venetoclax and IMBRUVICA combinations, we are designing company-sponsored studies to evaluate the combination in first-line CLL patients.
In addition, AbbVie and Genentech are finalizing plans to pursue registrational studies evaluating combinations of venetoclax with proteasome inhibitors in multiple myeloma, and as I mentioned previously, in combination with hypomethylating agents and AML. Finally, we are preparing to initiate a dose-finding study evaluating venetoclax and duvelisib in patients with a variety of hematologic malignancies.
In addition to our work in hematologic oncology, we have also been investing in a number of programs for the treatment of solid tumors, including our PARP inhibitor, veliparib, with 5 Phase III studies underway in lung, breast and ovarian cancer; and ABT-414, which is in development for glioblastoma multiforme or GBM. GBM is the most common and most aggressive type of malignant primary brain tumor.
Previously reported interim results from a Phase I clinical trial of ABT-414 showed that roughly 25% of patients with EGFR amplification or the B3 variant treated with ABT-414 in addition to standard of care achieved an objective response. These results illustrate a level of efficacy not typically seen in this difficult-to-treat cancer, where historic data of response rates in our refractory population have been less than 10%.
Later this year, we'll see additional data for ABT-414 in second-line GBM. If the data are consistent with earlier studies, these trials could represent a path to a regulatory submission in the second half of 2016. In parallel, larger randomized comparative registrational trials are ongoing in first- and second-line GBM. We also have an active program focused on driving the next wave of immuno-oncology development beyond checkpoint inhibitors. We recently entered into a collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center focused on the discovery and development of new immuno-oncology therapies. Through this agreement, we're pairing MD Anderson's cutting-edge preclinical, translational and clinical capabilities with our strength in biology, protein engineering and chemistry, with the goal to accelerate the development of new medicines. We anticipate a number of immuno-oncology assets moving into the clinic this year, and we look forward to sharing more details on our strategy in this area at our R&D day in June.
Moving on to immunology. Our strategy is centered upon identifying treatments that offer differentiated profiles relative to currently available therapies, with the goal of continuing to raise the standard of care. We have multiple mid- and late-stage pipeline assets with best-in-class potential. In late 2015, we initiated a Phase III program in rheumatoid arthritis for our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494, following positive results from our mid-stage clinical trials. We are particularly excited about the results of ABT-494 in a difficult-to-treat population, anti-TNF-inadequate responders, a growing segment of the RA market. Results from the BALANCE-I trial in this patient population, recently presented at ACR, illustrate the agent's potential to be a best-in-class therapy, with ACR20 responses up to 73% and ACR50 responses up to 44%. 
Additional data from our Phase II program will be presented over the course of 2016, and we expect to commercialize ABT-494 in 2019. We also have additional immunology candidates in development, and we'll see mid-stage data from multiple programs in 2016. 
Finally, in immunology, we continue to innovate with HUMIRA. Last year, we received EU and U.S. approval for a new formulation of HUMIRA. Additionally, we have submitted regulatory applications for an improved HUMIRA pen device. And our U.S. and European regulatory applications for uveitis are currently under review, with decisions expected in the second half of this year.
Moving now to virology, where our goal is to develop a next-generation asset that offers high cure rates in a ribavirin- and ritonavir-free regimen. Mid-stage data indicates that our new pan-genotypic combination can deliver cure rates approaching 100%, and we believe the majority of patients will be well served with an 8-week treatment option. Late last year, we initiated a comprehensive registrational program, including 6 global Phase III studies. We'll start to see data from our registrational trials later this year, and this combination is poised for commercial entry next year.
In neurology, we're focused on therapies for the treatment of conditions like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's, MS and other neurodegenerative conditions. Zinbryta is our first-in-class investigational biologic for relapse-remitting multiple sclerosis, which is currently under regulatory review in the U.S. and Europe, with regulatory decisions expected in the first half of 2016. The filings are based upon strong pivotal-trial results, which demonstrates that patients treated with Zinbryta had a statistically significant 45% reduction in annualized relapse rates versus AVONEX, an established standard of care. Given the product profile, novel mechanism of action and its once-monthly subcutaneous administration, we believe Zinbryta has the potential to be an important therapeutic option.
Last year, we entered into a collaboration with C2N Diagnostics to develop and commercialize a portfolio of anti-tau antibodies for the treatment of serious neurodegenerative disorders. Last year, we initiated a Phase I program in patients with Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, and we remain on track to start clinical development with C2N in Alzheimer's disease in 2016.
Finally, elagolix is our compound in Phase III development for endometriosis and uterine fibroids. Our goal with elagolix in endometriosis is to bring to market an oral therapy that provides a high level of efficacy with minimal menopausal side effects, such as hot flash, while preserving bone health. We've reported positive results from our first pivotal trial in endometriosis last year, and plan to report top line results from the second pivotal study in the first quarter of 2016. We also plan to present more detailed findings from both registrational trials at the ASRM meeting in October. We also recently initiated a Phase III program investigating the effect of elagolix on bleeding related to uterine fibroids.
So in summary, we continue to make significant progress with our pipeline and are on track to advance several programs in 2016. We built a promising late-stage pipeline comprised of potentially transformational medicines, which will fuel our future growth. We look forward to covering our full pipeline in more detail at an R&D pipeline review to be held in Chicago during the 2016 ASCO Meeting in June. We hope you will join us. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on the quarter and our 2016 guidance. Bill?"

This morning, I'll share with you the highlights of our full year 2015 performance, provide an overview of our fourth quarter results, and then walk through our outlook for 2016.
We had a strong performance in 2015, allowing us to raise our full year EPS guidance range twice during the year, and ultimately deliver sales, margin expansion and earnings projections that exceeded our original expectations. For the full year 2015, adjusted net revenues were $22.8 billion, up 22% on an operational basis. We expanded our adjusted operating margin profile to 42.3% in 2015, up 610 basis points for the year. And as Rick mentioned, we reported adjusted earnings-per-share results of $4.29, up more than 29% for the year.
Turning to the fourth quarter. Total adjusted sales were $6.4 billion, up more than 24% on an operational basis. Unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange rate fluctuations reduced sales growth in the quarter by 6%. HUMIRA delivered global sales of $3.8 billion in the quarter, up 16% operationally, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales were more than $2.3 billion, increasing nearly 21%, reflecting exceptional growth across all 3 major categories: rheumatology, gastro and dermatology. Internationally, HUMIRA sales were nearly $1.4 billion in the quarter, up a strong 9.7% on an operational basis, excluding an unfavorable impact from exchange. Global HUMIRA sales for the full year 2015 were $14 billion, up 19.1% operationally versus the prior year. International HUMIRA sales in 2015 increased 8.6% on an operational basis.
Global IMBRUVICA net revenues were $343 million in the quarter. U.S. sales were $295 million, and our international profit sharing was $48 million. Since the closing of the Pharmacyclics acquisition on May 26, IMBRUVICA has driven $754 million of new revenue for AbbVie, and we are pleased with its progress.
A significant portion of our valuation for Pharmacyclics is attributed to advancing into first-line therapy in treatment-naïve CLL patients, and the submission of the strong RESONATE-2 data to the FDA this quarter bodes well for this assumption.
Global VIEKIRA sales in the fourth quarter were $554 million. The international launch has exceeded our planning expectations, resulting in a higher mix of international sales again this quarter. As expected, VIEKIRAX, our 2-drug once-daily ribavirin-free combination for the treatment of genotype 1b in Japan, launched late in the fourth quarter.
Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 24.4% on an operational basis in the quarter. We saw continued double-digit growth internationally for Duodopa, with a modest level of U.S. sales, as expected. Global Duodopa sales for the full year 2015 were $231 million, up 23.5% operationally versus the prior year.
Global Creon sales were $185 million, up 22.8%. Full year sales of Creon were $632 million, up 22.5% versus 2014. Creon maintains its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market with roughly 70% share.
Global Lupron sales were $235 million in the fourth quarter, up 15.6% on an operational basis. For the full year, global Lupron sales were $826 million, up 9.3%, exceeding our expectations. Lupron continues to hold the leadership position and maintain significant share of the market.
Turning to the P&L profile for the fourth quarter. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 80.5%, excluding amortization and other specified items. Excluding the impact of Pharmacyclics, we saw a nearly 100 basis improvement year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, adjusted R&D was 15.9% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 23.9% of sales, contributing to continued improvement in our operating margin profile. Operating margin in the quarter was 40.1% of sales compared to 35.8% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusting for the negative impacts of foreign exchange and the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, operating margin increased by 540 basis points. As a reminder, the fourth quarter margin profile is generally the lowest of any quarter during the year. This reflects seasonal product mix impacts from higher sales of products like Synagis, a lower-margin partnered product.
Net interest expense was $199 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 21.6% in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.13, excluding noncash amortization expense and specified items. On a GAAP basis, we posted EPS of $0.92. As we look ahead to 2016, we are confirming our previously issued full year adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.90 to $5.10. This guidance excludes $0.42 per share of noncash amortization and noncash Pharmacyclics acquisition impacts, as well as $0.03 per share of other specifieds. On the top line, we expect mid-teens revenue growth on an operational basis, excluding roughly 2% negative impact from exchange.
Included in our top line guidance, our assumptions for our key products are as follows: HUMIRA has averaged well over $1 billion of annual growth for a number of years. In 2016, we expect HUMIRA to once again be an important contributor to our performance, with high teens growth expected in the U.S. Internationally, we are forecasting mid-single digit operational growth, reflecting the latest market dynamics, including the launch of a biosimilar for Enbrel. 
For IMBRUVICA, we expect revenues to AbbVie of at least $1.8 billion. We anticipate global VIEKIRA sales of approximately $2 billion for the year. This level of sales includes significant international growth, with a full year of sales in Japan. We expect continued double-digit growth for Duodopa, including an increase to U.S. sales contribution. As mentioned on previous calls, we anticipate a gradual ramp for product sales in the U.S. as physicians continue to get more familiar with the product. 
For Synagis, we expect mid-single-digit operational growth in 2016. Regarding AndroGel, we're forecasting 2016 sales of roughly $500 million. For Creon, we expect high single digit sales growth. For Lupron and Synthroid, we expect sales to be roughly flat year-over-year, and we expect declines in several products with continued lipid franchise erosion as well as negative market trends in HIV and other mature products.
Turning back to the P&L for 2016. We are forecasting an adjusted gross margin ratio approaching 82%. We are forecasting R&D expense above 15% of sales, and we expect to see sales leverage with SG&A levels at approximately 23% of sales, well below the 24.6% booked in 2015. As a result, in 2016, we are forecasting an increase in our operating margin profile of 100 basis points, reflecting ongoing initiatives and sales leverage. Excluding year-over-year impacts of foreign exchange and Pharmacyclics, this operating margin improvement would exceed 300 basis points. We are forecasting net interest expense of about $800 million for the full year, and we expect an adjusted tax rate of approximately 21% to 22% in 2016. Regarding our first quarter outlook, we expect adjusted earnings per share in the quarter of $1.13 to $1.15. This guidance reflects growth of approximately 21% at the midpoint. Our first quarter adjusted EPS guidance excludes roughly $0.11 of noncash amortization and specified items. We are forecasting revenue growth in the first quarter just above 20%, excluding roughly 4% negative exchange. While our full year outlook for international HUMIRA growth is mid-single digits, in the first quarter, we anticipate an operational international growth rate of 3%. This is the direct result of a difficult comparison to the prior-year quarter, where we posted a 15% increase for the brand due to shipment timing. So as we look back, we're very pleased with AbbVie's performance in our first 3 years as an independent company. In 2015, we delivered sales, margin expansion and earnings well above our original outlook. And we expect to build on that momentum in 2016, with industry-leading growth and an exciting pipeline.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry."

So I'll cover those 2. Let me do the HUMIRA one first. So as we mentioned in our previous call, we are anticipating that we will see indirect biosimilar competition outside the U.S., meaning Enbrel biosimilars outside the U.S., this year. So if you think about our growth rate, we finished this year internationally at about 8.6%, and we're guiding for next year at about mid-single digits. And you can break it up into sort of 2 components. One would be, obviously, as the brand gets a little bit bigger, the growth rates as a percentage is slowing down a bit. And then we have built in what are a set of assumptions of what kind of price impact we might see from Enbrel in certain markets, particularly in Europe, I would say, and that represents about 2% of our growth. So you can think of it coming down about 2% based on that. So that's the HUMIRA piece. On the Amgen IPR and the other IPRs, I think, in general, across all of the litigation aspects of HUMIRA, I think it's important to recognize that we have now entered a new phase of our biosimilar strategy. And in our third quarter call, we laid out a detailed explanation of our patent estate in an effort to really provide the investment community with a comprehensive set of information around the IP and what we thought the litigation time lines would look like going forward. What I can tell you is nothing has changed from that assessment. We still believe in everything that we've described to you as part of that. But now we're in the active litigation process with other players, whether that be IPR litigation or other kind of litigation that will start to play out. And it's just not prudent for us to lay out for the world a play-by-play analysis of our positions around those. That's just not the -- that's not the smart thing to do from a litigation standpoint. So what I'd tell you is, I reiterate the points that we made before. We have a large robust portfolio of IP. We have done significant work from an innovation standpoint in this area, and we have prosecuted all of this IP based on the work that we've done and the investment that we've made, and we feel good about the IP in our portfolio. And as we said before, we intend to vigorously defend our IP. And this is going to need to play out over time. We're certainly pleased with the decision of the patent office, but we're not going to basically do a play-by-play on this because that potentially could jeopardize our position."

It's a little less than half a month. But one thing that is impacting this number is we had slightly higher inventory numbers in the channel in Q4 '14. And if you adjust that out, it pretty much gets you back to where guidance had us. So we haven't seen anything on this brand that would lead us to pause and restate our expectations. And as I said in the call in my comments, we're expecting high teens growth. So it's going very well. From price perspective, it's normal for these sorts of products to take price increases towards the end of the year or the beginning of the year. We certainly have done that at the beginning of the year. So there is going to be a price dynamic on HUMIRA in 2016. And we'll have to see how things pan out as the year progresses, above and beyond that."

I mean, I think all of us in this industry recognize all of the headlines we seen around price. And I think an important perspective to step back and think about for our business, this is not a business that is highly dependent upon price -- our business, I'm talking about. So if you look at our operational growth in 2015 at 22%, only 2% of that was price across the business. And if you look at HUMIRA, roughly around 25% of the overall growth is driven by price. Now you do have certain managed care contracts that have some level of price protection, so all the price doesn't fall through at 100%. And depending upon where the price increases are and the magnitude of those price increases, less of it will fall through in a later price increase, as an example. So -- but overall, the vast majority of our growth, whether it be HUMIRA or other assets in our pipeline, is driven by volume growth. And I think that's an important perspective for the investor community to understand. As far as HCV is concerned, as we planned out for 2016, I'd say the Merck label came in pretty much spot on what we had expected. So I think it's within our expectations. We have built into our assumptions for HCV a level of competition and some level of price competition. We're going to have to see how that plays out. It's not -- we don't believe we have any exposure there at all, so we're not concerned about that. But we have built in what we believe is an appropriate level of both price and volume competition that we could see in the marketplace in 2016. Japan, to your point, we launched very late in the fourth quarter. And so far -- and I had an update just a week or so ago from the team. Japan is going well. It's tracking on our expectations."

Your first question was about our JAK franchise and competition. I think that if we look at JAK inhibitors, there had been a fair amount of enthusiasm several years ago that actual results didn't live up to the expectations for the first generation of those molecules, such as tofacitinib. But the current generation, I think, have very nice profiles. And I think baricitinib has generated a nice profile based on the data that we've seen today. We'll see more as they proceed through the regulatory review. And I think the class is going to get use over time. What we see with this class is it tends to start slow and build over time and work from more resistant patients up to all the [ph] other lines of therapy, and we see that with therapies in RA and in immunology, in general. So when I compare the 2, I feel very encouraged by the results that we've seen with ABT-494. We have seen very strong efficacy, not just at the ACR20 level, but at much higher levels of response, ACR50, ACR70, DAS remission, et cetera. And we've seen that across 2 large Phase IIb studies, including a TNF-inadequate responder study. And those are the results that I mentioned in our opening comments. And there, we see a level of response in TNF-inadequate responders that we believe has the potential to be best in class. And so if you link that up with what I said about how RA dynamics play out, those data can be very important. And we believe that, that is a big opportunity for this molecule. We do believe over time that 494 will certainly have use in earlier lines of therapy. But when we look at the balanced profile of 494, we feel very good about it. So moving on to ABT-122 and Ablynx, those are in mid-stage trials, and we'll see data from ABT-122 mid-year, and from Ablynx towards the back end of the year. And once we have those data, then that will be the time to make decisions about next steps, and we'll be sharing those data as soon as it's reasonable to do so after we get them."

Now obviously, these aren't comparative studies, but we'll have the data, we believe, to make those assessments and to determine whether we will advance those programs this year, as I said.

What I would say, first and foremost, is we've set a very high bar with IMBRUVICA. We've set a very high bar with efficacy and also with safety. I quoted some of the numbers from RESONATE-2. We don't believe we've left any room on the table for there to be a story of improved efficacy. And we feel very good about the safety profile of IMBRUVICA. With Acerta, we're looking at much earlier data. We're looking at Phase Ib/IIa studies. I think the study that's garnered the most attention is about a 61-patient dose-rising study with an expansion. And it's really just not possible to compare those very early trials to a molecule like IMBRUVICA, which has multiple Phase III read-outs and it's been on the market now for a considerable period of time. So we'll see, as their program continues to progress, what they are able to demonstrate. They have comparative studies that will read out in a couple of years' time, and I think that's really the first time we'll be able to make any sort of comparative assessment. Those are open-label studies, so that's a limitation of them. And I'll also add that Acerta's comparative studies are in relapse/refractory patients, and IMBRUVICA is moving to the front line over time, and that momentum is going to keep up. So we feel very confident in our position with IMBRUVICA."

When we did the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, we did it with the knowledge of Acerta. So we thoroughly reviewed, based on the information that we had at that time, the compound, and evaluated whether or not we thought it was a risk. And I think one of the things to keep in mind is a follower strategy in oncology, at least historically, has not worked very well. And the reason it doesn't work very well is if the innovator keeps advancing the bar, the regulatory environment changes on the follower and what they need to do to be able to get their approvals. It's more difficult, it takes more time, it's more expensive because they can't do single-arm studies to get approval. The second thing I'd say is there seems to be 2 theses out there: one would be improved efficacy; one would be improved safety profile, particularly around bleeding in AFib. I wouldn't say that those are issues that are inhibiting our ability to be able to advance the brand and standard of care today, but what I'd also say is as we have evaluated it, we believe that the vast majority of the data would support that those are on-mechanism side effects. And so we'll have to see what their data proves out, and we'll have to see what their inclusion and exclusion criteria is on the trials that they run to make sure it's a balanced view to be able to demonstrate what the bleeding-in-AFib rate would be. And remember, we didn't see AFib in IMBRUVICA until we got to something like 1,500 patients or so. And I think we saw bleeding at about 500, 600, something like that, right? So we have to see a lot more data to see a real signal, and it has to be in a population that's consistent with the population that's being treated, and we'll see what the data looks like. But I think the evidence today would suggest that those are on-mechanism. And so we'll have to see how it plays out, but I would tell you that we're confident in our position with IMBRUVICA."

We obviously have a pretty high level of confidence in the IP. As far as others that would infringe, I mean, we're certainly not in a position to be able to answer that question because we don't know what their formulations are. I guess the best place to get that answer would be to ask them. But as I said, we're not going to talk a lot about how we're positioning things and how we plan on running the IPR process going forward. The most important thing here is that we prevail. And I realize that it probably doesn't give you great comfort, but you have to recognize our responsibility is to make sure we put the best position forward, and that we don't tip-off our opponents in this process as to what our strategy is. And so I apologize for that part of it, but that's the trade-off we have to make here. And you're going to see more of this play out over time, and I think you'll get a feel for it, and you can get other people to evaluate what you think that will look like from an IP standpoint, although I'd say much like this particular patent, some people opine that they didn't think it was very strong, and you saw how the patent office made their decision, right? So I think that's about all we can talk about as it relates to the litigation. The second would be on duration of therapy on IMBRUVICA. If you look at the duration of therapy today, I'd say it's tracking on what we expected as part of the original deal model that we put together. To give you some flavor for that, I'd say it's about 75% of the clinical trial duration. It has been increasing over time. There are a number of elements that basically we have analyzed and have programs in place. Some of those are payer related and some other kinds of things that we have to continue to work through. I think one of the things that will be extremely helpful is the RESONATE-2 data here, because now you have absolute data that supports that if you keep these patients on therapy for a longer period of time, then you get very good outcomes. And so I think not only from a standpoint of allowing us to be able to move into frontline, but as another piece of strong credible evidence that maintaining therapy over a longer period of time gives patients the benefit that we're looking for. One of the things that we did see is in certain physician populations, from a duration standpoint, when blood counts improved, some physicians would take patients off of therapy and obviously, that's not something that we would want, right? And so I think RESONATE-2 is a strong supporting set of data that will help give physicians the knowledge and information they need to be convinced that they should keep them on therapy even though the blood counts have improved. And then on venetoclax, I don't know. Mike, can you talk at all about that? I mean, it's a little hard to tell at this..."

I'd say in the fourth quarter, there were 2 impacts, and one of them is going to be the label change. That's why I'm going through this explanation for you. So one was the VA volumes stayed very low through the fourth quarter because of the funding issue in the VA. And so that was one of the impacts. But then the second was what we saw from collateral impact on the label. And I'd say we lost about 1 share point. So there was some bleed-over impact to other segments because the Child-Pugh B isn't worth 1 share point. It has stabilized now at that level, and so I think the impact has flowed through, and we assume that in what we built for 2016. But that's been the overall impact."

If you think about what we described for you on the 2020 HUMIRA guidance ex U.S., we basically said that we would see direct biosimilar competition in the fourth quarter of 2018. We'd have some impact from indirect biosimilars starting in 2016. I described earlier in the call what that impact assumption is for 2016. It will obviously have a flow-through impact into '17 as that expands and basically flows through. But then, if you think about the erosion curve that I described on the third quarter call. So what we said was, internationally, the brand will peak in 2018 and then it will gently start to decline. And if you get to the end in 2020, it's down about 15% or so. That's a combination of volume and price. Now I'd also tell you that because the category is still growing, obviously, then the growth would have been there, and some of that growth went to a biosimilar player. So it basically says that about 30% of the total opportunity would have gone over that period of time. And that's the point at which we see some level of stabilization going forward. So I think that's the way you would characterize it. And although we don't have direct knowledge of how each analyst builds consensus around their international and U.S. sets of assumptions, what I would say is the biggest difference between consensus and our forecast is that some people are still forecasting that HUMIRA sees biosimilar competition in the United States. The number is too big to be anything other than that, the change. So after our guidance, what we did see is we saw HUMIRA move up pretty significantly, but not all the way out to our 2020 forecast. So there are still some individuals who are assuming that they see biosimilar competition, probably now in that '19 time frame, it's pretty much slid out to. So it's the difference between that and ultimately our assumption that we'll get through '20 to '22, right? And I think that's the biggest single impact. As far as the Remsima panel, I think as we talked about internationally and we've been watching this play out in the international markets and studying it carefully, and as we've indicated to the marketplace many, many times before, we're not seeing a direct impact on HUMIRA. And obviously, if you look at our growth rates in 2015 and you look at our growth rate in the fourth quarter, I think that's indicative of the fact that we're not seeing any substantial impact as well. And so we wouldn't assume that there would be an impact in the United States either. That really fits in a different category. I think the one thing that will be interesting to look at in the panel is we have assumed in our planning assumptions that biosimilar players get extrapolation. We don't agree with that. We think it's important for any drug to be tested in the indication that it's going to be used in and generate some clinical data. But I'd say we plan from a conservative standpoint that we will see extrapolation in all the major markets around the world. I think as we go forward here, if somehow we got an indication that, that were not going to be the case in United States, that will be a positive to us. So that's one of the things that we'll be looking at."

What you need to think about with our pricing dynamic on HUMIRA is price increases in the later half of the year tend to have less of a fall-through. That's related to basically pricing caps in certain programs. So to the extent that we take price later in the year, our rebate goes up for those particular programs. But I don't want to get into any specific numbers around that at this point in time."

But the one thing I do want to clarify is remember, IP in Europe is different than IP in the United States in how it is ultimately prosecuted. The second thing is it's important to remember that although we withdrew the parent patent, we did it because it was one particular assay that we had a second patent that didn't have that question, and therefore, we pulled that patent in order to basically just focus on this other patent. So it's not like we withdrew it because we were concerned about it. And -- so ultimately -- but that is not an issue from a U.S. standpoint, and I think that's probably as much as we're going to talk about it. Reference pricing, obviously, part of what I indicated earlier is reference price, but I'd say also there are some markets where there could be some hospital negotiations also that could have an impact here, and so we factored in what we think is certainly a conservative number. But I think it's an appropriate number to be able to ultimately plan for 2016. And then on Acerta BTK, the IP, again, we have significant IP in this area.

This morning, I'll discuss our first quarter performance and provide an overview of the Stemcentrx acquisition, which we announced earlier today. Mike will provide updates on recent advancements across our R&D programs, and Bill will discuss the quarter and our 2016 guidance and our 2016 guidance in more detail, including the financial aspects of Stemcentrx transaction. And as always, following our remarks, we'll take your questions.
We delivered another strong quarterly performance, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.15, representing growth of more than 22% versus the first quarter 2015. Our results included strong operational sales growth of 22.4%, driven by a number of products across our portfolio. This includes HUMIRA global operational growth of more than 19%, strong growth from IMBRUVICA, continued global update of VIEKIRA and strong performance from several other products in our portfolio, including Creon and Duodopa. We also continued to deliver improvements in our operating margin profile. In addition to our strong financial results, we also advanced several of our key strategic priorities. Late in the quarter, we secured FDA approval for IMBRUVICA as a first-line treatment for patients with CLL. We're roughly 1 month into our first-line launch, and we're pleased with our progress to date. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, recently published an updated view of this guidelines granting IMBRUVICA a category 1 recommendation for certain CLL patients, the highest recommendation assigned by the organization.
We are also approaching the one-year mark for Pharmacyclics, and we continue to be very pleased with the progress we've made today. The Pharmacyclics team continues to rapidly advance trial activity, exploring IMBRUVICA across a broad range of tumor types. IMBRUVICA offers significant growth potential through its expanding list of indications and lines of therapy, and we remain excited about the vast potential for this unique asset.
Earlier this month, we received FDA approval for another transformative therapy for the treatment of CLL. Venclexta, our novel BCL-2 inhibitor was approved for patients with relapsed refractory CLL who harbor the 17p deletion, a difficult to treat form of the disease typically associated with poor prognosis. Based on the level of efficacy in this patient population, the FDA granted the approval under its breakthrough therapy and priority review designations. Since the beginning of the year, we've also reported compelling data from several development programs, including positive top line results from our second pivotal elagolix trial in endometriosis and strong data from our next-generation HCV program. Mike will provide updates in both programs during his remarks in just a few moments.
We also augmented our pipeline with a late-stage asset with a global collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim to develop and commercialize an anti-IL-23 currently in Phase III development for psoriasis and mid-stage development for several additional indications. The agreement provides AbbVie with another potential best-in-class late-stage asset, adding to our immunology pipeline, which includes G494 currently in Phase III development for RA as well as several other Biologics that are in mid-stage trials. Based on its potential for best-in-class efficacy, we believe it to be an asset to generate multibillion dollars in revenues across several immune-mediated diseases.
Clearly, the most notable and exciting news today is our planned acquisition of Stemcentrx. We could not be more pleased to have this talented group of individuals join our organization. We have been tremendously impressed with their accomplishments to date, and their innovation and expertise will drive strong benefits for AbbVie going forward. The addition of Stemcentrx is a strategically compelling opportunity for our company, our shareholders and the patients, which we serve. Over the past several years, we've taken a number of steps to build and strengthen our position in oncology, research and development, with the objective of becoming a leading oncology company. We've advanced numerous promising pipeline assets, including our BCL-2 inhibitor for blood cancers and anti-inhibitor and anti-EGFR antibody drug conjugate in development for solid tumors. We've strengthened our discovery efforts through collaborations with leading academic and other institutions around the world. We've added top talent to our organization. Last year, through the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, we obtained IMBRUVICA, a first-in-class BTK inhibitor, which has already achieved blockbuster status and is on a trajectory to achieve multibillion dollar peak year sales. 
And as I mentioned earlier, we just launched our internally developed Venclexta, which adds another transformational therapy to our hematological oncology franchise. We view oncology as a significant pillar of growth for AbbVie going forward. And as we evaluate all opportunities, we do so with a desire to balance near-term performance by continuing to build the portfolio of assets that will generate strong growth in 2020 and beyond, supporting our commitment to drive top-tier performance over the long term. 
So that brings me to our announcement today, the acquisition of Stemcentrx, which gives AbbVie a highly attractive platform for solid tumors and extremely exciting late-stage assets in Rova-T. The transaction enables AbbVie to further expand and accelerate our presence in oncology, building upon our growing position in the hematological oncology. Stemcentrx proprietary solid tumor platform leverages cancer stem cell biology to identify and validate novel therapeutic targets. The company has demonstrated a track record of successfully engineering and manufacturing antibodies and antibody drug conjugates for those targets.
Stemcentrx lead asset is Rova-T, a DLL3 targeted antibody drug conjugate. DLL3 is a novel target expressed in several tumor types, including small cell lung cancer, an aggressive and difficult-to-treat disease, small cell lung cancer accounts for roughly 15% of all lung cancers, and more than 60,000 patients are diagnosed annually in the major developed markets. DLL3 is the first predictive biomarker associated with the drug efficacy and small cell lung cancer. It is highly expressed in a majority of small cell lung cancer tumors as well as cancer stem cells and is not expressed in normal tissue. Predictive biomarkers help identify which patients have the potential to benefit from a therapy. Rova-T is currently in registrational trials for third-line small cell lung cancer. There is a significant unmet need for this patient population as the treatment landscape is not changed for several decades. In fact, there is current the only one approved treatment for second-line small cell lung cancer and no approved agents for third-line use. The 5-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with this type of cancer is unfortunately very low at approximately 6%. Last year, the European Society of Medical Oncology meeting, Stemcentrx presented exciting Phase II results in small cell lung cancer, including data that illustrated an overall response rate of 44% in a DLL3 biomarker-defined population. Rova-T also demonstrated a clinical benefit rate of 78% in this refractory and difficult-to-treat set of patients. Response rates were similar in third-line and second-line patients with a manageable safety profile. This landmark data represents the first time a biomarker-targeted therapy has shown significant efficacy in small cell lung cancer. Additional data from a broader set of patients and longer-term follow-up, including compelling overall survival results, will be disclosed during an oral section at the upcoming ASCO meeting in June where the abstract has been selected as a Best of ASCO presentation, a distinction only 1% of abstracts received. Given the very promising efficacy in third-line small cell lung cancer, Stemcentrx recently filed for FDA breakthrough designation for this setting. Based on a compelling data and a significant unmet need in this patient population, we are certainly hopeful that we will be successful in obtaining this status. Stemcentrx has moved rapidly through clinical development in third-line small cell lung cancer, from the initiation of the first in human trials to the recent start of the registration-enabling study. Based on the expected completion of the ongoing registrational trial, commercialization of this indication is expected in 2018. Stemcentrx is also moving to rapidly advance in the front-line small cell lung cancer. Mike will provide more detail on the planned first-line program in just a few moments.
Like HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, we believe Rova-T has the potential applicability across a broad range of indications and tumors. In addition, the small cell lung cancer expression of DLL3 indicates Rova-T may be useful across multiple solid tumor types, including metastatic melanoma, glioblastoma multiforme as well as some prostate, pancreatic and colorectal cancers, among others. There is a significant subset of patients whose tumors are positive for a DLL3 expression within this broader set of tumors, representing more than 65,000 patients treated annually. We plan to evaluate Rova-T across numerous indications, leveraging our R&D infrastructure and global clinical trial organization to move rapidly and efficiently.
The acquisition of Stemcentrx also broadens AbbVie's oncology pipeline with a portfolio of earlier-stage candidates focused on novel oncology targets. In addition to Rova-T, the Stemcentrx pipeline includes 4 clinical candidates being evaluated in trials across a range of solid tumors as well as 2 additional INDs for new targets planned for 2016 and a broad portfolio of validated preclinical targets.
Stemcentrx also enhances AbbVie's oncology discovery capabilities. The technology platform that identified Rova-T and the other assets in the Stemcentrx pipeline has strong potential for continued asset generation and will strengthen AbbVie's discovery and development efforts in solid tumors going forward.
So as we summarize the transaction, the addition of Stemcentrx is strategically compelling. The acquisition is highly complementary with our growing hematological oncology franchise and existing portfolio of solid tumor assets. The lead asset, Rova-T, represents a multibillion-dollar peak revenue opportunity, with revenue potentially approaching $5 billion as we advance in the first-line small cell lung cancer and other indications. Rova-T has the potential to have a dramatic impact on our growth over the long term. Additionally, Stemcentrx existing pipeline of additional assets in their R&D engine will augment our future development efforts in solid tumors. Stemcentrx adds to AbbVie's long-term growth prospects, providing another compelling growth platform that will further diversify our revenue base beginning in 2018 and will enhance our EPS growth starting in 2020 and beyond. Stemcentrx fits well within our overall strategy. We have now assembled a significant number of late-stage assets, which have been significantly de-risked, have multibillion-dollar potential and the potential to drive sustainable growth in 2020 and beyond. Assets including IMBRUVICA, Venclexta, ABT-494, Zinbryta, elagolix, the next-generation HCV combination, our recently unlicensed anti-IL-23 and now Rova-T, all of these assets have a high probability of regulatory and commercial success.
In closing, we continue to be pleased with our strong execution and strategic advancement. We continue to demonstrate an exceptional track record of success with positive clinical data and regulatory outcomes, and we look forward to additional important pipeline milestones in the year ahead. We're off to a strong start this year, and we intend to build upon our momentum to drive a high level of performance across their operations and deliver strong growth in 2016, and we remain committed to delivering on our long-term objectives that we outlined last year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D program. Mike?"

We had a very productive first quarter from an R&D perspective with a number of important data readouts, phase transitions, regulatory approvals as well as licensing activity. This morning, I will provide color on some of the key highlights.
I'll start by saying that I certainly share Rick's enthusiasm for Stemcentrx, which brings us a promising late-stage program with Rova-T, a pipeline of earlier stage candidates and a platform technology that will enhance our future solid tumor discovery and development efforts. We very much enjoyed our dialogue with the Stemcentrx team as we've gotten to know them over the past several months, and we've been impressed with the individuals and the innovative platform they built. 
Stemcentrx has established an impressive track record. The company's first 3 clinical stage drugs each represent novel targets with single-agent activity demonstrated in early phase trials in small cell lung cancer, triple negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer, all difficult-to-treat solid tumor indications. Stemcentrx is highly productive discovery effort is driven by the company's core technology, which utilizes a library of more than 700 patient-derived tumors models and leverages cancer stem cell biology to identify and validate therapeutic targets that would be overlooked by other methods. This platform has yielded impressive results to date, and we are excited about the potential for continued asset generation, which will aid AbbVie in our R&D efforts going forward. The company's lead asset, Rova-T, represents a significant opportunity, not only through its lead indication, third line small cell lung cancer, but also through the potential for expansion into the front-line setting as well as other types of cancer where LL 3 plays an important role. Stemcentrx has a broad development program for Rova-T currently underway. We've been impressed with the speed with which Stemcentrx has moved through the clinic. It's been roughly 4.5 years since target identification and less than 3 years between filing the Rova-T IND to the initiation of the registration study in third-line small cell lung cancer. The confirmatory third line trial, which is called Trinity, began in January and is expected to complete enrollment by the end of 2016 with commercialization expected in 2018. We view the Rova-T small cell lung cancer program as significantly derisked with a high probability of success. In addition to the overall respondents data presented at last year which showed an overall response rate of 44% in DLL3-positive patients, the profile of Rova-T is supported by longer-term data, some of which will be presented at the upcoming ASCO meaning. These updated data include promising overall survival findings that compare favorably to historical controls. We believe the full body of data generated -- generated today are highly compelling and strongly support the value proposition of Rova-T.
Stemcentrx is also moving rapidly into front-line small cell lung cancer with Rova-T. The company is on the cusp of initiating a study designed to select the optimal regimen for the front-line registration no program. This 4-arm trial will evaluate several permutations of Rova-T and standard of care chemotherapy, including both monotherapy and combination arms. Given the compelling data we've seen in small cell lung cancer to date, we believe there is a high likelihood of successfully moving into earlier lines of therapy.
Stemcentrx is also evaluating an 8-arm 400 patient basket study, which will look at Rova-T as monotherapy in patients with a range of tumor types with and neuro features including malignant melanoma, medullary thyroid cancer, glioblastoma large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and forms of prostate cancer and other solid tumors. This study is on track to start enrolling patients this quarter.
Additional first-line studies are planned, including a Phase I study to assess the safety of Rova-T in combination with anti-body therapy targeting the PD-1 PDL-1 access, which is on track to initiated during the second half of 2016. Clearly, prior to the Stemcentrx acquisition, AbbVie was already focused on establishing a strong position in oncology. Since the company was established in 2013, we've added 10 new oncology assets through internal advancement or partnership efforts. The Stemcentrx acquisition accelerates our objective of becoming a leading oncology company. We look forward to spending more time discussing Stemcentrx including their pipeline at our upcoming R&D Day in June.
In addition to the Stemcentrx acquisition, last week, we also announced 2 early-stage oncology collaborations, including an agreement with argenx for a novel immuno oncology target and an agreement with CytomX to develop drug conjugates, a platform which provides another opportunity to buy with the strength and antibody drug conjugates. Beyond oncology, as Rick noted, we also recently entered into a global agreement with to develop and commercialize an anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody in Phase III development for psoriasis and mid-stage development for several additional indications.
The collaboration of physicians is promising asset as AbbVie's lead investigational compound in psoriasis and complements our robust immunology pipeline. Recent Phase II study results for in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis showed improved efficacy of a commonly used treatment for this light impacting skin condition that was included in the study as an active comparator. Specifically, the strong head-to-head results showed that at 12 weeks, 81% of patients treated with 180 milligrams of the BI compound achieved [indiscernible] 90 [ph] more than doubled the rate achieved by patients treated with In 50% of the patients treated with the BI compound, achieved complete skin clearance or posse [ph] 100 versus just 17.5% of the treated patients. We're pleased with this level of efficacy as our immunology development strategy is centered upon identifying treatments that offer differentiated profiles relative to currently available therapies, with the goal of continuing to raise the standard of care. Beyond the impressive efficacy, this asset also has the potential to offer a favorable dosing profile with subcutaneous quarterly administration.
The BI compound is also currently in Phase II development for psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease with plans to initiate a Phase IIb study in psoriatic arthritis in mid-2016 and the potential to transition into Phase III development and Crohn's disease next year. We will present mid-stage Crohn's disease induction data at the upcoming Digestive Disease Week, or DDW, meeting next month. We've also disclosed positive results for several late-stage programs, including most recently additional data on next-generation HCV regimen. Earlier this month at The International Liver Congress in Barcelona, we presented data on our once-daily ribavirin-free combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in patients with genotypes 1 through 6 [ph] including data on treatment durations as short as 8 weeks. The data illustrate that with the 8 weeks of treatment, 97% to 98% of genotype-1 through 3 patients without cirrhosis achieved sustained virologic response at 12 weeks posttreatment. Additionally, 100% of genotype 4 through 6 patients without cirrhosis achieved SVR 12 with 12 weeks of treatment. We also presented late-breaking data showing our next-generation combination drug 100% SVR 12 with 12 weeks of treatment without ribavirin in treatment-naïve genotype 3 patients with compensated cirrhosis. While recent advancements in HCV treatment have resulted in high cure rates for many patients, there remain distinct areas of unmet need, including patients with genotype 3. These new data illustrate the potential of our next-generation combination to address this need.
Another area of unmet need is patients who have failed previous therapy with direct-acting antivirals or DAA as treatment options for these patients are limited. We presented data showing that 95% of genotype-1 patients who failed previous therapy with DAAs achieved SVR 12 with 12 weeks of therapy without the need for ribavirin. The mid-stage data we disclosed today indicated that our new HCV combination can deliver cure rates approaching 100%, and we believe the majority of patients will be well-served with an 8-week treatment option. We expect to see results from the pivotal studies in the second half of this year, and we remain on track for commercialization next year. We also announced positive top line results from the second of 2 replicate pivotal Phase III clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of elagolix in premenopausal women who suffer pain from endometriosis. Trial results show that after 6 months of continuous treatment, both doses of elagolix met the study's co-primary endpoints, with elagolix reducing scores of menstrual pain and non-menstrual pelvic pain in month 3 and month 6. We intend to present detailed results from both Phase III trials in a medical conference later this year and will complete the clinical database in anticipation of a new drug application submission for endometriosis in 2017. We also continue to advance the elagolix development program in urine fibroids. During the quarter, we initiated a Phase III program investigating the effect of elagolix on heavy bleeding related to this highly prevalent condition. As Rick noted, we received 2 important approvals within our hematologic oncology portfolio as well. The expansion of the IMBRUVICA label into first-line use for CLL and the initial approval of our novel BCL-2 inhibitor, Venclexta. With IMBRUVICA and Venclexta, we now have 2 therapies in the market for the treatment of CLL, addressing a range of patient types.
We continue to advance our development efforts for IMBRUVICA, Venclexta and several other assets in our oncology pipeline. We'll present data across a wide range of studies at the upcoming ASCO meeting. We built a strategic portfolio of oncology assets, including multiple mechanisms of action that have significant potential alone and in combination.
So in summary, we continue to make significant progress with our pipeline and are on track for further advancement in 2016. We have a broad pipeline that includes more than 50 active clinical assets, including more than 20 new products or indications in late-stage development or under regulatory review. We look forward to covering our full pipeline in more detail at our R&D pipeline review to be held in Chicago on June 3. We hope you will join us. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our first quarter performance. Bill?"

Strong operational revenue growth in the quarter was in line with our guidance for growth of just above [ph] 20%. Foreign exchange had a negative 4.2% impact on revenue in the quarter, also in line with our guidance of roughly 4% negative exchange.
We continue to see strong momentum for HUMIRA, which delivered global sales of more than $3.5 billion, up 19.2% operationally, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales were nearly $2.2 billion, reflecting exceptional growth across all 3 major categories: rheumatology, gastro and derm. Internationally, HUMIRA sales were nearly $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4.6% on an operational basis, excluding an unfavorable impact from exchange. This exceeded our previous forecast of 3% operational growth. Currency reduced reported international HUMIRA sales by 9.2%, while early in the launch, the biosimilar strategy in line or favorable to what we had modeled.

Global VIEKIRA sales in the quarter were $414 million. The launch of our 2-drug once-daily ribavirin-free combination for patients with HCV genotype-1D is underway in Japan leading to our continued higher mix of international sales in the quarter. Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 36.7% on an operational basis in the quarter. We saw continue to double-digit growth internationally for Duodopa with a modest level of U.S. sales as expected.
Global Creon sales were $150 million, up 18.2% operationally. Creon continues to maintain its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market with the majority of the market share.
The adjusted gross margin ratio was 81.3% of sales in the first quarter, which was impacted by the Pharmacyclics transaction and year-over-year impacts of foreign exchange. Excluding these impacts, the ratio was up over 200 basis points.
As I mentioned earlier, we continue to show improvement in our adjusted operating margin profile, which increased to 43.1% of sales, up 300 basis points. Excluding the impact of Pharmacyclics and foreign exchange, operating margin improved over 600 basis points versus the prior year quarter. The majority of this improvement was driven by efficiencies and our rapidly growing top line.
Adjusted R&D was 15.6% of sales, reflecting funding actions in support of our pipeline assets. Adjusted SG&A was 22.6% of sales in the first quarter, down significantly from the prior year on a profile basis, contributing to a continued improvement in operating margin leverage. Adjusted net interest expense was $200 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 20.7% in the quarter.
First quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding noncash intangible amortization expense and specified items, were $1.15, up 22.3% year-over-year.
During the quarter, as a result of the economic conditions in Venezuela and the lack of availability of U.S. dollars at the government's official exchange rate, we changed the exchange rate we use in Venezuela to the floating dcom rate. This resulted in a charge of $298 million related to a devaluation of our net monetary assets in Venezuela. This will also impact revenue book for products sold in Venezuela.
I would like to now walk you through the financial aspects of the Stemcentrx transaction. We are acquiring Stemcentrx for $5.8 billion, with the consideration be paid out as $3.8 billion in equity and $2 billion in cash. The use of equity in this transaction reflects Stemcentrx management and Board of Directors desire to retain a stake in the asset as well as achieve a tax-deferred structure. Upon closing, we plan to execute an accelerated share repurchase program to reacquire all of the newly issued equity. We anticipate transaction to close late in the second quarter. We are forecasting $0.20 dilution in 2016 as a result of the transaction, which represents a half year of R&D operating and interest expense. We plan to provide specifics on Stemcentrx's impact on our P&L profile during the second quarter earnings call in July. We expect the transaction to generate positive operating margin beginning in 2019 and EPS accretion starting in 2020. Given these facts, we are updating our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $4.62 to $4.82 to reflect the Stemcentrx transaction. This range reflects EPS growth of 10% at the midpoint and includes the previously communicated $0.08 diluted impact of the BI collaboration announced last month. It excludes $0.75 of intangible amortization and specified costs. Specified items related to the Stemcentrx acquisition will be quantified and included on our second quarter call.
Regarding the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.19 to $1.21. This excludes roughly $0.18 of specified items and noncash amortization and includes the BI and Stemcentrx dilution impact.
We are expecting mid-teens operational sales growth, excluding a roughly 2% negative foreign exchange impact on the quarter. As a result, we are expecting low teens sales growth on a reported basis. We are forecasting 3% operational growth for international HUMIRA in the second quarter. Excluding Venezuela, this growth would've exceeded 5%. We currently expect the negative 4% currency impact on international HUMIRA in the second quarter, resulting in a modest decline year-over-year on a reported basis. However, we remain on track with our previously communicated full year guidance for HUMIRA outside the U.S, including the mid-single-digit operational growth expected internationally.
So in conclusion, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter as we've driven strong top and bottom line growth and delivered operating margin expansion while also advancing on our strategic priorities. This puts us in a strong position to continue delivering industry-leading growth this year. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry."

Essentially, how we do acquisitions, if you'll",694,"Jeff, it's Rick. So I'll take a guess all of those questions. So as it relates to the valuation, I would say it had nothing to do with what their prior round valuation was. That's not how we do acquisitions. Essentially, how we do acquisitions, if you'll recall this from the Pharmacyclics discussion that we have, and I think it's typical within our industry how it's done as you build the model, that ultimately projects out what you think of the company and assets can do. And then off of that model, you determine what the return would look like at various price points, what the NPV would look like and ultimately, yes, the threshold -- what we we do it is we have a threshold, which we say we want go above, and that will begin the process and ultimately try to validate this assumption to make a decision as to whether or not you want to go forward if you want to go forward we'll negotiate as hard as we can to try to get to the lowest possible price, but most of these are competitive situation. So what I would tell you about this transaction is that I believe it is at a very good valuation for us. It has a good NPV based on the base case, which was essentially on second- and the third-line small cell lung cancer and a couple of other indications. And it has significant upside if we move to first line or, more broadly, across those cancers that are DLL3 positive. None of those trials are ongoing, so we don't have that data so we do necessarily build all those in. If that were to occur, you the CDR for full first line that the investors would receive but I would tell you first line will have a very, very strong NPV above and beyond what you factored in here. But with the base case, this has a very good NPV and a very good IRR, so I could just tell you we feel good about the valuation.
As far as the data is concerned, we have seen a significant amount of data above and beyond what is public now. We obviously need to be careful about what we talk about because some of that data will be presented at the ASCO meeting. I think we've given a pretty good idea of what you're likely to see at the ASCO meeting, but I can tell you that we have seen all the data that was available to the management team, and we are impressed with that data. So I can tell you I'm very, very excited. We look for quite some time now for a solid tumor platform play, and they're hard to find in this market. And I think if you look at the productivity of this group and of the novel therapeutic targets that they have been able to come up with and their hit rate on those targets is significantly above industry average. And the way they approach it is pretty impressive and the fact this is focusing, to a great extent, on cancer stem cells. I think there's a strong belief that if you can knock out certain cancer stem cells, you can dramatically impact the course of that disease for those patients. And I think the data will speak for itself when it's available, and you can take a look at it. So we are impressed with those I think we think Rova-T is a very good asset and gives us a good strong position in solid tumors going forward. On the ITRs, as we said before, we're not going to talk a lot about the process now that we're in litigation. I can answer maybe 1 or 2 of these questions. We don't have the ability to predict the timing. You have the date correct that you described, so it should occur sometime no later than that date. We don't know whether it will be consolidated or not, and we're not going to comment on the issuance of the patent and what we would do in that scenario. Okay?"

They have developed great expertise, and they are out in the lead in all of the areas that they're pursuing. So DLL3 is out in the lead. It's demonstrated very compelling results, and we think it's an asset that has tremendous promise and really change the standard of care. And I think if you look at all of the programs, that Stemcentrx is advancing, there's a high degree of novelty and very strong signs of activity from the first 3 clinical programs.

The only thing I'd add on the -- I know what you're trying to do. You're obviously trying to model or incorporate into your model what the R&D impact will be on 2017. I think that's what you're trying to do based on your question. And",537,"Chris, this is Rick. The only thing I'd add on the -- I know what you're trying to do. You're obviously trying to model or incorporate into your model what the R&D impact will be on 2017. I think that's what you're trying to do based on your question. And I'd say as we factored in this number and as we look at 2017, it certainly incorporates the assumptions that we've made around the expansion into other tumors that are DLL3 positive. It incorporates what Mike described as the first-line trials that ultimately they're pursuing with Rova-T. The one part that it probably does not include at this point, we just need to work on it some more would be -- we also believe that this could be a synergistic strategy in first-line with immunotherapy. And they have walked us through a plan where potentially, as an example, Rova-T could be a highly specific debulking agent on the front end for DLL3 positive patients in small cell and knocking out the stem cells in the process, which traditional chemotherapy does not do today, and then you would get the disease under control and debulk and you follow it with immunotherapy for a longer-term maintenance. And so they've laid out some plans around that, and that has not been incorporated to this point. So that will be the only thing now. Now we obviously have a significant R&D budget that we would look at. How we normally do R&D, we had everything up and you make a decision to rejoin the line and we're going to be conscious of that's not tell you that will be incremental, but what I'm telling you is that's the one thing that's outside the scope of what's in the current R&D production. So hopefully, that gives you some clarity around that. On the M&A front, similar to the comments I made earlier, we have been looking for a solid tumor platform. I think we made that somewhat clear that, that was something we're interested in doing. I would say this came in at a valuation significantly below the numbers we have flagged before, but we are looking to balance near-term performance against making sure that we build a significant portfolio of assets out in that 2020 and beyond period that can contribute to delivering strong EPS growth and strong revenue growth. But I'd say where we are right now is we have a lot of things going right now, and we still have a lot of the needs that we have, and so I would not expect to that we would go out into another significant transaction. And obviously, Pharmacyclics is a significant transaction, but I'm talking about a transaction of this size. So I think for the next certainly 18 months or so, if we were to do anything it would probably be more of a BI kind of transaction, more of a single asset, might be in licensing kind of a transaction. And I think based on the fact that we have delivered some level of dilution here, we would have to be in a position where we would absorb the dilution going forward. So hopefully that answers your question."

Clearly, the whole sort of stem cell base focus has been fraught with challenges, and I was wondering maybe if you could reply to the specific questions.

And I was also curious to know how Stemcentrx's ADC technology differs from other ADC players? And then a follow up question, I'm sorry about this, but just a follow-up on an earlier question. If you could kind of play out the scenario of the upcoming IPO, which investors are obviously highly focused on, what is the right analytical framework, Rick, that we should think about this in the event of that day, that a, the IPRS or it dismiss just in relation to the overall IP picture in duration of HUMIRA?"

I will take the first of those, and then Rick may want to add some follow-up. So with respect to cancer stem cells, what I would say is we've had a fair amount of time to get very comfortable with the platform that Stemcentrx has developed, and we believe that they are doing something really novel here. In terms of understanding how models might translate into human clinical trials or ultimately clinical benefit, we certainly recognize that, that translational leap is often fraught with peril. But in this case, we don't have to wonder. We've seen the first 3 assets move into the clinic showing strong activity. And so they have demonstrated with their first 3 clinical assets activity in small cell lung cancer, triple negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer. So there are human data to back up their hypothesis, not only onetime but 3x in a row. And obviously, being right 3x in a row in this business doesn't happen by chance very often. So with respect to our confidence that small cell lung cancer will transfer to other cancers, the set of cancers that we're talking about all share neuro endocrine features as the small cell, and Stemcentrx has done a large amount of work to understand the role that DLL3 plays biologically in these tumors. And we know based on the work that they have done that DLL3 is playing the same role across these tumors, and so that's why we have much greater-than-average confidence than what we're seeing in those preclinical studies and other tumors will translate into the basket study that they are running.
So as Rick said, we've seen a lot of data here, and we feel very good about this opportunity. With respect to the ADC landscape, Stemcentrx has shown that they are very good at generating highly selective monoclonal antibodies that make good reagents for ADCs, and they also have the technology and the toxin technology all fully integrated within their company to rapidly produce these ADCs. And again, I would say that their clinical track record speaks for itself.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Rick for the other questions."

At the end of 12 months, there would be a decision on the patent.

If not, then we have the right to appeal. So that's the process and I think that essentially defines sort of the implications of the process.

I'll take probably the first of those and maybe some part of the second, and I'll ask to chime in on the second part, and I'll take the Calico one for you. So I mean obviously, an important part of these kinds of companies is retaining the people. And particularly, when you think about this kind of a company where a lot of the intellectual property of the company is that, right, the intellectual horsepower of the people. And I would say we have been interacting with Stemcentrx now for a number of months, well before this process started. And so we've had a chance to get to know the team and get to know the leadership within the team, and they had a decision to make, right? They could've gone down the IPO route, they could've collaborated with somebody and gone down the IPO route if they wanted to. And I think based on the kind of asset they have in Rova-T, they certainly would've had -- even in the tough IPO market as it is today -- I think it would have had the ability to be able to do that or if they can do a transaction we ended up doing with them. And I think one of the deciding factors for them was what they're really good at and what they love doing is essentially going in and discovering novel markers and creating drugs. So going to the discovery and early development process and they demonstrated they can do that highly efficient and effective way, and they can do that very, very rapidly. If they went down to the IPO route, they had to do basically build the other infrastructures that the fully integrated business, including all the commercial and medical affairs and global clinical development groups in order to be able to execute a fully integrated strategy. And I think as they looked at that, I think they had confidence that they can do it, but it'd be a tremendous amount of effort on their part in their leadership team to be able to do that. When they look at coming together with us, they ultimately said, ""Look, we can do the part that we think we're great at, and we can plug in to what you already have for all those other things."" The global clinical development group that we have, the medical affairs group that we have all around the world, the commercial organization have all around the world, so I think they perceived it to be a win-win. So I think that's the first thing. Winning their hearts and their minds through that process was an important aspect of it. Second aspect of it was that obviously the CDRs, all of the leadership team and many of the employees have either ownership in the company or they have -- and they have stock options, right? So these CDRs are pretty important to them. They can extract a tremendous amount of value through that process if they deliver against those CD-Rs, and I can tell you that's a pretty healthy financial incentive for them to stay and execute against those. And I can tell you, in the interactions that I had with them -- we had with them, I should say, I can tell you that's an important point to him. Third thing is they wanted a stock transaction. They wanted it so much for tax purposes, but they also wanted it because they wanted to believe they could share in the upside, and some of what they agreed to do with their options only reinforce that, meaning, their Stemcentrx options and what they will become and how that value will be derived. And so I think there's a very high likelihood that we will retain the key people in this, and I think they like our culture, and they like the environment that they're operating in. And so I tell you, I have a fairly high level of confidence. And I think Pharmacyclics demonstrates, we have retained all of the key clinical development people, and I've spent time, Mike has spent time with the team, I think they're very, very happy being part of AbbVie, and they get to execute the strategy that they wanted as an independent company as well or better than they could as an independent company. So I feel pretty good about that, but it's an important point. On the Pfizer transaction, it's something we want to be careful with because I'm not sure what their confidentiality agreement is. Henry, you want to comment anything on it?"

And when you look at the individuals that Calico first started up with, Art and Hal and others, they've assembled a very talented team and that's -- that was the big reason that we ultimately decided to do something with them. But essentially, what we have is we co-fund a discovery effort to find new innovative targets in a number of different areas. Oncology is one of them. Disease aging is another. Neurodegenerative disease is another area that, ultimately, we have an interest in. And the way it works is essentially we can opt in on anything that's discovered that there, and the point at which we take it over, we have commercial rights to it and is basically a 50-50 profit-sharing arrangement between us and Calico.

We're advancing a number of programs but, of course, we do need to keep in mind that these are early-discovery programs that have been initiated in the last 12 to 18 months. So we intend to move very quickly, but it takes a bit of time before programs are ready for clinical introduction and sort of news flow that you would expect to hear in this sort of setting. So what I would say is the cultural fit is great. We made great progress building up a set of programs in the areas that Rick mentioned that I think are a very good fit for our overall strategy, and we remain very optimistic about of the Calico partnership."

I'll take VIEKIRA, and Bill can take the HUMIRA question, and we'll have Mike cover the ASCO question.
So VIEKIRA, let me start with Japan. Japan is continuing to track consistent with our expectations, so I think there's nothing all that remarkable in Japan. It's a good market. Our profile within that market is a good profile. The U.S. has certainly been more challenging. I would say that it's a combination of several factors, some volume losses as well as some price loss. As Merck has entered the market, we know that they set the list price lower than the other products in the marketplace. That strategy initially, I think, we interpreted as a strategy that we go after medical exceptions because medical exceptions historically are in at more of a list price point, and so they have the lowest price essentially on a medical exception basis, and they have been somewhat successful in gaining some of those medical exceptions. So that's part of the issue. The second part of the issue though is they have been more aggressive than we anticipated from a pricing standpoint, particularly in the public segments, the VA in particular. And as we look at that, we ultimately made the decision that we were not going to compete with the lowest overall price in the VA. We did adjust our price down, but we didn't adjust it down to the very lowest price, and that has caused us to obviously lose price but also lose volume, and we had a fairly significant share of VA. So I think it is those factors playing out. And I would say that based on where the U.S. is going, it is unlikely that we will achieve the $2 billion member that we described earlier. I think a number that you should be thinking about now is more in the 1 6 range globally I'm talking about. And you can look at this quarter as an example even though VIEKIRA was weaker than we expected, we obviously beat our EPS number and achieved our revenue numbers so it talks of the strength of the rest of the business. That's the nice thing about our business is we have good balanced performance across a number of different assets, and so when one thing doesn't go as well as we had hoped, then others can pick up the slack. So we will not be changing our guidance based on this. We factored that into our going-forward guidance in 2016, and we're comfortable with the guidance that we provided you, but those are the facts around VIEKIRA."

So if they take 1 asset and we move it through, when you take it to a registration study and we determined that, that asset in that indication would generate a commercial asset that had greater than $1 billion worth of revenue, then we would pay them $500 million. And then if you do a second one or a third one or a fourth one, they can get up to 4 $500 million milestones, so that's how the contingent payments are laid out. On the competitive dynamics, it was a competitive process. It was relatively blind to us, so we don't know what the other competitors were, but we do know there are other players that were involved, and I'd say it ended up being us and one other player at the very end who were competing for the asset through that process. And ultimately, as I told you, on that [indiscernible] what they said to you before. If you look at what we are paying in the base case for this asset, and we look at the base case for us without [indiscernible]as a significantly positive NPV and well above the threshold at which we look at the cutoff for IRRs, and so this is a transaction that we feel very comfortable from a financial standpoint. And we've obviously built in the upside for first-line because we don't have first-line right now, and we don't want to be in a position where we're paying for something that we didn't know what that is going to look like. We were very comfortable with the second and third line because we saw data supported that, human data that supported that. I do believe from everything I've seen, I think Mike and others believe, that there is a higher probability this asset will move into third line, but we are going to pursue aggressively and if they do, they will get the incremental or wanted to be will obviously get the incremental award of moving into that.

We think there's really tremendous potential for that asset. With respect to ABT-122, which is our IL-17 TNF DVD, we are going to be seeing mid-stage data internally in the middle of this year, so shortly. We'll probably be in a position to present that externally around the ACR time frame, and so we'll make a decision when we have those data. But what I can say is to move forward with those molecules, it would have to fit our strategy with that molecule with ABT-122. It would have to fit our strategy to raise the bar on the standard of care. So we would be looking for a differentiated efficacy compared to not only what we have in our own portfolio but what's available externally. And so we'll be making that decision later on this year. With respect to your question about our presence in lung cancer, we've said for quite some time that we want to build our presence in solid tumors. I think the Stemcentrx acquisition clearly does that. It gives us a broad platform as well as a very promising lead asset and other clinical assets behind that. And so we're going to continue to build on that presence, not only with the development engine that comes from Stemcentrx, but with our internal pipeline. And I think you'll see that we have a number of programs that could be applicable to lung cancer and other solid tumors that will be moving through the clinic shortly."

As far as of the model, obviously, we went through the model with some level of detail around Pharmacyclics. One, because of the magnitude of investment that we were making and we described what supported that investment and highly built-up the model. What I characterized for you already basically tells you how we built of this model, right? It's built primarily around second and third line which we believe is small cell, which we believe will have successfully, which as you can imagine we risk-adjusted it accordingly at a high probability of success. It does have a couple of other smaller indications where we believe there's a very high probability of being able to extend it into some of these other cancers that we described. I wouldn't say that has a significant impact, and those are risk-adjusted accordingly. It doesn't have first-line in it and the milestone or the CBR is basically driven off of what we think the value would be and the return would be appropriate for first-line, and it doesn't have any other of these other milestone-driven POCs that would come forward. So I think that's roughly the same kind of guidance we gave share and some other kinds of things. And we've obviously build the model around those same kinds of assumptions, but I think in this case, we'll wait to provide that at a later date once we get closer to a launch of the asset in 2018. On the R&D line or I think really what you're asking is are we still committed to delivering 50% or greater in 2020, and the short answer to that is yes. We've looked at it, we carefully looked at the commitments we made around the compounded growth rate and the revenue projections as well as the operating margin profile that we communicated last year, and we're still absolutely committed to delivering against that."

I mean, first of all, if you look at the guidance we provided back in, I think, it was October 29 of last year and you look at what happened to the consensus numbers, what you'll see is they shifted out roughly a year. I think the mean now is probably you look at where people are assuming biosimilar impact in the United States, it's probably in that 2019 -- Larry, correct me if I'm wrong here, a 2019 time frame moved out from about 17 to 2019. And I'd say, one of the things we track to try to understand how the market is proceeding that guidance is we track what our stock performance has been versus our peers over that period of time. And I saw it just the other day I made a change in the last couple of days a little bit, but we're the #1 performing stock since that point in time. So I think it was around 14% appreciation or something like 15% appreciation. So I think it did have a positive impact. Having said that, I would agree with your point that there's still this overhang, and this overhang is built around different catalysts. As we've said before, we've given a lot of clarity in that review of what our IP strategy is and the confidence that we have in our IP strategy. How the market will relate to that, that's a little harder for me to describe or predict, I'd say. But certainly, I think, as it plays out, I think the market will basically start to better understand what our position is. And certainly, as you have more confidence around of that, I think you will see the sentiment change. I think the bigger issue, and I think Rova-T and IL-23 are 2 good examples. Look, we obviously have a point of view of what we think is going to happen. We've communicated what that point of view looks like, I think, in very clear terms. That doesn't mean that everybody believes that point of view. But what I'd say is if you look at even the bare case on HUMIRA, which we certainly don't agree with and you look at this pipeline that we now assembled of assets that have a very high probability of success, I think even in the most bare case possible, most people would look at that pipeline and say, ""They should be able to grow through whatever happens."" Now obviously, we have a different view of what we think is going to happen, but even if you look at as the models I've looked at that have the worst case build into them when I look at our pipeline and the probability of success of those assets I described in my formal remarks and use that risk-adjust based on the data you've seen and the commercial success you would expect from those assets, I think a reasonable person would draw the conclusion that you can grow through that.

This morning, I'll discuss our first quarter performance and provide an overview of the Stemcentrx acquisition, which we announced earlier today. Mike will provide updates on recent advancements across our R&D programs, and Bill will discuss the quarter and our 2016 guidance in more detail, including the financial aspects of Stemcentrx transaction. And as always, following our remarks, we'll take your questions.
We delivered another strong quarterly performance, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.15, representing growth of more than 22% versus the first quarter 2015. Our results included strong operational sales growth of 22.4%, driven by a number of products across our portfolio. This includes HUMIRA global operational growth of more than 19%, strong growth from IMBRUVICA, continued global update of VIEKIRA and strong performance from several other products in our portfolio, including Creon and Duodopa. We also continued to deliver improvements in our operating margin profile. In addition to our strong financial results, we also advanced several of our key strategic priorities. Late in the quarter, we secured FDA approval for IMBRUVICA as a first-line treatment for patients with CLL. We're roughly 1 month into our first-line launch, and we're pleased with our progress, to date. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, recently published an updated view of this guidelines granting IMBRUVICA a category 1 recommendation for certain CLL patients, the highest recommendation assigned by the organization.
We are also approaching the 1-year mark for Pharmacyclics, and we continue to be very pleased with the progress we've made today. The Pharmacyclics team continues to rapidly advance trial activity, exploring IMBRUVICA across a broad range of tumor types. IMBRUVICA offers significant growth potential through its expanding list of indications and lines of therapy, and we remain excited about the vast potential for this unique asset.
Earlier this month, we received FDA approval for another transformative therapy for the treatment of CLL. Venclexta, our novel BCL-2 inhibitor was approved for patients with relapsed refractory CLL who harbor the 17p deletion, a difficult-to-treat form of the disease, typically associated with poor prognosis. Based on the level of efficacy in this patient population, the FDA granted the approval under its breakthrough therapy and priority review designations. Since the beginning of the year, we've also reported compelling data from several development programs, including positive top line results from our second pivotal elagolix trial in endometriosis and strong data from our next-generation HCV program. Mike will provide updates on both programs during his remarks in just a few moments. We also augmented our pipeline with a late-stage asset with a global collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim to develop and commercialize an anti-IL-23, currently in Phase III development for psoriasis and mid-stage development for several additional indications. The agreement provides AbbVie with another potential best-in-class late-stage asset, adding to our immunology pipeline, which [indiscernible] 494 currently in Phase III development for RA as well as several other Biologics that are in mid-stage trials. Based on its potential for best-in-class efficacy, we believe the BI asset to generate multibillion dollars in peak year revenues across several immune-mediated diseases.
Clearly, the most notable and exciting news today is our planned acquisition of Stemcentrx. We could not be more pleased to have this talented group of individuals join our organization. We have been tremendously impressed with their accomplishments to-date, and their innovation and expertise will drive strong benefits for AbbVie going forward. The addition of Stemcentrx is a strategically compelling opportunity for our company, our shareholders and the patients which we serve. Over the past several years, we've taken a number of steps to build and strengthen our position in oncology research and development, with the objective of becoming a leading oncology company. We've advanced numerous promising pipeline assets, including our BCL-2 inhibitor for blood cancers and our PARP-inhibitor and anti-EGFR antibody drug conjugate in development for solid tumors. We've strengthened our discovery efforts through collaborations with leading academic and other institutions around the world. We've added top talent to our [indiscernible] organization. Last year, through the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, we obtained IMBRUVICA, a first-in-class BTK inhibitor, which has already achieved blockbuster status and is on a trajectory to achieve multibillion-dollar peak year sales.
And as I mentioned earlier, we just launched our internally developed Venclexta, which adds another transformational therapy to our hematological oncology franchise. We view oncology as a significant pillar of growth for AbbVie going forward. And as we evaluate all opportunities, we do so with a desire to balance near-term performance by continuing to build the portfolio of assets that will generate strong growth in 2020 and beyond, supporting our commitment to drive top-tier performance over the long term.
So that brings me to our announcement today, the acquisition of Stemcentrx, which gives AbbVie a highly attractive platform for solid tumors and extremely exciting late-stage assets in Rova-T. The transaction enables AbbVie to further expand and accelerate our presence in oncology, building upon our growing position in hematological oncology. Stemcentrx proprietary solid tumor platform leverages cancer stem cell biology to identify and validate novel therapeutic targets. The company has demonstrated a track record of successfully engineering and manufacturing antibodies and antibody drug conjugates for those targets.
Stemcentrx lead asset is Rova-T, a DLL3-targeted antibody drug conjugate. DLL3 is a novel target expressed in several tumor types, including small cell lung cancer, an aggressive and difficult-to-treat disease. Small cell lung cancer accounts for roughly 15% of all lung cancers, and more than 60,000 patients are diagnosed annually in the major developed markets. DLL3 is the first predictive biomarker associated with drug efficacy in small cell lung cancer. It is highly expressed in a majority of small cell lung cancer tumors as well as cancer stem cells and is not expressed in normal tissue. Predictive biomarkers help identify which patients have the potential to benefit from a therapy. Rova-T is currently in registrational trials for third-line small cell lung cancer. There is a significant unmet need for this patient population as the treatment landscape is not changed for several decades. In fact, there is current only one approved treatment for second-line small cell lung cancer and no approved agents for third-line use. The 5-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with this type of cancer is unfortunately very low, at approximately 6%. Last year, the European Society of Medical Oncology meeting, Stemcentrx presented exciting Phase II results in small cell lung cancer, including data that illustrated an overall response rate of 44% in a DLL3 biomarker-defined population. Rova-T also demonstrated a clinical benefit rate of 78% in this refractory and difficult-to-treat set of patients. Response rates were similar in third-line and second-line patients with a manageable safety profile. These landmark data represents the first time a biomarker-targeted therapy has shown significant efficacy in small cell lung cancer. Additional data from a broader set of patients and longer-term follow-up, including compelling overall survival results will be disclosed during an oral session at the upcoming ASCO meeting in June, where the abstract has been selected as a Best of ASCO presentation, a distinction only 1% of abstracts receive. Given the very promising efficacy in third-line small cell lung cancer, Stemcentrx recently filed for FDA breakthrough designation for this setting. Based on a compelling data and a significant unmet need in this patient population, we are certainly hopeful that we will be successful in obtaining this status. Stemcentrx has moved rapidly through clinical development in third-line small cell lung cancer, from the initiation of the first in human trials to the recent start of the registration-enabling study. Based on the expected completion of the ongoing registrational trial, commercialization of this indication is expected in 2018. Stemcentrx is also moving to rapidly advance in the front-line small cell lung cancer. Mike will provide more detail on the planned first-line program in just a few moments.
Like HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, we believe Rova-T has the potential applicability across the broad range of indications and tumors. In addition, the small cell lung cancer expression of DLL3 indicates Rova-T may be useful across multiple solid tumor types, including metastatic melanoma, glioblastoma multiforme as well as some prostate, pancreatic and colorectal cancers among others. There is a significant subset of patients whose tumors are positive for DLL3 expression within this broader set of tumors, representing more than 65,000 patients treated annually. We plan to evaluate Rova-T across numerous indications, leveraging our R&D infrastructure and global clinical trial organization to move rapidly and efficiently.
The acquisition of Stemcentrx also broadens AbbVie's oncology pipeline with a portfolio of earlier-stage candidates focused on novel oncology targets. In addition to Rova-T, the Stemcentrx pipeline includes 4 clinical candidates being evaluated in trials across a range of solid tumors as well as 2 additional INDs for new targets planned for 2016 and a broad portfolio of validated preclinical targets.
Stemcentrx also enhances AbbVie's oncology discovery capabilities. The technology platform that identified Rova-T and the other assets in the Stemcentrx pipeline has strong potential for continued asset generation and will strengthen AbbVie's discovery and development efforts in solid tumors going forward.
So as we summarize the transaction, the addition of Stemcentrx is strategically compelling. The acquisition is highly complementary with our growing hematological oncology franchise and existing portfolio of solid tumor assets. The lead asset, Rova-T, represents a multibillion-dollar peak revenue opportunity, with revenue potentially approaching $5 billion as we advance in the first-line small cell lung cancer and other indications. Rova-T has the potential to have a dramatic impact on our growth over the long term. Additionally, Stemcentrx existing pipeline of additional assets in their R&D engine will augment our future development efforts in solid tumors. Stemcentrx adds to AbbVie's long-term growth prospects, providing another compelling growth platform that will further diversify our revenue base beginning in 2018 and will enhance our EPS growth starting in 2020 and beyond. Stemcentrx fits well within our overall strategy. We have now assembled a significant number of late-stage assets, which have been significantly derisked to have multibillion-dollar potential and the potential to drive sustainable growth in 2020 and beyond. Assets including IMBRUVICA, Venclexta, ABT-494, Zinbryta, elagolix, the next-generation HCV combination, our recently licensed [ph] anti-IL-23 and now Rova-T, all of these assets have a high probability of regulatory and commercial success.
In closing, we continue to be pleased with our strong execution and strategic advancement. We continue to demonstrate an exceptional track record of success with positive clinical data and regulatory outcomes, and we look forward to additional important pipeline milestones in the year ahead. We're off to a strong start this year, and we intend to build upon our momentum to drive a high level of performance across their operations and deliver strong growth in 2016, and we remain committed to delivering on long-term objectives that we outlined last year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D program. Mike?"

We had a very productive first quarter from an R&D perspective with a number of important data readouts, phase transitions and regulatory approvals as well as licensing activity. This morning, I will provide color on some of the key highlights.
I'll start by saying that I certainly share Rick's enthusiasm for Stemcentrx, which brings us a promising late-stage program with Rova-T, a pipeline of earlier stage candidates and a platform technology that will enhance our future solid tumor discovery and development efforts. We very much enjoyed our dialogue with the Stemcentrx team as we've gotten to know them over the past several months, and we've been impressed with the individuals and the innovative platform they built.
Stemcentrx has established an impressive track record. The company's first 3 clinical stage drugs each represent novel targets with single-agent activity demonstrated in early phase trials in small cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer, all difficult-to-treat solid tumor indications. Stemcentrx's highly productive discovery effort is driven by the company's core technology, which utilizes a library of more than 700 patient-derived tumor xenograft models and leverages cancer stem cell biology to identify and validate therapeutic targets that would be overlooked by other methods. This platform has yielded impressive results today, and we are excited about the potential for continued asset generation, which will aid AbbVie in our R&D efforts going forward. The company's lead asset, Rova-T, represents a significant opportunity, not only through its lead indication, third-line small cell lung cancer, but also through the potential for expansion into the front-line setting as well as other types of cancer where DLL3 plays an important role. Stemcentrx has a broad development program for Rova-T currently underway. We've been impressed with the speed with which Stemcentrx has moved through the clinic. It's been roughly 4.5 years since target identification and less than 3 years between filing the Rova-T IND to the initiation of the registration study in third-line small cell lung cancer. The confirmatory third-line trial, which is called Trinity, began in January and is expected to complete enrollment by the end of 2016 with commercialization expected in 2018. We view the Rova-T small cell lung cancer program as significantly derisked with a high probability of success. In addition to the overall response data presented at ESMO last year, which showed an overall response rate of 44% in DLL3-positive patients, the profile of Rova-T is supported by longer-term data, some of which will be presented at the upcoming ASCO meeting. These updated data include promising overall survival findings that compared favorably to historical controls. We believe the full body of data generates -- generated today are highly compelling and strongly support the value proposition of Rova-T.
Stemcentrx is also moving rapidly into front-line small cell lung cancer with Rova-T. The company is on the cusp of initiating a study designed to select the optimal regimen for the front-line registrational program. This 4-arm trial will evaluate several permutations of Rova-T and standard of care chemotherapy, including both monotherapy and combination arms. Given the compelling data we've seen in small cell lung cancer to-date, we believe there is a high likelihood of successfully moving into earlier lines of therapy.
Stemcentrx is also evaluating an 8-arm 400-patient basket study, which will look at Rova-T as monotherapy in patients with a range of tumor types that share neuroendocrine features, including malignant melanoma, medullary thyroid cancer, glioblastoma, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and forms of prostate cancer and other solid tumors. This study is on track to start enrolling patients this quarter.
Additional first-line studies are planned, including a Phase I study to assess the safety of Rova-T in combination with anti-body therapy targeting the PD-1 PDL-1 access, which is on track to be initiated during the second half of 2016. Clearly, prior to the Stemcentrx acquisition, AbbVie was already focused on establishing a strong position in oncology. Since the company was established in 2013, we've added 10 new oncology assets through internal advancement or partnership efforts. The Stemcentrx acquisition accelerates our objective of becoming a leading oncology company. We look forward to spending more time discussing Stemcentrx, including their pipeline, at our upcoming R&D Day in June.
In addition to the Stemcentrx's acquisition, last week, we also announced 2 early-stage oncology collaborations, including an agreement with Argenx for a novel immuno-oncology target, GARP, and an agreement with CytomX to develop Probody drug conjugates, a platform which provides another differentiated opportunity to combine with our strength in antibody drug conjugates. Beyond oncology, as Rick noted, we also recently entered into a global agreement with BI to develop and commercialize risankizumab, an anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, in Phase III development for psoriasis and mid-stage development for several additional indications.
The collaboration of physicians is promising asset as AbbVie has lead investigational compound in psoriasis and complements a robust immunology pipeline. Recent Phase II study results for risankizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis showed improved efficacy of Stelara, a commonly used treatment for this life-impacting skin condition that was included in the study as an active comparator. Specifically, the strong head-to-head results showed that at 12 weeks, 81% of patients treated with 180 milligrams of the BI compound achieved PASI 90, more than doubled the rate achieved by patients treated with Stelara. In 50% of the patients treated with the BI compound, achieved complete skin clearance or PASI 100 versus just 17.5% of the Stelara-treated patients. We're pleased with this level of efficacy as our immunology development strategy is centered upon identifying treatments that offer differentiated profiles relative to currently available therapies, with a goal of continuing to raise the standard of care. Beyond the impressive efficacy, this asset also has the potential to offer a favorable dosing profile with subcutaneous quarterly administration.
The BI compound is also currently in Phase II development for psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease with plans to initiate a Phase IIb study in psoriatic arthritis in mid-2016 and the potential to transition into Phase III development in Crohn's disease next year. We will present mid-stage Crohn's disease induction data at the upcoming Digestive Disease Week, or DDW, meeting next month. We've also disclosed positive results for several late-stage programs, including most recently additional data on next-generation HCV regimen. Earlier this month at The International Liver Congress in Barcelona, we presented data on our pan-genotypic once-daily ribavirin-free combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in patients with genotypes 1 through 6, including data on treatment durations as short as 8 weeks. The data illustrate that with 8 weeks of treatment, 97% to 98% of genotype-1 through 3 patients without cirrhosis achieved sustained virologic response at 12 weeks posttreatment. Additionally, 100% of genotype 4 through 6 patients without cirrhosis achieved SVR 12 with 12 weeks of treatment. We also presented late-breaking data showing our next-generation combination drug 100% SVR 12 with 12 weeks of treatment without ribavirin in treatment-naïve genotype 3 patients with compensated cirrhosis. While recent advancements in HCV treatment have resulted in high cure rates for many patients, there remained distinct areas of unmet need, including patients with genotype 3. These new data illustrate the potential of our next-generation combination to address this need.
Another area of unmet need is patients who have failed previous therapy with direct-acting antivirals, or DAA, as retreatment options for these patients are limited. We presented data showing that 95% of genotype 1 patients, who failed previous therapy with DAAs, achieved SVR 12 with 12 weeks of therapy without the need for ribavirin. The mid-stage data, we disclosed to-date, indicate that our new HCV combination can deliver cure rates approaching 100%, and we believe the majority of patients will be well served with an 8-week treatment option. We expect to see results from the pivotal studies in the second half of this year, and we remain on track for commercialization next year. We also announced positive top line results from the second of 2 replicate pivotal Phase III clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of elagolix in premenopausal women who suffer pain from endometriosis. Trial results show that after 6 months of continuous treatment, both doses of elagolix met the study's co-primary endpoints, with elagolix reducing scores of menstrual pain and non-menstrual pelvic pain in month 3 and month 6. We intend to present detailed results from both Phase III trials in a medical conference later this year, and we will complete the clinical database in anticipation of a new drug application submission for endometriosis in 2017. We also continue to advance the elagolix development program in uterine fibroids. During the quarter, we initiated a Phase III program investigating the effect of elagolix on heavy bleeding related to this highly prevalent condition. As Rick noted, we received 2 important approvals within our hematologic oncology portfolio as well. The expansion of the IMBRUVICA label into first-line use for CLL and the initial approval of our novel BCL-2 inhibitor, Venclexta. With IMBRUVICA and Venclexta, we now have 2 therapies on the market for the treatment of CLL, addressing a range of patient types.
We continue to advance our development efforts for IMBRUVICA, Venclexta and several other assets in our oncology pipeline. We'll present data across a wide range of studies at the upcoming ASCO meeting. We built a strategic portfolio of oncology assets, including multiple mechanisms of action that have significant potential alone and in combination.
So in summary, we continue to make significant progress with our pipeline and are on track for further advancements in 2016. We have a broad pipeline that includes more than 50 active clinical assets, including more than 20 new products or indications in late-stage development or under regulatory review. We look forward to covering our full pipeline in more detail at our R&D pipeline review to be held in Chicago on June 3. We hope you will join us.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our first quarter performance. Bill?"
141885706,330346085,966764,"AbbVie Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","AbbVie Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mike.

As Rick said, we are very pleased with a strong quarter we delivered. Net revenues were up 22.4% operationally, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin profile by 300 basis points to 43.1% of sales. We reported adjusted earnings per share results of $1.15, up 22.3% over the first quarter of 2015. Strong operational revenue growth in the quarter was in line with our guidance for growth of just above 20%. Foreign exchange had a negative 4.2% impact on revenue in the quarter, also in line with our guidance of roughly 4% negative exchange.
We continue to see strong momentum for HUMIRA, which delivered global sales of more than $3.5 billion, up 19.2% operationally, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales were nearly $2.2 billion, reflecting exceptional growth across all 3 major categories: rheumatology, gastro and derm. Internationally, HUMIRA sales were nearly $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4.6% on an operational basis, excluding an unfavorable impact from exchange. This exceeded our previous forecast of 3% operational growth. Currency reduced reported international HUMIRA sales by 9.2%, while early in the launch, the Enbrel biosimilar is tracking in line or favorable to what we had modeled.
Global IMBRUVICA net revenues were $381 million in the quarter. U.S. sales were $325 million, and our international profit-sharing was $56 million. Global VIEKIRA sales in the quarter were $414 million. The launch of VIEKIRAX, our 2-drug once-daily ribavirin-free combination for patients with HCV genotype 1b, is underway in Japan, leading to a continued higher mix of international sales in the quarter. Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 36.7% on an operational basis in the quarter. We saw continued double-digit growth internationally for Duodopa with a modest level of U.S. sales as expected.
Global Creon sales were $150 million, up 18.2% operationally. Creon continues to maintain its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market with the majority of the market share.
The adjusted gross margin ratio was 81.3% of sales in the first quarter, which was impacted by the Pharmacyclics transaction and year-over-year impacts of foreign exchange. Excluding these impacts, the ratio was up over 200 basis points.
As I mentioned earlier, we continue to show improvement in our adjusted operating margin profile, which increased to 43.1% of sales, up 300 basis points. Excluding the impact of Pharmacyclics in foreign exchange, operating margin improved over 600 basis points versus the prior year quarter. The majority of this improvement was driven by efficiencies and our rapidly growing top line.
Adjusted R&D was 15.6% of sales, reflecting funding actions in support of our pipeline assets. Adjusted SG&A was 22.6% of sales in the first quarter, down significantly from the prior year on a profile basis, contributing to a continued improvement in operating margin leverage. Adjusted net interest expense was $200 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 20.7% in the quarter.
First quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding noncash intangible amortization expense and specified items, were $1.15, up 22.3% year-over-year.
During the quarter, as a result of the economic conditions in Venezuela and the lack of availability of U.S. dollars at the government's official exchange rate, we changed the exchange rate we use in Venezuela to the floating DICOM rate. This resulted in a charge of $298 million related to a devaluation of our net monetary assets in Venezuela. This will also impact revenue book for products sold in Venezuela.
I would like to now walk you through the financial aspects of the Stemcentrx transaction. We are acquiring Stemcentrx for $5.8 billion with the consideration be paid out as $3.8 billion in equity and $2 billion in cash. The use of equity in this transaction reflects Stemcentrx management and Board of Directors desire to retain a stake in the asset as well as achieve a tax-deferred structure. Upon closing, we plan to execute an accelerated share repurchase program to reacquire all of the newly issued equity. We anticipate the transaction to close late in the second quarter. We are forecasting $0.20 of dilution in 2016 as a result of the transaction, which represents a half year of R&D, operating and interest expense. We plan to provide specifics on Stemcentrx's impact on our P&L profile during the second quarter earnings call in July. We expect the transaction to generate positive operating margin beginning in 2019 and EPS accretion starting in 2020. Given these facts, we are updating our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $4.62 to $4.82 to reflect the Stemcentrx transaction. This range reflects EPS growth of 10% at the midpoint and includes the previously communicated $0.08 diluted impact of the BI collaboration announced last month. It excludes $0.75 of intangible amortization and specified costs. Specified items related to the Stemcentrx acquisition will be quantified and included on our second quarter call.
Regarding the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.19 to $1.21. This excludes roughly $0.18 of specified items and noncash amortization and includes the BI and Stemcentrx dilution impacts.
We are expecting mid-teens operational sales growth, excluding a roughly 2% negative foreign exchange impact on the quarter. As a result, we are expecting low teens sales growth on a reported basis. We are forecasting 3% operational growth for international HUMIRA in the second quarter. Excluding Venezuela, this growth would've exceeded 5%. We currently expect a negative 4% currency impact on international HUMIRA in the second quarter, resulting in a modest decline year-over-year on a reported basis. However, we remain on track with our previously communicated full year guidance for HUMIRA outside the U.S, including the mid-single-digit operational growth expected internationally.
So in conclusion, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter as we've driven strong top and bottom line growth and delivered operating margin expansion while also advancing on our strategic priorities. This puts us in a strong position to continue delivering industry-leading growth this year.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry."

So as it relates to the valuation, I would say it had nothing to do with what their prior round valuation was. That's not how we do acquisitions. Essentially, how we do acquisitions, and you",705,"Jeff, it's Rick. So I'll take, I guess, all of those questions. So as it relates to the valuation, I would say it had nothing to do with what their prior round valuation was. That's not how we do acquisitions. Essentially, how we do acquisitions, and you probably recall this from the Pharmacyclics discussion that we had, and I think it's typical within our industry how it's done, is you build a model that ultimately projects out what you think the company and assets can do, and then off of that model, you determine what the return would look like at various price points, what the NPV would look like and ultimately, yes, the threshold at which -- the way we do it. We have a threshold at which we say we won't go above. And then, we get into the process and ultimately try to validate those assumptions and make a decision as to whether or not we want to go forward, and if you want to go forward, then we'll obviously negotiate as hard as we can to try to get to the lowest possible price, but most of these are a competitive kind of situation. So what I would tell you about this transaction is that I believe it is at a very good valuation for us. It has a good NPV, based on the base case, which was essentially on second- and third-line small cell lung cancer and a couple of other indications. And it has significant upside if we move to first line or more broadly across those cancers that are DLL3-positive. Now those trials are ongoing, so we don't have that data, so we didn't necessarily build all of those in. If that were to occur, you probably saw it as a CDR for first line that the investors would receive, but I would tell first line will have a very, very strong NPV above and beyond what we factored in here. But with the base case, this has a very good NPV and a very good IRR, so I can just tell you I feel good about the valuation.
As far as the data is concerned, we have seen a significant amount of data above and beyond what is public now. We obviously need to be careful about what we talk about because some of that data will be presented at the ASCO meeting. I think we've given you a pretty good idea of what you're likely to see at the ASCO meeting, but I can tell you that we have seen all the data that was available to the management team, and we are impressed with that data. So I can tell you I'm very, very excited. We've looked for quite some time now for a solid tumor platform play, and they're hard to find in this market. And I think if you look at the productivity of this group and the novel therapeutic target that they have been able to come up with and their hit rate on those targets is significantly above industry average. And the way they approach it is pretty impressive, and the fact that this is focusing to a great extent on cancer stem cells. I think there's a strong belief that if you can knock out certain cancer stem cells, you can dramatically impact the course of that disease for those patients. And I think the data will speak for itself when it's available, and you can take a look at it. So we are impressed with those I think. We think Rova-T is a very good asset and gives us a good strong position in solid tumors going forward. On the IPRs, as we said before, we're not going to talk a lot about the process now that we're in litigation. I can answer maybe 1 or 2 of these questions. We don't have the ability to predict the timing. You have the date correct, that you described. So it should occur some time no later than that date. We don't know whether it will be consolidated or not, and we're not going to comment on the issuance of the patent and what we would do in that scenario. Okay?"

They have developed great expertise, and they are out in the lead in all of the areas that they're pursuing. So DLL3 is out in the lead. It's demonstrated very compelling results, and we think it's an asset that has tremendous promise and will really change the standard of care. And I think if you look at all of the programs, that Stemcentrx is advancing, there's a high degree of novelty and very strong signs of activity from the first 3 clinical programs. So we feel very good about their position in the competitive environment."

What's nice about this transaction though is in 2018, we're going to be bringing the product to market. And we think given the clinical data that has been shown so far, we're going to have a fairly impressive uptake on Rova-T, and that will offset that dilution pretty quickly.

The only thing I'd add on the -- I know what you're trying to do. You're obviously trying to model or incorporate into your model what the R&D impact will be on 2017. I think that's what you're trying to do based on your question. And",545,"Chris, this is Rick. The only thing I'd add on the -- I know what you're trying to do. You're obviously trying to model or incorporate into your model what the R&D impact will be on 2017. I think that's what you're trying to do based on your question. And I'd say as we factored in this number and as we look at 2017, it certainly incorporates the assumptions that we've made around the expansion into other tumors that are DLL3-positive. It incorporates what Mike described as the first-line trials that ultimately they're pursuing with Rova-T. The one part that it probably does not include at this point, we just need to work on it some more would be -- we also believe that this could be a synergistic strategy in first-line with immunotherapy. And they have walked us through a plan where potentially, as an example, Rova-T could be a highly specific debulking agent on the front end for DLL3-positive patients in small cell and knocking out the stem cells in the process, which traditional chemotherapy does not do today, and then you would get the disease under control and debulked and you would follow it, with immunotherapy for a longer-term maintenance. And so they've laid out some plans around that, and that has not been incorporated to this point. So that would be the only thing. Now we obviously have a significant R&D budget, and we would look at it. How we normally do R&D is we add everything up and then we make a decision where we draw the line. And we're going to be conscious of that, so I'm not telling you that would be incremental, but what I'm telling you is that's the one thing that's outside the scope of what's in the current R&D production. So hopefully, that gives you some clarity around that. On the M&A front, similar to the comments I made earlier, we have been looking for a solid tumor platform. I think we made that somewhat clear that, that was something we're interested in doing. I would say this came in at a valuation that was significantly below the numbers that we had flagged before, but we are looking to balance near-term performance against making sure that we build a significant portfolio of assets out in that 2020 and beyond period that can contribute to delivering strong EPS growth and strong revenue growth. But I'd say where we are right now is we have a lot of things going right now, and we still have a lot of the needs that we have, and so I would not expect that we will go out and do another significant transaction. And obviously, Pharmacyclics is a significant transaction, but I'm talking about even a transaction of this size. So I think for the next certainly 18 months or so, if we were to do anything it would probably be more of a BI kind of transaction, more of a single asset, might be in licensing kind of a transaction. And I think based on the fact that we have delivered some level of dilution here, we would have to be in a position where we would absorb the dilution going forward. So hopefully that answers your question."

I will take the first of those, and then Rick may want to add some follow-up. So with respect to cancer stem cells, what I would say is we've had a fair amount of time to get very comfortable with the platform that Stemcentrx has developed, and we believe that they are doing something really novel here. In terms of understanding how mouse models might translate into human clinical trials or ultimately clinical benefit, we certainly recognize that, that translational leap is often fraught with peril. But in this case, we don't have to wonder. We've seen the first 3 assets move into the clinic showing strong activity. And so they have demonstrated with their first 3 clinical assets activity in small cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer. So there are human data to backup their hypothesis, not only onetime but 3 times in a row. And obviously, being right 3 times in a row in this business doesn't happen by chance very often. So with respect to our confidence that small cell lung cancer will transfer to other cancers, the set of cancers that we're talking about all share neuroendocrine features as the small cell, and Stemcentrx has done a large amount of work to understand the role that DLL3 plays biologically in these tumors. And we know based on the work that they have done that DLL3 is playing the same role across these tumors, and so that's why we have much greater-than-average confidence than what we're seeing in those preclinical studies and other tumors will translate into the basket study that they are running. So as Rick said, we've seen a lot of data here, and we feel very good about this opportunity. With respect to the ADC landscape, Stemcentrx has shown that they are very good at generating highly selective monoclonal antibodies that make good reagents for ADCs, and they also have the linker technology and the toxin technology, all fully integrated within their company to rapidly produce these ADCs. And again, I would say that their clinical track record speaks for itself. So with that, I'll turn it over to Rick for the other questions."

There will be a process that we go through, that's well documented of how we defend the patents and the process that the challenger would go through as well, that takes about 12 months, or at the end of 12 months, there would be a decision on the patent. And depending upon which way that decision went, if it went for us, then obviously the patent would be upheld and would be obviously strengthened dramatically. If not, then we have the right to appeal. So that's the process. And I think that essentially defines sort of the implications of the process.

So I mean, obviously, an important part of these kinds of companies is retaining the people. And particularly, when you think about this kind of a company where the -- a lot of the intellectual property of the company is that, right, the intellectual horsepower are the people. And I would say we have been interacting with Stemcentrx now for a number of months, well before this process started. And so we've had a chance to get to know the team and get to know the leadership within the team, and they had a decision to make, right? They could have gone down the IPO route, they could have collaborated with somebody and gone down the IPO route if they wanted to. And I think based on the kind of asset they have in Rova-T, they certainly would've had -- even in a tough IPO market as it is today, I think they would have had the ability to be able to do that. Or they could do a transaction like the transaction we ended up doing with them. And I think one of the deciding factors for them was what they're really good at and what they love doing is essentially going in and discovering novel markers and creating drugs. So going to the discovery in early development process and they demonstrated they can do that in a highly efficient and effective way, and they can do that very, very rapidly. If they went down the IPO route, they had to do basically build all the other infrastructure that a fully integrated business would need to have including all the commercial and medical affairs and global clinical development groups in order to be able to execute a fully integrated strategy. And I think as they looked at that, I think they had confidence that they can do it, but it'd be a tremendous amount of effort on their part in their leadership team to be able to do that. When they look at coming together with us, they ultimately said, ""Look, we can do the part that we think we're great at, and we can plug in to what you already have for all those other things."" The global clinical development group that we have, the medical affairs group that we have all around the world, the commercial organization that we have all around the world. And so I think they perceived it to be a win-win. So I think that's the first thing. Winning their hearts and their minds through that process, it was an important aspect of it. Second aspect of it was that obviously the CVRs, all of the leadership team and many of the employees have either ownership in the company or they have -- and they have stock options, right? So these CVRs are pretty important to them. They can extract a tremendous amount of value through that process if they deliver against those CVRs, and I can tell you that's a pretty healthy financial incentive for them to stay and execute against those. And I can tell you, in the interactions that I had with them -- we had with them, I should say, I can tell you that's an important point to them. Third thing is they wanted the stock transaction. Now they wanted it somewhat for tax purposes, but they also wanted it because they wanted to believe that they could share in the upside, and some of what they agreed to do with their options only reinforced that. Meaning, their Stemcentrx options and what they will become and how that value will be derived. And so I think there's a very high likelihood that we will retain the key people in this, and I think they like our culture, and they like the environment that they're operating in, and so I tell you, I have a fairly high level of confidence, and I think Pharmacyclics demonstrates. We have retained all of the key clinical development people, and I've spent time, Mike has spent time with that team. I think, they're very happy being part of AbbVie. And they get to execute their strategy that they wanted as an independent company as well or better than they could as an independent company. So I feel pretty good about that, but it's an important point. On the Pfizer transaction, it's something we want to be careful with because I'm not sure what their confidentiality agreement is.

So we intend to move very quickly, but it takes a bit of time before programs are ready for clinical introduction and sort of news flow that would -- you'd expect to hear in this sort of setting.

Second, HUMIRA in the U.S. I was just curious, obviously, we've seen quite a few price increases if you look at it over the past 12 months, and I was curious whether you are still being able to get the same amount of price dropping to the bottom line as you have been in the past if there was more pressure on that. And then third, can you give us an update on what we're going to see at ASCO for the broader portfolio?"

I'll take VIEKIRA, and Bill can take the HUMIRA question, and we'll have Mike cover the ASCO question. So VIEKIRA, let me start with Japan. Japan is continuing to track consistent with our expectations, so I think there's nothing all that remarkable in Japan. It's a good market. Our profile within that market is a good profile. The U.S. has certainly been more challenging. I would say that it's a combination of several factors, some volume losses as well as some price loss. As Merck has entered the market, we know that they set the list price lower than the other products in the marketplace. That strategy initially, I think, we interpreted as a strategy that we would go after medical exceptions because medical exceptions historically are in at more of a list price point, and so they have the lowest price essentially on a medical exception basis, and they have been somewhat successful in gaining some of those medical exceptions. So that's part of the issue. The second part of the issue though is they have been more aggressive than we anticipated from a pricing standpoint, particularly in the public segments, the VA in particular. And as we looked at that, we ultimately made the decision that we were not going to compete with the lowest overall price in the VA. We did adjust our price down, but we didn't adjust it down to the very lowest price, and that has caused us to obviously lose price but also lose volume, and we had a fairly significant share of VA. So I think it is those factors playing out. And I would say that based on where the U.S. is going, it is unlikely that we will achieve the $2 billion number that we described earlier. I think a number that you should be thinking about now is more in the 1 6 range, globally I'm talking about. And you can look at this quarter as an example even though VIEKIRA was weaker than we expected. We obviously beat our EPS number and achieved our revenue numbers. So it talks to the strength of the rest of the business. And a nice thing about our business is we have good balanced performance across a number of different assets. And so when one thing doesn't go as well as we had hoped, then others can pick up the slack. So we will not be changing our guidance based on this. We factored that into our going-forward guidance in 2016, and we're comfortable with the guidance that we provided you, but those are the facts around VIEKIRA."

So if they take one asset and they move it through and when we take it to a registration study and we determine that, that asset in that indication would generate a commercial asset that had greater than $1 billion worth of revenue, then we would pay them $500 million. And then if they do a second one or a third one or a fourth one, they can get up to 4 $500 million milestones. So that's how the contingent payments are laid out. On the competitive dynamics, it was a competitive process. It was relatively blind to us, so we don't know who the other competitors were, but we do know there are other players that were involved, and I'd say it ended up being us and one other player at the very end who were competing for the asset through that process. And ultimately, as I told you, on that equation [indiscernible] what they said to you before. If you look at what we are paying in the base case for this asset, [indiscernible] and you are looking at the base case for us without [indiscernible] as a significantly positive NPV and well above the threshold at which we look at the cutoff for IRRs, and so this is a transaction that we feel very comfortable from financial standpoint. And we've obviously built in the upside for first line because we don't have data on the first line right now. And we didn't want to be in a position where we're paying for something that we didn't know what it was going to look like. We were very comfortable with the second and third line because we saw a data that supported that, human data that supported that. I do believe, based on everything I've seen, I think that Mike and others believe that there is a higher probability this asset will move into first line, but we are going to pursue it aggressively. And if they do, they will get the incremental reward and we will obviously get the incremental award [indiscernible] moving into that.

I think based on what we know about the pathway, it makes sense to make that same statement about psoriatic arthritis. We're very pleased with the data we've seen today. We think there is really tremendous potential for that asset. With respect to ABT-122, which is our IL-17/TNF DVD, we are going to be seeing mid-stage data internally in the middle of this year. So shortly, we'll probably be in a position to present that externally around the ACR time frame. And so we'll make a decision when we have those data. But what I can say is to move forward with those molecules. It would have to fit our strategy with that molecule with ABT-122. It would have to fit our strategy to raise the bar on the standard of care. So we would be looking for a differentiated efficacy compared to not only what we have in our own portfolio but what's available externally. And so we'll be making that decision later on this year. 
With respect to your question about our presence in lung cancer, we've said for quite some time that we want to build our presence in solid tumors. I think the Stemcentrx acquisition clearly does that. It gives us a broad platform as well as a very promising lead asset and other clinical assets behind that. And so we're going to continue to build on that presence not only with the development engine that comes from Stemcentrx but with our internal pipeline. And I think you'll see that we have a number of programs that could be applicable to lung cancer and other solid tumors that will be moving through the clinic shortly."

Are you talking small cell alone, other indications, and sort of give some more granular color on how you built up to that number? And then the second question. Now that you have purchased Stemcentrx that have been licensed [indiscernible] from BI, can you give a little bit more color on how you see the R&D line evolving over the next few years?

As far as of the model, obviously, we went through the model in some level of detail around Pharmacyclics, one, because of the magnitude of the investment that we were making, and we described what supported that investment and how we've built up the model. What I characterized for you already basically tells you how we built of this model, right? It's built primarily around second and third line, which we believe -- small cell, which we believe as they -- I probably really have successfully. So you could imagine we risk-adjusted it accordingly at a high probability of success. It does have a couple of other smaller indications where we believe there is a very high probability of being able to extend it into some of these other cancers that we described. I wouldn't say that has a significant impact on it, and those are risk-adjusted accordingly. It doesn't have first line in it. And the milestone of the CBR is basically driven off of what we think the value would be and the return would be appropriate for first-line, and it doesn't have any other of these other milestone-driven POCs that would come forward. So I think that's roughly the same kind of guidance we gave share and some other kinds of things. And we've obviously built the model around those same kinds of assumptions. But I think, in this case, we'll wait to provide that at a later date, once we get closer to a launch of the asset in 2018. On the R&D line, or I think really what you're asking is, are we still committed to delivering 50% or greater in 2020, and the short answer to that is yes. We've looked at it. We've carefully looked at the commitments we made around the compounded growth rate and the revenue projections as well as the operating margin profile that we communicated last year, and we're still absolutely committed to delivering against that."

I mean, first of all, if you look at the guidance that we provided back in, I think it was October 29 of last year, and you look at what happened to the consensus numbers, what you'll see is they shifted out roughly a year. I think the mean now is probably, if you look at where people are assuming biosimilar impact in the United States, it's probably in that 2019 -- Larry, correct me if I'm wrong here, a 2019 time frame, so moved out from about '17 to 2019. And I'd say one of the things we tracked to try to understand how the market is perceiving that guidance is we track what our stock performance has been versus our peers over that period of time. And I saw it just the other day, I made a change in the last couple of days a little bit, but we're the #1 performing stock since that point in time. So I think it was around 14% appreciation or something like that, 15% appreciation. So I think it did have a positive impact. Having said that, I would agree with your point that there's still this overhang, and this overhang is built around different catalysts. As we've said before, we've given a lot of clarity in that review of what our IP strategy is and the confidence that we have in our IP strategy. How the market will relate to that, that's a little harder for me to describe or predict, I'd say. But certainly, I think, as it plays out, I think the market will basically start to better understand what our position is. And certainly, as you have more confidence around of that, I think you will see the sentiment change. I think the bigger issue, and I think Rova-T and IL-23 are 2 good examples, but we obviously have a point of view of what we think is going to happen. We've communicated what that point of view looks like. I think, in very clear terms. That doesn't mean that everybody believes that point of view. But what I'd say is, if you look at even the bare case on HUMIRA, which we certainly don't agree with, and you look at this pipeline that we now assembled for the assets that have a very high probability of success, I think even in the most bare case possible, most people would look at that pipeline and say they should be able to grow through whatever happens. Now obviously, we have a different view of what we think is going to happen. But even if you look at least the models I've looked at that have the worse case built into them, when I look at our pipeline and the probability of success of those assets I described in my formal remarks and usually add them up, risk-adjust them based on the data you've seen and the commercial success you would expect from those assets, I think a reasonable person would draw the conclusion that you can grow through that. And I think that ultimately will be the calculus that investors are going to have to make."

Mike will provide updates on recent advancements across our R&D programs, and Bill will discuss the quarter and our 2016 guidance in more detail, including the financial aspects of Stemcentrx transaction. And as always, following our remarks, we'll take your questions.
We delivered another strong quarterly performance, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.15, representing growth of more than 22% versus the first quarter 2015. Our results included strong operational sales growth of 22.4%, driven by a number of products across our portfolio. This includes HUMIRA global operational growth of more than 19%, strong growth from IMBRUVICA, continued global uptake of VIEKIRA and strong performance from several other products in our portfolio, including Creon and Duodopa. We also continued to deliver improvements in our operating margin profile. In addition to our strong financial results, we also advanced several of our key strategic priorities. Late in the quarter, we secured FDA approval for IMBRUVICA as a first-line treatment for patients with CLL. We're roughly 1 month into our first-line launch, and we're pleased with our progress, to date. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, recently published an updated view of this guidelines granting IMBRUVICA a category 1 recommendation for certain CLL patients, the highest recommendation assigned by the organization.
We are also approaching the 1-year mark for Pharmacyclics, and we continue to be very pleased with the progress we've made to date. The Pharmacyclics team continues to rapidly advance trial activity, exploring IMBRUVICA across a broad range of tumor types. IMBRUVICA offers significant growth potential through its expanding list of indications and lines of therapy, and we remain excited about the vast potential for this unique asset.
Earlier this month, we received FDA approval for another transformative therapy for the treatment of CLL. Venclexta, our novel BCL-2 inhibitor was approved for patients with relapsed refractory CLL who harbor the 17p deletion, a difficult-to-treat form of the disease, typically associated with poor prognosis. Based on the level of efficacy in this patient population, the FDA granted the approval under its breakthrough therapy and priority review designations. Since the beginning of the year, we've also reported compelling data from several development programs, including positive top line results from our second pivotal elagolix trial in endometriosis and strong data from our next-generation HCV program. Mike will provide updates on both programs during his remarks in just a few moments. We also augmented our pipeline with a late-stage asset with a global collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim to develop and commercialize an anti-IL-23, currently in Phase III development for psoriasis and mid-stage development for several additional indications. The agreement provides AbbVie with another potential best-in-class late-stage asset, adding to our immunology pipeline, which [indiscernible] 494 currently in Phase III development for RA as well as several other Biologics that are in mid-stage trials. Based on its potential for best-in-class efficacy, we believe the BI asset could generate multibillion dollars in peak year revenues across several immune-mediated diseases.
Clearly, the most notable and exciting news today is our planned acquisition of Stemcentrx. We could not be more pleased to have this talented group of individuals join our organization. We have been tremendously impressed with their accomplishments to-date, and their innovation and expertise will drive strong benefits for AbbVie going forward. The addition of Stemcentrx is a strategically compelling opportunity for our company, our shareholders and the patients which we serve. Over the past several years, we've taken a number of steps to build and strengthen our position in oncology research and development, with the objective of becoming a leading oncology company. We've advanced numerous promising pipeline assets, including our BCL-2 inhibitor for blood cancers and our PARP-inhibitor and anti-EGFR antibody drug conjugate in development for solid tumors. We've strengthened our discovery efforts through collaborations with leading academic and other institutions around the world. We've added top talent to our R&D organization. Last year, through the acquisition of Pharmacyclics, we obtained IMBRUVICA, a first-in-class BTK inhibitor, which has already achieved blockbuster status and is on a trajectory to achieve multibillion-dollar peak year sales.
And as I mentioned earlier, we just launched our internally developed Venclexta, which adds another transformational therapy to our hematological oncology franchise. We view oncology as a significant pillar of growth for AbbVie going forward. And as we evaluate all opportunities, we do so with a desire to balance near-term performance while continuing to build the portfolio of assets that will generate strong growth in 2020 and beyond, supporting our commitment to drive top-tier performance over the long term.
So that brings me to our announcement today, the acquisition of Stemcentrx, which gives AbbVie a highly attractive platform for solid tumors and extremely exciting late-stage assets in Rova-T. The transaction enables AbbVie to further expand and accelerate our presence in oncology, building upon our growing position in hematological oncology. Stemcentrx proprietary solid tumor platform leverages cancer stem cell biology to identify and validate novel therapeutic targets. The company has demonstrated a track record of successfully engineering and manufacturing antibodies and antibody drug conjugates for those targets.
Stemcentrx lead asset is Rova-T, a DLL3-targeted antibody drug conjugate. DLL3 is a novel target expressed in several tumor types, including small cell lung cancer, an aggressive and difficult-to-treat disease. Small cell lung cancer accounts for roughly 15% of all lung cancers, and more than 60,000 patients are diagnosed annually in the major developed markets. DLL3 is the first predictive biomarker associated with drug efficacy in small cell lung cancer. It is highly expressed in a majority of small cell lung cancer tumors as well as cancer stem cells and is not expressed in normal tissue. Predictive biomarkers help identify which patients have the potential to benefit from a therapy. Rova-T is currently in registrational trials for third-line small cell lung cancer. There is a significant unmet need for this patient population as the treatment landscape is not changed for several decades. In fact, there is current only one approved treatment for second-line small cell lung cancer and no approved agents for third-line use. The 5-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with this type of cancer is unfortunately very low, at approximately 6%. Last year, the European Society of Medical Oncology meeting, Stemcentrx presented exciting Phase II results in small cell lung cancer, including data that illustrated an overall response rate of 44% in a DLL3 biomarker-defined population. Rova-T also demonstrated a clinical benefit rate of 78% in this refractory and difficult-to-treat set of patients. Response rates were similar in third-line and second-line patients with a manageable safety profile. These landmark data represents the first time a biomarker-targeted therapy has shown significant efficacy in small cell lung cancer. Additional data from a broader set of patients and longer-term follow-up, including compelling overall survival results will be disclosed during an oral session at the upcoming ASCO meeting in June, where the abstract has been selected as a Best of ASCO presentation, a distinction only 1% of abstracts receive. Given the very promising efficacy in third-line small cell lung cancer, Stemcentrx recently filed for FDA breakthrough designation for this setting. Based on a compelling data and a significant unmet need in this patient population, we are certainly hopeful that we will be successful in obtaining this status. Stemcentrx has moved rapidly through clinical development in third-line small cell lung cancer, from the initiation of the first in human trials to the recent start of the registration-enabling study. Based on the expected completion of the ongoing registrational trial, commercialization of this indication is expected in 2018. Stemcentrx is also moving to rapidly advance in the front-line small cell lung cancer. Mike will provide more detail on the planned first-line program in just a few moments.
Like HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, we believe Rova-T has the potential applicability across the broad range of indications and tumors. In addition, the small cell lung cancer expression of DLL3 indicates Rova-T may be useful across multiple solid tumor types, including metastatic melanoma, glioblastoma multiforme as well as some prostate, pancreatic and colorectal cancers among others. There is a significant subset of patients whose tumors are positive for DLL3 expression within this broader set of tumors, representing more than 65,000 patients treated annually. We plan to evaluate Rova-T across numerous indications, leveraging our R&D infrastructure and global clinical trial organization to move rapidly and efficiently.
The acquisition of Stemcentrx also broadens AbbVie's oncology pipeline with a portfolio of earlier-stage candidates focused on novel oncology targets. In addition to Rova-T, the Stemcentrx pipeline includes 4 clinical candidates being evaluated in trials across a range of solid tumors as well as 2 additional INDs for new targets planned for 2016 and a broad portfolio of validated preclinical targets.
Stemcentrx also enhances AbbVie's oncology discovery capabilities. The technology platform that identified Rova-T and the other assets in the Stemcentrx pipeline has strong potential for continued asset generation and will strengthen AbbVie's discovery and development efforts in solid tumors going forward.
So as we summarize the transaction, the addition of Stemcentrx is strategically compelling. The acquisition is highly complementary with our growing hematological oncology franchise and existing portfolio of solid tumor assets. The lead asset, Rova-T, represents a multibillion-dollar peak revenue opportunity, with revenue potentially approaching $5 billion as we advance in the first-line small cell lung cancer and other indications. Rova-T has the potential to have a dramatic impact on our growth over the long term. Additionally, Stemcentrx existing pipeline of additional assets in their R&D engine will augment our future development efforts in solid tumors. Stemcentrx adds to AbbVie's long-term growth prospects, providing another compelling growth platform that will further diversify our revenue base beginning in 2018 and will enhance our EPS growth starting in 2020 and beyond. Stemcentrx fits well within our overall strategy. We have now assembled a significant number of late-stage assets, which have been significantly derisked to have multibillion-dollar potential and the potential to drive sustainable growth in 2020 and beyond. Assets including IMBRUVICA, Venclexta, ABT-494, Zinbryta, elagolix, the next-generation HCV combination, our recently in-licensed anti-IL-23 and now Rova-T, all of these assets have a high probability of regulatory and commercial success.
In closing, we continue to be pleased with our strong execution and strategic advancement. We continue to demonstrate an exceptional track record of success with positive clinical data and regulatory outcomes, and we look forward to additional important pipeline milestones in the year ahead. We're off to a strong start this year, and we intend to build upon our momentum to drive a high level of performance across their operations and deliver strong growth in 2016, and we remain committed to delivering on long-term objectives that we outlined last year.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D program. Mike?"

We had a very productive first quarter from an R&D perspective with a number of important data readouts, phase transitions and regulatory approvals as well as licensing activity. This morning, I will provide color on some of the key highlights.
I'll start by saying that I certainly share Rick's enthusiasm for Stemcentrx, which brings us a promising late-stage program with Rova-T, a pipeline of earlier stage candidates and a platform technology that will enhance our future solid tumor discovery and development efforts. We very much enjoyed our dialogue with the Stemcentrx team as we've gotten to know them over the past several months, and we've been impressed with the individuals and the innovative platform they built.
Stemcentrx has established an impressive track record. The company's first 3 clinical stage drugs each represent novel targets with single-agent activity demonstrated in early phase trials in small cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer, all difficult-to-treat solid tumor indications. Stemcentrx's highly productive discovery effort is driven by the company's core technology, which utilizes a library of more than 700 patient-derived tumor xenograft models and leverages cancer stem cell biology to identify and validate therapeutic targets that would be overlooked by other methods. This platform has yielded impressive results to date, and we are excited about the potential for continued asset generation, which will aid AbbVie in our R&D efforts going forward. The company's lead asset, Rova-T, represents a significant opportunity, not only through its lead indication, third-line small cell lung cancer, but also through the potential for expansion into the front-line setting as well as other types of cancer where DLL3 plays an important role. Stemcentrx has a broad development program for Rova-T currently underway. We've been impressed with the speed with which Stemcentrx has moved through the clinic. It's been roughly 4.5 years since target identification and less than 3 years between filing the Rova-T IND to the initiation of the registration study in third-line small cell lung cancer. The confirmatory third-line trial, which is called Trinity, began in January and is expected to complete enrollment by the end of 2016 with commercialization expected in 2018. We view the Rova-T small cell lung cancer program as significantly derisked with a high probability of success. In addition to the overall response data presented at ESMO last year, which showed an overall response rate of 44% in DLL3-positive patients, the profile of Rova-T is supported by longer-term data, some of which will be presented at the upcoming ASCO meeting. These updated data include promising overall survival findings that compared favorably to historical controls. We believe the full body of data generates -- generated today are highly compelling and strongly support the value proposition of Rova-T.
Stemcentrx is also moving rapidly into front-line small cell lung cancer with Rova-T. The company is on the cusp of initiating a study designed to select the optimal regimen for the front-line registrational program. This 4-arm trial will evaluate several permutations of Rova-T and standard of care chemotherapy, including both monotherapy and combination arms. Given the compelling data we've seen in small cell lung cancer to-date, we believe there is a high likelihood of successfully moving into earlier lines of therapy.
Stemcentrx is also evaluating an 8-arm 400-patient basket study, which will look at Rova-T as monotherapy in patients with a range of tumor types that share neuroendocrine features, including malignant melanoma, medullary thyroid cancer, glioblastoma, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and forms of prostate cancer and other solid tumors. This study is on track to start enrolling patients this quarter.
Additional first-line studies are planned, including a Phase I study to assess the safety of Rova-T in combination with anti-body therapy targeting the PD-1 PDL-1 access, which is on track to be initiated during the second half of 2016. Clearly, prior to the Stemcentrx acquisition, AbbVie was already focused on establishing a strong position in oncology. Since the company was established in 2013, we've added 10 new oncology assets through internal advancement or partnership efforts. The Stemcentrx acquisition accelerates our objective of becoming a leading oncology company. We look forward to spending more time discussing Stemcentrx, including their pipeline, at our upcoming R&D Day in June.
In addition to the Stemcentrx's acquisition, last week, we also announced 2 early-stage oncology collaborations, including an agreement with Argenx for a novel immuno-oncology target, GARP, and an agreement with CytomX to develop Probody drug conjugates, a platform which provides another differentiated opportunity to combine with our strength in antibody drug conjugates. Beyond oncology, as Rick noted, we also recently entered into a global agreement with BI to develop and commercialize risankizumab, an anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, in Phase III development for psoriasis and mid-stage development for several additional indications.
The collaboration of physicians is promising asset as AbbVie has lead investigational compound in psoriasis and complements a robust immunology pipeline. Recent Phase II study results for risankizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis showed improved efficacy over Stelara, a commonly used treatment for this life-impacting skin condition that was included in the study as an active comparator. Specifically, the strong head-to-head results showed that at 12 weeks, 81% of patients treated with 180 milligrams of the BI compound achieved PASI 90, more than double the rate achieved by patients treated with Stelara. In 50% of the patients treated with the BI compound, achieved complete skin clearance or PASI 100 versus just 17.5% of the Stelara-treated patients. We're pleased with this level of efficacy as our immunology development strategy is centered upon identifying treatments that offer differentiated profiles relative to currently available therapies, with a goal of continuing to raise the standard of care. Beyond the impressive efficacy, this asset also has the potential to offer a favorable dosing profile with subcutaneous quarterly administration.
The BI compound is also currently in Phase II development for psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease with plans to initiate a Phase IIb study in psoriatic arthritis in mid-2016 and the potential to transition into Phase III development in Crohn's disease next year. We will present mid-stage Crohn's disease induction data at the upcoming Digestive Disease Week, or DDW, meeting next month. We've also disclosed positive results for several late-stage programs, including most recently additional data on next-generation HCV regimen. Earlier this month at The International Liver Congress in Barcelona, we presented data on our pan-genotypic once-daily ribavirin-free combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in patients with genotypes 1 through 6, including data on treatment durations as short as 8 weeks. The data illustrate that with 8 weeks of treatment, 97% to 98% of genotype-1 through 3 patients without cirrhosis achieved sustained virologic response at 12 weeks posttreatment. Additionally, 100% of genotype 4 through 6 patients without cirrhosis achieved SVR 12 with 12 weeks of treatment. We also presented late-breaking data showing our next-generation combination drove 100% SVR 12 with 12 weeks of treatment without ribavirin in treatment-naïve genotype 3 patients with compensated cirrhosis. While recent advancements in HCV treatment have resulted in high cure rates for many patients, there remained distinct areas of unmet need, including patients with genotype 3. These new data illustrate the potential of our next-generation combination to address this need.
Another area of unmet need is patients who have failed previous therapy with direct-acting antivirals, or DAA, as retreatment options for these patients are limited. We presented data showing that 95% of genotype 1 patients, who failed previous therapy with DAAs, achieved SVR 12 with 12 weeks of therapy without the need for ribavirin. The mid-stage data, we disclosed to-date, indicate that our new HCV combination can deliver cure rates approaching 100%, and we believe the majority of patients will be well served with an 8-week treatment option. We expect to see results from the pivotal studies in the second half of this year, and we remain on track for commercialization next year. We also announced positive top line results from the second of 2 replicate pivotal Phase III clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of elagolix in premenopausal women who suffer pain from endometriosis. Trial results show that after 6 months of continuous treatment, both doses of elagolix met the study's co-primary endpoints, with elagolix reducing scores of menstrual pain and non-menstrual pelvic pain in month 3 and month 6. We intend to present detailed results from both Phase III trials in a medical conference later this year, and we will complete the clinical database in anticipation of a new drug application submission for endometriosis in 2017. We also continue to advance the elagolix development program in uterine fibroids. During the quarter, we initiated a Phase III program investigating the effect of elagolix on heavy bleeding related to this highly prevalent condition. As Rick noted, we received 2 important approvals within our hematologic oncology portfolio as well. The expansion of the IMBRUVICA label into first-line use for CLL and the initial approval of our novel BCL-2 inhibitor, Venclexta. With IMBRUVICA and Venclexta, we now have 2 therapies on the market for the treatment of CLL, addressing a range of patient types.
We continue to advance our development efforts for IMBRUVICA, Venclexta and several other assets in our oncology pipeline. We'll present data across a wide range of studies at the upcoming ASCO meeting. We built a strategic portfolio of oncology assets, including multiple mechanisms of action that have significant potential alone and in combination.
So in summary, we continue to make significant progress with our pipeline and are on track for further advancements in 2016. We have a broad pipeline that includes more than 50 active clinical assets, including more than 20 new products or indications in late-stage development or under regulatory review. We look forward to covering our full pipeline in more detail at our R&D pipeline review to be held in Chicago on June 3. We hope you will join us.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our first quarter performance. Bill?"

As Rick said, we are very pleased with a strong quarter we delivered. Net revenues were up 22.4% operationally, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin profile by 300 basis points to 43.1% of sales. We reported adjusted earnings per share results of $1.15, up 22.3% over the first quarter of 2015. Strong operational revenue growth in the quarter was in line with our guidance for growth of just above 20%. Foreign exchange had a negative 4.2% impact on revenue in the quarter, also in line with our guidance of roughly 4% negative exchange.
We continue to see strong momentum for HUMIRA, which delivered global sales of more than $3.5 billion, up 19.2% operationally, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. In the U.S., HUMIRA sales were nearly $2.2 billion, reflecting exceptional growth across all 3 major categories: rheumatology, gastro and derm. Internationally, HUMIRA sales were nearly $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4.6% on an operational basis, excluding an unfavorable impact from exchange. This exceeded our previous forecast of 3% operational growth. Currency reduced reported international HUMIRA sales by 9.2%, while early in the launch, the Enbrel biosimilar is tracking in line or favorable to what we had modeled.
Global IMBRUVICA net revenues were $381 million in the quarter. U.S. sales were $325 million, and our international profit-sharing was $56 million. Global VIEKIRA sales in the quarter were $414 million. The launch of VIEKIRAX, our 2-drug once-daily ribavirin-free combination for patients with HCV genotype 1b, is underway in Japan, leading to a continued higher mix of international sales in the quarter. Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 36.7% on an operational basis in the quarter. We saw continued double-digit growth internationally for Duodopa with a modest level of U.S. sales as expected.
Global Creon sales were $150 million, up 18.2% operationally. Creon continues to maintain its leadership position in the pancreatic enzyme market with the majority of the market share.
The adjusted gross margin ratio was 81.3% of sales in the first quarter, which was impacted by the Pharmacyclics transaction and year-over-year impacts of foreign exchange. Excluding these impacts, the ratio was up over 200 basis points.
As I mentioned earlier, we continue to show improvement in our adjusted operating margin profile, which increased to 43.1% of sales, up 300 basis points. Excluding the impact of Pharmacyclics in foreign exchange, operating margin improved over 600 basis points versus the prior year quarter. The majority of this improvement was driven by efficiencies and our rapidly growing top line.
Adjusted R&D was 15.6% of sales, reflecting funding actions in support of our pipeline assets. Adjusted SG&A was 22.6% of sales in the first quarter, down significantly from the prior year on a profile basis, contributing to a continued improvement in operating margin leverage. Adjusted net interest expense was $200 million, and the adjusted tax rate was 20.7% in the quarter.
First quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding noncash intangible amortization expense and specified items, were $1.15, up 22.3% year-over-year.
During the quarter, as a result of the economic conditions in Venezuela and the lack of availability of U.S. dollars at the government's official exchange rate, we changed the exchange rate we use in Venezuela to the floating DICOM rate. This resulted in a charge of $298 million related to a devaluation of our net monetary assets in Venezuela. This will also impact revenue booked for products sold in Venezuela.
I would like to now walk you through the financial aspects of the Stemcentrx transaction. We are acquiring Stemcentrx for $5.8 billion with the consideration be paid out as $3.8 billion in equity and $2 billion in cash. The use of equity in this transaction reflects Stemcentrx management and Board of Directors desire to retain a stake in the asset as well as achieve a tax-deferred structure. Upon closing, we plan to execute an accelerated share repurchase program to reacquire all of the newly issued equity. We anticipate the transaction to close late in the second quarter. We are forecasting $0.20 of dilution in 2016 as a result of the transaction, which represents a half year of R&D, operating and interest expense. We plan to provide specifics on Stemcentrx's impact on our P&L profile during the second quarter earnings call in July. We expect the transaction to generate positive operating margin beginning in 2019 and EPS accretion starting in 2020. Given these facts, we are updating our 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $4.62 to $4.82 to reflect the Stemcentrx transaction. This range reflects EPS growth of 10% at the midpoint and includes the previously communicated $0.08 diluted impact of the BI collaboration announced last month. It excludes $0.75 of intangible amortization and specified costs. Specified items related to the Stemcentrx acquisition will be quantified and included on our second quarter call.
Regarding the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.19 to $1.21. This excludes roughly $0.18 of specified items and noncash amortization and includes the BI and Stemcentrx dilution impacts.
We are expecting mid-teens operational sales growth, excluding a roughly 2% negative foreign exchange impact on the quarter. As a result, we are expecting low teens sales growth on a reported basis. We are forecasting 3% operational growth for international HUMIRA in the second quarter. Excluding Venezuela, this growth would've exceeded 5%. We currently expect a negative 4% currency impact on international HUMIRA in the second quarter, resulting in a modest decline year-over-year on a reported basis. However, we remain on track with our previously communicated full year guidance for HUMIRA outside the U.S, including the mid-single-digit operational growth expected internationally.
So in conclusion, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter as we've driven strong top and bottom line growth and delivered operating margin expansion while also advancing on our strategic priorities. This puts us in a strong position to continue delivering industry-leading growth this year.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry."

Essentially, how we do acquisitions, and you",704,"Jeff, it's Rick. So I'll take, I guess, all of those questions. So as it relates to the valuation, I would say it had nothing to do with what their prior round valuation was. That's not how we do acquisitions. Essentially, how we do acquisitions, and you probably recall this from the Pharmacyclics discussion that we had, and I think it's typical within our industry how it's done, is you build a model that ultimately projects out what you think the company and assets can do, and then off of that model, you determine what the return would look like at various price points, what the NPV would look like and ultimately, yes, the threshold at which -- the way we do it. We have a threshold at which we say we won't go above. And then, we get into the process and ultimately try to validate those assumptions and make a decision as to whether or not we want to go forward, and if you want to go forward, then we'll obviously negotiate as hard as we can to try to get to the lowest possible price, but most of these are a competitive kind of situation. So what I would tell you about this transaction is that I believe it is at a very good valuation for us. It has a good NPV, based on the base case, which was essentially on second- and third-line small cell lung cancer and a couple of other indications. And it has significant upside if we move to first line or more broadly across those cancers that are DLL3-positive. Now those trials are ongoing, so we don't have that data, so we didn't necessarily build all of those in. If that were to occur, you probably saw it as a CDR for first line that the investors would receive, but I would tell first line will have a very, very strong NPV above and beyond what we factored in here. But with the base case, this has a very good NPV and a very good IRR, so I can just tell you I feel good about the valuation.
As far as the data is concerned, we have seen a significant amount of data above and beyond what is public now. We obviously need to be careful about what we talk about because some of that data will be presented at the ASCO meeting. I think we've given you a pretty good idea of what you're likely to see at the ASCO meeting, but I can tell you that we have seen all the data that was available to the management team, and we are impressed with that data. So I can tell you I'm very, very excited. We've looked for quite some time now for a solid tumor platform play, and they're hard to find in this market. And I think if you look at the productivity of this group and the novel therapeutic target that they have been able to come up with and their hit rate on those targets is significantly above industry average. And the way they approach it is pretty impressive, and the fact that this is focusing to a great extent on cancer stem cells. I think there's a strong belief that if you can knock out certain cancer stem cells, you can dramatically impact the course of that disease for those patients. And I think the data will speak for itself when it's available, and you can take a look at it. So we are impressed with those I think. We think Rova-T is a very good asset and gives us a good strong position in solid tumors going forward. On the IPRs, as we said before, we're not going to talk a lot about the process now that we're in litigation. I can answer maybe 1 or 2 of these questions. We don't have the ability to predict the timing. You have the date correct, that you described. So it should occur sometime no later than that date. We don't know whether it will be consolidated or not, and we're not going to comment on the issuance of the patent and what we would do in that scenario. Okay?"

Should we think about Stemcentrx as the type of size and profile you're looking for? Or could you look to get more aggressive as the year kind of or as we got to 2017 if the right deal is out there?"

I'll take the first question with respect to the competitive environment for Rova-T and some of the other programs that Stemcentrx has been working on. And what I will say is that -- one of the things that really impressed us with Stemcentrx is the novelty of their platform. They've invested early in this technology. They have developed great expertise, and they are out in the lead in all of the areas that they're pursuing. So DLL3 is out in the lead. It's demonstrated very compelling results, and we think it's an asset that has tremendous promise and will really change the standard of care. And I think if you look at all of the programs, that Stemcentrx is advancing, there's a high degree of novelty and very strong signs of activity from the first 3 clinical programs. So we feel very good about their position in the competitive environment."

What's nice about this transaction though is in 2018, we're going to be bringing the product to market. And we think given the clinical data that has been shown so far, we're going to have a fairly impressive uptake on Rova-T, and that will offset that dilution pretty quickly.

The only thing I'd add on the -- I know what you're trying to do. You're obviously trying to model or incorporate into your model what the R&D impact will be on 2017. I think that's what you're trying to do based on your question. And",545,"Chris, this is Rick. The only thing I'd add on the -- I know what you're trying to do. You're obviously trying to model or incorporate into your model what the R&D impact will be on 2017. I think that's what you're trying to do based on your question. And I'd say as we factored in this number and as we look at 2017, it certainly incorporates the assumptions that we've made around the expansion into other tumors that are DLL3-positive. It incorporates what Mike described as the first-line trials that ultimately they're pursuing with Rova-T. The one part that it probably does not include at this point, we just need to work on it some more would be -- we also believe that this could be a synergistic strategy in first-line with immunotherapy. And they have walked us through a plan where potentially, as an example, Rova-T could be a highly specific debulking agent on the front end for DLL3-positive patients in small cell and knocking out the stem cells in the process, which traditional chemotherapy does not do today, and then you would get the disease under control and debulked and you would follow it, with immunotherapy for a longer-term maintenance. And so they've laid out some plans around that, and that has not been incorporated to this point. So that would be the only thing. Now we obviously have a significant R&D budget, and we would look at it. How we normally do R&D is we add everything up and then we make a decision where we draw the line. And we're going to be conscious of that, so I'm not telling you that would be incremental, but what I'm telling you is that's the one thing that's outside the scope of what's in the current R&D assumptions. So hopefully, that gives you some clarity around that. On the M&A front, similar to the comments I made earlier, we have been looking for a solid tumor platform. I think we made that somewhat clear that, that was something we're interested in doing. I would say this came in at a valuation that was significantly below the numbers that we had flagged before, but we are looking to balance near-term performance against making sure that we build a significant portfolio of assets out in that 2020 and beyond period that can contribute to delivering strong EPS growth and strong revenue growth. But I'd say where we are right now is we have a lot of things going right now, and we have filled a lot of the needs that we have, and so I would not expect that we will go out and do another significant transaction. And obviously, Pharmacyclics is a significant transaction, but I'm talking about even a transaction of this size. So I think for the next certainly 18 months or so, if we were to do anything it would probably be more of a BI kind of transaction, more of a single asset, might be in licensing kind of a transaction. And I think based on the fact that we have delivered some level of dilution here, we would have to be in a position where we would absorb the dilution going forward. So hopefully that answers your question."

And I was also curious to know how Stemcentrx's ADC technology differs from other ADC players? And then a follow-up question, I'm sorry about this, but just a follow-up on an earlier question. If you could kind of play out the scenario of the upcoming IPR, which investors are obviously highly focused on, what is the right analytical framework, Rick, that we should think about this in the event that, a, the IPR is heard or it is dismissed just in relation to the overall IP picture in duration of HUMIRA?"

I will take the first of those, and then Rick may want to add some follow-up. So with respect to cancer stem cells, what I would say is we've had a fair amount of time to get very comfortable with the platform that Stemcentrx has developed, and we believe that they are doing something really novel here. In terms of understanding how mouse models might translate into human clinical trials or ultimately clinical benefit, we certainly recognize that, that translational leap is often fraught with peril. But in this case, we don't have to wonder. We've seen the first 3 assets move into the clinic showing strong activity. And so they have demonstrated with their first 3 clinical assets activity in small cell lung cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer. So there are human data to back up their hypothesis, not only onetime but 3 times in a row. And obviously, being right 3 times in a row in this business doesn't happen by chance very often. So with respect to our confidence that small cell lung cancer will transfer to other cancers, the set of cancers that we're talking about all share neuroendocrine features as does small cell, and Stemcentrx has done a large amount of work to understand the role that DLL3 plays biologically in these tumors. And we know based on the work that they have done that DLL3 is playing the same role across these tumors, and so that's why we have much greater-than-average confidence than what we're seeing in those preclinical studies in other tumors will translate into the basket study that they are running. So as Rick said, we've seen a lot of data here, and we feel very good about this opportunity. With respect to the ADC landscape, Stemcentrx has shown that they are very good at generating highly selective monoclonal antibodies that make good reagents for ADCs, and they also have the linker technology and the toxin technology, all fully integrated within their company to rapidly produce these ADCs. And again, I would say that their clinical track record speaks for itself. So with that, I'll turn it over to Rick for the other questions."

There will be a process that we go through, that's well documented of how we defend the patents and the process that the challenger would go through as well, that takes about 12 months, or at the end of 12 months, there would be a decision on the patent. And depending upon which way that decision went, if it went for us, then obviously the patent would be upheld and would be obviously strengthened dramatically. If not, then we have the right to appeal. So that's the process. And I think that essentially defines sort of the implications of the process.

I'll take probably the first of those and maybe some part of the second, and may ask Henry to chime in on the second part, and I'll take the Calico one for you. So I mean, obviously, an important part of these kinds of companies is retaining the people. And particularly, when you think about this kind of a company where the -- a lot of the intellectual property of the company is that, right, the intellectual horsepower are the people. And I would say we have been interacting with Stemcentrx now for a number of months, well before this process started. And so we've had a chance to get to know the team and get to know the leadership within the team, and they had a decision to make, right? They could have gone down the IPO route, they could have collaborated with somebody and gone down the IPO route if they wanted to. And I think based on the kind of asset they have in Rova-T, they certainly would've had -- even in a tough IPO market as it is today, I think they would have had the ability to be able to do that. Or they could do a transaction like the transaction we ended up doing with them. And I think one of the deciding factors for them was what they're really good at and what they love doing is essentially going in and discovering novel markers and creating drugs. So going through the discovery and early development process and they demonstrated they can do that in a highly efficient and effective way, and they can do that very, very rapidly. If they went down the IPO route, they had to do basically build all the other infrastructure that a fully integrated business would need to have including all the commercial and medical affairs and global clinical development groups in order to be able to execute a fully integrated strategy. And I think as they looked at that, I think they had confidence that they can do it, but it'd be a tremendous amount of effort on their part and their leadership team to be able to do that. When they look at coming together with us, they ultimately said, ""Look, we can do the part that we think we're great at, and we can plug in to what you already have for all those other things."" The global clinical development group that we have, the medical affairs group that we have all around the world, the commercial organization that we have all around the world. And so I think they perceived it to be a win-win. So I think that's the first thing. Winning their hearts and their minds through that process, it was an important aspect of it. Second aspect of it was that obviously the CVRs, all of the leadership team and many of the employees have either ownership in the company or they have -- and they have stock options, right? So these CVRs are pretty important to them. They can extract a tremendous amount of value through that process if they deliver against those CVRs, and I can tell you that's a pretty healthy financial incentive for them to stay and execute against those. And I can tell you, in the interactions that I had with them -- we had with them, I should say, I can tell you that's an important point to them. Third thing is they wanted the stock transaction. Now they wanted it somewhat for tax purposes, but they also wanted it because they wanted to believe that they could share in the upside, and some of what they agreed to do with their options only reinforced that. Meaning, their Stemcentrx options and what they will become and how that value will be derived. And so I think there's a very high likelihood that we will retain the key people in this, and I think they like our culture, and they like the environment that they're operating in, and so I tell you, I have a fairly high level of confidence, and I think Pharmacyclics demonstrates. We have retained all of the key clinical development people, and I've spent time, Mike has spent time with that team. I think, they're very happy being part of AbbVie. And they get to execute their strategy that they wanted as an independent company as well or better than they could as an independent company. So I feel pretty good about that, but it's an important point. On the Pfizer transaction, it's something we want to be careful with because I'm not sure what their confidentiality agreement is.

But essentially, what we have is we co-fund a discovery effort to find new innovative targets in a number of different areas, oncology is one of them, disease of the aging is another, neurodegenerative disease is another area that ultimately we have a lot of interest in. And the way it works is essentially we can opt in on anything that's discovered there, and then the point at which we take it over, we have commercial rights to it and is basically a 50-50 profit-sharing arrangement between us and Calico.

So we intend to move very quickly, but it takes a bit of time before programs are ready for clinical introduction and sort of news flow that would -- you'd expect to hear in this sort of setting.

I'll take VIEKIRA, and Bill can take the HUMIRA question, and we'll have Mike cover the ASCO question. So VIEKIRA, let me start with Japan. Japan is continuing to track consistent with our expectations, so I think there's nothing all that remarkable in Japan. It's a good market. Our profile within that market is a good profile. The U.S. has certainly been more challenging. I would say that it's a combination of several factors, some volume losses as well as some price loss. As Merck has entered the market, we know that they set the list price lower than the other products in the marketplace. That strategy initially, I think, we interpreted as a strategy that we would go after medical exceptions because medical exceptions historically are in at more of a list price point, and so they have the lowest price essentially on a medical exception basis, and they have been somewhat successful in gaining some of those medical exceptions. So that's part of the issue. The second part of the issue though is they have been more aggressive than we anticipated from a pricing standpoint, particularly in the public segments, the VA in particular. And as we looked at that, we ultimately made the decision that we were not going to compete with the lowest overall price in the VA. We did adjust our price down, but we didn't adjust it down to the very lowest price, and that has caused us to obviously lose price but also lose volume, and we had a fairly significant share of VA. So I think it is those factors playing out. And I would say that based on where the U.S. is going, it is unlikely that we will achieve the $2 billion number that we described earlier. I think a number that you should be thinking about now is more in the 1 6 range, globally I'm talking about. And you can look at this quarter as an example even though VIEKIRA was weaker than we expected. We obviously beat our EPS number and achieved our revenue numbers. So it talks to the strength of the rest of the business. And a nice thing about our business is we have good balanced performance across a number of different assets. And so when one thing doesn't go as well as we had hoped, then others can pick up the slack. So we will not be changing our guidance based on this. We factored that into our going-forward guidance in 2016, and we're comfortable with the guidance that we provided you, but those are the facts around VIEKIRA."

You'll start to see data on some of our newer ADCs, and we continue to have a number of programs that will be moving into clinical development in oncology. So overall, we're going to be very active at ASCO, and of course, we're also having our R&D Day to coincide with the timing of ASCO, so you'll see a broad update on our pipeline there."

First on the Stemcentrx transaction. Could you provide a little bit more detail on the earn out, the press release references milestones and you mentioned in passing the first-line indication, but if you could provide some more granularity that would be great. Second, I would imagine this was a competitive auction, given especially as Stemcentrx has got a finance professional as a CEO and several high profile tech investors involved. Perhaps you could just give us some sense of the competitive dynamics if you think about valuation? Second, in reference to your comments on your IL-23, you highlighted it as your proxy compound in psoriatic arthritis. What's the future for ABT-122? Do you intend to proceed in either psoriasis arthritis or psoriasis in RA for that compound? And then finally, more broadly, now that you've got a lung candidate in your oncology pipeline, how do you think about augmenting that compound going forward?"

So if they take one asset and they move it through and when we take it to a registration study and we determine that, that asset in that indication would generate a commercial asset that had greater than $1 billion worth of revenue, then we would pay them $500 million. And then if they do a second one or a third one or a fourth one, they can get up to 4 $500 million milestones. So that's how the contingent payments are laid out. On the competitive dynamics, it was a competitive process. It was relatively blind to us, so we don't know who the other competitors were, but we do know there are other players that were involved, and I'd say it ended up being us and one other player at the very end who were competing for the asset through that process. And ultimately, as I told you, on the valuation, it is consistent with what they said to you before. If you look at what we are paying in the base case for this asset, [indiscernible] and you are looking at the base case for us without [indiscernible] as a significantly positive NPV and well above the threshold at which we look at the cutoff for IRRs, and so this is a transaction that we feel very comfortable from financial standpoint. And we've obviously built in the upside for first line because we don't have data on the first line right now. And we didn't want to be in a position where we're paying for something that we didn't know what it was going to look like. We were very comfortable with the second and third line because we saw a data that supported that, human data that supported that. I do believe, based on everything I've seen, I think that Mike and others believe that there is a higher probability this asset will move into first line, but we are going to pursue it aggressively. And if they do, they will get the incremental reward and we will obviously get the incremental award of being able to move into that. We have specified where -- how the guidelines have to characterize the asset, that it would be a broad-based first-line agent in order for that milestone to be paid. On the BI and 122, Mike, why don't you cover that?"

I think based on what we know about the pathway, it makes sense to make that same statement about psoriatic arthritis. We're very pleased with the data we've seen today. We think there is really tremendous potential for that asset. With respect to ABT-122, which is our IL-17/TNF DVD, we are going to be seeing mid-stage data internally in the middle of this year. So shortly, we'll probably be in a position to present that externally around the ACR time frame. And so we'll make a decision when we have those data. But what I can say is to move forward with those molecules. It would have to fit our strategy with that molecule with ABT-122. It would have to fit our strategy to raise the bar on the standard of care. So we would be looking for a differentiated efficacy compared to not only what we have in our own portfolio but what's available externally. And so we'll be making that decision later on this year. 
With respect to your question about our presence in lung cancer, we've said for quite some time that we want to build our presence in solid tumors. I think the Stemcentrx acquisition clearly does that. It gives us a broad platform as well as a very promising lead asset and other clinical assets behind that. And so we're going to continue to build on that presence not only with the development engine that comes from Stemcentrx but with our internal pipeline. And I think you'll see that we have a number of programs that could be applicable to lung cancer and other solid tumors that will be moving through the clinic shortly."

Are you talking small cell alone, other indications, and sort of give some more granular color on how you built up to that number? And then the second question. Now that you have purchased Stemcentrx that have been licensed IL-23 from BI, can you give a little bit more color on how you see the R&D line evolving over the next few years? So specifically, with regard to the 2020 guidance, are you going to be able to keep hold, essentially, the greater than 50% non-GAAP operating guidance that you've given previously?

As far as of the model, obviously, we went through the model in some level of detail around Pharmacyclics, one, because of the magnitude of the investment that we were making, and we described what supported that investment and how we've built up the model. What I characterized for you already basically tells you how we built of this model, right? It's built primarily around second and third line, which we believe -- small cell, which we believe as they -- has a very high probability of success. So you could imagine we risk-adjusted it accordingly at a high probability of success. It does have a couple of other smaller indications where we believe there is a very high probability of being able to extend it into some of these other cancers that we described. I wouldn't say that has a significant impact on it, and those are risk-adjusted accordingly. It doesn't have first line in it. And the milestone or the CBR is basically driven off of what we think the value would be and the return would be appropriate for first-line, and it doesn't have any other of these other milestone-driven POCs that would come forward. So I think that's roughly the same kind of guidance we gave share and some other kinds of things. And we've obviously built the model around those same kinds of assumptions. But I think, in this case, we'll wait to provide that at a later date, once we get closer to a launch of the asset in 2018. On the R&D line, or I think really what you're asking is, are we still committed to delivering 50% or greater in 2020, and the short answer to that is yes. We've looked at it. We've carefully looked at the commitments we made around the compounded growth rate and the revenue projections as well as the operating margin profile that we communicated last year, and we're still absolutely committed to delivering against that."

I mean, first of all, if you look at the guidance that we provided back in, I think it was October 29 of last year, and you look at what happened to the consensus numbers, what you'll see is they shifted out roughly a year. I think the mean now is probably, if you look at where people are assuming biosimilar impact in the United States, it's probably in that 2019 -- Larry, correct me if I'm wrong here, a 2019 time frame, so moved out from about '17 to 2019. And I'd say one of the things we tracked to try to understand how the market is perceiving that guidance is we track what our stock performance has been versus our peers over that period of time. And I saw it just the other day, it may have changed in the last couple of days a little bit, but we're the #1 performing stock since that point in time. So I think it was around 14% appreciation or something like that, 15% appreciation. So I think it did have a positive impact. Having said that, I would agree with your point that there's still this overhang, and this overhang is built around different catalysts. As we've said before, we've given a lot of clarity in that review of what our IP strategy is and the confidence that we have in our IP strategy. How the market will relate to that, that's a little harder for me to describe or predict, I'd say. But certainly, I think, as it plays out, I think the market will basically start to better understand what our position is. And certainly, as you have more confidence around of that, I think you will see the sentiment change. I think the bigger issue, and I think Rova-T and IL-23 are 2 good examples, but we obviously have a point of view of what we think is going to happen. We've communicated what that point of view looks like. I think, in very clear terms. That doesn't mean that everybody believes that point of view. But what I'd say is, if you look at even the bare case on HUMIRA, which we certainly don't agree with, and you look at this pipeline that we now assembled for the assets that have a very high probability of success, I think even in the most bare case possible, most people would look at that pipeline and say they should be able to grow through whatever happens. Now obviously, we have a different view of what we think is going to happen. But even if you look at least the models I've looked at that have the worst case built into them, when I look at our pipeline and the probability of success of those assets I described in my formal remarks and usually add them up, risk-adjust them based on the data you've seen and the commercial success you would expect from those assets, I think a reasonable person would draw the conclusion that you can grow through that. And I think that ultimately will be the calculus that investors are going to have to make."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We delivered another strong quarter with results well ahead of our expectations, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, representing growth of 16.7% versus the second qua",1227,"Think you, Lis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We delivered another strong quarter with results well ahead of our expectations, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, representing growth of 16.7% versus the second quarter of 2015. 
Our results in the quarter included strong top line performance with global operational sales growth of 18%, reflecting robust growth from several products in our portfolio, including HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, among others. 
We're pleased with our outperformance in the quarter and progress year-to-date. We've driven outstanding commercial, operational and R&D execution, resulting in strong top and bottom line results. Based on our performance in the first half of the year, we're raising our full year 2016 EPS guidance to $4.73 to $4.83 on an adjusted basis, reflecting growth of 11.4% at the mid-point. 
As I mentioned, several products within our portfolio are driving robust growth. HUMIRA continues to drive strong performance, delivering global operational growth of more than 17% in the quarter. Despite increasing competition from new classes of drugs and indirect biosimilar competition in international markets, HUMIRA continues to demonstrate exceptional performance and durability across all 3 market segments. 
In rheumatology, HUMIRA is the #1 prescribed biologic, and we continue to grow our share position in the face of new competition. And in Dermatology and Gastro, HUMIRA continues to hold a strong market leadership position, demonstrating double-digit growth year-over-year.
We also continue to be pleased with the strong IMBRUVICA performance, which is tracking in line to slightly ahead of our expectations following our approval for first-line use in CLL. IMBRUVICA has achieved the #1 market share position in all approved disease indications in second line and second line plus treatment. And since we received the FDA approval of IMBRUVICA as the first-line treatment for CLLlate late in the first quarter, IMBRUVICA has already gained the market share position in first-line in the midteens and the third position in the market. And this share continues to steadily increase with approximately 1 of every 6 patients now receiving IMBRUVICA as a front-line therapy, surpassing FCR, which is generally considered the gold standard for young and fit CLL patients. 
This market share and the strong momentum underlying its performance further reinforces our confidence and our long-term expectations for IMBRUVICA that supported our decision to acquire Pharmacyclics last year. 
We also saw strong performance from several other products in our portfolio, including Duodopa, Creon and Lupron. Each of these therapies within our marketed product portfolio continue to deliver durable performance. Global VIEKIRA sales in the second quarter were $419 million, up 8.2% on an operational basis. Growth in the quarter was driven by our international business. In the U.S, as we describe when our first quarter call, we have seen market share loss and some price erosion due to the entry of a new competitor into the HCV market.
We are nearing the completion of our registrational studies for our next generation pan genotypic HCV combination. Based on the mid-stage data we've disclosed to date, we believe that our new HCV combination will be highly competitive. The data illustrates that this therapy can deliver share rates approaching 100% across unit types. And we believe the majority of patients will be well served with an 8-week treatment option. We expect to see results from the pivotal studies in the second half and we remain on track for commercialization next year.
In addition to our strong financial results, we've continued to advance our strategic priorities and have made excellent progress with our R&D pipeline. Mike will cover the pipeline in more detail in just a few moments, so I'll only mention a few highlights. 
Importantly, we successfully completed the acquisition of Stemcentrx. We've been impressed by the caliber of talent we've welcomed from Stemcentrx and the transition has been seamless. The addition of Stemcentrx is a strategically and financially compelling opportunity for our company, getting AbbVie a highly attractive platform for solid tumors in an extremely exciting late stage asset in Rova-T. The transaction enables AbbVie to further expand and accelerate our presence in oncology, building upon our growing position in hematological oncology. We are moving rapidly to advance Rova-T in its lead indications, third line small cell lung cancer, and we continue to feel confident about our 2017 DLA filing strategy and launch in 2018.
We are also rapidly advancing studies to evaluate Rova-T in earlier lines of therapy for small cell lung cancer, including combination studies with both chemotherapy and immuno-oncology agents. Earlier this week, we jointly announced the clinical collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to evaluate the combination of Rova-T with BMS immuno-oncology agents in small cell lung cancer with trials beginning this year. We're pleased to be partnering with BMS to bring innovative new therapies forward that have the potential to significantly improve the survival of patients with small cell lung cancer, a disease with devastating outcomes.
We also continue to make significant progress with our hematological oncology portfolio. We're building upon our strong position with IMBRUVICA in treating blood cancers with Venclexta. During the quarter, we received the first FDA approval for Venclexta for patients with plaques refractory CLL, who harbor the 17p dilution, a difficult-to-treat form of a deceased typically associated with poor prognosis. The approval for this transformative therapy was granted under breakthrough therapy and priority review designations, and the launch is still in its early stages. Although this first indication is a relatively small patient population, it is important to provide patients with this difficult-to-treat disease, new therapy with strong clinical results and it's also important to give physicians an opportunity to gain experience to the particularly initial dosing regiment of Venclexta to ensure patients receive the benefit of this therapy.
We expect data from the Phase III study evaluating Venclexta in a broader set of relapsed refractory CLL patients to read out next year, supporting our regulatory submission for an expanded label covering all relapsed refractory CLL patients, a much larger population. Like IMBRUVICA, we believe that Venclexta will be effective across a range of hematological malignancies with high unmet need, and we're actively evaluating additional indications, including acute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma, among others. 
We also continue to make progress across other important areas of our pipeline. During the quarter, we presented positive results for our mid-stage study of our anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. The pivotal program for is in psoriasis, and it's underway and enrolling very well. And in partnership with by region, we recently received FDA and EC approval for Zinbryta for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. We plan to launch Zinbryta in the U.S. in August.
In summary, we continue to be pleased with our strong execution and the significant advancements in our pipeline. As we outlined in our recent R&D day, we have 8 late stage assets, which have been significantly derisked and have the potential to drive meaningful revenue growth in the years to come. We continued to demonstrate an exceptional track record of success with positive clinical data and regulatory outcomes and strong commercial performance. We intend to build on this momentum to drive a high level of performance across our operations in the second half of the year. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for some additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?"

We had another very productive quarter from an R&D perspective with significant progress on several programs, including the FDA approval of Venclexta for its first indication in patients with relapsed refractory CLL with a 17p deletion mutation, as well as the FDA and EMA approvals of the Zinbryta for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Today, I'll highlight additional update and discuss some of the milestones we anticipate in the second half of 2016.
I'll start with our oncology portfolio, an area where we are growing our already strong position in hematological malignancies, as well as establishing a strong foundation in solid tumors, which was significantly accelerated by a recent acquisition of Stemcentrx and its lead asset, Rova-T. 
At the ASCO meeting in early June, we presented data from a Phase II trial in small cell lung cancer that demonstrated that Rova-T monotherapy drove a 1-year survival rate of 32% in DLL3-positive patients, almost triple that of historical third line standard of care at 12%. In addition to the impressive 1-year survival, Rova-T showed the most compelling single agent activity in terms of overall response rate, clinical benefit rate and progression-free survival in third line small cell lung cancer, the patient population where our first pivotal trial for registration is rapidly enrolling.
The confirmatory third line registrational trial, which is called Trinity, began in January and is expected to complete enrollment by the end of 2016 with commercialization expected in 2018. We're also quickly advancing Rova-T in the studies to support front-line treatment in small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. The first line development program includes a Phase I 2 regimen flexion study that will be used to inform future Phase III pivotal trials evaluating various combinations of Rova-T and chemotherapy. The regimen selection study is expected to begin next quarter. 
The first-line program also includes the study, a Phase III registrational trial evaluating standard chemotherapy followed by Rova-T in the front-line setting. We expect to have this study up and running by the end of the year. 
We are also advancing and A arm basket study, evaluating Rova-T in a range of neuro endocrine tumor, where DLL3 plays an important role. The study is on track to begin this quarter with data expected next year. Given that many of these tumor types have low survival rates and limited treatment options available, there may be an opportunity to explore single arm studies to support accelerated approval. As Rick mentioned earlier this week, we announced the clinical collaboration with BMS to evaluate the investigational combination of Rova-T with AbbVie and with AbbVie in, in small cell lung cancer. We believe that combining Rova-T with these checkpoint inhibitors could drive enhanced and sustained efficacy, above what that which either approach could offer individually.
Preclinical evidence and biological rational supports our prioritization of efforts to find Rova-T with AiO agents, and we believe these combinations have the potential to establish a new standard of care. 
We expect to begin the Rova-T AiO combination study by the end of the year. In addition to Rova-T, we've also continued to make progress with our pipeline assets targeting in solid tumors. In particular, our PARP-inhibitor, ABT-414, an antibody for glioblastoma multiform. We presented Phase I data for both of these assets at the recent ASCO meeting and anticipate data readouts from registration-enabling studies for both programs over the next 12 months. We also continue to make good progress with our hematologic oncology portfolio. In the second quarter, the FDA updated the IMBRUVICA level to include new data from 2 Phase III trials supporting expanded use in patients with CLL and SLL, including overall survival data from both the 8 2 [ph] and Leo's trials. IMBRUVICA is also being about it in mid-to late-stage trials for several additional indications with timing of data readouts and potential regulatory submissions dependent on analyses of ongoing studies.
In June, IMBRUVICA received breakthrough therapy designation as a potential treatment of chronic run versus host disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy, marking the drug's fourth breakthrough therapy designation. The FDA also granted IMBRUVICA a drug designation for the same condition. The breakthrough designation was based on clinical data from a Phase II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA for the treatment of patients with steroid dependent or refractory chronic GVHD. A registrational study in graft-versus-host disease is underway with data expected late this year or early 2017.
We've made significant progress with the development of another important strategic asset, our novel BCL-2 inhibitor, Venclexta, which is being developed in collaboration with Roche. Venclexta was recently approved under priority review for first syndication in patients with relapsed refractory CLL with 17p deletion. Earlier this year, Venclexta also received the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation for use in combination with rituximab for the treatment of patients with relapsed refractory CLL. The Phase III morono trial, which will support a broader label in relapsed refractory CLL, is fully enrolled with data readout and regulatory submission anticipated in 2017. Additionally, we have an active Phase III program evaluating Venclexta in treatment-naïve CLL patients with studies underway and progressing well.
Like IMBRUVICA, we believe Venclexta will be effective across a range of blood cancers, including AML and multiple myeloma. We recently started a Phase III program evaluating Venclexta in combination with standard of care in multiple myeloma, and we anticipate moving forward with Phase III development in AML by the end of the year. In addition to the elements of the program I've described, we continue to be excited about the ongoing legal relation of combinations of drug for Venclexta, which we believe have the potential strive to provide responses and minimal residual disease negative the team in a number of clinical settings. Now I would like to turn our attention to the immunology portfolio, where we have 2 late stage assets, our anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody with and our selective Jack 1 inhibitor, ABT-494. Each of these assets have the potential to significantly advance standard of care in immune mediated conditions, such as RA, psoriasis and Crohn's disease, covering the major market segments where we currently have a leadership position. 
ABT-494 is currently in Phase III development for rheumatoid arthritis, where we are studying the asset in 6 pivotal trials. Our jack inhibitor has of the potential to be best-in-class with what we believe will be an optimized benefit risk profile. Our development strategy is aimed at delivering a comprehensive labor to cover multiple lines of therapy from first-line use in meta naive patients to use in patients with inadequate response to Biologics, where the highest unmet need remains in this market. Data from the ABT-494 Phase III RA program is expected in the first half of 2018 with commercialization targeted in 2019.
We have also accelerated the development of this important asset in gastrointestinal disorders. Our Phase II study in Crohn's disease is well underway and data should be available internally later this year. This will enable the decision to advance of the Phase III development by the first quarter of next year. You can expect to see the data from this Phase II Crohn study at DDW next year. In addition, we recently initiated a Phase II study in ulcerative colitis with data expected in 2018.
Risankizumab is another strategic important late stage immunology asset. This anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, which we licensed from Berggren earlier this year has the potential to be a transformative therapy by providing best-in-class efficacy with increased dosing convenience. Risankizumab that is currently in Phase III psoriasis trial and in mid-stage development for both Crohn's disease and psoriatic arthritis. Interest in the Phase III psoriasis program has been strong and enrollment is progressing very well. We continue to expect data from the registrational program in 2018. 
At the Digestive Disease Week meeting in May, we reported encouraging results from a Phase II study of risankizumab in patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease, a particularly difficult-to-treat population given that the majority of these patients had previously failed treatment with one or more TNF antagonists. Based on these strong results, with intent to move rapidly into Phase III studies in Crohn's disease with registration trials commencing later this year or early next year.
Another technology that we believe holds great promise is our proprietary by specific antibody platform. We've introduced a number of these assets into the clinic in both our immunology and oncology therapeutic areas. Based on our early-stage studies, we've established performance of concept across several programs, demonstrating that these antibodies possess good drug like properties and deliver the desired pharmacodynamic effects. And we've learned how to successfully and consistently manufacture them. We recently evaluated data from 1 of our bio specific programs in development, ABT-112, our combination anti TNF and anti-IL-17 in Phase II trials for RA and psoriatic arthritis. The data demonstrated that ABT-122 is well tolerated with a safety profile that was comparable to HUMIRA. In the mid-stage psoriatic arthritis and RA studies, ABT-122 showed ACR20 response rates as high as 75% and 82%, respectively, demonstrating that the platform worked well with clear evidence of biologic activity. However, the simultaneous inhibition of IO 17 and TNF alpha did not produce the strong synergistic effect necessary to differentiate ABT-122 from other candidates in our pipeline, such as ABT-494 and risankizumab. As a result, we have made the decision not to pursue for the development of this assets. 
While in this particular setting, we didn't see the high-level of the much hated we were seeking, the validation of the bispecific platform gives us confidence to continue to advance other programs with different mechanisms of action. Also in our immunology portfolio, we continue to make progress with an, an ANTI IO6 receptor antibody being developed in collaboration with our links for patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. Earlier this month, AbbVie announced positive topline results from a Phase II monotherapy study demonstrating that this asset improves symptoms of RA. We expect results from a second Phase II study evaluating use of methotrexate in the third quarter, which will allow us to determine next steps for development of this asset.
In the quarter, we also made significant progress in other key therapeutic areas and are on track to advance several programs in the second half of the year. And virology, our next-generation HCV program, is progressing well. 
Early in the quarter, in The International Liver Congress, we presented new data on our pan-genotypic once-daily ribavirin-free combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in patients with genotypes 1 through 6, including data on treatment durations as short as 8 weeks. The data illustrate that with 8 weeks of treatment, 97% and 98% of genotype 1 through 3 patients without cirrhosis treated with AbbVie's next generation regimen achieved sustained virologic response in 12 weeks. Additionally, 100% of genotype 4 through 6 patients without cirrhosis achieved SVR 12 with 12 weeks of treatment. Overall, we believe that AbbVie's next-generation HCV therapy will be able to address our meaning unmet medical need within this market. We continue to expect to see results from the Phase III trials in the coming months, and we remain on track for commercialization next year.
And in the area of women's health, we are nearing completion of our Phase III Uma Trios program with rectal a submission plans for 2017. Earlier this year, we announced positive topline results from the second of 2 replicate -- pivotal Phase III clinical trials involving elagolix in premenopausal women who suffered pain from interim metriosos. The results show that after 6 months of continuous treatment, both doses of elagolix met the study's co-primary endpoints with elagolix reducing scores of menstrual pain and non-menstrual pelvic pain in month 3 and month 6.
We plan to present detailed results from both Phase III studies, including extension study data up to 12 months, at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in October. And our Phase III studies in uterine fibroids are underway and progressing well. This program is investigating the effect of elagolix on heavy bleeding related to this highly prevalent condition. 
So in summary, we can take to make significant progress with our pipeline and are on track for further advancements in the remainder of 2016. We have a broad pipeline that includes more than 50 active clinical development programs, including more than 20 new products or indications in late stage development or under regulatory review. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our second quarter performance."

This morning, I'll review our second quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2016, inclusive of the recently completed Stemcentrx transaction and the VI collaboration. We're very pleased with our strong second quarter",1104,"Thanks, Mike. This morning, I'll review our second quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2016, inclusive of the recently completed Stemcentrx transaction and the VI collaboration. 
We're very pleased with our strong second quarter results. In addition to delivering strong operational sales growth of 18%, we exceeded the mid-point of our adjusted earnings per share guidance range by $0.06 and it delivered growth of nearly 17% over the second quarter of 2015. As Rick mentioned, we continue to see strong momentum from HUMIRA with global sales of more than $4.1 billion, up 17.7% operationally.
In the U.S, HUMIRA sales increased nearly 27%. We continue to see midteens prescription volume growth across the brand, fueled by robust demand in the room, derm and astral market segments. In the quarter, we also saw a low single-digit benefit on the growth rate as a result of customer buying patterns versus the prior year quarter. Channel inventory levels in both the second quarter of 2015 and 2016 were below half a month.
International HUMIRA sales were more than $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4% on an operational basis and exceeding our prior guidance of 3% operational growth for the quarter. Internationally, HUMIRA continues to maintain its strong market leadership position. We continue to see only modest overall market share gains for biosimilar REMICADE in major markets in line with our planning assumptions. At while still early in the launch, the admiral by similar continues to perform in line with our assumptions.
Global IMBRUVICA net revenues were $439 million in the quarter. U.S. sales were $384 million and our international profit-sharing was $55 million. Global we care sales in the second quarter were $419 million. This reflects weaker quarter-over-quarter sales from the U.S. due to competitive dynamics, offset by our performance in international markets.
Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew nearly 29% on an operational basis in the quarter, continuing to grow by double digits internationally with a modest level of U.S. sales, as expected.
We also saw strong operational sales growth in the quarter from both Creon and Lupron, which were up 13% and 11%, respectively. As Rick noted, in the quarter, we received approval for 2 new products, Venclexta and Zinbryta. We launched Venclexta early in the quarter in its initial indication for relapsed refractory CLL patients with a 17p deletion, which represents the smaller addressable patient population in the U.S. We have begun a beta measure commercial rollout to ensure adequate position training and we expect a modest level of a ventricle sales for 2016. 
For Zinbryta, we plan to launch in the U.S. in August. Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 81.9% of sales. On a comparative year-over-year basis, this ratio reflects an adverse impact from foreign exchange of roughly 320 basis points. In addition, the adjusted gross margin reflects 160 basis points of unfavorable impact related to the Pharmacyclics acquisition, including the proper transfer from IMBRUVICA. Adjusting for these impacts, gross margin profile performance improved by approximately 140 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted R&D was 15.5% of sales, reflecting funding actions supporting the pipeline, as well as the impact of both Stemcentrx transaction and the VI collaboration.
Adjusted SG&A was 22.2% of the sales in the second quarter, down 290 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 43.9% of sales, down 30 basis points relative to the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange and the Pharmacyclics acquisition, operating margin profile performance improved 370 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $225 million and the adjusted tax rate was 20.1% in the quarter. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding noncash intangible amortization expense and specified items, were $1.26, up 16.7% year-over-year.
Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our strong business performance year-to-date, we are raising our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range to $4.73 to $4.83, reflecting adjusted EPS growth of 11.4% at the mid-point. This includes the previously communicated $0.28 of dilution related to the Stemcentrx acquisition and the VI collaboration.
We are also updating our 2016 GAAP diluted EPS guidance range to $3.82 to $3.92, which includes $0.91 per share of noncash intangible asset amortization expense and other specified items, including acquisition cost and accounting impacts associated with Stemcentrx and the VI collaboration. On the top line, we expect full year sales approaching $26 billion. Foreign exchange dynamics have run favorable unfavorable relative to our initial projections, and we are now forecasting approximately 1% of negative top line impact from currency for the full year.
Based on our strong performance year-to-date, we now expect U.S. HUMIRA operational sales growth of more than 20%. And we remain on track with our previously communicated full year guidance for international HUMIRA with operational growth in the mid single-digits. 
We now forecast an adjusted gross margin profile approaching 81%, impacted by stronger performance of hedge currencies in 2016. The gross margin profile also reflects 130 basis points of impact related to the pharma cyclic's acquisition. Excluding this and the year-over-year change impacts, the gross margin profile is expected to improve relative to 2015 by roughly 190 basis points. 
We are now forecasting R&D expense of more than 16% of sales, reflecting our increased R&D investments related to the Stemcentrx acquisition and the BI collaboration. And we expect SG&A to run at approximately 23% of sales. We now forecast an adjusted operating margin profile approaching 42% on a full year basis. We remain committed to delivering on our 2020 targetedof June forecast of above 50% of sales.
We are now forecasting net interest expense of approximately $925 million for the full year, above our original guidance of approximately $800 million as a result of the debt we issued for the Stemcentrx acquisition. And we expect an adjusted tax rate in the 20% to 21% range in 2016. 
Regarding the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 to $1.20. This excludes roughly $0.16 of specified items and noncash amortization and includes the dilutive impact of Stemcentrx and the BI collaboration. We are expecting high single-digit operational sales growth, excluding a modest negative foreign exchange impact in the quarter. 
So in conclusion, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter, as we've driven strong top and bottom line growth while also advancing on our strategic priorities and our pipeline. This puts us in a strong position to continue delivering industry-leading growth this year. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Lis."

So Rick, there's clearly substantial track value the company because of the uncertainty for investors around HUMIRA. And you've made positive cells to deal with building new growth drivers for R&D, aggressive this is the moment, as well as making clear your long-term expectations regarding HUMIRA. We've and so, despite great quarters like today, we'll we're still seeing vicious trade as substantial discounts appears. So is there anything else except for discussion terms of how you can unlock the track value the company, whether its through different capital allocation, separation of the oncology platform given the valuation they can carry these days or anything else? Second one for Mike, I wonder what is collaboration with Bristol on Rova-T tell you about what they are thinking regarding the positioning of their combination in small cell lung cancer? And then last maybe for Rick again. We're expecting that you'll in place in Q4 to initiate patent litigation against Amgen, and it will be beyond just a dosing and formulation patents and been more widely discussed to date. Those recent of expectations and do you think investors will be Wishard when we see what other patents Amgen has agreed that they are potentially infringing out to the patent builds?"

I'll cover the first and third one, and then I'll have Mike cover the other one. So on the on track value, what I would tell you is that if you look our PE, I think what you've seen, and if you look at the range of companies in our peer group, there are obviously companies that have a much lower PE for a variety set of reasons and there are companies where have higher PEs and the median PEs certainly above where we are. So there's certainly a level overran that's associated with the biosimilar uncertainty around HUMIRA. And I think what we have laid out for investors is a clear strategy that we put in place starting back in 2013 of how we were going to deal with that. Ultimately, we have a large portfolio of IP around HUMIRA, and we certainly expect that to be able to protect the asset, as we've described back in October. We have now added to the portfolio 2 fundamentally differentiated new assets in 494 recent and you're seeing some of that data play out. And so we fundamentally believe that those will allow us to ultimately be able to grow through what will obviously be, at some point, a biosimilar impact, both internationally, as well as in the U.S.. And then we've spent a considerable amount of time building a robust pipeline that we've shown at our R&D day and in our other events that had the ability to be able to ultimately generate a very significant revenue opportunity that will allow us to grow through even the most bearish impact that's out there for an analyst standpoint around biosimilars. So I think we've done the things that we think are important to be able to communicate and then ultimately build a strategy to be able to drive the business from a growth perspective because that was the chart that we set for the company when we launched. And I think we've demonstrated that we're capable of doing that. I think it will take some time for the litigation strategies to play out and for investors to continue to gain confidence. Having said that, we constantly look at different kinds of alternatives that we think truly are value enhancing to shareholders, but also value enhancing to the business itself. And we'll explore all of those in time to determine whether or not they make sense. I mean, I think, if anything, we've probably been on the proactive side of going out and building new growth platforms and other kinds of things to be able to sustain the business going forward. And we have seen the PE improve, and we would certainly expect that it will continue to improve. I mean, if you look at our performance, both currently, as well as going forward, as we projected it in our LRP, we will perform in the top tier of our peer groups. And we would expect that we'll start to see the PE reflect that to a greater extent going forward as the litigation strategy plays out more.
On the third question, and I'm sure there will be other questions around the litigation and I'll apologize in advance that this won't be a very satisfying answer for you, but it certainly, I think you'll understand why. We're now in the very active phase of litigation around HUMIRA biosimilars. And therefore, we're not in a position where we're going to be able to provide a lot of color. And we're certainly not in a position where we can do this play by play strategy of how we're going to deal with every aspect of it. That just wouldn't be a smart thing for us to do. What I can reiterate is this. Back in October, we outlined in detail the extensive portfolio of IP that we have for HUMIRA and our confidence in that IP. And it goes beyond any one single patent. And I can tell you, we remain confident in that IP portfolio and we've made it very clear that we intend to vigorously defend all of our IP against anyone that potentially infringes it. And so that process will play out. So as I said, it's just not prudent for us now in this phase ultimately lay out in detail the play-by-play. And so we're just not in a position to be able to do that."

So this is Mike, I'll take the question about the BMS collaboration. So I think that, first of all, we're very fortunate that after many years without much progress in the treatment of small cell lung cancer, there are very promising mechanisms coming forward, our own [indiscernible] a data that have been presented recently in immuno-oncology. And I think that offers real benefit for patients downstream. What I would say about the way the 2 companies are thinking about these assets, I think that the speed with which the deal came together really speaks for itself. And that collaboration would not have been possible in the short period of time if we were thinking about the assets very differently. As we've said in other settings, when one is thinking about the treatment of patients with small cell lung cancer, there are a couple of treatment goals. The first is that one needs to get disease control because these patients presents very ill with very rapidly progressing disease. And Rova-T has shown in its Phase II studies that it can do that and it can do that with a defined course of therapy. We also believe that the data strongly support that the responses with Rova-T will be durable. Now when one thing is about other treatment goals, it will be desirable to have a long-term surveillance on board after one achieves that initial strong and durable disease control. And we believe that AiO agents can play a real role there. So the collation with Bristol with past and we believe will provide very exciting data for patients with small cell lung cancer in the future."

I'll take the hep C question that you had. Certainly, we, as we said in the first quarter call, we have seen an impact of the new entrant into the marketplace.

Certainly, we, as we said in the first quarter call, we have seen an impact of the new entrant into the marketplace. I'd say we've seen it primarily in the public channels, particularly, I'd say, they VA. And it really boils down to a pricing strategy. And ultimately, we decided that we were not going to match the lowest price, the 8 week [ph] price that was out in the marketplace. Therefore, we lost a significant amount of share. I mean, at our peak, we probably add close to 40% share. And now we have shares that's more than the single-digit range. So I'd say that's the vast majority of the impact that we've seen. There has been some price impact also that play through, but the greater impact is clearly share loss in that public primarily. And so as we look forward to next generation and I think, as we look at the profile of that asset, obviously, from a clinical performance standpoint, it is everything we would have hoped it would be based on the data that we've seen so far, I think it'll be a highly competitive asset. It will also provide, because it is pan-genotypic, an opportunity to be able to bridge across all of the genotypes and in particular, in the United States, genotype 2 and 3, worse of all, they essentially had a strong position in the marketplace. And so this will even that playing field. So we fundamentally believe that next generation will allow us an opportunity to be able to grow our share. If you look outside the United States as an example and you look in countries where there is predominantly a 1B population, but even in some countries where there's significant 1A population, our market shares in most of those countries are in, I'd say, on the low-end 30%, on the high-end, sometimes it's high as 70%. And so we compete very well and the profile of 1B is certainly much more of a competitive profile to the alternatives that are available outside the United States. And so I think it gives you an idea of our ability to be able to perform in those markets. So we would hope and I think expect that next generation will allow us to be able to gain share in those marketplace. The $3 billion, you're probably going back to the first prediction. And I think we anticipate that we would get back into that range. But I'm going out of the business of predicting HCV at this point. I think what I would say is, despite the impact that we've seen in the U.S. from a share standpoint, I think it shows you how fundamentally strong the overall business is because we've taken a fairly substantial hit in the U.S. on HCV. But yet, we continue to perform at a very high level and offset all of that impact and are now raising guidance on top of that. So the balance of our entire business and in particular, I'd say HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA right now, gives us the ability to be able to do that. And so we're not dependent upon that single asset performing at a certain level. Michael?"

And that really just relates to the cut of the data, but they're one is using initial investigative reports or subsequent adjudicated assessments of objective response and doesn't bear on durability of those responses in any way. And the objective response and importantly, the clinical benefit rate, have both remained very high. The one-year survival has also been very consistent in the 30% plus range across the data cuts, which gives us a very good feel for the durability of those responses. And in this heavily pretreated patient population, the best estimate, the most rigorous, but also the highest 's estimate, of 1-year survival is about 12%. And in many cases, it may actually be lower than that. And so that 30% number we view as very important. So we don't see anything concerning with respect to the durability of the responses with Rova-T. So with respect to the remainder of the Stemcentrx pipeline, there are actually 5 programs in the clinic now, 1 of those is Rova-T. 2 are the Pfizer partnered programs, PTK7 and A 4. [ph] And then there are 2 other programs in the clinic for solid tumor indicators, but we haven't disclosed those targets or the particular tumors of interest at this point in time. In addition to those 5, there are 5 additional assets that will enter the clinic over the next 12 to 18 months, so by the end of 2017. And the areas of initial interest when one looks at the tumors that were 2 treated today, were obviously these small cell. There's also a focus on ovarian cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, among others."

So I'll cover those. So let me start with the biosimilar impact. Because as you've said, we've seen biosimilar with the REMICADE biosimilar in the market for quite some time and now we're in the early stages of the launch of double biosimilars in the, particularly in the European areas. So if you look at REMICADE, there are REMICADE biosimilars now in roughly 60 plus countries, like 62 countries. About 50 of those, a little more than 50 of those have pricing and reimbursement that are actively involved in marketing the product in those countries. And we've studied it very carefully. If you look at the overall share of biosimilars, it's less than 5%. It's about 4.5%. If you look at their share of REMICADE, it's about 20%, 22%, something like that. it varies a lot. So I'd say it's a high in tender based countries, like in Norway, Denmark, Poland, as an example, very high up market share in those. If you go more into the traditional Western European markets, more like in the 20% to 25% share of the REMICADE market. And the discounting has played out to basically range in the tender countries fairly high. I'd say that's 50% to 70% kind of range from a discounting standpoint and the rest of the market probably in that 30%, 40% kind of range. It has an impact on us at all. REMICADE, because it's infusion product in most of those countries, doesn't compete in the same space that we compete in. So then you move over to Enbrel. So Enbrel's approved now, the Enbrel biosimilar is approved in about 32 countries. This pricing and reimbursement about 1/3 of those countries right now. We've seen much lower discounting than what we've expected, I'd say. It ranges from as little as low single-digit discounting to maybe up in the 30% to 35% range in nontender countries and kind of the high 30s to high 50s in the tender countries. Again, it's playing out similar to the way we saw the REMICADE biosimilars. So In the tender countries, they're having higher share, like the Norways and the Denmarks, Germany, Sweden, single-digit kind of figures. So really, no substantial market share impact. But it's too early in the process for us to see that. I'd say the strategy that we anticipated and the one we put in place seems to be working well. But it's in the early rounds. You can see it in the performance of the business. You can see HUMIRA's continuing to grow in the international markets. And as you back out the Venezuela impact, you can see it's actually growing in the 6% or so range, 6.2% range. And so we are continuing to see good strong growth in those markets.
And so I'd say the early rounds are working like we had anticipated they would. And then -- but we need to get some more time and see how it plays out. But it's a good opportunity for us to see how our strategy is working and be able to modify that strategy. So that's essentially the biosimilar impact that we see. Nothing different than what we had expected. Now let me move over to dirham and the impact on 17s. I'd say, overall, we're very happy with our performance in the derm space. So if you look at the U.S, I'll talk specifically about the U.S. We've seen TRx grow, in fact, accelerate over the course of time. I mean, if you go back to the early part of 2015 or even look at the average across 2015, we have got a low double-digit TRx growth in first and second quarter. That's accelerated to like 17% or 18% tRX growth in dirham. And so we're seeing nice strong growth in that segment of the market. If you look at our revenue, very similar kind of profile. We had strong double-digit growth and now it's accelerated fairly dramatically, probably about 10 to 15 points above what it had been running at. If you look at market share, a lower overall market share is pretty stable to maybe slightly down, 1.5% or so. As we analyze it, it is really driven extensively by the Tesla experience, where we're seeing a lot more patients, particularly moderate and sometimes mild patients, coming into the category. And so therefore, the category is growing faster. And so that dilutes our market share position where we pull Tesla out and we look at our market share, our market share looks relatively stable. In particular, if you look at PSA, our overall share has been stable in the U.S. at about 32%. If you look at room PSA, it's actually increased about 3 points, which is the larger part of the PSA market. It's about 75% of the overall BSA market. And even the AS PSA has increased about 2 points. Psoriasis, Sisson, it's down about 1.5 to 2 points in total, but it's more driven by our Tesla. So overall, we feel very good about how the business is performing across all the indications, but certainly in durhim as well."

So I'll cover that and maybe Mike can jump in it on some of specifics. When we went into -- when we made the decision that the core growth -- future growth franchise on top of immunology was going to be oncology, we made a decision that we would invest in a way to try to build leadership positions in certain areas where we thought we had core competencies that are complementary to being able to perform those areas. So specifically, we've started with hematological oncology based on the assets that we had internally, as well as the opportunity to exist with Pharmacyclics. And our goal was to basically build a position where we thought we could drive to a leadership position within that category. So if you look at the assets we have today, including IMBRUVICA and where we think Venclexta will be able to expand to, it would tell us that we should have an opportunity to be able to bring forward innovative therapies in roughly 65% of the overall market in hematological malignancies. And I'd say that's an area where we feel comfortable with what we have. Now having said that, if we found unique opportunities, I think particularly in the acute leukemia side assets or technologies or a drug that we thought was particularly attractive and an area where we didn't think we have a strong asset already, certainly, we would pursue that kind of an asset. But I'd say from a platform standpoint, we feel very good about what we have in hematological malignancies, both internally, as well as the addition of Pharmacyclics that we did a year or so ago. On the solid tumor side, as we said before about Stemcentrx, one of the things that was attractive for us is we have a number of efforts internally to be able to identify new targets. And so we have on effort internally to be able to do that. We obviously have a collaboration with Calico. And part of the work that they're doing is to identify new oncology targets. But we wanted a more fundamental base platform for solid tumors. And one of the things that attracted us to Stemcentrx is we believe they have that. And we're excited about that opportunity. And Mike talked earlier about the number of candidates that will be moving out of that platform. And I think it's impressive what they've accomplished. And so that has built what we fundamentally believe will be the core platform for us in solid tumors in addition to what we already have. We certainly continue to look for again now, more individual kinds of technology place or assets that might be complementary to that, but we're not looking for another big platform. I don't know, Mike, would you want to add anything?"

And we think that is a real advantage for our program and one that we're going to continue to drive as we drive forward, for example, with the add back program to further enhance the understanding of how we can use elagolix to treat endometriosis and uterine fibroids. With respect to some of the issues you brought up on competitive programs, we don't really view potency as a primary driver here. In fact, the most potent agent in this axis is loopron and the problem is in fact, down the axes. We're trying to achieve a fine titration of those and we think a local mix has of the property to still allow us to do that. With respect to co-formulation with add back, there is nothing that would prevent us from co formulating with add back as well. And we believe of our time there maybe a number of strategies that can be used to protect on. And so we'll have flexibly to improve really many different strategies. And so we feel very good about the position of elagolix. We think it's an important treatment option. And we think that it's going to make a real impact on endometriosis.

We are not focused solely on the use in patients with germline BRCA mutations or other HRD deficient tumors. We are exploring the hypothesis in our Phase III program that part can augment DNA damage in chemotherapy. Essentially the press it doesn't have to come from a genetic it. It come from a predicate that this DNA damaging, which would increase the importance of DNA repair mechanisms. That hypothesis is being tested in a range of Phase III programs and non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer and in ovarian cancer. And those studies will start to read out in 2017. We'll have a number of important data readouts, which will tell us the role the part can play there. So we haven't focused on it as much in recent Investor Days, and that's largely because it is in a quiet where the studies are up and running. We're generating the results.

Indication-based pricing, I think, first evolved primarily in the oncology space. And it was driven, I think, by certain efforts to say you have an oncology agent that has very strong efficacy in a certain disease and might have significantly lower efficacy in another disease, and why would I pay the same for this strong efficacy as I would for relatively modest efficacy? I think that was how the concept originally evolved. As we look at HUMIRA and we look across all of the major indications at least, with every single indication, there's obviously some variation between the competitive profiles. But I'd say, in general, HUMIRA tends to perform across those broad set of indications in the top tier. And so that is how we view it. So indication-based pricing wouldn't be something that we think is very applicable for this specific asset in this particular class. And we haven't seen it take off much prior to this and we'll have to see how it plays out over time. Again, on the time, there are a lot. It may sound to like it's a fairly innocent issue around timing and the steps and what should play out. But I would tell you, it's not that from a litigation standpoint.

Think that will give you some good sense of the overall dynamics of the brand. And then I'll backup attack on bit about the business in general. Obviously, the brand's performing very, very well in the U.S. We grew at 26.7% in the Q. Script trends, the way we see them, we're in the midteens for the quarter. Our price was up -- it was actually up in the single digits. And then as we, as I said in my comments, we did see a modest impact from differences in customer order patterns. Again, we run this business at less than half a month inventory. But it gets a little tough to call at varies times. And we did see a little bit of demand differences between the Q. We had a little bit lower inventories in the second quarter of '15 relative to '16. So yes, I think the way you got to think about this is midteens growth from script and single-digit price. And when you add those up, yes, you can pretty much get to the 20% number that we've guided to. From an overall price standpoint, look, I would say if you back up and look at our growth our growth in the quarter of 18%, the majority was volume. Across the total book of business, we had a price impact of less than 4%. So the strategy that we've actually employed for the business and certainly, with our new products launching is this is going to be a product, a company that's fueled by volume and not price. Obviously, price, we do have an opportunity in certain markets to take it. But I would not say this is a company that is heavily dependent on price. And then as we look out over the LRP, we tend to scale down our price expectations in the U.S. because we think that's the prudent way to model."

We delivered another strong quarter, with results well ahead of our expectations, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, representing growth of 16.7% versus the second quarter of 2015. Our results in the quarter included strong top line performance, with global operational sales growth of 18%, reflecting robust growth from several products in our portfolio, including HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, among others. 
We're pleased with our outperformance in the quarter and progress year-to-date. We've driven outstanding commercial, operational and R&D execution, resulting in strong top and bottom line results. Based on our performance in the first half of the year, we're raising our full year 2016 EPS guidance to $4.73 to $4.83 on an adjusted basis, reflecting growth of 11.4% at the midpoint. 
As I mentioned, several products within our portfolio are driving robust growth. HUMIRA continues to drive strong performance, delivering global operational growth of more than 17% in the quarter. Despite increasing competition from new classes of drugs and indirect biosimilar competition in international markets, HUMIRA continues to demonstrate exceptional performance and durability across all 3 market segments. 
In rheumatology, HUMIRA is the #1 prescribed biologic, and we continue to grow our share position in the face of new competition. And in dermatology and gastro, HUMIRA continues to hold a strong market leadership position, demonstrating double-digit growth year-over-year.
We also continue to be pleased with the strong IMBRUVICA performance, which is tracking in line to slightly ahead of our expectations following our approval for first-line use in CLL. IMBRUVICA has achieved the #1 market share position in all approved disease indications in second-line and second-line-plus treatment. And since we received the FDA approval of IMBRUVICA as the first-line treatment for CLL late in the first quarter, IMBRUVICA has already gained the market share position in first-line in the mid-teens and the third position in the market. 
And this share continues to steadily increase, with approximately 1 of every 6 patients now receiving IMBRUVICA as a front-line therapy, surpassing FCR, which is generally considered the gold standard for young and fit CLL patients. This market share and the strong momentum underlying its performance further reinforces our confidence and our long-term expectations for IMBRUVICA that supported our decision to acquire Pharmacyclics last year. 
We also saw strong performance from several other products in our portfolio, including Duodopa, Creon and Lupron. Each of these therapies within our marketed product portfolio continue to deliver durable performance. Global VIEKIRA sales in the second quarter were $419 million, up 8.2% on an operational basis. Growth in the quarter was driven by our international business. In the U.S, as we describe when our first quarter call, we have seen market share loss and some price erosion due to the entry of a new competitor into the HCV market.
We are nearing the completion of our registrational studies for our next-generation pan-genotypic HCV combination. Based on the mid-stage data we've disclosed to date, we believe that our new HCV combination will be highly competitive. The data illustrates that this therapy can deliver share rates approaching 100% across genotypes. And we believe the majority of patients will be well served with an 8-week treatment option. We expect to see results from the pivotal studies in the second half, and we remain on track for commercialization next year.
In addition to our strong financial results, we've continued to advance our strategic priorities and have made excellent progress with our R&D pipeline. Mike will cover the pipeline in more detail in just a few moments, so I'll only mention a few highlights. 
Importantly, we successfully completed the acquisition of Stemcentrx. We've been impressed by the caliber of talent we've welcomed from Stemcentrx, and the transition has been seamless. The addition of Stemcentrx is a strategically and financially compelling opportunity for our company, getting AbbVie a highly attractive platform for solid tumors in an extremely exciting late-stage asset in Rova-T. 
The transaction enables AbbVie to further expand and accelerate our presence in oncology, building upon our growing position in hematological oncology. We are moving rapidly to advance Rova-T in its lead indication, third-line small cell lung cancer, and we continue to feel confident about our 2017 BLA filing strategy and launch in 2018. We are also rapidly advancing studies to evaluate Rova-T in earlier lines of therapy for small cell lung cancer, including combination studies with both chemotherapy and immuno-oncology agents. 
Earlier this week, we jointly announced the clinical collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to evaluate the combination of Rova-T with BMS's immuno-oncology agents in small cell lung cancer, with trials beginning this year. We're pleased to be partnering with BMS to bring innovative new therapies forward that have the potential to significantly improve the survival of patients with small cell lung cancer, a disease with devastating outcomes.
We've also continued to make significant progress with our hematological oncology portfolio. We're building upon our strong position with IMBRUVICA in treating blood cancers with Venclexta. 
During the quarter, we received the first FDA approval for Venclexta for patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, who harbor the 17p dilution, a difficult-to-treat form of a disease, typically associated with poor prognosis. The approval for this transformative therapy was granted under breakthrough therapy and priority review designations, and the launch is still in its early stages. 
Although this first indication is a relatively small patient population, it is important to provide patients with this difficult-to-treat disease, a new therapy with strong clinical results. And it's also important to give physicians an opportunity to gain experience with the particular initial dosing regimen of Venclexta to ensure patients receive the benefit of this therapy. 
We expect data from the Phase III study evaluating Venclexta in a broader set of relapsed/refractory CLL patients to read out next year, supporting our regulatory submission for an expanded label covering all relapsed/refractory CLL patients, a much larger population. Like IMBRUVICA, we believe that Venclexta will be effective across a range of hematological malignancies with high unmet need, and we're actively evaluating additional indications, including acute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma, among others. 
We also continue to make progress across other important areas of our pipeline. During the quarter, we presented positive results for a mid-stage study of our anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab, in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. The pivotal program for risankizumab is in psoriasis, and it's underway and enrolling very well. And in partnership with Biogen, we recently received FDA and EC approval for Zinbryta for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. We plan to launch Zinbryta in the U.S. in August.
In summary, we continue to be pleased with our strong execution and the significant advancements in our pipeline. As we outlined in our recent R&D day, we have 8 late-stage assets, which have been significantly derisked and have the potential to drive meaningful revenue growth in the years to come. We've continued to demonstrate an exceptional track record of success with positive clinical data and regulatory outcomes and strong commercial performance. We intend to build on this momentum to drive a high level of performance across our operations in the second half of the year. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for some additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?"

We had another very productive quarter from an R&D perspective, with significant progress on several programs, including the FDA approval of Venclexta for its first indication in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL with a 17p deletion m",2053,"Thank you, Rick. We had another very productive quarter from an R&D perspective, with significant progress on several programs, including the FDA approval of Venclexta for its first indication in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL with a 17p deletion mutation, as well as the FDA and EMA approvals of the Zinbryta for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Today, I'll highlight additional update and discuss some of the milestones we anticipate in the second half of 2016.
I'll start with our oncology portfolio, an area where we are growing our already strong position in hematological malignancies, as well as establishing a strong foundation in solid tumors, which was significantly accelerated by a recent acquisition of Stemcentrx and its lead asset, Rova-T. 
At the ASCO meeting in early June, we presented data from a Phase II trial in small cell lung cancer that demonstrated that Rova-T monotherapy drove a 1-year survival rate of 32% in DLL3-positive patients, almost triple that of historical third-line standard of care at 12%. In addition to the impressive 1-year survival, Rova-T showed the most compelling single-agent activity in terms of the overall response rate, clinical benefit rate and progression-free survival in third-line small cell lung cancer, the patient population where our first pivotal trial for registration is rapidly enrolling.
The confirmatory third-line registrational trial, which is called TRINITY, began in January and is expected to complete enrollment by the end of 2016, with commercialization expected in 2018. We are also quickly advancing Rova-T in the studies to support front-line treatment in small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. The first-line development program includes a Phase I/II regimen flexion study that will be used to inform future Phase III pivotal trials, evaluating various combinations of Rova-T and chemotherapy. The regimen selection study is expected to begin next quarter. 
The first-line program also includes the [indiscernible] study, a Phase III registrational trial evaluating standard chemotherapy followed by Rova-T in the front-line setting. We expect to have this study up and running by the end of the year. 
We are also advancing and 8-arm basket study, evaluating Rova-T in a range of neuroendocrine tumor, where DLL3 plays an important role. This study is on track to begin this quarter, with data expected next year. Given that many of these tumor types have low survival rates and limited treatment options available, there may be an opportunity to explore single-arm studies to support accelerated approval. 
As Rick mentioned earlier this week, we announced the clinical collaboration with BMS to evaluate the investigational combination of Rova-T with Opdivo and with Opdivo and Yervoy in small cell lung cancer. We believe that combining Rova-T with these checkpoint inhibitors could drive enhanced and sustained efficacy, above that which either approach could offer individually. 
Preclinical evidence and biological rational supports our prioritization of efforts to find Rova-T with IO agents, and we believe these combinations have the potential to establish a new standard of care. We expect to begin the Rova-T/IO combination study by the end of the year. 
In addition to Rova-T, we've also continued to make progress with our pipeline assets targeting solid tumors. In particular, our PARP-inhibitor, veliparib, and ABT-414, an antibody drug conjugate for glioblastoma multiforme. We presented Phase I data for both of these assets at the recent ASCO meeting and anticipate data readouts from registration-enabling studies for both programs over the next 12 months. 
We also continue to make good progress with our hematologic oncology portfolio. In the second quarter, the FDA updated the IMBRUVICA label to include new data from 2 Phase III trials, supporting expanded use in patients with CLL and SLL, including overall survival data from both the RESONATE-2 and HELIOS trials. 
IMBRUVICA is also being evaluated in mid- to late-stage trials for several additional indications, with timing of data readouts and potential regulatory submissions dependent on event-driven analysis of ongoing studies. In June, IMBRUVICA received breakthrough therapy designation as a potential treatment of chronic graft-versus-host  disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy, marking the drug's fourth breakthrough therapy designation. The FDA also granted IMBRUVICA a drug designation for the same condition. The breakthrough designation was based on clinical data from a Phase II study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA for the treatment of patients with steroid-dependent or refractory chronic GVHD. A registrational study in graft-versus-host disease is underway, with data expected late this year or early 2017.
We've made significant progress with the development of another important strategic asset, our novel BCL-2 inhibitor, Venclexta, which is being developed in collaboration with Roche. Venclexta was recently approved under priority review for first syndication in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL with 17p deletion. Earlier this year, Venclexta also received the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation for use in combination with rituximab for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. 
The Phase III MURANO trial, which will support a broader label in relapsed/refractory CLL, is fully enrolled, with data readout and regulatory submission anticipated in 2017. Additionally, we have an active Phase III program evaluating Venclexta in treatment-naïve CLL patients, with studies underway and progressing well.
Like IMBRUVICA, we believe Venclexta will be effective across a range of blood cancers, including AML and multiple myeloma. We recently started a Phase III program evaluating Venclexta in combination with standard of care in multiple myeloma, and we anticipate moving forward with Phase III development in AML by the end of the year. 
In addition to the elements of the program I've described, we continue to be excited about the ongoing clinical evaluation of combinations of IMBRUVICA and Venclexta, which we believe have the potential to drive profound responses and minimal residual disease negativity in a number of clinical settings. 
Now I'd like to turn our attention to the immunology portfolio, where we have 2 late-stage assets, our anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab, and our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494. Each of these assets has the potential to significantly advance standard of care in immune-mediated conditions, such as RA, psoriasis and Crohn's disease, covering the major market segments where we currently have a leadership position. 
ABT-494 is currently in Phase III development for rheumatoid arthritis, where we are studying the asset in 6 pivotal trials. Our JAK inhibitor has the potential to be best-in-class with what we believe will be an optimized benefit risk profile. Our development strategy is aimed at delivering a comprehensive label to cover multiple lines of therapy from first-line use in methotrexate-naive patients to use in patients with inadequate response to biologics, where the highest unmet need remains in this market. Data from the ABT-494 Phase III RA program is expected in the first half of 2018, with commercialization targeted in 2019.
We have also accelerated the development of this important asset in gastrointestinal disorders. Our Phase II study in Crohn's disease is well underway, and data should be available internally later this year. This will enable the decision to advance the Phase III development by the first quarter of next year. You can expect to see the data from this Phase II Crohn study at DDW next year. In addition, we recently initiated a Phase II study in ulcerative colitis, with data expected in 2018.
Risankizumab is another strategically important late-stage immunology asset. This anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, which we licensed from Boehringer Ingelheim earlier this year, has the potential to be a transformative therapy by providing best-in-class efficacy with increased dosing convenience. Risankizumab is currently in Phase III psoriasis trials and in mid-stage development for both Crohn's disease and psoriatic arthritis. Interest in the Phase III psoriasis program has been strong, and enrollment is progressing very well. We continue to expect data from the registrational program in 2018. 
At the Digestive Disease Week meeting in May, we reported encouraging results from a Phase II study of risankizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, a particularly difficult-to-treat population, given that the majority of these patients had previously failed treatment with one or more TNF antagonists. Based on these strong results, we intent to move rapidly into Phase III studies in Crohn's disease, with registration trials commencing later this year or early next year.
Another technology that we believe holds great promise is our proprietary bio-specific antibody platform. We've introduced a number of these assets into the clinic in both our immunology and oncology therapeutic areas. Based on our early-stage studies, we've established proof of concept across several programs, demonstrating that these antibodies possess good drug-like properties and deliver the desired pharmacodynamic effects. And we've learned how to successfully and consistently manufacture them. 
We recently evaluated data from 1 of our bio-specific programs in development, ABT-112, our combination anti-TNF and anti-IL-17 in Phase II trials for RA and psoriatic arthritis. The data demonstrated that ABT-122 was well tolerated, with a safety profile that was comparable to HUMIRA. In the mid-stage psoriatic arthritis and RA studies, ABT-122 showed ACR20 response rates as high as 75% and 82%, respectively, demonstrating that the platform worked well with clear evidence of biologic activity. However, the simultaneous inhibition of IL-17 and TNF-alpha did not produce the strong synergistic effect necessary to differentiate ABT-122 from other candidates in our pipeline, such as ABT-494 and risankizumab. As a result, we have made the decision not to pursue further development of this asset.
While in this particular setting, we didn't see the high-level of differentiation we were seeking, the validation of the bio-specific platform gives us confidence to continue to advance other programs with different mechanisms of action. 
Also in our immunology portfolio, we continue to make progress with vobarilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor nanobody being developed in collaboration with Ablynx, for patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. Earlier this month, Ablynx announced positive top line results from a Phase II monotherapy study, demonstrating that this asset improves symptoms of RA. We expect results from a second Phase II study evaluating use of methotrexate in the third quarter, which will allow us to determine next steps for development of this asset.
In the quarter, we also made significant progress in other key therapeutic areas and are on track to advance several programs in the second half of the year. In virology, our next-generation HCV program is progressing well. 
Early in the quarter, at the International Liver Congress, we presented new data on our pan-genotypic once-daily ribavirin-free combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in patients with genotypes 1 through 6, including data on treatment durations as short as 8 weeks. The data illustrate that with 8 weeks of treatment, 97% and 98% of genotype 1 through 3 patients without cirrhosis treated with AbbVie's next-generation regimen achieved sustained virologic response in 12 weeks. Additionally, 100% of genotype 4 through 6 patients without cirrhosis achieved SVR12 with 12 weeks of treatment. 
Overall, we believe that AbbVie's next-generation HCV therapy will be able to address the remaining unmet medical need within this market. We continue to expect to see results from the Phase III trials in the coming months, and we remain on track for commercialization next year.
And in the area of women's health, we are nearing completion of our Phase III endometriosis program, with regulatory submission planned for 2017. Earlier this year, we announced positive top line results from the second of 2 replicate pivotal Phase III clinical trials evaluating Elagolix in premenopausal women who suffered pain from endometriosis. The results showed that after 6 months of continuous treatment, both doses of Elagolix met the study's co-primary endpoints, with Elagolix reducing scores of menstrual pain and nonmenstrual pelvic pain in month 3 and month 6.
We plan to present detailed results from both Phase III studies, including extension study data up to 12 months, at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in October. And our Phase III studies in uterine fibroids are underway and progressing well. This program is investigating the effect of Elagolix on heavy bleeding related to this highly prevalent condition. 
So in summary, we continue to make significant progress with our pipeline and are on track for further advancements in the remainder of 2016. We have a broad pipeline that includes more than 50 active clinical development programs, including more than 20 new products or indications in late-stage development or under regulatory review. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our second quarter performance."

This morning, I'll review our second quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2016, inclusive of the recently completed Stemcentrx transaction and the BI collaboration. We're very pleased with our strong second quarter",1097,"Thanks, Mike. This morning, I'll review our second quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2016, inclusive of the recently completed Stemcentrx transaction and the BI collaboration. 
We're very pleased with our strong second quarter results. In addition to delivering strong operational sales growth of 18%, we exceeded the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share guidance range by $0.06, and it delivered growth of nearly 17% over the second quarter of 2015. As Rick mentioned, we continue to see strong momentum from HUMIRA, with global sales of more than $4.1 billion, up 17.7% operationally.
In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased nearly 27%. We continue to see mid-teens prescription volume growth across the brand, fueled by robust demand in the room, derm and gastro market segments. In the quarter, we also saw a low single-digit benefit on the growth rate as a result of customer-buying patterns versus the prior year quarter. Channel inventory levels in both the second quarter of 2015 and 2016 were below half a month.
International HUMIRA sales were more than $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4% on an operational basis and exceeding our prior guidance of 3% operational growth for the quarter. Internationally, HUMIRA continues to maintain its strong market leadership position. We continue to see only modest overall market share gains for biosimilar REMICADE in major markets in line with our planning assumptions. And while still early in the launch, the Enbrel biosimilar continues to perform in line with our assumptions.
Global IMBRUVICA net revenues were $439 million in the quarter. U.S. sales were $384 million, and our international profit-sharing was $55 million. Global VIEKIRA sales in the second quarter were $419 million. This reflects weaker quarter-over-quarter sales from the U.S. due to competitive dynamics, offset by our performance in international markets.
Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew nearly 29% on an operational basis in the quarter, continuing to grow by double digits internationally, with a modest level of U.S. sales as expected.
We also saw strong operational sales growth in the quarter from both Creon and Lupron, which were up 13% and 11%, respectively. As Rick noted, in the quarter, we received approval for 2 new products, Venclexta and Zinbryta. We launched Venclexta early in the quarter in its initial indication for relapsed/refractory CLL patients, with a 17p deletion, which represents a smaller addressable patient population in the U.S. We have begun a measured commercial rollout to ensure adequate physician training, and we expect a modest level of Venclexta sales for 2016. For Zinbryta, we plan to launch in the U.S. in August. 
Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 81.9% of sales. On a comparative year-over-year basis, this ratio reflects an adverse impact from foreign exchange of roughly 320 basis points. In addition, the adjusted gross margin reflects 160 basis points of unfavorable impact related to the Pharmacyclics acquisition, including the proper transfer from IMBRUVICA. Adjusting for these impacts, gross margin profile performance improved by approximately 140 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted R&D was 15.5% of sales, reflecting funding actions supporting the pipeline, as well as the impact of both Stemcentrx transaction and the BI collaboration.
Adjusted SG&A was 22.2% of the sales in the second quarter, down 290 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 43.9% of sales, down 30 basis points relative to the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange and the Pharmacyclics acquisition, operating margin profile performance improved 370 basis points versus the prior year. 
Net interest expense was $225 million and the adjusted tax rate was 20.1% in the quarter. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding noncash intangible amortization expense and specified items, were $1.26, up 16.7% year-over-year.
Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our strong business performance year-to-date, we are raising our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range to $4.73 to $4.83, reflecting adjusted EPS growth of 11.4% at the midpoint. This includes the previously communicated $0.28 of dilution related to the Stemcentrx acquisition and the BI collaboration.
We are also updating our 2016 GAAP diluted EPS guidance range to $3.82 to $3.92, which includes $0.91 per share of noncash intangible asset amortization expense and other specified items, including acquisition costs and accounting impacts associated with Stemcentrx and the BI collaboration. 
On the top line, we expect full year sales approaching $26 billion. Foreign exchange dynamics have run favorable relative to our initial projections, and we are now forecasting approximately 1% of negative top line impact from currency for the full year.
Based on our strong performance year-to-date, we now expect U.S. HUMIRA operational sales growth of more than 20%. And we remain on track with our previously communicated full year guidance for international HUMIRA, with operational growth in the mid-single digits. 
We now forecast an adjusted gross margin profile approaching 81%, impacted by stronger performance of hedge currencies in 2016. The gross margin profile also reflects 130 basis points of impact related to the Pharmacyclics acquisition. Excluding this and the year-over-year exchange impacts, the gross margin profile is expected to improve relative to 2015 by roughly 190 basis points. 
We are now forecasting R&D expense of more than 16% of sales, reflecting our increased R&D investments related to the Stemcentrx acquisition and the BI collaboration. And we expect SG&A to run at approximately 23% of sales. We now forecast an adjusted operating margin profile approaching 42% on a full year basis. We remain committed to delivering on our 2020 targeted operating margin forecast of above 50% of sales.
We are now forecasting net interest expense of approximately $925 million for the full year, above our original guidance of approximately $800 million as a result of the debt we issued for the Stemcentrx acquisition. And we expect an adjusted tax rate in the 20% to 21% range in 2016. 
Regarding the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 to $1.20. This excludes roughly $0.16 of specified items and noncash amortization and includes the dilutive impact of Stemcentrx and the BI collaboration. We are expecting high single-digit operational sales growth, excluding a modest negative foreign exchange impact in the quarter. 
So in conclusion, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter as we've driven strong top and bottom line growth while also advancing on our strategic priorities and our pipeline. This puts us in a strong position to continue delivering industry-leading growth this year. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz."

So Rick, there's clearly substantial track value in the company because of the uncertainty for investors around HUMIRA. And you've made positive steps to deal with this through building new growth drivers through R&D, aggressive business development as well as making clear your long-term expectations regarding HUMIRA. Even so, despite great quarters like today, we're still seeing the shares traded at substantial discounts to peers. So is there anything else that's up for discussion in terms of how you can unlock the track value in the company, whether it's through different capital allocation, separation of the oncology platform given the valuations they can carry these days or anything else? Second one for Mike, I wonder, what does your collaboration with Bristol on Rova-T tell you about what they are thinking regarding the positioning of their Opdivo/Yervoy combination in small cell lung cancer? And then last, maybe for Rick again. We're expecting that you'll be in place by Q4 to initiate patent litigation against Amgen, and it will be beyond just a dosing and formulation patents that would be more widely discussed to date. Are those still reasonable expectations? And do you think investors will be reassured when we see what other patents Amgen has agreed that they are potentially infringing out to the patent dance?"

I'll cover the first and third one, and then I'll have Mike cover the other one. So on the on track value, what I would tell you is that if you look our PE, I think what you've seen, and if you look at the range of companies in our peer group, there are obviously companies that have a much lower PE for a variety set of reasons, and there are companies where they have higher PEs, and the median PE is certainly above where we are. So there's certainly a level of overhang that's associated with the biosimilar uncertainty around HUMIRA. And I think what we have laid out for investors is a clear strategy that we put in place, starting back in 2013, of how we were going to deal with that. Ultimately, we have a large portfolio of IP around HUMIRA, and we certainly expect that to be able to protect the asset, as we described back in October. We have now added to the portfolio 2 fundamentally differentiated new assets in 494 risankizumab, and you're seeing some of that data play out. And so that we fundamentally believe that those will allow us to ultimately be able to grow through what will obviously be, at some point, a biosimilar impact, both internationally as well as in the U.S. And then we've spent a considerable amount of time building a robust pipeline that we've shown at our R&D day and in other events that has the ability to be able to ultimately generate a very significant revenue opportunity that will allow us to grow through even the most bearish impact that's out there, from an analyst standpoint, around biosimilars. So I think we've done the things that we think are important to be able to communicate and then ultimately, build a strategy to be able to drive the business from a growth perspective, because that was the chart that we set for the company when we launched. And I think we've demonstrated that we're capable of doing that. I think it will take some time for the litigation strategies to play out and for investors to continue to gain confidence. Having said that, we constantly look at different kinds of alternatives that we think truly are value-enhancing to shareholders, but also value-enhancing to the business itself. And we'll explore all of those in time to determine whether or not they make sense. I mean, I think, if anything, we've probably been on the proactive side of going out and building new growth platforms and other kinds of things to be able to sustain the business going forward. And we have seen the PE improve, and we would certainly expect that it will continue to improve. I mean, if you look at our performance, both currently as well as going forward, as we projected it in our LRP, we will perform in the top tier of our peer groups. And we would expect that we'll start to see the PE reflect that to a greater extent going forward as the litigation strategy plays out more. On the third question, and I'm sure there will be other questions around the litigation, and I'll apologize in advance that this won't be a very satisfying answer for you, but it certainly, I think you'll understand why. We're now in the very active phase of litigation around HUMIRA biosimilars. And therefore, we're not in a position where we're going to be able to provide a lot of color. And we're certainly not in a position where we can do this play-by-play strategy of how we're going to deal with every aspect of it. That just wouldn't be a smart thing for us to do. What I can reiterate is this, back in October, we outlined in detail the extensive portfolio of IP that we have for HUMIRA and our confidence in that IP. And it goes beyond any one single patent. And I can tell you, we remain confident in that IP portfolio, and we've made it very clear that we intend to vigorously defend all of our IP against anyone that potentially infringes it. And so that process will play out. So as I said, it's just not prudent for us now in this phase to ultimately lay out in detail the play-by-play. And so we're just not in a position to be able to do that."

So this is Mike, I'll take the question about the BMS collaboration. So I think that, first of all, we're very fortunate that after many years without much progress in the treatment of small cell lung cancer, there are very promising mechanisms coming forward, our own Rova-T as well as the data that have been presented recently in immuno-oncology. And I think that offers real benefit for patients downstream. What I would say about the way the 2 companies are thinking about these assets, I think that the speed with which the deal came together really speaks for itself. And that collaboration would not have been possible in the short period of time if we were thinking about the assets very differently. As we've said in other settings, when one is thinking about the treatment of patients with small cell lung cancer, there are a couple of treatment goals. The first is that one needs to get disease control, because these patients present very ill with very rapidly progressing disease. And Rova-T has shown, in its Phase II studies, that it can do that and it can do that with a defined course of therapy. We also believe that the data strongly support that the responses with Rova-T will be durable. Now when one thinks about other treatment goals, it would be desirable to have a long-term surveillance on board after one achieves that initial strong and durable disease control. And we believe that IP agents can play a real role there. And so the collaboration with Bristol will test this and we believe will provide very exciting data for patients with small cell lung cancer in the future."

And for which indications? And wondering what we will see potentially at ESMO. And Michael, just maybe if you could explain. I'm still getting a lot of pushback from investors who are unclear about the value of Rova-T, just given that the response rate that we saw at ASCO was a bit lower than what we saw at World Lung, I think creating question marks around the durability of response."

I'll take the hep C question that you had. Certainly, we -- as we said in the first quarter call, we have seen an impact of the new entrant into the marketplace.

Certainly, we -- as we said in the first quarter call, we have seen an impact of the new entrant into the marketplace. I'd say we've seen it primarily in the public channels, particularly, I'd say, the VA. And it really boils down to a pricing strategy. And ultimately, we decided that we were not going to match the lowest price, the 8-week price that was out in the marketplace. And therefore, we lost a significant amount of share. I mean, at our peak, we probably had close to 40% share. And now we have shares that's more down in the single-digit range. So I'd say that's the vast majority of the impact that we've seen. There has been some price impact also that played through, but the greater impact is clearly share loss in that public channel primarily. And so as we look forward to next generation, I think as we look at the profile of that asset, obviously, from a clinical performance standpoint, it is everything we would have hoped it would be. Based on the data that we've seen so far, I think it'll be a highly competitive asset. It will also provide, because it is pan-genotypic, an opportunity to be able to bridge across all of the genotypes and in particular, in the United States, genotype 2 and 3, worse of all, they essentially had a strong position in the marketplace. And so this will even that playing field. So we fundamentally believe that next generation will allow us an opportunity to be able to grow our share. If you look outside the United States as an example and you look in countries where there is predominantly a 1B population, but even in some countries where there's a significant 1A population, our market shares in most of those countries are in, I'd say, on the low end, 30%; on the high end, sometimes it's high as 70%. And so we compete very well, and the profile of 1B is certainly much more of a competitive profile to the alternatives that are available outside the United States. And so I think it gives you an idea of our ability to be able to perform in those markets. So we would hope and I think expect that next generation will allow us to be able to gain share in those marketplaces. The $3 billion, you're probably going back to the first prediction, and I think we anticipate that we would get back into that range. But I'm going out of the business of predicting HCV at this point. I think what I would say is, despite the impact that we've seen in the U.S., from a share standpoint, I think it shows you how fundamentally strong the overall business is, because we've taken a fairly substantial hit in the U.S. on HCV. But yet, we continue to perform at a very high level and offset all of that impact and are now raising guidance on top of that. So the balance of our entire business and in particular, I'd say, HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA right now, gives us the ability to be able to do that. And so we're not dependent upon that single asset performing at a certain level. Mike?"

Rova-T, the objective response data for Rova-T has been very consistent, in our view, across the various reports over the last several months. And they've ranged from about 39% into the mid-40% range. And that really just relates to the cut of the data, whether one is using initial investigative reports or subsequent adjudicated assessments of objective response and doesn't bear on durability of those responses in any way. And the objective response and importantly, the clinical benefit rate have both remained very high. The one-year survival has also been very consistent in the 30%-plus range across the data cuts, which gives us a very good feel for the durability of those responses. And in this heavily pretreated patient population, the best estimate, the most rigorous, but also the highest estimate, of 1-year survival is about 12%. And in many cases, it may actually be lower than that. And so that 30% number we view as very important. So we don't see anything concerning with respect to the durability of the responses with Rova-T. So with respect to the remainder of the Stemcentrx pipeline, there are actually 5 programs in the clinic now, 1 of those is Rova-T. 2 are the Pfizer-partnered programs, PTK7 and EFNA4. And then there are 2 other programs in the clinic for solid tumor indicators, but we haven't disclosed those targets or the particular tumors of interest at this point in time. In addition to those 5, there are 5 additional assets that will enter the clinic over the next 12 to 18 months, so by the end of 2017. And the areas of initial interest, when one looks at the tumors that were treating today, will obviously be small cell. There's also a focus on ovarian cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, among others."

So let me start with the biosimilar impact, because as you've said, we've seen biosimilar certainly with the REMICADE biosimilar in the market for quite some time, and now we're in the early phases of",871,"Okay, great. Chris, this is Rick. So I'll cover those. So let me start with the biosimilar impact, because as you've said, we've seen biosimilar certainly with the REMICADE biosimilar in the market for quite some time, and now we're in the early phases of the launch of Enbrel biosimilars in the -- particularly in the European areas. So if you look at REMICADE, there are REMICADE biosimilars now in roughly 60-plus countries, like 62 countries. About 50 of those -- a little more than 50 of those have pricing and reimbursement, so they're actively involved in marketing the product in those countries. If -- we've studied it very carefully. If you look at the overall share of biosimilars, it's less than 5%. It's about 4.5%. If you look at their share of REMICADE, it's about 20%, 22%, something like that. It varies a lot. So I'd say it's very high in tender-based countries like in Norway, Denmark, Poland, as an example, very high market share in those. If you go more into the traditional Western European markets, more like in the 20% to 25% share of the REMICADE market. And the discounting has played out to basically range in the tender countries fairly high. I'd say that's 50% to 70% kind of range, from a discounting standpoint; and the rest of the market, probably in that 30% to 40% kind of range. It hasn't any impact on us at all. REMICADE, because it's an infusion product in most of those countries, doesn't compete in the same space that we compete in. So then you move over to Enbrel. So Enbrel's approved now, the Enbrel biosimilars are approved in about 32 countries. There's pricing and reimbursement in about 1/3 of those countries right now. We've seen much lower discounting than what we've expected, I'd say. It ranges from as little as low single-digit discounting to maybe up in the 30% to 35% range in non-tender countries and kind of the high 30s to high 50s in the tender countries. Again, it's playing out similar to the way we saw the REMICADE biosimilars. So in the tender countries, they're having higher share like the Norways and the Denmarks, Germany, Sweden, single-digit kind of figures. So really, no substantial market share impact. But it's too early in the process for us to see that. I'd say, the strategy that we anticipated and the one we put in place seems to be working well. But it's the early rounds, and you can see it in the performance of the business. You can see HUMIRA's continuing to grow in the international markets. And as you back out the Venezuela impact, you can see it's actually growing in the 6% or so range, 6.2% range. And so we are continuing to see good strong growth in those markets. And so I'd say, the early rounds are working like we had anticipated they would. And then -- but we need to give it some more time and see how it plays out. But it's a good opportunity for us to see how our strategy is working and be able to modify that strategy. So that's essentially the biosimilar impact that we see. Nothing different than what we had expected. Now let me move over to derm and the impact on 17s. I'd say, overall, we're very happy with our performance in the derm space. So if you look at the U.S, I'll talk specifically about the U.S. We've seen TRxs grow, in fact, accelerate over the course of time. I mean, if you go back to the early part of 2015 or even look at the average across 2015, we had -- got a low double-digit TRx growth in first and second quarter. That's accelerated to like 17% or 18% TRx growth in derm. And so we're seeing nice strong growth in that segment of the market. If you look at our revenue, a very similar kind of profile. We had strong double-digit growth, and now it's accelerated fairly dramatically, probably about 10 to 15 points above what it had been running at. If you look at market share, our overall market share is pretty stable to maybe slightly down, 1.5% or so. As we analyze it, it is really driven extensively by the Otezla experience, where we're seeing a lot more patients, particularly moderate and sometimes mild patients coming into the category. And so therefore, the category is growing faster. And so that dilutes our market share position. When we pull Otezla out and we look at our market share, our market share looks relatively stable. In particular, if you look at PsA, our overall share has been stable in the U.S. at about 32%. If you look at room PsA, it's actually increased about 3 points, which is the larger part of the PsA market, it's about 75% of the overall PsA market. And even the AS PsA has increased about 2 points. Psoriasis, as I've said, is down about 1.5 to 2 points in total, but it's more driven by our Otezla. So overall, we feel very good about how the business is performing across all the indications, but certainly, in derm as well."

So I'll cover that, and maybe Mike can jump in on some of specifics. When we went into -- when we made the decision that the core growth -- future growth franchise on top of immunology was going to be oncology, we made a decision that we would invest in a way to try to build leadership positions in certain areas where we thought we had core competencies that were complementary to being able to perform in those areas. So specifically, we've started with hematological oncology based on the assets that we had internally as well as the opportunity that existed with Pharmacyclics. And our goal was to basically build a position where we thought we could drive to a leadership position within that category. So if you look at the assets we have today, including IMBRUVICA and where we think Venclexta will be able to expand to, it would tell us that we should have an opportunity to be able to bring forward innovative therapies in roughly 65% of the overall market in hematological malignancies. And I'd say that, that's an area where we feel comfortable with what we have. Now having said that, if we found unique opportunities, I think, particularly in the acute leukemia side assets or technologies or a drug that we thought was particularly attractive and an area where we didn't think we had a strong asset already, certainly, we would pursue that kind of an asset. But I'd say, from a platform standpoint, we feel very good about what we have in hematological malignancies, both internally as well as the addition of Pharmacyclics that we did a year or so ago. On the solid tumor side, as we've said before about Stemcentrx, one of the things that was attractive to us is we have a number of efforts internally to be able to identify new targets. And so we have an effort internally to be able to do that. We obviously have a collaboration with Calico. And part of the work that they're doing is to identify new oncology targets. But we wanted a more fundamental base platform for solid tumors. And one of the things that attracted us to Stemcentrx is we believe they have that. And we're excited about that opportunity. And Mike talked earlier about the number of candidates that will be moving on to that platform. And I think it's impressive what they've accomplished. And so that has built what we fundamentally believe will be the core platform for us in solid tumors, in addition to what we already have. We certainly continue to look for, again, now, more individual kinds of technology place or assets that might be complementary to that, but we're not looking for another big platform. I don't know, Mike, would you want to add anything?"

So with respect to Elagolix, as you pointed out, Mark, we have substantial lead on having completed our 2 pivotal Phase III studies and already being in the process of collecting longer-term data that are necessary to define benefit risk. And we think that is a real advantage for our program, and one that we're going to continue to drive as we drive forward, for example, with the add-back program to further enhance the understanding of how we can use Elagolix to treat endometriosis and uterine fibroids. With respect to some of the issues you brought up on competitive programs, we don't really view potency as a primary driver here. In fact, the most potent agent in this axis is Lupron, and the problem is, in fact, the degree to which that shuts down axis. We're trying to achieve a fine titration of those, and we believe Elagolix has the properties to allow us to do that. With respect to co-formulation with add-back, there is nothing that would prevent us from co-formulating with add-back as well. And we believe, over time, there may be a number of strategies that can be used to protect bone, and so we'll have flexibility to employ many different strategies. So we feel very good about the position of Elagolix. We think it's an important treatment option. And we think that it's going to make a real impact on endometriosis.  With respect to relative advantages of a q-day formulation, I think that, again, depends on the dose one ultimately selects. And I think when we will get the overall profile of Elagolix, we remain convinced that it's very strong."

And we have the potential to pursue myeloma with a number of assets on our portfolio. Venclexta has clear potential there, and we're advancing that program rapidly, as we mentioned during our opening remarks. Imbruvica also has potential as to a number of molecules in our pipeline. It is a competitive space. One can prolong survival to a much a bigger extent today than was possible a decade ago. But we still don't have curative therapies, patients ultimately fell therapy and progress, which means that we need new mechanisms that aren't cross-reactive that provide durable disease control. And we think we have a number of those in our pipeline. So we're aware of the competition certainly, but we think we have therapies that will further the standard of care in that disease. And we'll be driving clinical programs forward to demonstrate that. With respect to veliparib. So veliparib is a molecule that is an important part of our overall oncology efforts. It's in Phase III studies across a range of tumor indications. We have a bit of a different hypothesis around the way veliparib should be used than perhaps some of the others who are developing PARPs. We are not focused solely on the use in patients with germline BRCA mutation or other HRD-deficient tumors. We are exploring the hypothesis in our Phase III program. That part can augment DNA damage in chemotherapy. Essentially, that the first hit doesn't have to come from a genetic hit. It can come from a therapeutic hit that is DNA damaging, which would increase the importance of DNA repair mechanisms. That hypothesis is being tested in a range of Phase III programs in non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer and in ovarian cancer. And those studies will start to read out in 2017. We'll have a number of important data readouts, which will tell us the role that PARP can play there. So we haven't focused on it as much in recent Investor Days, and that's largely because it is in a quiet period where the studies are up and running. We're generating the results. But you'll hear a lot more about PARP in 2017."

Could you just comment on your perspective on contracting for individual indications in autoimmune disease? And then second, Rick, I was hoping that you could provide a little bit more detail on the sort of timing and specifics surrounding the patent litigation steps. So obviously, you're not going to comment on individual patterns or individual patent strategies. But as I understand it, there will be -- immediately after Amgen gets approval of its biosimilar, immediately after that occurs, there will be a wave of patent litigation that kicks in.

Indication-based pricing, I think, first evolved primarily in the oncology space. And it was driven, I think, by certain efforts to say, you have an oncology agent that has very strong efficacy in a certain disease and might have significantly lower efficacy in another disease, and why would I pay the same for this strong efficacy as I would for relatively modest efficacy? I think that was how the concept originally evolved. As we look at HUMIRA and we look across all of the major indications at least, with every single indication, there's obviously some variation between the competitive profiles. But I'd say, in general, HUMIRA tends to perform across those broad set of indications in the top tier. And so that is how we view it. So indication-based pricing wouldn't be something that we think is very applicable for this specific asset in this particular class. And we haven't seen it take off much prior to this, and we'll have to see how it plays out over time. Again, on the time -- there are a lot -- it may sound to you like it's a fairly innocent issue around timing and the steps and what should play out. But I would tell you, it's not that, from a litigation standpoint. So I'm just going to need to take the same position I did before. We're not in the position to be able to give you a lot more color. Certainly, we've made it clear what our position is going to be, and I think that will become clearer as the steps play out. But I can't give you a whole lot of color on the timing or what the alternatives would be."

And I think that will give you some good sense of the overall dynamics of the brand. And then I'll backup and talk a little bit about the business in general. Obviously, the brand's performing very, very well in the U.S. We grew at 26.7% in the Q. Script trends, the way we see them, we're in the mid-teens for the quarter. Our price was up. It was actually up in the single digits. And then as we -- as I said in my comments, we did see a modest impact from differences in customer order patterns. Again, we run this business at less than half a month inventory, but it gets a little tough to call at various times. And we did see a little bit of demand differences between the Q. We had a little bit lower inventories in the second quarter of '15 relative to '16. So yes, I think the way you got to think about this is mid-teens growth from script and single-digit price. And when you add those up, yes, you can pretty much get to the 20% number that we've guided to. From an overall price standpoint, look, I would say, if you back up and look at our growth on the quarter of 18%, the majority was volume. Across the total book of business, we had a price impact of less than 4%. So the strategy that we've actually employed for the business and certainly, with our new products launching is this is going to be a product -- a company that's fueled by volume and not price. Obviously, price, we do have an opportunity in certain markets to take it. But I would not say this is a company that is heavily dependent on price. And then as we look out over the LRP, we tend to scale down our price expectations in the U.S, because we think that's the prudent way to model."

We delivered another strong quarter, with results well ahead of our expectations, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, representing growth of 16.7% versus the second quarter of 2015. Our results in the quarter included strong top line performance, with global operational sales growth of 18%, reflecting robust growth from several products in our portfolio, including HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, among others. 
We're pleased with our outperformance in the quarter and progress year-to-date. We've driven outstanding commercial, operational and R&D execution, resulting in strong top and bottom line results. Based on our performance in the first half of the year, we're raising our full year 2016 EPS guidance to $4.73 to $4.83 on an adjusted basis, reflecting growth of 11.4% at the midpoint. 
As I mentioned, several products within our portfolio are driving robust growth. HUMIRA continues to drive strong performance, delivering global operational growth of more than 17% in the quarter. Despite increasing competition from new classes of drugs and indirect biosimilar competition in international markets, HUMIRA continues to demonstrate exceptional performance and durability across all 3 market segments. 
In rheumatology, HUMIRA is the #1 prescribed biologic, and we continue to grow our share position in the face of new competition. And in dermatology and gastro, HUMIRA continues to hold a strong market leadership position, demonstrating double-digit growth year-over-year.
We also continue to be pleased with the strong IMBRUVICA performance, which is tracking in line to slightly ahead of our expectations following our approval for first-line use in CLL. IMBRUVICA has achieved the #1 market share position in all approved disease indications in second-line and second-line-plus treatment. And since we received the FDA approval of IMBRUVICA as a first-line treatment for CLL late in the first quarter, IMBRUVICA has already gained a market share position in first-line in the mid-teens and the third position in the market. 
And this share continues to steadily increase, with approximately 1 of every 6 patients now receiving IMBRUVICA as a front-line therapy, surpassing FCR, which is generally considered the gold standard for young and fit CLL patients. This market share and the strong momentum underlying its performance further reinforces our confidence and our long-term expectations for IMBRUVICA that supported our decision to acquire Pharmacyclics last year. 
We also saw strong performance from several other products in our portfolio, including Duodopa, Creon and Lupron. Each of these therapies within our marketed product portfolio continue to deliver durable performance. Global VIEKIRA sales in the second quarter were $419 million, up 8.2% on an operational basis. Growth in the quarter was driven by our international business. In the U.S, as we described on our first quarter call, we have seen market share loss and some price erosion due to the entry of a new competitor into the HCV market.
We are nearing the completion of our registrational studies for our next-generation pan-genotypic HCV combination. Based on the mid-stage data we've disclosed to date, we believe that our new HCV combination will be highly competitive. The data illustrates that this therapy can deliver mature [ph] rates approaching 100% across genotypes. And we believe the majority of patients will be well served with an 8-week treatment option. We expect to see results from the pivotal studies in the second half, and we remain on track for commercialization next year.
In addition to our strong financial results, we've continued to advance our strategic priorities and have made excellent progress with our R&D pipeline. Mike will cover the pipeline in more detail in just a few moments, so I'll only mention a few highlights. 
Importantly, we successfully completed the acquisition of Stemcentrx. We've been impressed by the caliber of talent we've welcomed from Stemcentrx, and the transition has been seamless. The addition of Stemcentrx is a strategically and financially compelling opportunity for our company, giving AbbVie a highly attractive platform for solid tumors and an extremely exciting late-stage asset in Rova-T. 
The transaction enables AbbVie to further expand and accelerate our presence in oncology, building upon our growing position in hematological oncology. We are moving rapidly to advance Rova-T in its lead indication, third-line small cell lung cancer, and we continue to feel confident about our 2017 BLA filing strategy and launch in 2018. We are also rapidly advancing studies to evaluate Rova-T in earlier lines of therapy for small cell lung cancer, including combination studies with both chemotherapy and immuno-oncology agents. 
Earlier this week, we jointly announced the clinical collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to evaluate the combination of Rova-T with BMS's immuno-oncology agents in small cell lung cancer, with trials beginning this year. We're pleased to be partnering with BMS to bring innovative new therapies forward that have the potential to significantly improve the survival of patients with small cell lung cancer, a disease with devastating outcomes.
We've also continued to make significant progress with our hematological oncology portfolio. We're building upon our strong position with IMBRUVICA in treating blood cancers with Venclexta. 
During the quarter, we received the first FDA approval for Venclexta for patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, who harbor the 17p deletion, a difficult-to-treat form of the disease, typically associated with poor prognosis. The approval for this transformative therapy was granted under breakthrough therapy and priority review designations, and the launch is still in its early stages. 
Although this first indication is a relatively small patient population, it is important to provide patients with this difficult-to-treat disease, a new therapy with strong clinical results. And it's also important to give physicians an opportunity to gain experience with the particular initial dosing regimen of Venclexta to ensure patients receive the benefit of this therapy. 
We expect data from the Phase III study evaluating Venclexta in a broader set of relapsed/refractory CLL patients to read out next year, supporting our regulatory submission for an expanded label covering all relapsed/refractory CLL patients, a much larger population. Like IMBRUVICA, we believe that Venclexta will be effective across a range of hematological malignancies with high unmet need, and we're actively evaluating additional indications, including acute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma, among others. 
We also continue to make progress across other important areas of our pipeline. During the quarter, we presented positive results for a mid-stage study of our anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab, in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. The pivotal program for risankizumab is in psoriasis, and it's underway and enrolling very well. And in partnership with Biogen, we recently received FDA and EC approval for Zinbryta for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. We plan to launch Zinbryta in the U.S. in August.
In summary, we continue to be pleased with our strong execution and the significant advancements in our pipeline. As we outlined in our recent R&D day, we have 8 late-stage assets, which have been significantly derisked and have the potential to drive meaningful revenue growth in the years to come. We've continued to demonstrate an exceptional track record of success with positive clinical data and regulatory outcomes and strong commercial performance. We intend to build on this momentum to drive a high level of performance across our operations in the second half of the year. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for some additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?"
141885706,370563086,1018069,"AbbVie Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","AbbVie Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Rick. We had another very productive quarter from an R&D perspective, with significant progress on several programs, including the FDA approval of Venclexta for its first indication in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL with a 17p deletion m",2054,"Thank you, Rick. We had another very productive quarter from an R&D perspective, with significant progress on several programs, including the FDA approval of Venclexta for its first indication in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL with a 17p deletion mutation, as well as the FDA and EMA approvals of Zinbryta for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Today, I'll highlight additional updates and discuss some of the milestones we anticipate in the second half of 2016.
I'll start with our oncology portfolio, an area where we are growing our already strong position in hematological malignancies, as well as establishing a strong foundation in solid tumors, which was significantly accelerated by our recent acquisition of Stemcentrx and its lead asset, Rova-T. 
At the ASCO meeting in early June, we presented data from a Phase II trial in small cell lung cancer that demonstrated that Rova-T monotherapy drove a 1-year survival rate of 32% in DLL3-positive patients, almost triple that of historical third-line standard of care at 12%. In addition to the impressive 1-year survival, Rova-T showed the most compelling single-agent activity in terms of the overall response rate, clinical benefit rate and progression-free survival in third-line small cell lung cancer, the patient population where our first pivotal trial for registration is rapidly enrolling.
The confirmatory third-line registrational trial, which is called TRINITY, began in January and is expected to complete enrollment by the end of 2016, with commercialization expected in 2018. We are also quickly advancing Rova-T into studies to support front-line treatment in small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. The first-line development program includes a Phase I/II regimen flexion study that will be used to inform future Phase III pivotal trials, evaluating various combinations of Rova-T and chemotherapy. The regimen selection study is expected to begin next quarter. 
The first-line program also includes the Mehru [ph] study, a Phase III registrational trial evaluating standard chemotherapy followed by Rova-T in the front-line setting. We expect to have this study up and running by the end of the year. 
We are also advancing an 8-arm basket study, evaluating Rova-T in a range of neuroendocrine tumors, where DLL3 plays an important role. This study is on track to begin this quarter, with data expected next year. Given that many of these tumor types have low survival rates and limited treatment options available, there may be an opportunity to explore single-arm studies to support accelerated approval. 
As Rick mentioned earlier this week, we announced the clinical collaboration with BMS to evaluate the investigational combination of Rova-T with Opdivo and with Opdivo and Yervoy in small cell lung cancer. We believe that combining Rova-T with these checkpoint inhibitors could drive enhanced and sustained efficacy, above what that which either approach could offer individually. 
Preclinical evidence and biological rationale supports our prioritization of efforts to combine Rova-T with IO agents, and we believe these combinations have the potential to establish a new standard of care. We expect to begin the Rova-T/IO combination study by the end of the year. 
In addition to Rova-T, we've also continued to make progress with our pipeline assets targeting solid tumors. In particular, our PARP-inhibitor, veliparib, and ABT-414, an antibody drug conjugate for glioblastoma multiforme. We presented Phase I data for both of these assets at the recent ASCO meeting and anticipate data readouts from registration-enabling studies for both programs over the next 12 months. 
We also continue to make good progress with our hematologic oncology portfolio. In the second quarter, the FDA updated the IMBRUVICA label to include new data from 2 Phase III trials, supporting expanded use in patients with CLL and SLL, including overall survival data from both the RESONATE-2 and HELIOS trials. 
IMBRUVICA is also being evaluated in mid- to late-stage trials for several additional indications, with timing of data readouts and potential regulatory submissions dependent on event-driven analyses of ongoing studies. In June, IMBRUVICA received breakthrough therapy designation as a potential treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy, marking the drug's fourth breakthrough therapy designation. The FDA also granted IMBRUVICA for a drug designation for the same condition. The breakthrough designation was based on clinical data from a Phase II study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA for the treatment of patients with steroid-dependent or refractory chronic GVHD. A registrational study in graft-versus-host disease is underway, with data expected late this year or early 2017.
We've made significant progress with the development of another important strategic asset, our novel BCL-2 inhibitor, Venclexta, which is being developed in collaboration with Roche. Venclexta was recently approved under priority review for first indication in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL with 17p deletion. Earlier this year, Venclexta also received the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation for use in combination with rituximab for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. 
The Phase III MURANO trial, which will support a broader label in relapsed/refractory CLL, is fully enrolled, with data readout and regulatory submission anticipated in 2017. Additionally, we have an active Phase III program evaluating Venclexta in treatment-naïve CLL patients, with studies underway and progressing well.
Like IMBRUVICA, we believe Venclexta will be effective across a range of blood cancers, including AML and multiple myeloma. We recently started a Phase III program evaluating Venclexta in combination with standard of care in multiple myeloma, and we anticipate moving forward with Phase III development in AML by the end of the year. 
In addition to the elements of the program I've described, we continue to be excited about the ongoing clinical evaluation of combinations of IMBRUVICA and Venclexta, which we believe have the potential to drive profound responses and minimal residual disease negativity in a number of clinical settings. 
Now I'd like to turn our attention to the immunology portfolio, where we have 2 late-stage assets, our anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab, and our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494. Each of these assets has the potential to significantly advance standard of care in immune-mediated conditions, such as RA, psoriasis and Crohn's disease, covering the major market segments where we currently have a leadership position. 
ABT-494 is currently in Phase III development for rheumatoid arthritis, where we are studying the asset in 6 pivotal trials. Our JAK inhibitor has the potential to be best-in-class with what we believe will be an optimized benefit risk profile. Our development strategy is aimed at delivering a comprehensive label to cover multiple lines of therapy from first-line use in methotrexate-naive patients to use in patients with inadequate response to biologics, where the highest unmet need remains in this market. Data from the ABT-494 Phase III RA program is expected in the first half of 2018, with commercialization targeted in 2019.
We have also accelerated the development of this important asset in gastrointestinal disorders. Our Phase II study in Crohn's disease is well underway, and data should be available internally later this year. This will enable the decision to advance the Phase III development by the first quarter of next year. You can expect to see the data from this Phase II Crohn study at DDW next year. In addition, we recently initiated a Phase II study in ulcerative colitis, with data expected in 2018.
Risankizumab is another strategically important late-stage immunology asset. This anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, which we licensed from Boehringer Ingelheim earlier this year, has the potential to be a transformative therapy by providing best-in-class efficacy with increased dosing convenience. Risankizumab is currently in Phase III psoriasis trials and in mid-stage development for both Crohn's disease and psoriatic arthritis. Interest in the Phase III psoriasis program has been strong, and enrollment is progressing very well. We continue to expect data from the registrational program in 2018. 
At the Digestive Disease Week meeting in May, we reported encouraging results from a Phase II study of risankizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, a particularly difficult-to-treat population, given that the majority of these patients had previously failed treatment with one or more TNF antagonists. Based on these strong results, we intend to move rapidly into Phase III studies in Crohn's disease, with registration trials commencing later this year or early next year.
Another technology that we believe holds great promise is our proprietary bio-specific antibody platform. We've introduced a number of these assets into the clinic in both our immunology and oncology therapeutic areas. Based on our early-stage studies, we've established proof of concept across several programs, demonstrating that these antibodies possess good drug-like properties and deliver the desired pharmacodynamic effects. And we've learned how to successfully and consistently manufacture them. 
We recently evaluated data from 1 of our bio-specific programs in development, ABT-122, our combination anti-TNF and anti-IL-17 in Phase II trials for RA and psoriatic arthritis. The data demonstrated that ABT-122 was well tolerated, with a safety profile that was comparable to HUMIRA. In the mid-stage psoriatic arthritis and RA studies, ABT-122 showed ACR20 response rates as high as 75% and 82%, respectively, demonstrating that the platform worked well with clear evidence of biologic activity. However, the simultaneous inhibition of IL-17 and TNF-alpha did not produce the strong synergistic effect necessary to differentiate ABT-122 from other candidates in our pipeline, such as ABT-494 and risankizumab. As a result, we have made the decision not to pursue further development of this asset.
While in this particular setting, we didn't see the high-level of differentiation we were seeking, the validation of the bio-specific platform gives us confidence to continue to advance other programs with different mechanisms of action. 
Also in our immunology portfolio, we continue to make progress with vobarilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor nanobody being developed in collaboration with Ablynx, for patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. Earlier this month, Ablynx announced positive top line results from a Phase II monotherapy study, demonstrating that this asset improves symptoms of RA. We expect results from a second Phase II study evaluating use of methotrexate in the third quarter, which will allow us to determine next steps for development of this asset.
In the quarter, we also made significant progress in other key therapeutic areas and are on track to advance several programs in the second half of the year. In virology, our next-generation HCV program is progressing well. 
Early in the quarter, at the International Liver Congress, we presented new data on our pan-genotypic once-daily ribavirin-free combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in patients with genotypes 1 through 6, including data on treatment durations as short as 8 weeks. The data illustrate that with 8 weeks of treatment, 97% and 98% of genotype 1 through 3 patients without cirrhosis treated with AbbVie's next-generation regimen achieved sustained virologic response in 12 weeks. Additionally, 100% of genotype 4 through 6 patients without cirrhosis achieved SVR12 with 12 weeks of treatment. 
Overall, we believe that AbbVie's next-generation HCV therapy will be able to address the remaining unmet medical need within this market. We continue to expect to see results from the Phase III trials in the coming months, and we remain on track for commercialization next year.
And in the area of women's health, we are nearing completion of our Phase III endometriosis program, with regulatory submission planned for 2017. Earlier this year, we announced positive top line results from the second of 2 replicate pivotal Phase III clinical trials evaluating Elagolix in premenopausal women who suffer pain from endometriosis. The results showed that after 6 months of continuous treatment, both doses of Elagolix met the study's co-primary endpoints, with Elagolix reducing scores of menstrual pain and nonmenstrual pelvic pain at month 3 and month 6.
We plan to present detailed results from both Phase III studies, including extension study data up to 12 months, at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in October. And our Phase III studies in uterine fibroids are underway and progressing well. This program is investigating the effect of Elagolix on heavy bleeding related to this highly prevalent condition. 
So in summary, we continue to make significant progress with our pipeline and are on track for further advancements in the remainder of 2016. We have a broad pipeline that includes more than 50 active clinical development programs, including more than 20 new products or indications in late-stage development or under regulatory review. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our second quarter performance."

This morning, I'll review our second quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2016, inclusive of the recently completed Stemcentrx transaction and the BI collaboration. We're very pleased with our strong second quarter",1098,"Thanks, Mike. This morning, I'll review our second quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2016, inclusive of the recently completed Stemcentrx transaction and the BI collaboration. 
We're very pleased with our strong second quarter results. In addition to delivering strong operational sales growth of 18%, we exceeded the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share guidance range by $0.06, and it delivered growth of nearly 17% over the second quarter of 2015. As Rick mentioned, we continue to see strong momentum from HUMIRA, with global sales of more than $4.1 billion, up 17.7% operationally.
In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased nearly 27%. We continue to see mid-teens prescription volume growth across the brand, fueled by robust demand in the room [ph] derm and gastro market segments. In the quarter, we also saw a low single-digit benefit on the growth rate as a result of customer-buying patterns versus the prior year quarter. Channel inventory levels in both the second quarter of 2015 and 2016 were below half a month.
International HUMIRA sales were more than $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4% on an operational basis and exceeding our prior guidance of 3% operational growth for the quarter. Internationally, HUMIRA continues to maintain its strong market leadership position. We continue to see only modest overall market share gains for biosimilar REMICADE in major markets in line with our planning assumptions. And while still early in the launch, the Enbrel biosimilar continues to perform in line with our assumptions.
Global IMBRUVICA net revenues were $439 million in the quarter. U.S. sales were $384 million, and our international profit-sharing was $55 million. Global VIEKIRA sales in the second quarter were $419 million. This reflects weaker quarter-over-quarter sales in the U.S. due to competitive dynamics, offset by our performance in international markets.
Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew nearly 29% on an operational basis in the quarter, continuing to grow by double digits internationally, with a modest level of U.S. sales as expected.
We also saw strong operational sales growth in the quarter from both Creon and Lupron, which were up 13% and 11%, respectively. As Rick noted, in the quarter, we received approval for 2 new products, Venclexta and Zinbryta. We launched Venclexta early in the quarter in its initial indication for relapsed/refractory CLL patients, with a 17p deletion, which represents a smaller addressable patient population in the U.S. We have begun a measured commercial rollout to ensure adequate physician training, and we expect a modest level of Venclexta sales for 2016. For Zinbryta, we plan to launch in the U.S. in August. 
Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 81.9% of sales. On a comparative year-over-year basis, this ratio reflects an adverse impact from foreign exchange of roughly 320 basis points. In addition, the adjusted gross margin reflects 160 basis points of unfavorable impact related to the Pharmacyclics acquisition, including the profit transfer from IMBRUVICA. Adjusting for these impacts, gross margin profile performance improved by approximately 140 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted R&D was 15.5% of sales, reflecting funding actions supporting the pipeline, as well as the impact of both Stemcentrx transaction and the BI collaboration.
Adjusted SG&A was 22.2% of the sales in the second quarter, down 290 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 43.9% of sales, down 30 basis points relative to the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange and the Pharmacyclics acquisition, operating margin profile performance improved 370 basis points versus the prior year. 
Net interest expense was $225 million and the adjusted tax rate was 20.1% in the quarter. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding noncash intangible amortization expense and specified items, were $1.26, up 16.7% year-over-year.
Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our strong business performance year-to-date, we are raising our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range to $4.73 to $4.83, reflecting adjusted EPS growth of 11.4% at the midpoint. This includes the previously communicated $0.28 of dilution related to the Stemcentrx acquisition and the BI collaboration.
We are also updating our 2016 GAAP diluted EPS guidance range to $3.82 to $3.92, which includes $0.91 per share of noncash intangible asset amortization expense and other specified items, including acquisition costs and accounting impacts associated with Stemcentrx and the BI collaboration. 
On the top line, we expect full year sales approaching $26 billion. Foreign exchange dynamics have run favorable relative to our initial projections, and we are now forecasting approximately 1% of negative top line impact from currency for the full year.
Based on our strong performance year-to-date, we now expect U.S. HUMIRA operational sales growth of more than 20%. And we remain on track with our previously communicated full year guidance for international HUMIRA, with operational growth in the mid-single digits. 
We now forecast an adjusted gross margin profile approaching 81%, impacted by stronger performance of hedged currencies in 2016. The gross margin profile also reflects 130 basis points of impact related to the Pharmacyclics acquisition. Excluding this and the year-over-year exchange impacts, the gross margin profile is expected to improve relative to 2015 by roughly 190 basis points. 
We are now forecasting R&D expense of more than 16% of sales, reflecting our increased R&D investments related to the Stemcentrx acquisition and the BI collaboration. And we expect SG&A to run at approximately 23% of sales. We now forecast an adjusted operating margin profile approaching 42% on a full year basis. We remain committed to delivering on our 2020 targeted operating margin forecast of above 50% of sales.
We are now forecasting net interest expense of approximately $925 million for the full year, above our original guidance of approximately $800 million as a result of the debt we issued for the Stemcentrx acquisition. And we expect an adjusted tax rate in the 20% to 21% range in 2016. 
Regarding the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 to $1.20. This excludes roughly $0.16 of specified items and noncash amortization and includes the dilutive impact of Stemcentrx and the BI collaboration. We are expecting high single-digit operational sales growth, excluding a modest negative foreign exchange impact in the quarter. 
So in conclusion, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter as we've driven strong top and bottom line growth while also advancing on our strategic priorities and our pipeline. This puts us in a strong position to continue delivering industry-leading growth this year. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz."

So Rick, there's clearly substantial track value in the company because of the uncertainty for investors around HUMIRA. And you've made positive steps to deal with this through building new growth drivers through R&D, aggressive business development as well as making clear your long-term expectations regarding HUMIRA. Even so, despite great quarters like today, we're still seeing the shares trade at substantial discounts to peers. So is there anything else that's up for discussion in terms of how you can unlock the track value in the company, whether it's through different capital allocation, separation of the oncology platform given the valuations they can carry these days or anything else? Second one for Mike, I wonder, what does your collaboration with Bristol on Rova-T tell you about what they are thinking regarding the positioning of their Opdivo/Yervoy combination in small cell lung cancer? And then last, maybe for Rick again. We're expecting that you'll be in place by Q4 to initiate patent litigation against Amgen, and it will be beyond just the dosing and formulation patents that have been more widely discussed to date. Are those still reasonable expectations? And do you think investors will be reassured when we see what other patents Amgen has agreed that they are potentially infringing out of the patent dance?"

I'll cover the first and third one, and then I'll have Mike cover the other one. So on the on-track value, what I would tell you is that if you look at our PE, I think what you've seen, and if you look at the range of companies in our peer group, there are obviously companies that have a much lower PE for a variety set of reasons, and there are companies where they have higher PEs, and the median PE is certainly above where we are. So there's certainly a level of overhang that's associated with the biosimilar uncertainty around HUMIRA. And I think what we have laid out for investors is a clear strategy that we put in place, starting back in 2013, of how we were going to deal with that. Ultimately, we have a large portfolio of IP around HUMIRA, and we certainly expect that to be able to protect the asset, as we described back in October. We have now added to the portfolio 2 fundamentally differentiated new assets in 494 risankizumab, and you're seeing some of that data play out. And so that we fundamentally believe that those will allow us to ultimately be able to grow through what will obviously be, at some point, a biosimilar impact, both internationally as well as in the U.S. And then we've spent a considerable amount of time building a robust pipeline that we've shown at our R&D day and in other events that has the ability to be able to ultimately generate a very significant revenue opportunity that will allow us to grow through even the most bearish impact that's out there, from an analyst standpoint, around biosimilars. So I think we've done the things that we think are important to be able to communicate and then ultimately, build a strategy to be able to drive the business from a growth perspective, because that was the chart that we set for the company when we launched. And I think we've demonstrated that we're capable of doing that. I think it will take some time for the litigation strategies to play out and for investors to continue to gain confidence. Having said that, we constantly look at different kinds of alternatives that we think truly are value-enhancing to shareholders, but also value-enhancing to the business itself. And we'll explore all of those in time to determine whether or not they make sense. I mean, I think, if anything, we've probably been on the proactive side of going out and building new growth platforms and other kinds of things to be able to sustain the business going forward. And we have seen the PE improve, and we would certainly expect that it will continue to improve. I mean, if you look at our performance, both currently as well as going forward, as we projected it in our LRP, we will perform in the top tier of our peer groups. And we would expect that we'll start to see the PE reflect that to a greater extent going forward as the litigation strategy plays out more. On the third question, and I'm sure there will be other questions around the litigation, and I'll apologize in advance that this won't be a very satisfying answer for you, but it certainly, I think you'll understand why. We're now in the very active phase of litigation around HUMIRA biosimilars. And therefore, we're not in a position where we're going to be able to provide a lot of color. And we're certainly not in a position where we can do this play-by-play strategy of how we're going to deal with every aspect of it. That just wouldn't be a smart thing for us to do. What I can reiterate is this, back in October, we outlined in detail the extensive portfolio of IP that we have for HUMIRA and our confidence in that IP. And it goes beyond any one single patent. And I can tell you, we remain confident in that IP portfolio, and we've made it very clear that we intend to vigorously defend all of our IP against anyone that potentially infringes it. And so that process will play out. So as I said, it's just not prudent for us now in this phase to ultimately lay out in detail the play-by-play.

So this is Mike, I'll take the question about the BMS collaboration. So I think that, first of all, we're very fortunate that after many years without much progress in the treatment of small cell lung cancer, there are very promising mechanisms coming forward, our own Rova-T as well as the data that have been presented recently in immuno-oncology. And I think that offers real benefit for patients downstream. What I would say about the way the 2 companies are thinking about these assets, I think that the speed with which the deal came together really speaks for itself. And that collaboration would not have been possible in the short period of time if we were thinking about the assets very differently. As we've said in other settings, when one is thinking about the treatment of patients with small cell lung cancer, there are a couple of treatment goals. The first is that one needs to get disease control, because these patients present very ill with very rapidly progressing disease. And Rova-T has shown, in its Phase II studies, that it can do that and it can do that with a defined course of therapy. We also believe that the data strongly support that the responses with Rova-T will be durable. Now when one thinks about other treatment goals, it would be desirable to have a long-term surveillance on board after one achieves that initial strong and durable disease control. And we believe that IL agents can play a real role there. And so the collaboration with Bristol will test this and we believe will provide very exciting data for patients with small cell lung cancer in the future."

And for which indications? And wondering what we will see potentially at ESMO. And Michael, just maybe if you could explain. I'm still getting a lot of pushback from investors who are unclear about the value of Rova-T, just given that the response rate that we saw at ASCO was a bit lower than what we saw at World Lung, I think creating question marks around the durability of response."

I'll take the hep C question that you had. Certainly, we -- as we said in the first quarter call, we have seen an impact of the new entrant into the marketplace. I'd say we've seen it primarily in the public channels, particularl",555,"Okay, Jami, this is Rick. I'll take the hep C question that you had. Certainly, we -- as we said in the first quarter call, we have seen an impact of the new entrant into the marketplace. I'd say we've seen it primarily in the public channels, particularly, I'd say, the VA. And it really boils down to a pricing strategy. And ultimately, we decided that we were not going to match the lowest price, the 8-week price that was out into the marketplace. And therefore, we lost a significant amount of share. I mean, at our peak, we probably had close to 40% share. And now we have share that's more down in the single-digit range. So I'd say that's the vast majority of the impact that we've seen. There has been some price impact also that played through, but the greater impact is clearly share loss in that public channel primarily. And so as we look forward to next generation, I think as we look at the profile of that asset, obviously, from a clinical performance standpoint, it is everything we would have hoped it would be. Based on the data that we've seen so far, I think it'll be a highly competitive asset. It will also provide, because it is pan-genotypic, an opportunity to be able to bridge across all of the genotypes and in particular, in the United States, genotype 2 and 3 where it’s evolving, essentially had a strong position in the marketplace. And so this will even that playing field. So we fundamentally believe that next generation will allow us an opportunity to be able to grow our share. If you look outside the United States as an example and you look in countries where there is predominantly a 1B population, but even in some countries where there's a significant 1A population, our market shares in most of those countries are in, I'd say, on the low end, 30%; on the high end, sometimes as high as 70%. And so we compete very well, and the profile of 1B is certainly much more of a competitive profile to the alternatives that are available outside the United States. And so I think it gives you an idea of our ability to be able to perform in those markets. So we would hope and I think expect that next generation will allow us to be able to gain share in those marketplaces. The $3 billion, you're probably going back to the first prediction, and I think we anticipate that we would get back into that range. But I'm going out of the business of predicting HCV at this point. I think what I would say is, despite the impact that we've seen in the U.S., from a share standpoint, I think it shows you how fundamentally strong the overall business is, because we've taken a fairly substantial hit in the U.S. on HCV. But yet, we continue to perform at a very high level and offset all of that impact and are now raising guidance on top of that. So the balance of our entire business and in particular, I'd say, HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA right now, gives us the ability to be able to do that. And so we're not dependent upon that single asset performing at a certain level. Mike?"

Rova-T, the objective response data for Rova-T has been very consistent, in our view, across the various reports over the last several months. And they've ranged from about 39% into the mid-40% range. And that really just relates to the cut of the data, whether one is using initial investigative reports or subsequent adjudicated assessments of objective response and doesn't bear on durability of those responses in any way. And the objective response and importantly, the clinical benefit rate have both remained very high. The one-year survival has also been very consistent in the 30-plus percent range across the data cuts, which gives us a very good feel for the durability of those responses. And in this heavily pretreated patient population, the best estimate, the most rigorous, but also the highest estimate, of 1-year survival is about 12%. And in many cases, it may actually be lower than that. And so that 30% number we view as very important. So we don't see anything concerning with respect to the durability of the responses with Rova-T. So with respect to the remainder of the Stemcentrx pipeline, there are actually 5 programs in the clinic now, 1 of those is Rova-T. Two are the Pfizer-partnered programs, PTK7 and EFNA4. And then there are 2 other programs in the clinic for solid tumor indicators, but we haven't disclosed those targets or the particular tumors of interest at this point in time. In addition to those 5, there are 5 additional assets that will enter the clinic over the next 12 to 18 months, so by the end of 2017. And the areas of initial interest, when one looks at the tumors that we’re treating today, will obviously be small cell. There's also a focus on ovarian cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, among others."

So let me start with the biosimilar impact, because as you've said, we've seen biosimilar certainly with the REMICADE biosimilar in the market for quite some time, and now we're in the early phases of",872,"Okay, great. Chris, this is Rick. So I'll cover those. So let me start with the biosimilar impact, because as you've said, we've seen biosimilar certainly with the REMICADE biosimilar in the market for quite some time, and now we're in the early phases of the launch of Enbrel biosimilars in the -- particularly in the European areas. So if you look at REMICADE, there are REMICADE biosimilars now in roughly 60-plus countries, like 62 countries. About 50 of those -- a little more than 50 of those have pricing and reimbursement, so they're actively involved in marketing the product in those countries. If -- we've studied it very carefully. If you look at the overall share of biosimilars, it's less than 5%. It's about 4.5%. If you look at their share of REMICADE, it's about 20%, 22%, something like that. It varies a lot. So I'd say it's very high in tender-based countries like in Norway, Denmark, Poland, as an example, very high market share in those, if you go more into the traditional Western European markets, more like in the 20% to 25% share of the REMICADE market. And the discounting has played out to basically range in the tender countries fairly high. I'd say that's 50% to 70% kind of range, from a discounting standpoint; and the rest of the market, probably in that 30% to 40% kind of range. It hasn't had any impact on us at all. REMICADE, because it's an infusion product in most of those countries, doesn't compete in the same space that we compete in. So then you move over to Enbrel. So Enbrel's approved now, the Enbrel biosimilars are approved in about 32 countries. There's pricing and reimbursement in about 1/3 of those countries right now. We've seen much lower discounting than what we've expected, I'd say. It ranges from as little as low single-digit discounting to maybe up in the 30% to 35% range in non-tender countries and kind of the high 30s to high 50s in the tender countries. Again, it's playing out similar to the way we saw the REMICADE biosimilars. So in the tender countries, they're having higher share like the Norways and the Denmarks, Germany, Sweden, single-digit kind of figures. So really, no substantial market share impact. But it's too early in the process for us to see that. I'd say, the strategy that we anticipated and the one we put in place seems to be working well. But it's the early rounds, and you can see it in the performance of the business. You can see HUMIRA's continuing to grow in the international markets. And as you back out the Venezuela impact, you can see it's actually growing in the 6% or so range, 6.2% range. And so we are continuing to see good strong growth in those markets. And so I'd say, the early rounds are working like we had anticipated they would. And then -- but we need to give it some more time and see how it plays out. But it's a good opportunity for us to see how our strategy is working and be able to modify that strategy. So that's essentially the biosimilar impact that we see. Nothing different than what we had expected. Now let me move over to derm and the impact on 17s. I'd say, overall, we're very happy with our performance in the derm space. So if you look at the U.S, I'll talk specifically about the U.S, we've seen TRxs grow, in fact, accelerate over the course of time. I mean, if you go back to the early part of 2015 or even look at the average across 2015, we had -- got a low double-digit TRx growth in first and second quarter. That's accelerated to like 17% or 18% TRx growth in derm. And so we're seeing nice strong growth in that segment of the market. If you look at our revenue, a very similar kind of profile. We had strong double-digit growth, and now it's accelerated fairly dramatically, probably about 10 to 15 points above what it had been running at. If you look at market share, our overall market share is pretty stable to maybe slightly down, 1.5% or so. As we analyze it, it is really driven extensively by the Otezla experience, where we're seeing a lot more patients, particularly moderate and sometimes mild patients coming into the category. And so therefore, the category is growing faster. And so that dilutes our market share position. When we pull Otezla out and we look at our market share, our market share looks relatively stable. In particular, if you look at PsA, our overall share has been stable in the U.S. at about 32%. If you look at room [ph] PsA, it's actually increased about 3 points, which is the larger part of the PsA market, it's about 75% of the overall PsA market. And even the AS PsA has increased about 2 points. Psoriasis, as I've said, is down about 1.5 to 2 points in total, but it's more driven by Otezla. So overall, we feel very good about how the business is performing across all the indications, but certainly, in derm as well."

So I'll cover that, and maybe Mike can jump in on some specifics. When we went into -- when we made the decision that the core growth -- future growth franchise on top of immunology was going to be oncology, we made a decision that we would invest in a way to try to build leadership positions in certain areas where we thought we had core competencies that were complementary to being able to perform in those areas. So specifically, we started with hematological oncology based on the assets that we had internally as well as the opportunity that existed with Pharmacyclics. And our goal was to basically build a position where we thought we could drive to a leadership position within that category. So if you look at the assets we have today, including IMBRUVICA and where we think Venclexta will be able to expand to, it would tell us that we should have an opportunity to be able to bring forward innovative therapies in roughly 65% of the overall market in hematological malignancies. And I'd say that, that's an area where we feel comfortable with what we have. Now having said that, if we found unique opportunities, I think, particularly in the acute leukemia side assets or technologies or a drug that we thought was particularly attractive in an area where we didn't think we had a strong asset already, certainly, we would pursue that kind of an asset. But I'd say, from a platform standpoint, we feel very good about what we have in hematological malignancies, both internally as well as the addition of Pharmacyclics that we did a year or so ago. On the solid tumor side, as we've said before about Stemcentrx, one of the things that was attractive to us is we have a number of efforts internally to be able to identify new targets. And so we have an effort internally to be able to do that. We obviously have a collaboration with Calico. And part of the work that they're doing is to identify new oncology targets. But we wanted a more fundamental base platform for solid tumors. And one of the things that attracted us to Stemcentrx is we believe they have that. And we're excited about that opportunity. And Mike talked earlier about the number of candidates that will be moving on to that platform. And I think it's impressive what they've accomplished. And so that has built what we fundamentally believe will be the core platform for us in solid tumors, in addition to what we already have. We certainly continue to look for, again, now, more individual kinds of technology plays or assets that might be complementary to that, but we're not looking for another big platform. I don't know, Mike, did you want to add anything?"

With respect to some of the issues you brought up on competitive programs, we don't really view potency as a primary driver here. In fact, the most potent agent in this axis is Lupron, and the problem is, in fact, the degree to which that shuts down axis. We're trying to achieve a fine titration of dose, and we believe Elagolix has the properties to allow us to do that. With respect to co-formulation with add-back, there is nothing that would prevent us from co-formulating with add-back as well. And we believe, over time, there may be a number of strategies that can be used to protect bone, and so we'll have flexibility to employ many different strategies. So we feel very good about the position of Elagolix. We think it's an important treatment option. And we think that it's going to make a real impact on endometriosis.

And I think when we look at the overall profile of Elagolix, we remain convinced that it's very strong."

And then the other one, which you didn't touch much on at the R&D Day and I think it's overlooked a little bit is veliparib. And there's been a lot of discussions around the PARPs recently. Just curious if you can kind of maybe refresh us on sort of what you feel is the competitive advantages that you may hold or where that's going to sort of fit in relative to the other PARPs that are in -- either on the market or in development?"

So the first part of the question related to multiple myeloma. And we have the potential to pursue myeloma with a number of assets on our portfolio. Venclexta has clear potential there, and we're advancing that program rapidly, as we mentioned durin",375,"Okay. So the first part of the question related to multiple myeloma. And we have the potential to pursue myeloma with a number of assets on our portfolio. Venclexta has clear potential there, and we're advancing that program rapidly, as we mentioned during our opening remarks. Imbruvica also has potential as to a number of the molecules in our pipeline. It is a competitive space. One can prolong survival to a much a bigger extent today than was possible a decade ago. But we still don't have curative therapies, patients ultimately fail therapy and progress, which means that we need new mechanisms that aren't cross-reactive that provide durable disease control. And we think we have a number of those in our pipeline. So we're aware of the competition certainly, but we think we have therapies that will further the standard of care in that disease. And we'll be driving clinical programs forward to demonstrate that. With respect to veliparib. So veliparib is a molecule that is an important part of our overall oncology efforts. It's in Phase III studies across a range of tumor indications. We have a bit of a different hypothesis around the way veliparib should be used than perhaps some of the others who are developing PARPs. We are not focused solely on the use in patients with germline BRCA mutations or other HRD-deficient tumors. We are exploring the hypothesis in our Phase III program. That part can augment DNA damage in chemotherapy. Essentially, that the first hit doesn't have to come from a genetic hit. It can come from a therapeutic hit that is DNA damaging, which would increase the importance of DNA repair mechanisms. That hypothesis is being tested in a range of Phase III programs in non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer and in ovarian cancer. And those studies will start to read out in 2017. We'll have a number of important data readouts, which will tell us the role that PARP can play there. So we haven't focused on it as much in recent Investor Days, and that's largely because it is in a quiet period where the studies are up and running. We're generating the results. But you'll hear a lot more about PARP in 2017."

Could you just comment on your perspective on contracting for individual indications in autoimmune disease? And then second, Rick, I was hoping that you could provide a little bit more detail on the sort of timing and specifics surrounding the patent litigation steps. So obviously, you're not going to comment on individual patents or individual patent strategies. But as I understand it, there will be -- immediately after Amgen gets approval of its biosimilar, immediately after that occurs, there will be a wave of patent litigation that kicks in.

Indication-based pricing, I think, first evolved primarily in the oncology space. And it was driven, I think, by certain efforts to say, you have an oncology agent that has very strong efficacy in a certain disease and might have significantly lower efficacy in another disease, and why would I pay the same for this strong efficacy as I would for relatively modest efficacy? I think that was how the concept originally evolved. As we look at HUMIRA and we look across all of the major indications at least, with every single indication, there's obviously some variation between the competitive profiles. But I'd say, in general, HUMIRA tends to perform across those broad set of indications in the top tier. And so that is how we view it. So indication-based pricing wouldn't be something that we think is very applicable for this specific asset in this particular class. And we haven't seen it take off much prior to this, and we'll have to see how it plays out over time. Again, on the time -- there are a lot -- it may sound to you like it's a fairly innocent issue around timing and the steps and what should play out. But I would tell you, it's not that, from a litigation standpoint. So I'm just going to need to take the same position I did before. We're not in the position to be able to give you a lot more color. Certainly, we've made it clear what our position is going to be, and I think that will become clearer as the steps play out. But I can't give you a whole lot of color on the timing or what the alternatives would be."

And I think that will give you some good sense of the overall dynamics of the brand. And then I'll back up and talk a little bit about the business in general. Obviously, the brand's performing very, very well in the U.S. We grew to 26.7% in the Q. Script trends, the way we see them, we're in the mid-teens for the quarter. Our price was up. It was actually up in the single digits. And then as we -- as I said in my comments, we did see a modest impact from differences in customer order patterns. Again, we run this business at less than half a month inventory, but it gets a little tough to call at various times. And we did see a little bit of demand differences between the Q. We had a little bit lower inventories in the second quarter of '15 relative to '16. So yes, I think the way you got to think about this is mid-teens growth from script and single-digit price. And when you add those up, yes, you can pretty much get to the 20% number that we've guided to. From an overall price standpoint, look, I would say, if you back up and look at our growth on the quarter of 18%, the majority was volume. Across the total book of business, we had a price impact of less than 4%. So the strategy that we've actually employed for the business and certainly, with our new products launching is this is going to be a product -- a company that's fueled by volume and not price. Obviously, price, we do have an opportunity in certain markets to take it. But I would not say this is a company that is heavily dependent on price. And then as we look out over the LRP, we tend to scale down our price expectations in the U.S, because we think that's the prudent way to model."

We delivered another strong quarter, with results well ahead of our expectations, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, representing growth of 16.7% versus the second qu",1218,"Thank you, Liz, Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We delivered another strong quarter, with results well ahead of our expectations, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.26, representing growth of 16.7% versus the second quarter of 2015. Our results in the quarter included strong top line performance, with global operational sales growth of 18%, reflecting robust growth from several products in our portfolio, including HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, among others. 
We're pleased with our outperformance in the quarter and progress year-to-date. We've driven outstanding commercial, operational and R&D execution, resulting in strong top and bottom line results. Based on our performance in the first half of the year, we're raising our full year 2016 EPS guidance to $4.73 to $4.83 on an adjusted basis, reflecting growth of 11.4% at the midpoint. 
As I mentioned, several products within our portfolio are driving robust growth. HUMIRA continues to drive strong performance, delivering global operational growth of more than 17% in the quarter. Despite increasing competition from new classes of drugs and indirect biosimilar competition in international markets, HUMIRA continues to demonstrate exceptional performance and durability across all 3 market segments. 
In rheumatology, HUMIRA is the #1 prescribed biologic, and we continue to grow our share position in the face of new competition. And in dermatology and gastro, HUMIRA continues to hold a strong market leadership position, demonstrating double-digit growth year-over-year.
We also continue to be pleased with the strong IMBRUVICA performance, which is tracking in line to slightly ahead of our expectations following our approval for first-line use in CLL. IMBRUVICA has achieved the #1 market share position in all approved disease indications in second-line and second-line-plus treatment. And since we received the FDA approval of IMBRUVICA as a first-line treatment for CLL late in the first quarter, IMBRUVICA has already gained a market share position in first-line in the mid-teens and the third position in the market. 
And this share continues to steadily increase, with approximately 1 of every 6 patients now receiving IMBRUVICA as a front-line therapy, surpassing FCR, which is generally considered the gold standard for young and fit CLL patients. This market share and the strong momentum underlying its performance further reinforces our confidence and our long-term expectations for IMBRUVICA that supported our decision to acquire Pharmacyclics last year. 
We also saw strong performance from several other products in our portfolio, including Duodopa, Creon and Lupron. Each of these therapies within our marketed product portfolio continue to deliver durable performance. Global VIEKIRA sales in the second quarter were $419 million, up 8.2% on an operational basis. Growth in the quarter was driven by our international business. In the U.S, as we described on our first quarter call, we have seen market share loss and some price erosion due to the entry of a new competitor into the HCV market.
We are nearing the completion of our registrational studies for our next-generation pan-genotypic HCV combination. Based on the mid-stage data we've disclosed to date, we believe that our new HCV combination will be highly competitive. The data illustrates that this therapy can deliver mature [ph] rates approaching 100% across genotypes. And we believe the majority of patients will be well served with an 8-week treatment option. We expect to see results from the pivotal studies in the second half, and we remain on track for commercialization next year.
In addition to our strong financial results, we've continued to advance our strategic priorities and have made excellent progress with our R&D pipeline. Mike will cover the pipeline in more detail in just a few moments, so I'll only mention a few highlights. 
Importantly, we successfully completed the acquisition of Stemcentrx. We've been impressed by the caliber of talent we've welcomed from Stemcentrx, and the transition has been seamless. The addition of Stemcentrx is a strategically and financially compelling opportunity for our company, giving AbbVie a highly attractive platform for solid tumors and an extremely exciting late-stage asset in Rova-T. 
The transaction enables AbbVie to further expand and accelerate our presence in oncology, building upon our growing position in hematological oncology. We are moving rapidly to advance Rova-T in its lead indication, third-line small cell lung cancer, and we continue to feel confident about our 2017 BLA filing strategy and launch in 2018. We are also rapidly advancing studies to evaluate Rova-T in earlier lines of therapy for small cell lung cancer, including combination studies with both chemotherapy and immuno-oncology agents. 
Earlier this week, we jointly announced the clinical collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb to evaluate the combination of Rova-T with BMS's immuno-oncology agents in small cell lung cancer, with trials beginning this year. We're pleased to be partnering with BMS to bring innovative new therapies forward that have the potential to significantly improve the survival of patients with small cell lung cancer, a disease with devastating outcomes.
We've also continued to make significant progress with our hematological oncology portfolio. We're building upon our strong position with IMBRUVICA in treating blood cancers with Venclexta. 
During the quarter, we received the first FDA approval for Venclexta for patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, who harbor the 17p deletion, a difficult-to-treat form of the disease, typically associated with poor prognosis. The approval for this transformative therapy was granted under breakthrough therapy and priority review designations, and the launch is still in its early stages. 
Although this first indication is a relatively small patient population, it is important to provide patients with this difficult-to-treat disease, a new therapy with strong clinical results. And it's also important to give physicians an opportunity to gain experience with the particular initial dosing regimen of Venclexta to ensure patients receive the benefit of this therapy. 
We expect data from the Phase III study evaluating Venclexta in a broader set of relapsed/refractory CLL patients to read out next year, supporting our regulatory submission for an expanded label covering all relapsed/refractory CLL patients, a much larger population. Like IMBRUVICA, we believe that Venclexta will be effective across a range of hematological malignancies with high unmet need, and we're actively evaluating additional indications, including acute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma, among others. 
We also continue to make progress across other important areas of our pipeline. During the quarter, we presented positive results for a mid-stage study of our anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab, in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease. The pivotal program for risankizumab is in psoriasis, and it's underway and enrolling very well. And in partnership with Biogen, we recently received FDA and EC approval for Zinbryta for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. We plan to launch Zinbryta in the U.S. in August.
In summary, we continue to be pleased with our strong execution and the significant advancements in our pipeline. As we outlined in our recent R&D day, we have 8 late-stage assets, which have been significantly derisked and have the potential to drive meaningful revenue growth in the years to come. We've continued to demonstrate an exceptional track record of success with positive clinical data and regulatory outcomes and strong commercial performance. We intend to build on this momentum to drive a high level of performance across our operations in the second half of the year. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for some additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?"

We had another very productive quarter from an R&D perspective, with significant progress on several programs, including the FDA approval of Venclexta for its first indication in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL with a 17p deletion m",2054,"Thank you, Rick. We had another very productive quarter from an R&D perspective, with significant progress on several programs, including the FDA approval of Venclexta for its first indication in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL with a 17p deletion mutation, as well as the FDA and EMA approvals of Zinbryta for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Today, I'll highlight additional updates and discuss some of the milestones we anticipate in the second half of 2016.
I'll start with our oncology portfolio, an area where we are growing our already strong position in hematological malignancies, as well as establishing a strong foundation in solid tumors, which was significantly accelerated by our recent acquisition of Stemcentrx and its lead asset, Rova-T. 
At the ASCO meeting in early June, we presented data from a Phase II trial in small cell lung cancer that demonstrated that Rova-T monotherapy drove a 1-year survival rate of 32% in DLL3-positive patients, almost triple that of historical third-line standard of care at 12%. In addition to the impressive 1-year survival, Rova-T showed the most compelling single-agent activity in terms of the overall response rate, clinical benefit rate and progression-free survival in third-line small cell lung cancer, the patient population where our first pivotal trial for registration is rapidly enrolling.
The confirmatory third-line registrational trial, which is called TRINITY, began in January and is expected to complete enrollment by the end of 2016, with commercialization expected in 2018. We are also quickly advancing Rova-T into studies to support front-line treatment in small cell lung cancer in combination with chemotherapy. The first-line development program includes a Phase I/II regimen flexion study that will be used to inform future Phase III pivotal trials, evaluating various combinations of Rova-T and chemotherapy. The regimen selection study is expected to begin next quarter. 
The first-line program also includes the Mehru [ph] study, a Phase III registrational trial evaluating standard chemotherapy followed by Rova-T in the front-line setting. We expect to have this study up and running by the end of the year. 
We are also advancing an 8-arm basket study, evaluating Rova-T in a range of neuroendocrine tumors, where DLL3 plays an important role. This study is on track to begin this quarter, with data expected next year. Given that many of these tumor types have low survival rates and limited treatment options available, there may be an opportunity to explore single-arm studies to support accelerated approval. 
As Rick mentioned earlier this week, we announced the clinical collaboration with BMS to evaluate the investigational combination of Rova-T with Opdivo and with Opdivo and Yervoy in small cell lung cancer. We believe that combining Rova-T with these checkpoint inhibitors could drive enhanced and sustained efficacy, above what that which either approach could offer individually. 
Preclinical evidence and biological rationale supports our prioritization of efforts to combine Rova-T with IO agents, and we believe these combinations have the potential to establish a new standard of care. We expect to begin the Rova-T/IO combination study by the end of the year. 
In addition to Rova-T, we've also continued to make progress with our pipeline assets targeting solid tumors. In particular, our PARP-inhibitor, veliparib, and ABT-414, an antibody drug conjugate for glioblastoma multiforme. We presented Phase I data for both of these assets at the recent ASCO meeting and anticipate data readouts from registration-enabling studies for both programs over the next 12 months. 
We also continue to make good progress with our hematologic oncology portfolio. In the second quarter, the FDA updated the IMBRUVICA label to include new data from 2 Phase III trials, supporting expanded use in patients with CLL and SLL, including overall survival data from both the RESONATE-2 and HELIOS trials. 
IMBRUVICA is also being evaluated in mid- to late-stage trials for several additional indications, with timing of data readouts and potential regulatory submissions dependent on event-driven analyses of ongoing studies. In June, IMBRUVICA received breakthrough therapy designation as a potential treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy, marking the drug's fourth breakthrough therapy designation. The FDA also granted IMBRUVICA for a drug designation for the same condition. The breakthrough designation was based on clinical data from a Phase II study, evaluating the safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA for the treatment of patients with steroid-dependent or refractory chronic GVHD. A registrational study in graft-versus-host disease is underway, with data expected late this year or early 2017.
We've made significant progress with the development of another important strategic asset, our novel BCL-2 inhibitor, Venclexta, which is being developed in collaboration with Roche. Venclexta was recently approved under priority review for first indication in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL with 17p deletion. Earlier this year, Venclexta also received the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation for use in combination with rituximab for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. 
The Phase III MURANO trial, which will support a broader label in relapsed/refractory CLL, is fully enrolled, with data readout and regulatory submission anticipated in 2017. Additionally, we have an active Phase III program evaluating Venclexta in treatment-naïve CLL patients, with studies underway and progressing well.
Like IMBRUVICA, we believe Venclexta will be effective across a range of blood cancers, including AML and multiple myeloma. We recently started a Phase III program evaluating Venclexta in combination with standard of care in multiple myeloma, and we anticipate moving forward with Phase III development in AML by the end of the year. 
In addition to the elements of the program I've described, we continue to be excited about the ongoing clinical evaluation of combinations of IMBRUVICA and Venclexta, which we believe have the potential to drive profound responses and minimal residual disease negativity in a number of clinical settings. 
Now I'd like to turn our attention to the immunology portfolio, where we have 2 late-stage assets, our anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, risankizumab, and our selective JAK1 inhibitor, ABT-494. Each of these assets has the potential to significantly advance standard of care in immune-mediated conditions, such as RA, psoriasis and Crohn's disease, covering the major market segments where we currently have a leadership position. 
ABT-494 is currently in Phase III development for rheumatoid arthritis, where we are studying the asset in 6 pivotal trials. Our JAK inhibitor has the potential to be best-in-class with what we believe will be an optimized benefit risk profile. Our development strategy is aimed at delivering a comprehensive label to cover multiple lines of therapy from first-line use in methotrexate-naive patients to use in patients with inadequate response to biologics, where the highest unmet need remains in this market. Data from the ABT-494 Phase III RA program is expected in the first half of 2018, with commercialization targeted in 2019.
We have also accelerated the development of this important asset in gastrointestinal disorders. Our Phase II study in Crohn's disease is well underway, and data should be available internally later this year. This will enable the decision to advance the Phase III development by the first quarter of next year. You can expect to see the data from this Phase II Crohn study at DDW next year. In addition, we recently initiated a Phase II study in ulcerative colitis, with data expected in 2018.
Risankizumab is another strategically important late-stage immunology asset. This anti-IL-23 monoclonal antibody, which we licensed from Boehringer Ingelheim earlier this year, has the potential to be a transformative therapy by providing best-in-class efficacy with increased dosing convenience. Risankizumab is currently in Phase III psoriasis trials and in mid-stage development for both Crohn's disease and psoriatic arthritis. Interest in the Phase III psoriasis program has been strong, and enrollment is progressing very well. We continue to expect data from the registrational program in 2018. 
At the Digestive Disease Week meeting in May, we reported encouraging results from a Phase II study of risankizumab in patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn's disease, a particularly difficult-to-treat population, given that the majority of these patients had previously failed treatment with one or more TNF antagonists. Based on these strong results, we intend to move rapidly into Phase III studies in Crohn's disease, with registration trials commencing later this year or early next year.
Another technology that we believe holds great promise is our proprietary bio-specific antibody platform. We've introduced a number of these assets into the clinic in both our immunology and oncology therapeutic areas. Based on our early-stage studies, we've established proof of concept across several programs, demonstrating that these antibodies possess good drug-like properties and deliver the desired pharmacodynamic effects. And we've learned how to successfully and consistently manufacture them. 
We recently evaluated data from 1 of our bio-specific programs in development, ABT-122, our combination anti-TNF and anti-IL-17 in Phase II trials for RA and psoriatic arthritis. The data demonstrated that ABT-122 was well tolerated, with a safety profile that was comparable to HUMIRA. In the mid-stage psoriatic arthritis and RA studies, ABT-122 showed ACR20 response rates as high as 75% and 82%, respectively, demonstrating that the platform worked well with clear evidence of biologic activity. However, the simultaneous inhibition of IL-17 and TNF-alpha did not produce the strong synergistic effect necessary to differentiate ABT-122 from other candidates in our pipeline, such as ABT-494 and risankizumab. As a result, we have made the decision not to pursue further development of this asset.
While in this particular setting, we didn't see the high-level of differentiation we were seeking, the validation of the bio-specific platform gives us confidence to continue to advance other programs with different mechanisms of action. 
Also in our immunology portfolio, we continue to make progress with vobarilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor nanobody being developed in collaboration with Ablynx, for patients with moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis. Earlier this month, Ablynx announced positive top line results from a Phase II monotherapy study, demonstrating that this asset improves symptoms of RA. We expect results from a second Phase II study evaluating use of methotrexate in the third quarter, which will allow us to determine next steps for development of this asset.
In the quarter, we also made significant progress in other key therapeutic areas and are on track to advance several programs in the second half of the year. In virology, our next-generation HCV program is progressing well. 
Early in the quarter, at the International Liver Congress, we presented new data on our pan-genotypic once-daily ribavirin-free combination of ABT-493 and ABT-530 in patients with genotypes 1 through 6, including data on treatment durations as short as 8 weeks. The data illustrate that with 8 weeks of treatment, 97% and 98% of genotype 1 through 3 patients without cirrhosis treated with AbbVie's next-generation regimen achieved sustained virologic response in 12 weeks. Additionally, 100% of genotype 4 through 6 patients without cirrhosis achieved SVR12 with 12 weeks of treatment. 
Overall, we believe that AbbVie's next-generation HCV therapy will be able to address the remaining unmet medical need within this market. We continue to expect to see results from the Phase III trials in the coming months, and we remain on track for commercialization next year.
And in the area of women's health, we are nearing completion of our Phase III endometriosis program, with regulatory submission planned for 2017. Earlier this year, we announced positive top line results from the second of 2 replicate pivotal Phase III clinical trials evaluating Elagolix in premenopausal women who suffer pain from endometriosis. The results showed that after 6 months of continuous treatment, both doses of Elagolix met the study's co-primary endpoints, with Elagolix reducing scores of menstrual pain and nonmenstrual pelvic pain at month 3 and month 6.
We plan to present detailed results from both Phase III studies, including extension study data up to 12 months, at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in October. And our Phase III studies in uterine fibroids are underway and progressing well. This program is investigating the effect of Elagolix on heavy bleeding related to this highly prevalent condition. 
So in summary, we continue to make significant progress with our pipeline and are on track for further advancements in the remainder of 2016. We have a broad pipeline that includes more than 50 active clinical development programs, including more than 20 new products or indications in late-stage development or under regulatory review. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our second quarter performance."

This morning, I'll review our second quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2016, inclusive of the recently completed Stemcentrx transaction and the BI collaboration. We're very pleased with our strong second quarter",1098,"Thanks, Mike. This morning, I'll review our second quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2016, inclusive of the recently completed Stemcentrx transaction and the BI collaboration. 
We're very pleased with our strong second quarter results. In addition to delivering strong operational sales growth of 18%, we exceeded the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share guidance range by $0.06, and it delivered growth of nearly 17% over the second quarter of 2015. As Rick mentioned, we continue to see strong momentum from HUMIRA, with global sales of more than $4.1 billion, up 17.7% operationally.
In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased nearly 27%. We continue to see mid-teens prescription volume growth across the brand, fueled by robust demand in the room [ph] derm and gastro market segments. In the quarter, we also saw a low single-digit benefit on the growth rate as a result of customer-buying patterns versus the prior year quarter. Channel inventory levels in both the second quarter of 2015 and 2016 were below half a month.
International HUMIRA sales were more than $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4% on an operational basis and exceeding our prior guidance of 3% operational growth for the quarter. Internationally, HUMIRA continues to maintain its strong market leadership position. We continue to see only modest overall market share gains for biosimilar REMICADE in major markets in line with our planning assumptions. And while still early in the launch, the Enbrel biosimilar continues to perform in line with our assumptions.
Global IMBRUVICA net revenues were $439 million in the quarter. U.S. sales were $384 million, and our international profit-sharing was $55 million. Global VIEKIRA sales in the second quarter were $419 million. This reflects weaker quarter-over-quarter sales in the U.S. due to competitive dynamics, offset by our performance in international markets.
Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew nearly 29% on an operational basis in the quarter, continuing to grow by double digits internationally, with a modest level of U.S. sales as expected.
We also saw strong operational sales growth in the quarter from both Creon and Lupron, which were up 13% and 11%, respectively. As Rick noted, in the quarter, we received approval for 2 new products, Venclexta and Zinbryta. We launched Venclexta early in the quarter in its initial indication for relapsed/refractory CLL patients, with a 17p deletion, which represents a smaller addressable patient population in the U.S. We have begun a measured commercial rollout to ensure adequate physician training, and we expect a modest level of Venclexta sales for 2016. For Zinbryta, we plan to launch in the U.S. in August. 
Adjusted gross margin for the quarter was 81.9% of sales. On a comparative year-over-year basis, this ratio reflects an adverse impact from foreign exchange of roughly 320 basis points. In addition, the adjusted gross margin reflects 160 basis points of unfavorable impact related to the Pharmacyclics acquisition, including the profit transfer from IMBRUVICA. Adjusting for these impacts, gross margin profile performance improved by approximately 140 basis points versus the prior year. Adjusted R&D was 15.5% of sales, reflecting funding actions supporting the pipeline, as well as the impact of both Stemcentrx transaction and the BI collaboration.
Adjusted SG&A was 22.2% of the sales in the second quarter, down 290 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 43.9% of sales, down 30 basis points relative to the second quarter of 2015. Excluding the negative impact of foreign exchange and the Pharmacyclics acquisition, operating margin profile performance improved 370 basis points versus the prior year. 
Net interest expense was $225 million and the adjusted tax rate was 20.1% in the quarter. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding noncash intangible amortization expense and specified items, were $1.26, up 16.7% year-over-year.
Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our strong business performance year-to-date, we are raising our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range to $4.73 to $4.83, reflecting adjusted EPS growth of 11.4% at the midpoint. This includes the previously communicated $0.28 of dilution related to the Stemcentrx acquisition and the BI collaboration.
We are also updating our 2016 GAAP diluted EPS guidance range to $3.82 to $3.92, which includes $0.91 per share of noncash intangible asset amortization expense and other specified items, including acquisition costs and accounting impacts associated with Stemcentrx and the BI collaboration. 
On the top line, we expect full year sales approaching $26 billion. Foreign exchange dynamics have run favorable relative to our initial projections, and we are now forecasting approximately 1% of negative top line impact from currency for the full year.
Based on our strong performance year-to-date, we now expect U.S. HUMIRA operational sales growth of more than 20%. And we remain on track with our previously communicated full year guidance for international HUMIRA, with operational growth in the mid-single digits. 
We now forecast an adjusted gross margin profile approaching 81%, impacted by stronger performance of hedged currencies in 2016. The gross margin profile also reflects 130 basis points of impact related to the Pharmacyclics acquisition. Excluding this and the year-over-year exchange impacts, the gross margin profile is expected to improve relative to 2015 by roughly 190 basis points. 
We are now forecasting R&D expense of more than 16% of sales, reflecting our increased R&D investments related to the Stemcentrx acquisition and the BI collaboration. And we expect SG&A to run at approximately 23% of sales. We now forecast an adjusted operating margin profile approaching 42% on a full year basis. We remain committed to delivering on our 2020 targeted operating margin forecast of above 50% of sales.
We are now forecasting net interest expense of approximately $925 million for the full year, above our original guidance of approximately $800 million as a result of the debt we issued for the Stemcentrx acquisition. And we expect an adjusted tax rate in the 20% to 21% range in 2016. 
Regarding the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 to $1.20. This excludes roughly $0.16 of specified items and noncash amortization and includes the dilutive impact of Stemcentrx and the BI collaboration. We are expecting high single-digit operational sales growth, excluding a modest negative foreign exchange impact in the quarter. 
So in conclusion, we are very pleased with our performance in the quarter as we've driven strong top and bottom line growth while also advancing on our strategic priorities and our pipeline. This puts us in a strong position to continue delivering industry-leading growth this year. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz."

So Rick, there's clearly substantial track value in the company because of the uncertainty for investors around HUMIRA. And you've made positive steps to deal with this through building new growth drivers through R&D, aggressive business development as well as making clear your long-term expectations regarding HUMIRA. Even so, despite great quarters like today, we're still seeing the shares trade at substantial discounts to peers. So is there anything else that's up for discussion in terms of how you can unlock the track value in the company, whether it's through different capital allocation, separation of the oncology platform given the valuations they can carry these days or anything else? Second one for Mike, I wonder, what does your collaboration with Bristol on Rova-T tell you about what they are thinking regarding the positioning of their Opdivo/Yervoy combination in small cell lung cancer? And then last, maybe for Rick again. We're expecting that you'll be in place by Q4 to initiate patent litigation against Amgen, and it will be beyond just the dosing and formulation patents that have been more widely discussed to date. Are those still reasonable expectations? And do you think investors will be reassured when we see what other patents Amgen has agreed that they are potentially infringing out of the patent dance?"

I'll cover the first and third one, and then I'll have Mike cover the other one. So on the on-track value, what I would tell you is that if you look at our PE, I think what you've seen, and if you look at the range of companies in our peer group, there are obviously companies that have a much lower PE for a variety set of reasons, and there are companies where they have higher PEs, and the median PE is certainly above where we are. So there's certainly a level of overhang that's associated with the biosimilar uncertainty around HUMIRA. And I think what we have laid out for investors is a clear strategy that we put in place, starting back in 2013, of how we were going to deal with that. Ultimately, we have a large portfolio of IP around HUMIRA, and we certainly expect that to be able to protect the asset, as we described back in October. We have now added to the portfolio 2 fundamentally differentiated new assets in 494 risankizumab, and you're seeing some of that data play out. And so that we fundamentally believe that those will allow us to ultimately be able to grow through what will obviously be, at some point, a biosimilar impact, both internationally as well as in the U.S. And then we've spent a considerable amount of time building a robust pipeline that we've shown at our R&D day and in other events that has the ability to be able to ultimately generate a very significant revenue opportunity that will allow us to grow through even the most bearish impact that's out there, from an analyst standpoint, around biosimilars. So I think we've done the things that we think are important to be able to communicate and then ultimately, build a strategy to be able to drive the business from a growth perspective, because that was the chart that we set for the company when we launched. And I think we've demonstrated that we're capable of doing that. I think it will take some time for the litigation strategies to play out and for investors to continue to gain confidence. Having said that, we constantly look at different kinds of alternatives that we think truly are value-enhancing to shareholders, but also value-enhancing to the business itself. And we'll explore all of those in time to determine whether or not they make sense. I mean, I think, if anything, we've probably been on the proactive side of going out and building new growth platforms and other kinds of things to be able to sustain the business going forward. And we have seen the PE improve, and we would certainly expect that it will continue to improve. I mean, if you look at our performance, both currently as well as going forward, as we projected it in our LRP, we will perform in the top tier of our peer groups. And we would expect that we'll start to see the PE reflect that to a greater extent going forward as the litigation strategy plays out more. On the third question, and I'm sure there will be other questions around the litigation, and I'll apologize in advance that this won't be a very satisfying answer for you, but it certainly, I think you'll understand why. We're now in the very active phase of litigation around HUMIRA biosimilars. And therefore, we're not in a position where we're going to be able to provide a lot of color. And we're certainly not in a position where we can do this play-by-play strategy of how we're going to deal with every aspect of it. That just wouldn't be a smart thing for us to do. What I can reiterate is this, back in October, we outlined in detail the extensive portfolio of IP that we have for HUMIRA and our confidence in that IP. And it goes beyond any one single patent. And I can tell you, we remain confident in that IP portfolio, and we've made it very clear that we intend to vigorously defend all of our IP against anyone that potentially infringes it. And so that process will play out. So as I said, it's just not prudent for us now in this phase to ultimately lay out in detail the play-by-play. And so we're just not in a position to be able to do that."

So this is Mike, I'll take the question about the BMS collaboration. So I think that, first of all, we're very fortunate that after many years without much progress in the treatment of small cell lung cancer, there are very promising mechanisms coming forward, our own Rova-T as well as the data that have been presented recently in immuno-oncology. And I think that offers real benefit for patients downstream. What I would say about the way the 2 companies are thinking about these assets, I think that the speed with which the deal came together really speaks for itself. And that collaboration would not have been possible in the short period of time if we were thinking about the assets very differently. As we've said in other settings, when one is thinking about the treatment of patients with small cell lung cancer, there are a couple of treatment goals. The first is that one needs to get disease control, because these patients present very ill with very rapidly progressing disease. And Rova-T has shown, in its Phase II studies, that it can do that and it can do that with a defined course of therapy. We also believe that the data strongly support that the responses with Rova-T will be durable. Now when one thinks about other treatment goals, it would be desirable to have a long-term surveillance on board after one achieves that initial strong and durable disease control. And we believe that IL agents can play a real role there. And so the collaboration with Bristol will test this and we believe will provide very exciting data for patients with small cell lung cancer in the future."

And for which indications? And wondering what we will see potentially at ESMO. And Michael, just maybe if you could explain. I'm still getting a lot of pushback from investors who are unclear about the value of Rova-T, just given that the response rate that we saw at ASCO was a bit lower than what we saw at World Lung, I think creating question marks around the durability of response."

I'll take the hep C question that you had. Certainly, we -- as we said in the first quarter call, we have seen an impact of the new entrant into the marketplace.

Certainly, we -- as we said in the first quarter call, we have seen an impact of the new entrant into the marketplace. I'd say we've seen it primarily in the public channels, particularly, I'd say, the VA. And it really boils down to a pricing strategy. And ultimately, we decided that we were not going to match the lowest price, the 8-week price that was out into the marketplace. And therefore, we lost a significant amount of share. I mean, at our peak, we probably had close to 40% share. And now we have share that's more down in the single-digit range. So I'd say that's the vast majority of the impact that we've seen. There has been some price impact also that played through, but the greater impact is clearly share loss in that public channel primarily. And so as we look forward to next generation, I think as we look at the profile of that asset, obviously, from a clinical performance standpoint, it is everything we would have hoped it would be. Based on the data that we've seen so far, I think it'll be a highly competitive asset. It will also provide, because it is pan-genotypic, an opportunity to be able to bridge across all of the genotypes and in particular, in the United States, genotype 2 and 3 where it’s evolving, essentially had a strong position in the marketplace. And so this will even that playing field. So we fundamentally believe that next generation will allow us an opportunity to be able to grow our share. If you look outside the United States as an example and you look in countries where there is predominantly a 1B population, but even in some countries where there's a significant 1A population, our market shares in most of those countries are in, I'd say, on the low end, 30%; on the high end, sometimes as high as 70%. And so we compete very well, and the profile of 1B is certainly much more of a competitive profile to the alternatives that are available outside the United States. And so I think it gives you an idea of our ability to be able to perform in those markets. So we would hope and I think expect that next generation will allow us to be able to gain share in those marketplaces. The $3 billion, you're probably going back to the first prediction, and I think we anticipate that we would get back into that range. But I'm going out of the business of predicting HCV at this point. I think what I would say is, despite the impact that we've seen in the U.S., from a share standpoint, I think it shows you how fundamentally strong the overall business is, because we've taken a fairly substantial hit in the U.S. on HCV. But yet, we continue to perform at a very high level and offset all of that impact and are now raising guidance on top of that. So the balance of our entire business and in particular, I'd say, HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA right now, gives us the ability to be able to do that. And so we're not dependent upon that single asset performing at a certain level. Mike?"

Rova-T, the objective response data for Rova-T has been very consistent, in our view, across the various reports over the last several months. And they've ranged from about 39% into the mid-40% range. And that really just relates to the cut of the data, whether one is using initial investigative reports or subsequent adjudicated assessments of objective response and doesn't bear on durability of those responses in any way. And the objective response and importantly, the clinical benefit rate have both remained very high. The one-year survival has also been very consistent in the 30-plus percent range across the data cuts, which gives us a very good feel for the durability of those responses. And in this heavily pretreated patient population, the best estimate, the most rigorous, but also the highest estimate, of 1-year survival is about 12%. And in many cases, it may actually be lower than that. And so that 30% number we view as very important. So we don't see anything concerning with respect to the durability of the responses with Rova-T. So with respect to the remainder of the Stemcentrx pipeline, there are actually 5 programs in the clinic now, 1 of those is Rova-T. Two are the Pfizer-partnered programs, PTK7 and EFNA4. And then there are 2 other programs in the clinic for solid tumor indicators, but we haven't disclosed those targets or the particular tumors of interest at this point in time. In addition to those 5, there are 5 additional assets that will enter the clinic over the next 12 to 18 months, so by the end of 2017. And the areas of initial interest, when one looks at the tumors that we’re treating today, will obviously be small cell. There's also a focus on ovarian cancer and triple-negative breast cancer, among others."

So if you look at REMICADE, there are REMICADE biosimilars now in roughly 60-plus countries, like 62 countries. About 50 of those -- a little more than 50 of those have pricing and reimbursement, so they're actively involved in marketing the product in those countries. If -- we've studied it very carefully. If you look at the overall share of biosimilars, it's less than 5%. It's about 4.5%. If you look at their share of REMICADE, it's about 20%, 22%, something like that. It varies a lot. So I'd say it's very high in tender-based countries like in Norway, Denmark, Poland, as an example, very high market share in those, if you go more into the traditional Western European markets, more like in the 20% to 25% share of the REMICADE market. And the discounting has played out to basically range in the tender countries fairly high. I'd say that's 50% to 70% kind of range, from a discounting standpoint; and the rest of the market, probably in that 30% to 40% kind of range. It hasn't had any impact on us at all. REMICADE, because it's an infusion product in most of those countries, doesn't compete in the same space that we compete in. So then you move over to Enbrel. So Enbrel's approved now, the Enbrel biosimilars are approved in about 32 countries. There's pricing and reimbursement in about 1/3 of those countries right now. We've seen much lower discounting than what we've expected, I'd say. It ranges from as little as low single-digit discounting to maybe up in the 30% to 35% range in non-tender countries and kind of the high 30s to high 50s in the tender countries. Again, it's playing out similar to the way we saw the REMICADE biosimilars. So in the tender countries, they're having higher share like the Norways and the Denmarks, Germany, Sweden, single-digit kind of figures. So really, no substantial market share impact. But it's too early in the process for us to see that. I'd say, the strategy that we anticipated and the one we put in place seems to be working well. But it's the early rounds, and you can see it in the performance of the business. You can see HUMIRA's continuing to grow in the international markets. And as you back out the Venezuela impact, you can see it's actually growing in the 6% or so range, 6.2% range. And so we are continuing to see good strong growth in those markets. And so I'd say, the early rounds are working like we had anticipated they would. And then -- but we need to give it some more time and see how it plays out. But it's a good opportunity for us to see how our strategy is working and be able to modify that strategy. So that's essentially the biosimilar impact that we see. Nothing different than what we had expected. Now let me move over to derm and the impact on 17s. I'd say, overall, we're very happy with our performance in the derm space. So if you look at the U.S, I'll talk specifically about the U.S, we've seen TRxs grow, in fact, accelerate over the course of time. I mean, if you go back to the early part of 2015 or even look at the average across 2015, we had -- got a low double-digit TRx growth in first and second quarter. That's accelerated to like 17% or 18% TRx growth in derm. And so we're seeing nice strong growth in that segment of the market. If you look at our revenue, a very similar kind of profile. We had strong double-digit growth, and now it's accelerated fairly dramatically, probably about 10 to 15 points above what it had been running at. If you look at market share, our overall market share is pretty stable to maybe slightly down, 1.5% or so. As we analyze it, it is really driven extensively by the Otezla experience, where we're seeing a lot more patients, particularly moderate and sometimes mild patients coming into the category. And so therefore, the category is growing faster. And so that dilutes our market share position. When we pull Otezla out and we look at our market share, our market share looks relatively stable. In particular, if you look at PsA, our overall share has been stable in the U.S. at about 32%. If you look at room [ph] PsA, it's actually increased about 3 points, which is the larger part of the PsA market, it's about 75% of the overall PsA market. And even the AS PsA has increased about 2 points. Psoriasis, as I've said, is down about 1.5 to 2 points in total, but it's more driven by Otezla. So overall, we feel very good about how the business is performing across all the indications, but certainly, in derm as well."

So I'll cover that, and maybe Mike can jump in on some specifics. When we went into -- when we made the decision that the core growth -- future growth franchise on top of immunology was going to be oncology, we made a decision that we would invest in a way to try to build leadership positions in certain areas where we thought we had core competencies that were complementary to being able to perform in those areas. So specifically, we started with hematological oncology based on the assets that we had internally as well as the opportunity that existed with Pharmacyclics. And our goal was to basically build a position where we thought we could drive to a leadership position within that category. So if you look at the assets we have today, including IMBRUVICA and where we think Venclexta will be able to expand to, it would tell us that we should have an opportunity to be able to bring forward innovative therapies in roughly 65% of the overall market in hematological malignancies. And I'd say that, that's an area where we feel comfortable with what we have. Now having said that, if we found unique opportunities, I think, particularly in the acute leukemia side assets or technologies or a drug that we thought was particularly attractive in an area where we didn't think we had a strong asset already, certainly, we would pursue that kind of an asset. But I'd say, from a platform standpoint, we feel very good about what we have in hematological malignancies, both internally as well as the addition of Pharmacyclics that we did a year or so ago. On the solid tumor side, as we've said before about Stemcentrx, one of the things that was attractive to us is we have a number of efforts internally to be able to identify new targets. And so we have an effort internally to be able to do that. We obviously have a collaboration with Calico. And part of the work that they're doing is to identify new oncology targets. But we wanted a more fundamental base platform for solid tumors. And one of the things that attracted us to Stemcentrx is we believe they have that. And we're excited about that opportunity. And Mike talked earlier about the number of candidates that will be moving on to that platform. And I think it's impressive what they've accomplished. And so that has built what we fundamentally believe will be the core platform for us in solid tumors, in addition to what we already have. We certainly continue to look for, again, now, more individual kinds of technology plays or assets that might be complementary to that, but we're not looking for another big platform. I don't know, Mike, did you want to add anything?"

So with respect to Elagolix, as you pointed out, Mark, we have substantial lead having completed our 2 pivotal Phase III studies and already being in the process of collecting longer-term data that are necessary to define benefit risk. And we think that is a real advantage for our program, and one that we're going to continue to drive as we drive forward, for example, with the add-back program to further enhance the understanding of how we can use Elagolix to treat endometriosis and uterine fibroids. With respect to some of the issues you brought up on competitive programs, we don't really view potency as a primary driver here. In fact, the most potent agent in this axis is Lupron, and the problem is, in fact, the degree to which that shuts down axis. We're trying to achieve a fine titration of dose, and we believe Elagolix has the properties to allow us to do that. With respect to co-formulation with add-back, there is nothing that would prevent us from co-formulating with add-back as well. And we believe, over time, there may be a number of strategies that can be used to protect bone, and so we'll have flexibility to employ many different strategies. So we feel very good about the position of Elagolix. We think it's an important treatment option. And we think that it's going to make a real impact on endometriosis.  With respect to relative advantages of a q-day formulation, I think that, again, depends on the dose one ultimately selects. And I think when we look at the overall profile of Elagolix, we remain convinced that it's very strong."

And we have the potential to pursue myeloma with a number of assets on our portfolio. Venclexta has clear potential there, and we're advancing that program rapidly, as we mentioned during our opening remarks. Imbruvica also has potential as to a number of the molecules in our pipeline. It is a competitive space. One can prolong survival to a much a bigger extent today than was possible a decade ago. But we still don't have curative therapies, patients ultimately fail therapy and progress, which means that we need new mechanisms that aren't cross-reactive that provide durable disease control. And we think we have a number of those in our pipeline. So we're aware of the competition certainly, but we think we have therapies that will further the standard of care in that disease. And we'll be driving clinical programs forward to demonstrate that. With respect to veliparib. So veliparib is a molecule that is an important part of our overall oncology efforts. It's in Phase III studies across a range of tumor indications. We have a bit of a different hypothesis around the way veliparib should be used than perhaps some of the others who are developing PARPs. We are not focused solely on the use in patients with germline BRCA mutations or other HRD-deficient tumors. We are exploring the hypothesis in our Phase III program. That part can augment DNA damage in chemotherapy. Essentially, that the first hit doesn't have to come from a genetic hit. It can come from a therapeutic hit that is DNA damaging, which would increase the importance of DNA repair mechanisms. That hypothesis is being tested in a range of Phase III programs in non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer and in ovarian cancer. And those studies will start to read out in 2017. We'll have a number of important data readouts, which will tell us the role that PARP can play there. So we haven't focused on it as much in recent Investor Days, and that's largely because it is in a quiet period where the studies are up and running. We're generating the results. But you'll hear a lot more about PARP in 2017."

Indication-based pricing, I think, first evolved primarily in the oncology space. And it was driven, I think, by certain efforts to say, you have an oncology agent that has very strong efficacy in a certain disease and might have significantly lower efficacy in another disease, and why would I pay the same for this strong efficacy as I would for relatively modest efficacy? I think that was how the concept originally evolved. As we look at HUMIRA and we look across all of the major indications at least, with every single indication, there's obviously some variation between the competitive profiles. But I'd say, in general, HUMIRA tends to perform across those broad set of indications in the top tier. And so that is how we view it. So indication-based pricing wouldn't be something that we think is very applicable for this specific asset in this particular class. And we haven't seen it take off much prior to this, and we'll have to see how it plays out over time. Again, on the time -- there are a lot -- it may sound to you like it's a fairly innocent issue around timing and the steps and what should play out. But I would tell you, it's not that, from a litigation standpoint. So I'm just going to need to take the same position I did before. We're not in the position to be able to give you a lot more color. Certainly, we've made it clear what our position is going to be, and I think that will become clearer as the steps play out. But I can't give you a whole lot of color on the timing or what the alternatives would be."

And I think that will give you some good sense of the overall dynamics of the brand. And then I'll back up and talk a little bit about the business in general. Obviously, the brand's performing very, very well in the U.S. We grew to 26.7% in the Q. Script trends, the way we see them, we're in the mid-teens for the quarter. Our price was up. It was actually up in the single digits. And then as we -- as I said in my comments, we did see a modest impact from differences in customer order patterns. Again, we run this business at less than half a month inventory, but it gets a little tough to call at various times. And we did see a little bit of demand differences between the Q. We had a little bit lower inventories in the second quarter of '15 relative to '16. So yes, I think the way you got to think about this is mid-teens growth from script and single-digit price. And when you add those up, yes, you can pretty much get to the 20% number that we've guided to. From an overall price standpoint, look, I would say, if you back up and look at our growth on the quarter of 18%, the majority was volume. Across the total book of business, we had a price impact of less than 4%. So the strategy that we've actually employed for the business and certainly, with our new products launching is this is going to be a product -- a company that's fueled by volume and not price. Obviously, price, we do have an opportunity in certain markets to take it. But I would not say this is a company that is heavily dependent on price. And then as we look out over the LRP, we tend to scale down our price expectations in the U.S, because we think that's the prudent way to model."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'll discuss our third quarter performance, recent operational highlights, and I'll also share some high-level perspective regarding our growth profile for 2017. Mik",1419,"Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'll discuss our third quarter performance, recent operational highlights, and I'll also share some high-level perspective regarding our growth profile for 2017. Mike will then provide updates on our recent advancements across our R&D programs, and Bill will provide additional color on the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of this year. 
2016 is shaping up to be another very strong year, with operational revenue growth year-to-date of nearly 16% and EPS growth through 3 quarters up 14.6%. This follows a very strong 2015, where we delivered operational revenue growth of 22% and EPS growth of 29%. Based on our confidence and in [ph] the performance of the business going forward, today, we'll provide a view of 2017, which will once again demonstrate strong underlying performance.
Our third quarter results were ahead of our expectations, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.21, representing growth of 7.1% versus the third quarter of 2015. Our results included global operational sales growth of 8%, reflecting continued strong performance from our on-market business, led by HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, as well as other products in our portfolio. 
HUMIRA continues to drive robust performance, delivering global operational growth of more than 12% in the quarter. Despite increasing competition from new classes of drugs and indirect biosimilar competition in international markets, HUMIRA continues to demonstrate exceptional performance and durability across the 3 major market segments.
In rheumatology, HUMIRA continues to hold the #1 market share position with year-over-year share gains. In dermatology, we're seeing mid-teens volume growth, and we're maintaining a very strong #1 market share position with a 15-point lead over the #2 competitor. And in GI, we continue to see strong double-digit volume growth. 
Internationally, HUMIRA continues to maintain its strong position despite indirect biosimilar competition, which is tracking in line with our expectations.
We also continue to deliver on our oncology strategy. IMBRUVICA's performance in the quarter was outstanding, with third quarter global revenues to AbbVie of just over $500 million. We're continuing to drive strong uptake in CLL. In the second-line-plus CLL market, we continue to hold the leadership position, with more than 4 of 10 patients starting treatment with IMBRUVICA. And in the front-line [ph] setting, our market share position is steadily increasing, with nearly 1 of 5 patients now starting IMBRUVICA as first-line therapy. 
While we're pleased with this performance, we're still in the very early stages of our trajectory in the front-line setting. We're making progress in a number of important comparatives in [ph] combination studies, evaluating IMBRUVICA monotherapy and [ph] combination therapy versus regimens such as BR and FCR, often considered the gold standards in the treatment of CLL.
These studies are being run in different patient segments, including young and fit patients and the watch-and-wait population. And the results will add significantly to the breadth of data supporting IMBRUVICA and will provide physicians with more evidence of the compelling clinical benefit in the front-line setting. 
Additionally, in other approved indications, including mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenström's, IMBRUVICA holds the market-leading position in the relapsed/refractory segments. In geographies outside the U.S., IMBRUVICA continues to experience strong adoption in Europe and Canada and has recently been launched in several new markets, including Japan.
While CLL clearly represents the largest revenue contributor to IMBRUVICA's growth over our long-range plan, new indications will also augment our performance. To that end, there is potential for several IMBRUVICA regulatory submissions and approvals over the next few years, including relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma, which is under regulatory review; chronic graft-versus-host disease, which we expect to submit for approval in the first half of 2017; front-line mantle cell lymphoma, which will [ph] add to our existing indication in relapsed/refractory MCL; as well as relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and front-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. For several of these indications, IMBRUVICA will be the only approved treatment, underscoring the importance of this therapy for patients.
Collectively, these new IMBRUVICA indications represent a significant incremental revenue opportunity for AbbVie. Mike will provide an update regarding some upcoming data flow for several of these potential new indications. 
Earlier this year, we received approval for Venclexta monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, who harbor the 17p deletion, a relatively small subset of the refractory patient population. In partnership with Roche/Genentech, we're continuing to make good progress with our launch within this indication, with Venclexta now added to the NCCN Guidelines and continued progress with formulary access. Physicians are gaining experience with the therapy, and we look forward to additional data next year in the broader relapsed/refractory setting. We also saw strong performance from several other products in our on-market portfolio, including Duodopa, Creon and international VIEKIRA.
In addition to our strong financial results, we have continued to advance our late-stage pipeline. Last week, at the ASRM meeting, we presented positive data on Elagolix in and [ph] endometriosis, including additional results from our 2 pivotal studies. Results from these trials will support our U.S. regulatory application, which is on track for submission in 2017. 
We're nearing the completion of our registrational program for our next-generation HCV combination, which is on track for commercialization next year. Based on the data we've shared to date, we believe our next-generation HCV therapy will address the remaining unmet medical needs within this market, with high SVR rates across genotypes with 8 weeks of therapy.
We're making good progress with the risankizumab program, which is in development with partnership with BI. We recently completed ahead of schedule patient enrollment for the pivotal studies in psoriasis, with data from 3 of these trials expected in 2017. We recently launched Zinbryta for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and are in the early stages of our rollout in collaboration with Biogen. And we've also continued to advance assets from the Stemcentrx pipeline. We recently started a basket study evaluating Rova-T in several neuroendocrine tumors where DLL3 is expressed. And we also initiated a regimen selection study for Rova-T in front-line small [ph] cell lung cancer.
Based on our performance year-to-date, we're raising our full year 2016 guidance to $4.80 to $4.82 on an adjusted basis, reflecting growth of 12.1% at the midpoint. 
Over the past several months, we received a lot of interest regarding our expectations for 2017. While we're in the midst of our annual planning process, based on the continued strength of the business and especially HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, we're now at a point where we can provide some high-level direction regarding our top and bottom line growth expectations for 2017.  We expect low double-digit operational growth in 2017. 2017 will be another important year of investment in R&D as we expand our leadership position in immunology and hematological oncology and also build our position in solid tumors. 
As a result, we expect EPS growth of roughly 13% to 15% from the midpoint of our new 2016 guidance range. This level of performance positions AbbVie to be among the industry leaders for both revenue and EPS growth once again next year. We'll outline our detailed 2017 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January.
Since our inception in 2013, we've delivered strong financial results, and we're well positioned to deliver industry-leading growth again in 2017 for the third consecutive year. We continue to be proud of our strong execution, and we remain committed to our long-term strategic and financial objectives, which we outlined for you in October of 2015.
AbbVie represents a unique investment opportunity, offering both compelling growth along with a strong return of capital to investors, including a rapidly growing dividend. To that end, today, we announced our Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly cash dividend of $0.57 per share to $0.64 per share, an increase of over 12%, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2017.  We view the dividend as an important aspect of our investment identity and as a sign of our confidence in the business going forward. Since the company's inception in 2013, AbbVie has increased its dividend by more than 60%. 
In summary, the strategy we've put in place puts us in a position to deliver strong top and bottom line performance. We've established growth platforms in some of the largest and most attractive segments, and we've built a compelling pipeline in these areas, which will contribute significantly to our performance in the years to come. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?"

Once again, we had a very productive quarter on R&D, with significant progress across a number of programs. Today, I'll highlight key pipeline events that occurred during the quarter as well as some of our upcoming milestones. 
I'll start with oncology, an area where we are advancing our pipeline in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. 
Turning our attention to solid tumors. We continue to make good progress with Rova-T. We recently began enrolling patients in 2 new studies, a Phase I 8-arm basket study in [ph] a broad set of neuroendocrine tumors and a Phase I/II regimen selection study in front-line small cell lung cancer. We expect to start seeing data from both studies in the second half of next year.  The Rova-T program in relapsed/refractory small cell lung cancer is progressing well. We continue to see good results from the ongoing Phase I study, with patients still alive more than 2 years after receiving just 2 doses of Rova-T. 
Enrollment in the TRINITY study, our confirmatory third-line registrational trial in small cell lung cancer, is also going very well. And we expect this study to be fully enrolled within the next month. Data from TRINITY will be available next year, which will trigger the submission of our regulatory dossiers. 
We are also on the cusp of starting 2 additional Rova-T studies: Mero, [ph] the Phase III registrational trial evaluating standard chemotherapy followed by Rova-T in the front-line setting; and the Phase I/II combination study, evaluating Rova-T with Opdivo and with Opdivo and Yervoy in small cell lung cancer. We expect both trials to be up and running by the end of the year.
We're also making good progress with other assets from the Stemcentrx pipeline. In addition to Rova-T, we have 4 assets in the clinic and are on track to transition up to 5 additional programs into the clinic over the next year. This will add to our growing oncology pipeline of more than 35 late preclinical or clinical stage assets.
I'll now turn to our hem/onc programs. In the quarter, we announced our U.S. regulatory submission of a supplemental new drug application for the use of IMBRUVICA in previously treated patients with marginal zone lymphoma, a slow-growing form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which accounts for roughly 12% of NHL cases. There are currently no approved treatments specifically indicated for patients with marginal zone lymphoma, and we expect a regulatory decision in the first half of 2017.  The data that supported this regulatory submission will also be presented at the upcoming ASH meeting in December. 
Additionally, at ASH, we'll present data from the registration-enabling trial in chronic graft-versus-host disease as well as data from several other IMBRUVICA studies across multiple blood cancers, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. 
We've also made significant progress with the development of Venclexta, which was approved earlier this year in the U.S. under priority review for its first indication as monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL with a 17p deletion mutation, a small but medically important segment of the CLL market and an important first step for this exciting new therapy.
Earlier this month, we received Canadian approval for Venclexta in previously treated CLL patients with a 17p deletion mutation as well as in patients with no other treatment options regardless of their mutational status. 
We also received a positive opinion from the European CHMP for the treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL patients with 17p deletion or TP53 mutations. The CHMP also recommended approval of Venclexta for patients who have failed both chemo-immunotherapy and a B-cell inhibitor regardless of mutational status.
Venclexta has demonstrated strong efficacy, driving deep levels of response and durable disease control, both as monotherapy and in combination with RITUXAN in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Earlier this year, Venclexta received the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation for use in combination with rituximab for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We're expecting data from the MURANO study in the first half of next year, which will support a broader label in relapsed/refractory CLL. 
The breakthrough designation and the upcoming MURANO data are important milestones for Venclexta that will expand use to the broader relapsed/refractory CLL population. We remain excited about the long-term potential for this molecule and believe that Venclexta will be effective across a range of blood cancers.
We're particularly encouraged by the opportunity in AML as the data generated to date have demonstrated clear signs of efficacy. Earlier this year, Venclexta received its third breakthrough therapy designation for use in combination with hypomethylating agents for the treatment of patients with AML who are ineligible to receive standard induction with high-dose chemotherapy. We're moving quickly with Venclexta's development in AML and expect to begin our Phase III programs by the end of the year.
At the upcoming ASH meeting, we'll also percent Venclexta data in a range of tumor types, including Phase I safety and efficacy data in both AML and multiple myeloma as well as results from the mid-stage which I'll and cabal he studies [ph] in follicular lymphoma and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively.
As we look ahead to 2017, there will be several additional key data readouts from our hematologic oncology portfolio that could enable registration of both IMBRUVICA and Venclexta in new indications. 
For IMBRUVICA, there are a number of planned interim analysis that could potentially lead to regulatory filings, including data in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, front-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and in front-line mantle cell lymphoma. And for Venclexta, as I mentioned, we'll see data from the MURANO study, which will support a broader Venclexta label in CLL.
Now I'll move on to our immunology programs, where we continue to make great progress with our 2 late-stage immunology assets, risankizumab and ABT-494. As Rick mentioned, we have fully enrolled the Phase III psoriasis program for risankizumab and will begin to see data from these pivotal studies toward the end of next year. Interest in the psoriasis program has been very strong, as evidenced by the fact that we fully enrolled the 4 Phase III studies in just 7.5 months, well ahead of our planning assumptions. 
The registration trials in Crohn's disease are expected to begin next year. And we also intend to move risankizumab into late-stage studies in both ulcerative colitis and psoriatic arthritis by the end of 2017. The registration-enabling studies for ABT-494 in RA are also progressing very well, and we remain on track for data readouts from these Phase 3 studies during the first half of 2018.
The development program for ABT-494 in gastrointestinal disorders is also progressing well, with the Phase II study in Crohn's disease ongoing and a Phase II study in ulcerative colitis getting underway in the third quarter. Data from the Crohn's study should be available in the first half of 2017, with Phase III Crohn's study starting later in the year. 
We also recently began a Phase II study to evaluate our oral selective JAK1 inhibitor in atopic dermatitis. 
I'll now move to virology, where we're nearing the completion of our registrational program for our next-generation HCV regimen. This program was designed to investigate a faster path secure [ph] for all genotypes of HCV and to address treatment areas of continued unmet need.
Based on the data we've presented today, our once-daily pan-genotypic regimen is highly effective and has the potential to cure a majority of HCV patients in just 8 weeks. The FDA recently granted breakthrough therapy designation for our next-generation regimen for the treatment of patients with chronic HCV who have failed previous therapy with directly acting antivirals in genotype 1. This designation is an important step in our efforts to bring our pan-genotypic regimen to market.
At the AASLD meeting in November, we'll be presenting pivotal data from our next-generation regimen, including results from 8-week cohorts in [ph] non-cirrhotics  as well as data in patients who have failed prior DAA-containing regimens.
We expect to submit the NDA for our next-generation HCV regimen to the FDA by the end of this year and file the marketing authorization application with the EMA in the first quarter next year. And we remain on track for commercialization in the U.S. in 2017. We believe that AbbVie's pan-genotypic once-daily ribavirin-free HCV therapy will be competitively positioned and will be able to address the remaining unmet medical need within this market.
Finally, in the area of women's health, we are nearing completion of our Phase III endometriosis program, with regulatory submission planned for 2017. The Elagolix clinical development program includes the largest clinical trials conducted to date [ph] in endometriosis, with nearly 1,700 patients in 2 [ph] pivotal trials. 
At the ASRM Congress earlier this month, we presented detailed results from 2 pivotal studies, demonstrating that Elagolix reduced menstrual and non-menstrual pelvic pain associated with endometriosis compared to placebo. We also presented research on the economic and health care costs associated with endometriosis and endometriosis-related surgery in women in the United States. These data support AbbVie's continued efforts to pursue a regulatory filing of Elagolix as a potential new treatment option for the most prevalent symptoms of the disease.
In addition to the endometriosis program, we have Phase III studies underway in uterine fibroids. This program is investigating the effect of Elagolix on heavy bleeding related to this highly prevalent condition. We anticipate beginning to see data from this Phase 3 program late next year. 
So in summary, we are very pleased with the progress of our pipeline and are on track for further advancements in the remainder of 2016 and into 2017. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our third quarter performance. Bill?"

This morning, I'll review our third quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2016.

This morning, I'll review our third quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2016. 
In the quarter, we delivered strong operational sales growth of 8%, excluding a little more than 0.5% of unfavorable impact from foreign currency. We exceeded our adjusted earnings per share guidance, delivering growth of more than 7% compared to the third quarter of 2015. HUMIRA delivered another quarter of strong sales growth, with global sales of more than $4 billion, up 12.1% operationally. Globally, we continue to see strong volume growth across all therapeutic segments.
In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased 16.7% compared to the prior year. The growth rate in the quarter was negatively impacted by 4 points due to higher customer ordering patterns in the prior year, a reversal of what we experienced with second quarter growth rates. Normalized for this, HUMIRA performance in the quarter exceeded 20%, comprised of low-teen prescription growth and single-digit price.  Wholesaler inventory levels remained below half a month across all periods. 
On a year-to-date basis, HUMIRA U.S. sales growth exceeds 24%. For the fourth quarter, we forecast sales growth in excess of 20%, which will contribute to our full year forecast of above 20%.
International HUMIRA sales were more than $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4.5% on an operational basis. Biosimilar REMICADE has not had a material impact on our performance, and the Enbrel biosimilar continues to perform in line with our previously communicated assumptions. We continue to forecast HUMIRA international operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year. HUMIRA's unique product profile and AbbVie's strong commercial execution has made HUMIRA the #1 prescribed biologic, and we continue to see strong momentum for HUMIRA as market leader around the world.
Global IMBRUVICA net revenues in the third quarter were $501 million, up nearly 65% over prior year, driven by increased penetration in relapsed/refractory CLL and other indications as well as continued uptake in first-line CLL where we launched earlier this year. 
Global VIEKIRA sales in the third quarter were $378 million, down versus the prior year. Our international business delivered operational sales growth of nearly 31% in the quarter, driven by new launches and continued uptake. In the U.S., as we communicated earlier this year, we have seen market share loss and some price erosion due to the entrance of a new competitor in the market.
Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 21.4% on an operational basis in the quarter, reflecting robust international growth and a modest level of U.S. sales.  We also saw strong operational sales growth in the quarter from Creon, which was up 16.6%.
We are in the early stages of our commercial launches of Venclexta and Zinbryta, which had modest sales impact in the third quarter. We have begun our commercial rollout of Venclexta, with our first priority being to ensure adequate physician training and to give physicians an opportunity to gain experience with a dosing ramp. 
As we've outlined, our initial indication for Venclexta, relapsed/refractory CLL patients with a 17p deletion, represents a fairly small market segment estimated to be roughly $300 million.  IMBRUVICA currently holds a strong market leadership position in this segment with well over 50% share. However, Venclexta is an asset that offers significant growth potential over the longer term. In the next several years, we expect to augment our label to address the broader relapsed/refractory CLL patient population, expanded [ph] earlier lines of therapy and broadened into other hematologic malignancies. 
The next major milestone for Venclexta will be the submission of data from the MURANO trial to regulatory authorities, which will expand the addressable patient population for Venclexta to all relapsed/refractory CLL patients, a much larger patient population.  This will add meaningfully to Venclexta's growth beginning in 2018. 
Additionally, we expect further augmentation of the Venclexta label beginning in 2019, with a potential for first-line data and expansion into additional blood cancers.
In August, we launched Zinbryta in the U.S. The Zinbryta label requires the establishment of an appropriate REMS program. And we are on track with the required physician certification and training. While we're very early in the launch, we're encouraged by the level of physician and patient interest. For example, in the U.S., more than 80% of our high-priority physicians have been certified through the REMS program, enabling them to begin prescribing. Based on the approved labeling, we expect Zinbryta to be used as a third-line agent, offering a unique mechanism of action, compelling efficacy and convenient dosing.
Turning to the P&L profile for the quarter. The adjusted gross margin was 80.7% of sales. On a comparative year-over-year basis, this ratio reflects an adverse impact from foreign exchange of roughly 320 basis points. In addition, the adjusted gross margin reflects 110 basis points of unfavorable impact related to the Pharmacyclics acquisition, including the profit transfer [ph] for IMBRUVICA, which is booked as cost of goods sold. Adjusting for these impacts, the gross margin profile improved by approximately 170 basis points versus the prior year.
Adjusted R&D was 16.5% of sales, supporting pipeline opportunities in oncology, immunology, HCV and other areas. 
Adjusted SG&A was 21.4% of sales in the third quarter, down 160 basis points from the prior year as we drive operational efficiencies while maintaining our investments in our growth brands.
Adjusted operating margin was 42.8% of sales, down 210 basis points relative to the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the negative impact of exchange, the operating margin profile improved 120 basis points versus the prior year. We remain committed to achieving an adjusted operating margin target of greater than 50% of sales by 2020. 
Net interest expense was $250 million in the quarter, and the adjusted tax rate was 19.9% in the quarter.
Third quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding noncash intangible amortization expense and other specified items, was $1.21, up 7.1% year-over-year. 
Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our strong business performance year-to-date and our confidence in our momentum going forward, we are raising our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range to $4.80 to $4.82, reflecting adjusted EPS growth of 12.1% at the midpoint.  We are also updating our 2016 GAAP EPS guidance range to $3.74 to $3.76, which includes $1.06 per share of noncash intangible amortization expense and other specified items. 
Regarding the fourth quarter. We expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 to $1.20. This excludes roughly $0.22 of noncash amortization and other specified items. We expect high single-digit operational sales growth with minimal foreign exchange impacts in the quarter.
In closing, we delivered strong performance in the quarter. We've driven strong top and bottom line growth while also advancing our strategic priorities and our pipeline. And as Rick outlined, we're well positioned for strong growth again in 2017 as we expect to deliver low double-digit operational revenue growth and EPS growth of 13% to 15% from the midpoint of our new 2016 guidance range. This level of performance should place us among the industry leaders for both revenue and EPS growth once again next year. And underscoring our confidence in the business going forward, today, we announced a 12.3% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable on February 2017. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz."

Maybe you can talk about what you're seeing from your perspective. Obviously, there is some industry concern in the marketplace about structural change to pricing. We saw McKesson announce -- highlight significant moderation in price increases next year, which caused them to lower their guidance. Novo significantly lowered their expectations. Amgen talked about TNF pricing basically going away. From your vantage point, what are you seeing? And maybe you can share with us changes that we should anticipate in our models with respect to net pricing for HUMIRA in the U.S. going forward. Secondly, we appreciate the early commentary and color on 2017 guidance, 13% to 15% earnings growth. However, that is a little bit below consensus. Maybe if you could just step back, you gave us 2020 guidance a couple of years ago. Maybe you could just step back and help us think about the cadence of earnings growth. AbbVie is a different company from the industry average just given the looming competition to HUMIRA. Maybe if you could just help us think about the growth of this company over the next 5 years, how you're thinking about it, how -- what you see relative to the plan that you put out a couple of years ago."

I [ph] think as you look at price, certainly, the rhetoric on price has been more intense than we've seen it in a number of years. And some of that is driven by the political environment, and some",834,"Sure, Jami. So this is Rick. Thank you for the questions. I [ph] think as you look at price, certainly, the rhetoric on price has been more intense than we've seen it in a number of years. And some of that is driven by the political environment, and some of it's driven by more fundamentals. I think if you look at our business specifically, our business is primarily a volume-driven business. That's not to say we don't benefit at all from price, but clearly, the vast majority of our growth comes from volume. And the key, I think, for our entire industry is to continue to drive innovation. And [ph] innovative products in general and innovative pharmaceuticals, I think, in general tend to save the health care system money over time. And I don't know that we've done everything we should do to be able to make sure that we get -- one, get that message out; and two, maybe support that message a little bit better than we have in the past. And so I think that's the key for the industry going forward, and that's the thing that we need to focus our attention on. And if you look at the products that we've been successful with, I think they have a good economic value proposition. HUMIRA is a good example of that as well. And so -- but I'd say, as we look at our planning process, just as we have in previous years, we tend to plan conservatively when it comes to price and then evaluate the market environment at the time that we ultimately get close to that period of time and make a decision around what is the appropriate pricing strategy. And our guidance in 2017 and our long-range plan are both reflective of that philosophy. That philosophy hasn't changed. I think if you look at the 2017 EPS forecast that we gave you, I'd say there's 2 things that -- in the consensus that are important to look at. One is if you looked at consensus, I don't believe everyone has rolled into their model the full year R&D expectation for the BI and the Stemcentrx acquisition. And so obviously, that was not reflected in the overall consensus numbers. The second thing is, if you look at gross margin, the consensus numbers, [ph] gross margin profile is off. And we've communicated that a couple of times. And where it's off is trying to calculate what the partner products [ph] contribution will be. And I think if you look at those 2 factors, if you look at the top line, what we're communicating is very close to what the top line is. If you look at our overall operating expenses, certainly, SG&A, R&D is a little bit higher, SG&A probably a bit lower but, net-net, probably a little bit higher. But the difference that you would see would be in the gross margin profile. The other thing I'd say is if you look at that level of performance, based on everything that we see, it will rank us certainly in the top tier, if not #1. Obviously, we have to see what others report but based on consensus that's out there today, so we're delivering another year of truly outstanding performance. As far as what we communicated to you from the long-range plan back in October, as I said in my formal comments, this is consistent with what we communicated. I'd say we're still on track to be able to deliver what we expected. And in fact, if anything, I'd say HUMIRA is probably ahead. I think there was a lot of surprise when we first communicated the $18 billion for HUMIRA. There's obviously less surprise now to that number based on our overall performance. And so I think we're tracking on what we had communicated. We're absolutely committed to delivering a 50% operating margin by 2020, and that's despite the negative impact that we will see from the partner of products. [ph] And we're committed to being [ph] able to drive that average compounded growth rate of EPS that we communicated as well as our top line. And we continue to have a lot of confidence in the business going forward. As we look at the pipeline rolling out, the assets in our late-stage pipeline, I think, are continuing to advance in a way that is consistent with what we thought back then. And those assets are starting to roll out now as Venclexta, as an example, going to [ph] take broader label. That's going to be a very meaningful contributor to our overall performance. And a number of other programs are continuing to advance. Risankizumab is an example, I think, is ahead of schedule by a significant amount of time. 494 continues to advance very well. And so generally, what I'd say is we're very confident with what our outlook looks like and it's consistent with what we communicated to you back in October of 2015."

So I'm not going to necessarily give you the absolute color on what our assumption is in 2017 as it relates to price. But I'd say we don't have a consistent view of the TNF market to the one that was described by Amgen. And I think every product obviously has a different perspective in the marketplace. Maybe it's worthwhile to walk through HUMIRA in a little bit of detail because I know there's always a lot of interest in it. And that will give you, I think, a perspective of where we stand overall. I mean, if you step back and look at where HUMIRA is, take the international market first, HUMIRA continues to perform, as we described despite the fact that we've seen the launch of Enbrel biosimilars in that market now for about 7 or 8 months, I would guess, maybe 9 months, something like that. They've actually been in the marketplace. They've had a very modest impact. We're delivering mid-single-digit growth us we've described to you. In fact, this quarter was about 4.5%. And now the interesting thing is if you adjust the impact of Venezuela, which would be a one-time impact in 2016, the underlying growth of our international business for HUMIRA is 7.6%. So good, strong growth. It's primarily volume growth because you typically had negative price in those international markets. So I'd say HUMIRA is performing exactly where we would have expected it to perform in the international markets. If you look at the U.S. I mean, U.S. has had just truly outstanding growth. If you look at the past 6 quarters on average, HUMIRA has averaged about 25% growth. The last 2 quarters, second and third quarter, if you average the 2 of them together, the growth was 21.7%. If you make the adjustment for the ordering patterns that Bill described, third quarter was just over 20% growth. And as Bill indicated, we're forecasting 20% growth again in the fourth quarter. The October week lease are consistent with that. We obviously pay a lot of attention to HUMIRA. And so this brand continues to grow extremely well. And the vast majority of that growth is volume. If you look at market share, in the U.S, we continue to perform well. Probably the best way to look at market share would be if you track it at the beginning of 2016 and look at it through the earliest data points that we have, which would be September data points, the overall market share for HUMIRA is about 31.8%. It's up 6/10 of a percent over that period of time from January through September. Rheumatology, our share is 26.8%. It's increased a full point over that period of time. Gastro and Durham, our market share remains basically flat at 43% and 35% market share. And so this brand continues to perform extremely well in the marketplace, and it's because of the attributes of this product and how well accepted it is by physicians and by patients. We're continuing to see good market growth. There's an anomaly in the IMS data because a large managed care organization has blinded their data, but it's still in the base. But what I would tell you is that if you look at script growth on HUMIRA, it's above 13% and you make the appropriate adjustments. And the market is growing high single-digits, around 9% or so. So prescription growth continues to be extremely robust. And then if you look at our formulary position, we just finished our 2017, 2018 negotiations. We're pleased with how those negotiations sorted themselves out. We basically had the same level of strong market access for HUMIRA that we had in 2016. Net price, which we don't talk about a lot. But what I can tell you is there was only a very minimal almost no change in net price for doing the 2016 contracts and the 2017 and '18 contracts. And all other attributes of the contract, like price protection, are consistent, basically consistent with what we have previously. And so we feel good about our access in the marketplace. So I think you're going to expect that HUMIRA is going to continue to perform well. I mean, every brand has its own set of issues it has to do with. And I'm certainly not in a position to be able to talk about their brand. But what I am in a position to talk about is how HUMIRA's performed and how we expect them to continue to perform going forward. Price is something that, as I said, we look at it very carefully every single year, and we make a determination as to what we think is appropriate, and we'll do the exact same thing this year. We typically build in a conservative level of price into our planning assumptions because we don't want to be exposed in any way. And in the information that we provided to you thus far, it includes that level of conservative assumptions built into it. As it relates to the comments on the litigation, that's not something I can talk about in a lot of detail. I would have interpreted their comments to be the same as the way you interpret them. I don't think that's a big surprise. At the end of the day, when you look at the magnitude of our IP portfolio and you look at the risk of launching at risk against that portfolio, that would be a high risk proposition for anyone. And we made our intentions very clear about we plan to enforce our IP against anyone who attempts to enter the marketplace. And that if someone chose to make a decision to launch at risk, we would seek a PI. And I think the power of our IP, I think, is very clear in the marketplace. So hopefully, that was responsive to your question."

Now that doesn't mean you can't open something up. But at the end of the day, we had completed all of our negotiations at this point for the 2017 and '18 contract periods. My comment on net price was essentially, as you go in and negotiate for your next contract, typically, there is pressure to take your rebates up, right? So that's -- if you put any price increase in the fall through of price increase aside, it's what we do increase your rebates by over that period of time? That's what my comment was designed to address. That there was minimal to no change from that perspective and your price will flow through based on the normal dynamics of how that would occur. And as I said, it was consistent with what we had in place from any levels of price protection in 2016. So it's basically business as usual for us going forward in '17 and '18. As far as indication-based pricing, I mean, I think that's a phenomena that hit -- that originally started in the area of oncology, where you could have an oncolytic agent that had very different activity or efficacy in one type of cancer versus another. And the value proposition is the same. If you look at HUMIRA, typically across the areas that we compete, HUMIRA is typically the gold standard in most of the areas that we compete in. I'd say, generally speaking, we have seen some interest in indication-based pricing and potentially doing that. That's got something, as I said, I think fits well for HUMIRA because of its broad applicability and its level of performance across the range of indications that it has, but it's certainly something that has been of interest. I don't see that as a fundamental issue in the contracting that we've seen go forward for '17 and '18, at least for HUMIRA."

But broadly, when you look at our assumptions that we had around biosimilars and the underlying growth of the markets, things have been progressing very, very well. So if you look at major markets across Europe, we've got market growing in the low teens. No changes there. And if you look at HUMIRA share, very, very minimal change year-over-year. Remicade has not -- biosimilar REMICADE has not major impact on the been any way whatsoever. And Enbrel as we told you at the beginning of the year, we anticipated a 2 to 3 percentage growth impact, but that was more or less based on the pricing that we expect the biosimilar to come in at. So biosimilars have been performing very much in line with our expectations but with a new entrance and market like it something were watching very closely. But the royalties those you entrance tend to get slotted as for patients that are ultimately anti-TNF failures. And so while they are ultimately gaining some traction in the market, they're picking up market share, I don't think you should read that through as a direct erosion to the market share of HUMIRA. Again, in fact, we've got a very, very strong market share position across those markets."

When you say the brand is slowing, I'm not sure whether you're referencing what Bill said in his comments about the prior year inventory levels or you're just looking at, as in the U.S., as I said in my comments a moment ago, we've averaged over 6 quarters about 25%, the last 2 quarters, we're in the 21% range. There's obviously fluctuations from quarter to quarter. But if you look at the dollar contribution across those quarters of growth, it's fairly consistent. And there's always ins and outs. But at the end of the day, as the brand gets bigger, the percent growth is going to go down and the brand has obviously grown significantly across that period of time. If you look at the IL 17s or some of the other brands, as I mentioned, in the market share, our market share in Durham is roughly flat. Clearly, we have leadership position in that segment. And I think as we look at the dynamics within that market, just to reinforcement what Bill said, it's typically the #2 that's getting the bulk of any erosion in their market share with the entrance of a new mechanism like a 17, as an example, because it is usually the second line failure that they tend to get their market share from. And so HUMIRA has not had as much of a negative impact based on that because we're typically the first [indiscernible] that is used in those indications. On the PBM's, obviously, we've got to have good relationships with all of our customers, whether there be managed care organizations or PBMs, they are professional relationships. I think PBMs serve a very important purpose. They obviously allow plans to be able to have formularies that they can help manage, and that's the world that they play and we play an important role with them and being able to supply them with products. They can go on those formularies. And so I think it's a typical business relationship. And on IMBRUVICA, we commented specifically about the rates. They're obviously relatively low rates.

We still anticipate that HUMIRA will be the workhorse product that will handle the vast majority of the volume, particularly in the beginning, and these products will fit into different segments going forward in a complementary way. And I think that gives us an advantage, not a disadvantage, in the marketplace. Mike?"

When we look at in the case of the 2 molecules you mentioned, the Phase IIb data to make a decision on either advancement or in licensing, we kept that profile in mind. And I think each of those assets dense up very well to that understanding of what we will need to be competitive. With the jack, for example, that's why we focus on differentiated efficacies, strong efficacy in very difficult-to-treat patient populations and very, very strong data at the higher levels response and points like remission, low disease activity, durable, ACR70s and the like. And for bucket, it was really the same thought process. Lucrative those data and we believe that base in a very substantial set, of clinical trial results that the efficacy there was truly differentiated and we can point, for example, to the approximately 50% posse 100 response for risankizumab in Phase IIb with very favorable pharmaceutical properties of that patient dosing the deep opportunities attainable. In Phase III and registration. So we're keeping that profile in mind and we're advancing assets that we believe will be competitive in the future."

But I think in first-line, it's consistent with that and it has been increasing slightly in the relapsed refractory area. But it's certainly at a very respectable level and certainly, isn't anything that we're concerned about at all. I mean, it's early in a level that we would expect it to be going forward. And so I think the adoption of IMBRUVICA in that first line, I think it's the speed of adoption in that first-line is an indication of the power of the data that we've seen in RESONATE-2 and physician's receptivity to that data, both from a PFS and overall survival standpoint.

The net price actually has to do with without any future price increases, which, by the way, that isn't how we're modeling the year. What we would expect price would be on a constant basis without price increases. The contracts allow us to take net price. And any net price increases, any price increase that we took would have a positive impact on our bottom line. That's the way you need to think about it. That said, in 2017, we are planning conservatively, as we always do. We're approaching the 2017 guidance with the exact same philosophy on how we plan for price increases that we have in the past. So hopefully, that helps up. And then from a P&L management standpoint. Look, the SG&A ratio, we're very pleased with. It's really a couple of different things.

This morning, I'll discuss our third quarter performance, recent operational highlights, and I'll also share some high-level perspective regarding our growth profile for 2017. Mike will then provide updates on our recent advancements across our R&D programs, and Bill will provide additional color on the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of this year. 
2016 is shaping up to be another very strong year, with operational revenue growth year-to-date of nearly 16% and EPS growth through 3 quarters up 14.6%. This follows a very strong 2015, where we delivered operational revenue growth of 22% and EPS growth of 29%. Based on our confidence in the performance of the business going forward, today, we'll provide a view of 2017, which will once again demonstrate strong underlying performance.
Our third quarter results were ahead of our expectations, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.21, representing growth of 7.1% versus the third quarter of 2015. Our results included global operational sales growth of 8%, reflecting continued strong performance from our on-market business, led by HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, as well as other products in our portfolio. 
HUMIRA continues to drive robust performance, delivering global operational growth of more than 12% in the quarter. Despite increasing competition from new classes of drugs and indirect biosimilar competition in international markets, HUMIRA continues to demonstrate exceptional performance and durability across the 3 major market segments.
In rheumatology, HUMIRA continues to hold the #1 market share position with year-over-year share gains. In dermatology, we're seeing mid-teens volume growth, and we're maintaining a very strong #1 market share position with a 15-point lead over the #2 competitor. And in GI, we continue to see strong double-digit volume growth. 
Internationally, HUMIRA continues to maintain its strong position despite indirect biosimilar competition, which is tracking in line with our expectations.
We also continue to deliver on our oncology strategy. IMBRUVICA's performance in the quarter was outstanding, with third quarter global revenues to AbbVie of just over $500 million. We're continuing to drive strong uptake in CLL. In the second-line-plus CLL market, we continue to hold the leadership position, with more than 4 of 10 patients starting treatment with IMBRUVICA. And in the front-line setting, our market share position is steadily increasing, with nearly 1 of 5 patients now starting IMBRUVICA as first-line therapy. 
While we're pleased with this performance, we're still in the very early stages of our trajectory in the front-line setting. We're making progress in a number of important comparatives: in combination studies evaluating IMBRUVICA monotherapy; in combination therapy versus regimens such as BR and FCR, often considered the gold standards in the treatment of CLL. These studies are being run in different patient segments, including young and fit patients and the watch-and-wait population. And the results will add significantly to the breadth of data supporting IMBRUVICA and will provide physicians with more evidence of the compelling clinical benefit in the front-line setting. 
Additionally, in other approved indications, including mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenström's, IMBRUVICA holds the market-leading position in the relapsed/refractory segments. In geographies outside the U.S., IMBRUVICA continues to experience strong adoption in Europe and Canada and has recently been launched in several new markets, including Japan.
While CLL clearly represents the largest revenue contributor to IMBRUVICA's growth over our long-range plan, new indications will also augment our performance. To that end, there is potential for several IMBRUVICA regulatory submissions and approvals over the next few years, including relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma, which is under regulatory review; chronic graft-versus-host disease, which we expect to submit for approval in the first half of 2017; front-line mantle cell lymphoma, which will add to our existing indication in relapsed/refractory MCL; as well as relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and front-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. For several of these indications, IMBRUVICA will be the only approved treatment, underscoring the importance of this therapy for patients.
Collectively, these new IMBRUVICA indications represent a significant incremental revenue opportunity for AbbVie. Mike will provide an update regarding some upcoming data flow for several of these potential new indications. 
Earlier this year, we received approval for Venclexta monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, who harbor the 17p deletion, a relatively small subset of the refractory patient population. In partnership with Roche/Genentech, we're continuing to make good progress with our launch within this indication, with Venclexta now added to the NCCN Guidelines and continued progress with formulary access. Physicians are gaining experience with the therapy, and we look forward to additional data next year in the broader relapsed/refractory setting. We also saw strong performance from several other products in our on-market portfolio, including Duodopa, Creon and international VIEKIRA.
In addition to our strong financial results, we have continued to advance our late-stage pipeline. Last week, at the ASRM meeting, we presented positive data on Elagolix in endometriosis, including additional results from our 2 pivotal studies. Results from these trials will support our U.S. regulatory application, which is on track for submission in 2017. 
We're nearing the completion of our registrational program for our next-generation HCV combination, which is on track for commercialization next year. Based on the data we've shared to date, we believe our next-generation HCV therapy will address the remaining unmet medical needs within this market, with high SVR rates across genotypes with 8 weeks of therapy.
We're making good progress with the risankizumab program, which is in development with partnership with BI. We recently completed ahead of schedule patient enrollment for the pivotal studies in psoriasis, with data from 3 of these trials expected in 2017. We recently launched Zinbryta for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and are in the early stages of our rollout in collaboration with Biogen. And we've also continued to advance assets from the Stemcentrx pipeline. We recently started a basket study evaluating Rova-T in several neuroendocrine tumors where DLL3 is expressed. And we also initiated a regimen selection study for Rova-T in front-line small cell lung cancer.
Based on our performance year-to-date, we're raising our full year 2016 guidance to $4.80 to $4.82 on an adjusted basis, reflecting growth of 12.1% at the midpoint. 
Over the past several months, we received a lot of interest regarding our expectations for 2017. While we're in the midst of our annual planning process, based on the continued strength of the business and especially HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, we're now at a point where we can provide some high-level direction regarding our top and bottom line growth expectations for 2017. We expect low double-digit operational growth in 2017. 2017 will be another important year of investment in R&D as we expand our leadership position in immunology and hematological oncology and also build our position in solid tumors. 
As a result, we expect EPS growth of roughly 13% to 15% from the midpoint of our new 2016 guidance range. This level of performance positions AbbVie to be among the industry leaders for both revenue and EPS growth once again next year. We'll outline our detailed 2017 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January.
Since our inception in 2013, we've delivered strong financial results, and we're well positioned to deliver industry-leading growth again in 2017 for the third consecutive year. We continue to be proud of our strong execution, and we remain committed to our long-term strategic and financial objectives, which we outlined for you in October of 2015.
AbbVie represents a unique investment opportunity, offering both compelling growth along with a strong return of capital to investors, including a rapidly growing dividend. To that end, today, we announced our Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly cash dividend of $0.57 per share to $0.64 per share, an increase of over 12%, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2017. We view the dividend as an important aspect of our investment identity and as a sign of our confidence in the business going forward. Since the company's inception in 2013, AbbVie has increased its dividend by more than 60%. 
In summary, the strategy we've put in place puts us in a position to deliver strong top and bottom line performance. We've established growth platforms in some of the largest and most attractive segments, and we've built a compelling pipeline in these areas, which will contribute significantly to our performance in the years to come. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?"

Today, I'll highlight key pipeline events that occurred during the quarter as well as some of our upcoming milestones. I'll star",1608,"Thank you, Rick. Once again, we had a very productive quarter on R&D, with significant progress across a number of programs. Today, I'll highlight key pipeline events that occurred during the quarter as well as some of our upcoming milestones. 
I'll start with oncology, an area where we are advancing our pipeline in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. 
Turning our attention to solid tumors. We continue to make good progress with Rova-T. We recently began enrolling patients in 2 new studies, a Phase I 8-arm basket study in a broad set of neuroendocrine tumors and a Phase I/II regimen selection study in front-line small cell lung cancer. We expect to start seeing data from both studies in the second half of next year. The Rova-T program in relapsed/refractory small cell lung cancer is progressing well. We continue to see good results from the ongoing Phase I study, with patients still alive more than 2 years after receiving just 2 doses of Rova-T. 
Enrollment in the TRINITY study, our confirmatory third-line registrational trial in small cell lung cancer, is also going very well. And we expect this study to be fully enrolled within the next month. Data from TRINITY will be available next year, which will trigger the submission of our regulatory dossiers. 
We are also on the cusp of starting 2 additional Rova-T studies: Mero, [ph] the Phase III registrational trial evaluating standard chemotherapy followed by Rova-T in the front-line setting; and the Phase I/II combination study, evaluating Rova-T with Opdivo and with Opdivo and Yervoy in small cell lung cancer. We expect both trials to be up and running by the end of the year.
We're also making good progress with other assets from the Stemcentrx pipeline. In addition to Rova-T, we have 4 assets in the clinic and are on track to transition up to 5 additional programs into the clinic over the next year. This will add to our growing oncology pipeline of more than 35 late preclinical or clinical stage assets.
I'll now turn to our hem/onc programs. In the quarter, we announced our U.S. regulatory submission of a supplemental new drug application for the use of IMBRUVICA in previously treated patients with marginal zone lymphoma, a slow-growing form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which accounts for roughly 12% of NHL cases. There are currently no approved treatments specifically indicated for patients with marginal zone lymphoma, and we expect a regulatory decision in the first half of 2017. The data that supported this regulatory submission will also be presented at the upcoming ASH meeting in December. 
Additionally, at ASH, we'll present data from the registration-enabling trial in chronic graft-versus-host disease as well as data from several other IMBRUVICA studies across multiple blood cancers, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. 
We've also made significant progress with the development of Venclexta, which was approved earlier this year in the U.S. under priority review for its first indication as monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL with a 17p deletion mutation, a small but medically important segment of the CLL market and an important first step for this exciting new therapy.
Earlier this month, we received Canadian approval for Venclexta in previously treated CLL patients with a 17p deletion mutation as well as in patients with no other treatment options regardless of their mutational status. 
We also received a positive opinion from the European CHMP for the treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL patients with 17p deletion or TP53 mutations. The CHMP also recommended approval of Venclexta for patients who have failed both chemo-immunotherapy and a B-cell inhibitor regardless of mutational status.
Venclexta has demonstrated strong efficacy, driving deep levels of response and durable disease control, both as monotherapy and in combination with RITUXAN in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Earlier this year, Venclexta received the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation for use in combination with rituximab for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We're expecting data from the MURANO study in the first half of next year, which will support a broader label in relapsed/refractory CLL. 
The breakthrough designation and the upcoming MURANO data are important milestones for Venclexta that will expand use to the broader relapsed/refractory CLL population. We remain excited about the long-term potential for this molecule and believe that Venclexta will be effective across a range of blood cancers.
We're particularly encouraged by the opportunity in AML as the data generated to date have demonstrated clear signs of efficacy. Earlier this year, Venclexta received its third breakthrough therapy designation for use in combination with hypomethylating agents for the treatment of patients with AML who are ineligible to receive standard induction with high-dose chemotherapy. We're moving quickly with Venclexta's development in AML and expect to begin our Phase III programs by the end of the year.
At the upcoming ASH meeting, we'll also percent Venclexta data in a range of tumor types, including Phase I safety and efficacy data in both AML and multiple myeloma as well as results from the mid-stage CONTRALTO and CAVALLI studies in follicular lymphoma and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively.
As we look ahead to 2017, there will be several additional key data readouts from our hematologic oncology portfolio that could enable registration of both IMBRUVICA and Venclexta in new indications. 
For IMBRUVICA, there are a number of planned interim analysis that could potentially lead to regulatory filings, including data in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, front-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and in front-line mantle cell lymphoma. And for Venclexta, as I mentioned, we'll see data from the MURANO study, which will support a broader Venclexta label in CLL.
Now I'll move on to our immunology programs, where we continue to make great progress with our 2 late-stage immunology assets, risankizumab and ABT-494. As Rick mentioned, we have fully enrolled the Phase III psoriasis program for risankizumab and will begin to see data from these pivotal studies toward the end of next year. Interest in the psoriasis program has been very strong, as evidenced by the fact that we fully enrolled the 4 Phase III studies in just 7.5 months, well ahead of our planning assumptions. 
The registration trials in Crohn's disease are expected to begin next year. And we also intend to move risankizumab into late-stage studies in both ulcerative colitis and psoriatic arthritis by the end of 2017. The registration-enabling studies for ABT-494 in RA are also progressing very well, and we remain on track for data readouts from these Phase 3 studies during the first half of 2018.
The development program for ABT-494 in gastrointestinal disorders is also progressing well, with the Phase II study in Crohn's disease ongoing and a Phase II study in ulcerative colitis getting underway in the third quarter. Data from the Crohn's study should be available in the first half of 2017, with Phase III Crohn's study starting later in the year. 
We also recently began a Phase II study to evaluate our oral selective JAK1 inhibitor in atopic dermatitis. 
I'll now move to virology, where we're nearing the completion of our registrational program for our next-generation HCV regimen. This program was designed to investigate a faster path secure for all genotypes of HCV and to address treatment areas of continued unmet need.
Based on the data we've presented today, our once-daily pan-genotypic regimen is highly effective and has the potential to cure a majority of HCV patients in just 8 weeks. The FDA recently granted breakthrough therapy designation for our next-generation regimen for the treatment of patients with chronic HCV who have failed previous therapy with directly acting antivirals in genotype 1. This designation is an important step in our efforts to bring our pan-genotypic regimen to market.
At the AASLD meeting in November, we'll be presenting pivotal data from our next-generation regimen, including results from 8-week cohorts in non-cirrhotics as well as data in patients who have failed prior DAA-containing regimens.
We expect to submit the NDA for our next-generation HCV regimen to the FDA by the end of this year and file the marketing authorization application with the EMA in the first quarter next year. And we remain on track for commercialization in the U.S. in 2017. We believe that AbbVie's pan-genotypic once-daily ribavirin-free HCV therapy will be competitively positioned and will be able to address the remaining unmet medical need within this market.
Finally, in the area of women's health, we are nearing completion of our Phase III endometriosis program, with regulatory submission planned for 2017. The Elagolix clinical development program includes the largest clinical trials conducted to date in endometriosis, with nearly 1,700 patients in 2 pivotal trials. 
At the ASRM Congress earlier this month, we presented detailed results from 2 pivotal studies, demonstrating that Elagolix reduced menstrual and non-menstrual pelvic pain associated with endometriosis compared to placebo. We also presented research on the economic and health care costs associated with endometriosis and endometriosis-related surgery in women in the United States. These data support AbbVie's continued efforts to pursue a regulatory filing of Elagolix as a potential new treatment option for the most prevalent symptoms of the disease.
In addition to the endometriosis program, we have Phase III studies underway in uterine fibroids. This program is investigating the effect of Elagolix on heavy bleeding related to this highly prevalent condition. We anticipate beginning to see data from this Phase 3 program late next year. 
So in summary, we are very pleased with the progress of our pipeline and are on track for further advancements in the remainder of 2016 and into 2017. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our third quarter performance. Bill?"

This morning, I'll review our third quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2016. 
In the quarter, we delivered strong operational sales growth of 8%, excluding a little more than 0.5% of unfavorable impact from foreign currency. We exceeded our adjusted earnings per share guidance, delivering growth of more than 7% compared to the third quarter of 2015. HUMIRA delivered another quarter of strong sales growth, with global sales of more than $4 billion, up 12.1% operationally. Globally, we continue to see strong volume growth across all therapeutic segments.
In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased 16.7% compared to the prior year. The growth rate in the quarter was negatively impacted by 4 points due to higher customer ordering patterns in the prior year, a reversal of what we experienced with second quarter growth rates. Normalized for this, HUMIRA performance in the quarter exceeded 20%, comprised of low-teen prescription growth and single-digit price. Wholesaler inventory levels remained below half a month across all periods. 
On a year-to-date basis, HUMIRA U.S. sales growth exceeds 24%. For the fourth quarter, we forecast sales growth in excess of 20%, which will contribute to our full year forecast of above 20%.
International HUMIRA sales were more than $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4.5% on an operational basis. Biosimilar REMICADE has not had a material impact on our performance, and the Enbrel biosimilar continues to perform in line with our previously communicated assumptions. We continue to forecast HUMIRA international operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year. HUMIRA's unique product profile and AbbVie's strong commercial execution has made HUMIRA the #1 prescribed biologic, and we continue to see strong momentum for HUMIRA as market leader around the world.
Global IMBRUVICA net revenues in the third quarter were $501 million, up nearly 65% over prior year, driven by increased penetration in relapsed/refractory CLL and other indications as well as continued uptake in first-line CLL where we launched earlier this year. 
Global VIEKIRA sales in the third quarter were $378 million, down versus the prior year. Our international business delivered operational sales growth of nearly 31% in the quarter, driven by new launches and continued uptake. In the U.S., as we communicated earlier this year, we have seen market share loss and some price erosion due to the entrance of a new competitor in the market.
Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 21.4% on an operational basis in the quarter, reflecting robust international growth and a modest level of U.S. sales. We also saw strong operational sales growth in the quarter from Creon, which was up 16.6%.
We are in the early stages of our commercial launches of Venclexta and Zinbryta, which had modest sales impact in the third quarter. We have begun our commercial rollout of Venclexta, with our first priority being to ensure adequate physician training and to give physicians an opportunity to gain experience with a dosing ramp. 
As we've outlined, our initial indication for Venclexta, relapsed/refractory CLL patients with a 17p deletion, represents a fairly small market segment estimated to be roughly $300 million. IMBRUVICA currently holds a strong market leadership position in this segment with well over 50% share. However, Venclexta is an asset that offers significant growth potential over the longer term. In the next several years, we expect to augment our label to address the broader relapsed/refractory CLL patient population, expanded earlier lines of therapy and broadened into other hematologic malignancies. 
The next major milestone for Venclexta will be the submission of data from the MURANO trial to regulatory authorities, which will expand the addressable patient population for Venclexta to all relapsed/refractory CLL patients, a much larger patient population. This will add meaningfully to Venclexta's growth beginning in 2018. 
Additionally, we expect further augmentation of the Venclexta label beginning in 2019, with a potential for first-line data and expansion into additional blood cancers.
In August, we launched Zinbryta in the U.S. The Zinbryta label requires the establishment of an appropriate REMS program. And we are on track with the required physician certification and training. While we're very early in the launch, we're encouraged by the level of physician and patient interest. For example, in the U.S., more than 80% of our high-priority physicians have been certified through the REMS program, enabling them to begin prescribing. Based on the approved labeling, we expect Zinbryta to be used as a third-line agent, offering a unique mechanism of action, compelling efficacy and convenient dosing.
Turning to the P&L profile for the quarter. The adjusted gross margin was 80.7% of sales. On a comparative year-over-year basis, this ratio reflects an adverse impact from foreign exchange of roughly 320 basis points. In addition, the adjusted gross margin reflects 110 basis points of unfavorable impact related to the Pharmacyclics acquisition, including the profit transfer for IMBRUVICA, which is booked as cost of goods sold. Adjusting for these impacts, the gross margin profile improved by approximately 170 basis points versus the prior year.
Adjusted R&D was 16.5% of sales, supporting pipeline opportunities in oncology, immunology, HCV and other areas. 
Adjusted SG&A was 21.4% of sales in the third quarter, down 160 basis points from the prior year as we drive operational efficiencies while maintaining our investments in our growth brands.
Adjusted operating margin was 42.8% of sales, down 210 basis points relative to the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the negative impact of exchange, the operating margin profile improved 120 basis points versus the prior year. We remain committed to achieving an adjusted operating margin target of greater than 50% of sales by 2020. 
Net interest expense was $250 million in the quarter, and the adjusted tax rate was 19.9% in the quarter.
Third quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding noncash intangible amortization expense and other specified items, was $1.21, up 7.1% year-over-year. 
Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our strong business performance year-to-date and our confidence in our momentum going forward, we are raising our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range to $4.80 to $4.82, reflecting adjusted EPS growth of 12.1% at the midpoint. We are also updating our 2016 GAAP EPS guidance range to $3.74 to $3.76, which includes $1.06 per share of noncash intangible amortization expense and other specified items. 
Regarding the fourth quarter. We expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 to $1.20. This excludes roughly $0.22 of noncash amortization and other specified items. We expect high single-digit operational sales growth with minimal foreign exchange impacts in the quarter.
In closing, we delivered strong performance in the quarter. We've driven strong top and bottom line growth while also advancing our strategic priorities and our pipeline. And as Rick outlined, we're well positioned for strong growth again in 2017 as we expect to deliver low double-digit operational revenue growth and EPS growth of 13% to 15% from the midpoint of our new 2016 guidance range. This level of performance should place us among the industry leaders for both revenue and EPS growth once again next year. And underscoring our confidence in the business going forward, today, we announced a 12.3% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable on February 2017. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz."

Maybe you can talk about what you're seeing from your perspective. Obviously, there is some industry concern in the marketplace about structural change to pricing. We saw McKesson announce -- highlight significant moderation in price increases next year, which caused them to lower their guidance. Novo significantly lowered their expectations. Amgen talked about TNF pricing basically going away. From your vantage point, what are you seeing? And maybe you can share with us changes that we should anticipate in our models with respect to net pricing for HUMIRA in the U.S. going forward. Secondly, we appreciate the early commentary and color on 2017 guidance, 13% to 15% earnings growth. However, that is a little bit below consensus. Maybe if you could just step back, you gave us 2020 guidance a couple of years ago. Maybe you could just step back and help us think about the cadence of earnings growth. AbbVie is a different company from the industry average just given the looming competition to HUMIRA. Maybe if you could just help us think about the growth of this company over the next 5 years, how you're thinking about it, how -- what you see relative to the plan that you put out a couple of years ago."

I think as you look at price, certainly, the rhetoric on price has been more intense than we've seen it in a number of years.

I think as you look at price, certainly, the rhetoric on price has been more intense than we've seen it in a number of years. And some of that is driven by the political environment, and some of it's driven by more fundamentals. I think if you look at our business specifically, our business is primarily a volume-driven business. That's not to say we don't benefit at all from price, but clearly, the vast majority of our growth comes from volume. And the key, I think, for our entire industry is to continue to drive innovation. And innovative products in general and innovative pharmaceuticals, I think, in general tend to save the health care system money over time. And I don't know that we've done everything we should do to be able to make sure that we get -- one, get that message out; and two, maybe support that message a little bit better than we have in the past. And so I think that's the key for the industry going forward, and that's the thing that we need to focus our attention on. And if you look at the products that we've been successful with, I think they have a good economic value proposition. HUMIRA is a good example of that as well. And so -- but I'd say, as we look at our planning process, just as we have in previous years, we tend to plan conservatively when it comes to price and then evaluate the market environment at the time that we ultimately get close to that period of time and make a decision around what is the appropriate pricing strategy. And our guidance in 2017 and our long-range plan are both reflective of that philosophy. That philosophy hasn't changed. I think if you look at the 2017 EPS forecast that we gave you, I'd say there's 2 things that -- in the consensus that are important to look at. One is if you looked at consensus, I don't believe everyone has rolled into their model the full year R&D expectation for the BI and the Stemcentrx acquisition. And so obviously, that was not reflected in the overall consensus numbers. The second thing is, if you look at gross margin, the consensus numbers, gross margin profile is off. And we've communicated that a couple of times. And where it's off is trying to calculate what the partnering products contribution will be. And I think if you look at those 2 factors, if you look at the top line, what we're communicating is very close to what the top line is. If you look at our overall operating expenses, certainly, SG&A, R&D is a little bit higher, SG&A probably a bit lower but, net-net, probably a little bit higher. But the difference that you would see would be in the gross margin profile. The other thing I'd say is if you look at that level of performance, based on everything that we see, it will rank us certainly in the top tier, if not #1. Obviously, we have to see what others report but based on consensus that's out there today, so we're delivering another year of truly outstanding performance. As far as what we communicated to you from the long-range plan back in October, as I said in my formal comments, this is consistent with what we communicated. I'd say we're still on track to be able to deliver what we expected. And in fact, if anything, I'd say HUMIRA is probably ahead. I think there was a lot of surprise when we first communicated the $18 billion for HUMIRA. There's obviously less surprise now to that number based on our overall performance. And so I think we're tracking on what we had communicated. We're absolutely committed to delivering a 50% operating margin by 2020, and that's despite the negative impact that we will see from the partnering products. And we're committed to being able to drive that average compounded growth rate of EPS that we communicated as well as our top line. And we continue to have a lot of confidence in the business going forward. As we look at the pipeline rolling out, the assets in our late-stage pipeline, I think, are continuing to advance in a way that is consistent with what we thought back then. And those assets are starting to roll out now as Venclexta, as an example, gets a broader label. That's going to be a very meaningful contributor to our overall performance. And a number of other programs are continuing to advance. Risankizumab is an example, I think, is ahead of schedule by a significant amount of time. 494 continues to advance very well. And so generally, what I'd say is we're very confident in what our outlook looks like, and it's consistent with what we communicated to you back in October of 2015."

And then beyond 2017, do you already anticipate that, that flat net pricing in the U.S., if that's what you consider for 2017, actually becomes negative maybe in 2018, 2019? Just wondering what you've considered in your midterm plan. And then also, Amgen seemed to communicate yesterday evening that they won't launch at risk in 2017 and indeed whilst the legal process is going on. Is that your interpretation of what they were saying also? And how long do you think that, that legal process is going to go on for? I don't know if you have any court dates yet."

So I'm not going to necessarily give you the absolute color on what our assumption is in 2017 as it relates to price. But I'd say we don't have a consistent view of the TNF market to the one that was described by Amgen. And I think every product obviously has a different perspective in the marketplace. Maybe it's worthwhile to walk through HUMIRA in a little bit of detail because I know there's always a lot of interest in it, and that will give you, I think, a perspective of where we stand overall. I mean, if you step back and you look at where HUMIRA is, take the international market first, HUMIRA continues to perform as we described it despite the fact that we've seen the launch of Enbrel biosimilars in that market now for about 7 or 8 months, I would guess, maybe 9 months, something like that, that they've actually been in the marketplace. They've had a very modest impact. We're delivering mid-single-digit growth as we've described to you. In fact, this quarter, it was about 4.5%. Now the interesting thing is if you adjust for the impact of Venezuela, which would be a onetime impact in 2016, the underlying growth of our international business for HUMIRA is 7.6%. So good, strong growth. It's primarily volume growth because you typically have negative price in those international markets. So I'd say HUMIRA is performing exactly where we would have expected it to perform in the international markets. If you look at the U.S., I mean, U.S. has had just truly outstanding growth. If you look at the past 6 quarters, on average, HUMIRA has averaged about 25% growth. The last 2 quarters, second and third quarter, if you average the 2 of them together, the growth was 21.7%. If you make the adjustment for the ordering patterns that Bill described, third quarter was just over 20% growth. And as Bill indicated, we're forecasting 20% growth again in the fourth quarter. The October weeklies are consistent with that, and we obviously pay a lot of attention to HUMIRA. And so this brand continues to grow extremely well. And the vast majority of that growth is volume. If you look at market share, in the U.S., we continue to perform well. And probably the best way to look at market share would be if you track it at the beginning of 2016 and look at it through the earliest data points that we have, which would be September data points, the overall market share for HUMIRA is about 31.8%. It's up 0.6% over that period of time, from January through September. Rheumatology, our share is 26.8%. It's increased a full point over that period of time. Gastro and Durham[ph], our market share remains basically flat at 43% and 35% market share. And so this brand continues to perform extremely well in the marketplace, and it's because of the attributes of this product and how well accepted it is by physicians and by patients. We're continuing to see good market growth. There's an anomaly in the IMS data because a large managed care organization has blinded their data, but it's still in the base. But what I would tell you is that if you look at script growth on HUMIRA, it's above 13%, and you make the appropriate adjustments, and the market is growing high single digits, around 9% or so. So prescription growth continues to be extremely robust. And then if you look at our formulary position, we just finished our 2017, 2018 negotiations. We're pleased with how those negotiations sorted themselves out. We basically have the same level of strong market access for HUMIRA that we had in 2016. Net price, which we don't talk about a lot, but what I can tell you is there was only a very minimal, almost no change in net price by doing the 2016 contracts and the 2017 and '18 contracts. And all other attributes of the contract, like price protection, are consistent, basically consistent with what we've had previously. And so we feel good about our access in the marketplace. And so I think you can expect that HUMIRA is going to continue to perform well. I mean, every brand has its own set of issues that it has to deal with, and I'm certainly not in a position to be able to talk about their brand. But what I am in a position to talk about is how HUMIRA has performed and how we expect it to continue to perform going forward. Price is something that -- as I said, we look at it very carefully every single year, and we make a determination as to what we think is appropriate. And we'll do the exact same thing this year. We typically build in a conservative level of price into our planning assumptions because we don't want to be exposed in any way. And in the information that we provided you thus far, it includes that level of conservative assumptions built into it. As it relates to the comments on the litigation, that's not something I can talk about in a lot of detail. I would have interpreted their comments to be the same as the way you interpreted them. I don't think that's a big surprise. At the end of the day, when you look at the magnitude of our IP portfolio and you look at the risk of launching at risk against that portfolio, that would be a high-risk proposition for anyone. And we made our intentions very clear about we plan to enforce our IP against anyone who attempts to enter the marketplace and that we would -- if someone chose to make a decision to launch at risk, we would seek a PI. And I think the power of our IP, I think, is very clear in the marketplace. So hopefully, that was responsive to your question."

Now that doesn't mean you can't open something up. But at the end of the day, we had completed all of our negotiations at this point for the 2017 and '18 contract periods. My comment on net price was essentially, as you go and you negotiate for your next contract, typically, there is pressure to take your rebates up, right? So that's -- if you put any price increase and the fall-through of price increase aside, it's what would you increase your rebates by over that period of time? That's what my comment was designed to address, that there was minimal to no change from that perspective, and your price will flow through based on the normal dynamics of how that would occur. And as I said, it was consistent with what we had in place from any levels of price protection in 2016. So it's basically business as usual for us going forward in '17 and '18. As far as indication-based pricing, I mean, I think that's a phenomena that hit -- that originally started in the area of oncology, where you could have an oncolytic agent that had very different activity or efficacy in one type of cancer versus another and is the value proposition the same. If you look at HUMIRA, typically, across the areas that we compete, HUMIRA is typically the gold standard in most of the areas that we compete in. I'd say, generally speaking, we have seen some interest in indication-based pricing and potentially doing that. That's got something good, as I said, I think fits well for HUMIRA because of its broad applicability and its level of performance across the range of indications that it has. But it's certainly something that has been of interest. I don't see that as a fundamental issue in the contracting that we've seen go forward for '17 and '18, at least for HUMIRA."

Could you help me just further categorize the slowing HUMIRA growth given the biosimilar impact that's obviously going to be pretty limited given the geography and limited time that the other TNF biosimilars have been in the market? How much is competition from the IL-17s in the psoriasis class? How much is saturation of indications? And how much is mandatory price reductions outside the U.S.? And I know you've given earnings guidance for next year. I wonder whether you'd like to give revenue guidance for HUMIRA. Second, AbbVie has enjoyed a mutually positive relationship with PBMs. In general, do you anticipate any change between the relationships between the PBMs and the pharma industry given the political focus on the PBMs on the lack of transparency as well as the ongoing attorney general investigations? And then finally, for Mike, could you tell us what percentage of patients on IMBRUVICA run into problems with atrial fibrillation or coagulopathy? I'm obviously thinking about future competition from Astra's acalabrutinib."

But broadly, when you look at our assumptions that we had around biosimilars and the underlying growth of the markets, things have been progressing very, very well. So if you look at major markets across Europe, we've got market growing in the low teens, no changes there. And if you look at HUMIRA share, very, very minimal change year-over-year. REMICADE has not -- biosimilar REMICADE has not had a major impact on the brand in any way whatsoever. And Enbrel, as we had told you at the beginning of the year, we anticipated a 2 to 3 percentage growth impact, but that was more or less based on the pricing that we expected the biosimilar to come in at. So the biosimilars have been performing very much in line with our expectations. The new entrants to market, look, it's something we're watching very closely. But the reality is those new entrants tend to get slotted as for patients that are ultimately anti-TNF failures. And so while they are ultimately gaining some traction in the market and they're picking up market share, I don't think you should read that through as a direct erosion to the market share of HUMIRA. Again, in fact, we've got a very, very strong market share position across those markets."

When you say the brand is slowing, I'm not sure whether you're referencing what Bill said in his comments about the prior year inventory levels or you're just looking at, as in the U.S., as I said in my comments a moment ago, we've averaged over 6 quarters about 25%. The last 2 quarters are more in the 21% range. There's obviously fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter. But if you look at the dollar contribution across those quarters of growth, it's fairly consistent. And there's always ins and outs. But at the end of the day, as the brand gets bigger, the percent growth is going to go down, and the brand has obviously grown significantly across that period of time. If you look at the IL-17s or some of the other brands, as I mentioned, in the market share, our market share in Durham [ph] is roughly flat. Clearly, we have leadership position in that segment. And I think as we look at the dynamics within that market, just to reinforce what Bill said, it's typically the #2 player that's getting the bulk of any erosion in their market share with the entrance of a new mechanism, like a 17 as an example, because it is usually the second-line failure that they tend to get their market share from. And so HUMIRA has not had as much of a negative impact based on that because we're typically the first TNF that is used in those indications. On the PBMs, obviously, we've got to have good relationships with all of our customers, whether they be managed care organizations or PBMs. They are professional relationships. I think PBMs serve a very important purpose. They obviously allow plans to be able to have formularies that they can help manage. And that's the role that they play, and we play an important role with them. In being able to supply them with products, they can go on those formularies. And so I think it's a typical business relationship. And on IMBRUVICA, I mean, I don't know that we commented specifically about the rates. They're obviously relatively low rates.

I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the dynamics there because there's obviously competitors ahead of you in both of those spaces.

I don't anticipate anything significantly changing that strategy based on how we would employ the strategy, based on the debates that we see going on and the market dynamics going on. I'll have Mike maybe talk a little bit about the JAKs and the IL-23s from a performance standpoint. But what I would say from a market standpoint is we have always tried to position that our follow-on products would be significantly differentiated versus others in the marketplace, and we've designed our clinical trials to be able to produce that level of differentiation. And I would expect that, if anything, we would be in a better position, based on our experience and our position in this market, to be able to launch these products successfully into the market as companion products behind what will be a workhorse product like HUMIRA.

And I think each of those assets stands up very well to that understanding of what we'll need to be competitive. With the JAK, for example, that's why we've focused on differentiated efficacy, strong efficacy in very difficult-to-treat patient populations and very, very strong data at the higher levels response and points like remission, low disease activity, durable, ACR70s and the like. And for risankizumab, it was really the same thought process. We looked at those data, and we believed, based on a very substantial set of clinical trial results, that the efficacy there was truly differentiated. And we can point, for example, to the approximately 50% PASI 100 response for risankizumab in Phase IIb, with very favorable pharmaceutical properties of that agent, very favorable dosing that we believe is attainable in Phase III and in registration.

If you go back and look over the years, it is not unusual in the U.S. or abroad to see a general flattening out over the summer and then an acceleration back in the back half of the year. And that is the pattern that we're seeing this year. Now could there be some degree of inventory between Q2 and Q3 that's impacting that sequential growth? Yes. I mean, look, a minor move flow impacts that sequential. But really, at the end of the day, when we look at the brand and we look at the dynamics around the brand and we look at the prior year destock that we saw in the second quarter and the subsequent restock in the third quarter, there is nothing that is alarming us about this third quarter. You have to remember that our second quarter results had 26.7% growth. That was largely related -- that difference from the 20% was largely related to a destocking event in the second quarter of 2015. And we're just seeing the restock -- the impact of the restock in the third quarter of '15. So we actually feel very, very good about it. We're guiding fourth quarter above 20%. We feel very, very good about our full year forecast."

With respect to the basket study for Rova-T, so this is a study that has 8 arms.

Examples of these tumor types might be the large cell component of non-small cell lung cancer, a form of pancreatic cancer that has neuroendocrine features, subsets of colorectal cancer and metastatic melanoma, for example. So each of these 8 arms is going to look for a response rate in refractory patients with those tumors. And when we see a response rate that we view as indicative of good activity, we would then have the ability to expand out both those cohorts and start additional studies that could be registration-enabling, following the same conceptual strategy that we did with Rova-T in small cell. Of course, the nature of what each registrational program would look like would be tailored to the individual tumor type. But this is a study that could rapidly trigger additional registrational work in those other tumors as we see signs of activity."

So John, just to clarify on the price, the net price comment refers to what happened to net price before any future price actions, okay? Now what we're not saying is that there will be no net price increase next year. We still have, within our contracts, the ability to raise price and see a positive impact on the P&L from those actions. The net price actually has to do with, without any future price increases, which, by the way, that isn't how we're modeling the year, what we would expect price would be on a constant basis without price increases. The contracts allow us to take net price. And any net price increases, any price increase that we took would have a positive impact on our bottom line. That's the way you need to think about it. That said, in 2017, we are planning conservatively, as we always do. We're approaching the 2017 guidance with the exact same philosophy on how we plan for price increases that we have in the past. So hopefully, that helps some. And then from a P&L management standpoint, look, the SG&A ratio, we're very pleased with. It's really a couple different things. There is a leverage impact from the rapidly growing top line that obviously we've been putting -- delivering over the last few quarters. That said, we look at our spend. We're looking at admin very, very closely. We're looking at the productivity of all of our SG&A investments, as you would expect us to, and we fund projects based on an ROI and a return. And if they have positive ROI, we find a way to get the money in the right places to deliver the return. In terms of HUMIRA, we are not backing off our spend on HUMIRA. The spend on HUMIRA has been the driver of the spectacular growth that the brand has put up. And all of those programs are very, very high ROI, which, as you can see -- as you can imagine, based on the sales growth."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'll discuss our third quarter performance, recent operational highlights, and I'll also share some high-level perspective regarding our growth profile for 2017. Mik",1411,"Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'll discuss our third quarter performance, recent operational highlights, and I'll also share some high-level perspective regarding our growth profile for 2017. Mike will then provide updates on our recent advancements across our R&D programs, and Bill will provide additional color on the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of this year. 
2016 is shaping up to be another very strong year, with operational revenue growth year-to-date of nearly 16% and EPS growth through 3 quarters up 14.6%. This follows a very strong 2015, where we delivered operational revenue growth of 22% and EPS growth of 29%. Based on our confidence in the performance of the business going forward, today we'll provide a view of 2017, which will once again demonstrate strong underlying performance.
Our third quarter results were ahead of our expectations, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.21, representing growth of 7.1% versus the third quarter of 2015. Our results included global operational sales growth of 8%, reflecting continued strong performance from our on-market business, led by HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, as well as other products in our portfolio. 
HUMIRA continues to drive robust performance, delivering global operational growth of more than 12% in the quarter. Despite increasing competition from new classes of drugs and indirect biosimilar competition in international markets, HUMIRA continues to demonstrate exceptional performance and durability across the 3 major market segments.
In rheumatology, HUMIRA continues to hold the #1 market share position with year-over-year share gains. In dermatology, we're seeing mid-teens volume growth, and we're maintaining a very strong #1 market share position with a 15-point lead over the #2 competitor. And in GI, we continue to see strong double-digit volume growth. 
Internationally, HUMIRA continues to maintain its strong position despite indirect biosimilar competition, which is tracking in line with our expectations.
We also continue to deliver on our oncology strategy. IMBRUVICA's performance in the quarter was outstanding, with third quarter global revenues to AbbVie of just over $500 million. We're continuing to drive strong uptake in CLL. In the second-line-plus CLL market, we continue to hold the leadership position, with more than 4 of 10 patients starting treatment with IMBRUVICA. And in the front-line setting, our market share position is steadily increasing, with nearly 1 of 5 patients now starting IMBRUVICA as first-line therapy. 
While we're pleased with this performance, we're still in the very early stages of our trajectory in the front-line setting. We're making progress in a number of important comparatives: in combination studies evaluating IMBRUVICA monotherapy; in combination therapy versus regimens such as BR and FCR, often considered the gold standards in the treatment of CLL. These studies are being run in different patient segments, including young and fit patients and the watch-and-wait population. And the results will add significantly to the breadth of data supporting IMBRUVICA and will provide physicians with more evidence of the compelling clinical benefit in the front-line setting. 
Additionally, in other approved indications, including mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenström's, IMBRUVICA holds the market-leading position in the relapsed/refractory segments. In geographies outside the U.S., IMBRUVICA continues to experience strong adoption in Europe and Canada and has recently been launched in several new markets, including Japan.
While CLL clearly represents the largest revenue contributor to IMBRUVICA's growth over our long-range plan, new indications will also augment our performance. To that end, there is potential for several IMBRUVICA regulatory submissions and approvals over the next few years, including relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma, which is currently under regulatory review; chronic graft-versus-host disease, which we expect to submit for approval in the first half of 2017; front-line mantle cell lymphoma, which will add to our existing indication in relapsed/refractory MCL; as well as relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and front-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. For several of these indications, IMBRUVICA will be the only approved treatment, underscoring the importance of this therapy for patients.
Collectively, these new IMBRUVICA indications represent a significant incremental revenue opportunity for AbbVie. Mike will provide an update regarding some upcoming data flow for several of these potential new indications. 
Earlier this year, we received approval for Venclexta monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, who harbor the 17p deletion, a relatively small subset of the refractory patient population. In partnership with Roche/Genentech, we're continuing to make good progress with our launch within this indication, with Venclexta now added to the NCCN Guidelines and continued progress with formulary access. Physicians are gaining experience with the therapy, and we look forward to additional data next year in the broader relapsed/refractory setting. We also saw strong performance from several other products in our on-market portfolio, including Duodopa, Creon and international VIEKIRA.
In addition to our strong financial results, we have continued to advance our late-stage pipeline. Last week, at the ASRM meeting, we presented positive data on Elagolix in endometriosis, including additional results from our 2 pivotal studies. Results from these trials will support our U.S. regulatory application, which is on track for submission in 2017. 
We're nearing the completion of our registrational program for our next-generation HCV combination, which is on track for commercialization next year. Based on the data we've shared to date, we believe our next-generation HCV therapy will address the remaining unmet medical needs within this market, with high SVR rates across genotypes with 8 weeks of therapy.
We're making good progress with the risankizumab program, which is in development in partnership with BI. We recently completed, ahead of schedule, patient enrollment for the pivotal studies in psoriasis, with data from 3 of these trials expected in 2017. We recently launched Zinbryta for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and are in the early stages of our rollout in collaboration with Biogen. And we've also continued to advance assets from the Stemcentrx pipeline. We recently started a basket study evaluating Rova-T in several neuroendocrine tumors where DLL3 is expressed. And we also initiated a regimen selection study for Rova-T in front-line small cell lung cancer.
Based on our performance year-to-date, we're raising our full year 2016 guidance to $4.80 to $4.82 on an adjusted basis, reflecting growth of 12.1% at the midpoint. 
Over the past several months, we received a lot of interest regarding our expectations for 2017. While we're in the midst of our annual planning process, based on the continued strength of the business and especially HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, we're now at a point where we can provide some high-level direction regarding our top and bottom line growth expectations for 2017. We expect low double-digit operational growth in 2017. 2017 will be another important year of investment in R&D as we expand our leadership position in immunology and hematological oncology and also build our position in solid tumors. 
As a result, we expect EPS growth of roughly 13% to 15% from the midpoint of our new 2016 guidance range. This level of performance positions AbbVie to be among the industry leaders for both revenue and EPS growth once again next year. We'll outline our detailed 2017 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January.
Since our inception in 2013, we've delivered strong financial results, and we're well positioned to deliver industry-leading growth again in 2017 for the third consecutive year. We continue to be proud of our strong execution, and we remain committed to our long-term strategic and financial objectives, which we outlined for you in October of 2015.
AbbVie represents a unique investment opportunity, offering both compelling growth along with a strong return of capital to investors, including a rapidly growing dividend. To that end, today we announced our Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly cash dividend of $0.57 per share to $0.64 per share, an increase of over 12%, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2017. We view the dividend as an important aspect of our investment identity and as a sign of our confidence in the business going forward. Since the company's inception in 2013, AbbVie has increased its dividend by more than 60%. 
In summary, the strategy we've put in place puts us in a position to deliver strong top and bottom line performance. We've established growth platforms in some of the largest and most attractive segments, and we've built a compelling pipeline in these areas, which will contribute significantly to our performance in the years to come. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?"

Once again, we had a very productive quarter in R&D, with significant progress across a number of programs. Today, I'll highlight key pipeline events that occurred during the quarter as well as some of our upcoming milestones. 
I'll start with oncology, an area where we are advancing our pipeline in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. 
Turning our attention to solid tumors. We continue to make good progress with Rova-T. We recently began enrolling patients in 2 new studies, a Phase I 8-arm basket study in a broad set of neuroendocrine tumors and a Phase I/II regimen selection study in front-line small cell lung cancer. We expect to start seeing data from both studies in the second half of next year. The Rova-T program in relapsed/refractory small cell lung cancer is progressing well. We continue to see good results from the ongoing Phase I study, with patients still alive more than 2 years after receiving just 2 doses of Rova-T. 
Enrollment in the TRINITY study, our confirmatory third-line registrational trial in small cell lung cancer, is also going very well. And we expect this study to be fully enrolled within the next month. Data from TRINITY will be available next year, which will trigger the submission of our regulatory dossiers. 
We are also on the cusp of starting 2 additional Rova-T studies: Meru, [ph] the Phase III registrational trial evaluating standard chemotherapy followed by Rova-T in the front-line setting; and the Phase I/II combination study, evaluating Rova-T with Opdivo and with Opdivo and Yervoy in small cell lung cancer. We expect both trials to be up and running by the end of the year.
We're also making good progress with other assets from the Stemcentrx pipeline. In addition to Rova-T, we have 4 assets in the clinic and are on track to transition up to 5 additional programs into the clinic over the next year. This will add to our growing oncology pipeline of more than 35 late preclinical or clinical stage assets.
I'll now turn to our hem/onc programs. In the quarter, we announced our U.S. regulatory submission of a supplemental new drug application for the use of IMBRUVICA in previously treated patients with marginal zone lymphoma, a slow-growing form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which accounts for roughly 12% of NHL cases. There are currently no approved treatments specifically indicated for patients with marginal zone lymphoma, and we expect a regulatory decision in the first half of 2017. The data that supported this regulatory submission will also be presented at the upcoming ASH meeting in December. 
Additionally, at ASH, we'll present data from the registration-enabling trial in chronic graft-versus-host disease as well as data from several other IMBRUVICA studies across multiple blood cancers, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. 
We've also made significant progress with the development of Venclexta, which was approved earlier this year in the U.S. under priority review for its first indication as monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL with a 17p deletion mutation, a small but medically important segment of the CLL market and an important first step for this exciting new therapy.
Earlier this month, we received Canadian approval for Venclexta in previously treated CLL patients with a 17p deletion mutation as well as in patients with no other treatment options regardless of their mutational status. 
We also received a positive opinion from the European CHMP for the treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL patients with 17p deletion or TP53 mutations. The CHMP also recommended approval of Venclexta for patients who have failed both chemo-immunotherapy and a B-cell inhibitor regardless of mutational status.
Venclexta has demonstrated strong efficacy, driving deep levels of response and durable disease control, both as monotherapy and in combination with RITUXAN in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Earlier this year, Venclexta received the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation for use in combination with rituximab for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We're expecting data from the MURANO study in the first half of next year, which will support a broader label in relapsed/refractory CLL. 
The breakthrough designation and the upcoming MURANO data are important milestones for Venclexta that will expand use to the broader relapsed/refractory CLL population. We remain excited about the long-term potential for this molecule and believe that Venclexta will be effective across a range of blood cancers.
We're particularly encouraged by the opportunity in AML as the data generated to date have demonstrated clear signs of efficacy. Earlier this year, Venclexta received its third breakthrough therapy designation for use in combination with hypomethylating agents for the treatment of patients with AML who are ineligible to receive standard induction with high-dose chemotherapy. We're moving quickly with Venclexta's development in AML and expect to begin our Phase III programs by the end of the year.
At the upcoming ASH meeting, we'll also present Venclexta data in a range of tumor types, including Phase I safety and efficacy data in both AML and multiple myeloma, as well as results from the mid-stage CONTRALTO and CAVALLI studies in follicular lymphoma and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively.
As we look ahead to 2017, there will be several additional key data readouts from our hematologic oncology portfolio that could enable registration of both IMBRUVICA and Venclexta in new indications. 
For IMBRUVICA, there are a number of planned interim analyses that could potentially lead to regulatory filings, including data in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, front-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and in front-line mantle cell lymphoma. And for Venclexta, as I mentioned, we'll see data from the MURANO study, which will support a broader Venclexta label in CLL.
Now I'll move on to our immunology programs, where we continue to make great progress with our 2 late-stage immunology assets, risankizumab and ABT-494. As Rick mentioned, we have fully enrolled the Phase III psoriasis program for risankizumab and will begin to see data from these pivotal studies toward the end of next year. Interest in the psoriasis program has been very strong, as evidenced by the fact that we fully enrolled the 4 Phase III studies in just 7.5 months, well ahead of our planning assumptions. 
The registration trials in Crohn's disease are expected to begin next year. And we also intend to move risankizumab into late-stage studies in both ulcerative colitis and psoriatic arthritis by the end of 2017. The registration-enabling studies for ABT-494 in RA are also progressing very well, and we remain on track for data readouts from these Phase III studies during the first half of 2018.
The development program for ABT-494 in gastrointestinal disorders is also progressing well, with the Phase II study in Crohn's disease ongoing and a Phase II study in ulcerative colitis getting underway in the third quarter. Data from the Crohn's study should be available in the first half of 2017, with Phase III Crohn's study starting later in the year. 
We also recently began a Phase II study to evaluate our oral selective JAK1 inhibitor in atopic dermatitis. 
I'll now move to virology, where we're nearing the completion of our registrational program for our next-generation HCV regimen. This program was designed to investigate a faster path to cure for all genotypes of HCV and to address treatment areas of continued unmet need.
Based on the data we've presented today, our once-daily pan-genotypic regimen is highly effective and has the potential to cure a majority of HCV patients in just 8 weeks. The FDA recently granted breakthrough therapy designation for our next-generation regimen for the treatment of patients with chronic HCV who have failed previous therapy with directly acting antivirals in genotype 1. This designation is an important step in our efforts to bring our pan-genotypic regimen to market.
At the AASLD meeting in November, we'll be presenting pivotal data from our next-generation regimen, including results from 8-week cohorts in non-cirrhotics as well as data in patients who have failed prior DAA-containing regimens.
We expect to submit the NDA for our next-generation HCV regimen to the FDA by the end of this year and file the marketing authorization application with the EMA in the first quarter next year. And we remain on track for commercialization in the U.S. in 2017. We believe that AbbVie's pan-genotypic once-daily ribavirin-free HCV therapy will be competitively positioned and will be able to address the remaining unmet medical need within this market.
Finally, in the area of women's health, we are nearing completion of our Phase III endometriosis program, with regulatory submission planned for 2017. The Elagolix clinical development program includes the largest clinical trials conducted to date in endometriosis, with nearly 1,700 patients in 2 pivotal trials. 
At the ASRM Congress earlier this month, we presented detailed results from 2 pivotal studies, demonstrating that Elagolix reduced menstrual and non-menstrual pelvic pain associated with endometriosis compared to placebo. We also presented research on the economic and health care costs associated with endometriosis and endometriosis-related surgery in women in the United States. These data support AbbVie's continued efforts to pursue a regulatory filing of Elagolix as a potential new treatment option for the most prevalent symptoms of the disease.
In addition to the endometriosis program, we have Phase III studies underway in uterine fibroids. This program is investigating the effect of Elagolix on heavy bleeding related to this highly prevalent condition. We anticipate beginning to see data from this Phase III program late next year. 
So in summary, we are very pleased with the progress of our pipeline and are on track for further advancements in the remainder of 2016 and into 2017. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our third quarter performance. Bill?"

This morning, I'll review our third quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2016. 
In the quarter, we delivered strong operational sales growth of 8%, excluding a little more than 0.5% of unfavorable impact from foreign currency. We exceeded our adjusted earnings per share guidance, delivering growth of more than 7% compared to the third quarter of 2015. HUMIRA delivered another quarter of strong sales growth, with global sales of more than $4 billion, up 12.1% operationally. Globally, we continue to see strong volume growth across all therapeutic segments.
In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased 16.7% compared to the prior year. The growth rate in the quarter was negatively impacted by 4 points due to higher customer ordering patterns in the prior year, a reversal of what we experienced with second quarter growth rates. Normalized for this, HUMIRA performance in the quarter exceeded 20%, comprised of low-teen prescription growth and single-digit price. Wholesaler inventory levels remained below half a month across all periods. 
On a year-to-date basis, HUMIRA U.S. sales growth exceeds 24%. For the fourth quarter, we forecast sales growth in excess of 20%, which will contribute to our full year forecast of above 20%.
International HUMIRA sales were more than $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4.5% on an operational basis. Biosimilar REMICADE has not had a material impact on performance, and the Enbrel biosimilar continues to perform in line with our previously communicated assumptions. We continue to forecast HUMIRA international operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year. HUMIRA's unique product profile and AbbVie's strong commercial execution has made HUMIRA the #1 prescribed biologic, and we continue to see strong momentum for HUMIRA as market leader around the world.
Global IMBRUVICA net revenues in the third quarter were $501 million, up nearly 65% over prior year, driven by increased penetration in relapsed/refractory CLL and other indications as well as continued uptake in first-line CLL where we launched earlier this year. 
Global VIEKIRA sales in the third quarter were $378 million, down versus the prior year. Our international business delivered operational sales growth of nearly 31% in the quarter, driven by new launches and continued uptake. In the U.S., as we communicated earlier this year, we have seen market share loss and some price erosion due to the entrance of a new competitor in the market.
Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 21.4% on an operational basis in the quarter, reflecting robust international growth and a modest level of U.S. sales. We also saw strong operational sales growth in the quarter from Creon, which was up 16.6%.
We are in the early stages of our commercial launches of Venclexta and Zinbryta, which had modest sales impact in the third quarter. We have begun our commercial rollout of Venclexta, with our first priority being to ensure adequate physician training and to give physicians an opportunity to gain experience with a dosing ramp. 
As we've outlined, our initial indication for Venclexta, relapsed/refractory CLL patients with a 17p deletion, represents a fairly small market segment estimated to be roughly $300 million. IMBRUVICA currently holds a strong market leadership position in this segment with well over 50% share. However, Venclexta is an asset that offers significant growth potential over the longer term. In the next several years, we expect to augment our label to address the broader relapsed/refractory CLL patient population, expanded earlier lines of therapy and broadened into other hematologic malignancies. 
The next major milestone for Venclexta will be the submission of data from the MURANO trial to regulatory authorities, which will expand the addressable patient population for Venclexta to all relapsed/refractory CLL patients, a much larger patient population. This will add meaningfully to Venclexta's growth beginning in 2018. 
Additionally, we expect further augmentation of the Venclexta label beginning in 2019, with a potential for first-line data and expansion into additional blood cancers.
In August, we launched Zinbryta in the U.S. The Zinbryta label requires the establishment of an appropriate REMS program. And we are on track with the required physician certification and training. While we're very early in the launch, we're encouraged by the level of physician and patient interest. For example, in the U.S., more than 80% of our high-priority physicians have been certified through the REMS program, enabling them to begin prescribing. Based on the approved labeling, we expect Zinbryta to be used as a third-line agent, offering a unique mechanism of action, compelling efficacy and convenient dosing.
Turning to the P&L profile for the quarter. The adjusted gross margin was 80.7% of sales. On a comparative year-over-year basis, this ratio reflects an adverse impact from foreign exchange of roughly 320 basis points. In addition, the adjusted gross margin reflects 110 basis points of unfavorable impact related to the Pharmacyclics acquisition, including the profit transfer for IMBRUVICA, which is booked as cost of goods sold. Adjusting for these impacts, the gross margin profile improved by approximately 170 basis points versus the prior year.
Adjusted R&D was 16.5% of sales, supporting pipeline opportunities in oncology, immunology, HCV and other areas. 
Adjusted SG&A was 21.4% of sales in the third quarter, down 160 basis points from the prior year as we drive operational efficiencies while maintaining our investments in our growth brands.
Adjusted operating margin was 42.8% of sales, down 210 basis points relative to the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the negative impact of exchange, the operating margin profile improved 120 basis points versus the prior year. We remain committed to achieving an adjusted operating margin target of greater than 50% of sales by 2020. 
Net interest expense was $250 million in the quarter, and the adjusted tax rate was 19.9% in the quarter.
Third quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding noncash intangible amortization expense and other specified items, was $1.21, up 7.1% year-over-year. 
Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our strong business performance year-to-date and our confidence in our momentum going forward, we are raising our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range to $4.80 to $4.82, reflecting adjusted EPS growth of 12.1% at the midpoint. We are also updating our 2016 GAAP EPS guidance range to $3.74 to $3.76, which includes $1.06 per share of noncash intangible amortization expense and other specified items. 
Regarding the fourth quarter. We expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 to $1.20. This excludes roughly $0.22 of noncash amortization and other specified items. We expect high single-digit operational sales growth with minimal foreign exchange impacts in the quarter.
In closing, we delivered strong performance in the quarter. We've driven strong top and bottom line growth while also advancing our strategic priorities and our pipeline. And as Rick outlined, we're well positioned for strong growth again in 2017 as we expect to deliver low double-digit operational revenue growth and EPS growth of 13% to 15% from the midpoint of our new 2016 guidance range. This level of performance should place us among the industry leaders for both revenue and EPS growth once again next year. And underscoring our confidence in the business going forward, today we announced a 12.3% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable on February 2017. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz."

Maybe you can talk about what you're seeing from your perspective. Obviously, there is some industry concern in the marketplace about structural change to pricing. We saw McKesson announce -- highlight significant moderation in price increases next year, which caused them to lower their guidance. Novo significantly lowered their expectations. Amgen talked about TNF pricing basically going away. From your vantage point, what are you seeing? And maybe you can share with us changes that we should anticipate in our models with respect to net pricing for HUMIRA in the U.S. going forward. Secondly, we appreciate the early commentary and color on 2017 guidance, 13% to 15% earnings growth. However, that is a little bit below consensus. Maybe if you could just step back, you gave us 2020 guidance a couple of years ago. Maybe you could just step back and help us think about the cadence of earnings growth. AbbVie's a different company from the industry average just given the looming competition to HUMIRA. Maybe if you could just help us think about the growth of this company over the next 5 years, how you're thinking about it, how -- what you see relative to the plan that you put out a couple of years ago."

I think as you look at price, certainly, the rhetoric on price has been more intense than we've seen it in a number of years.

I think as you look at price, certainly, the rhetoric on price has been more intense than we've seen it in a number of years. And some of that is driven by the political environment, and some of it's driven by more fundamentals. I think if you look at our business specifically, our business is primarily a volume-driven business. That's not to say we don't benefit at all from price, but clearly, the vast majority of our growth comes from volume. And the key, I think, for our entire industry is to continue to drive innovation. And innovative products in general and innovative pharmaceuticals, I think, in general tend to save the health care system money over time. And I don't know that we've done everything we should do to be able to make sure that we get -- one, get that message out; and two, maybe support that message a little bit better than we have in the past. And so I think that's the key for the industry going forward, and that's the thing that we need to focus our attention on. And if you look at the products that we've been successful with, I think they have a good economic value proposition. HUMIRA's a good example of that as well. And so -- but I'd say, as we look at our planning process, just as we have in previous years, we tend to plan conservatively when it comes to price and then evaluate the market environment at the time that we ultimately get close to that period of time and make a decision around what is the appropriate pricing strategy. And our guidance in 2017 and our long-range plan are both reflective of that philosophy. That philosophy hasn't changed. I think if you look at the 2017 EPS forecast that we gave you, I'd say there's 2 things that -- in the consensus that are important to look at. One is if you looked at consensus, I don't believe everyone has rolled into their model the full year R&D expectation for the BI and the Stemcentrx acquisition. And so obviously, that was not reflected in the overall consensus numbers. The second thing is, if you look at gross margin, the consensus numbers, gross margin profile is off. And we've communicated that a couple of times. And where it's off is trying to calculate what the partnering products contribution will be. And I think if you look at those 2 factors, if you look at the top line, what we're communicating is very close to what the top line is. If you look at our overall operating expenses, certainly, SG&A, R&D's a little bit higher, SG&A's probably a bit lower but, net-net, probably a little bit higher. But the difference that you would see would be in the gross margin profile. The other thing I'd say is if you look at that level of performance, based on everything that we see, it will rank us certainly in the top tier, if not #1. Obviously, we have to see what others report but based on consensus that's out there today, so we're delivering another year of truly outstanding performance. As far as what we communicated to you from the long-range plan back in October, as I said in my formal comments, this is consistent with what we communicated. I'd say we're still on track to be able to deliver what we expected. And in fact, if anything, I'd say HUMIRA's probably ahead. I think there was a lot of surprise when we first communicated the $18 billion for HUMIRA. There's obviously less surprise now to that number based on our overall performance. And so I think we're tracking on what we had communicated. We're absolutely committed to delivering a 50% operating margin by 2020, and that's despite the negative impact that we will see from the partnering products. And we're committed to being able to drive that average compounded growth rate of EPS that we communicated as well as our top line. And we continue to have a lot of confidence in the business going forward. As we look at the pipeline rolling out, the assets in our late-stage pipeline, I think, are continuing to advance in a way that is consistent with what we thought back then. And those assets are starting to roll out now as Venclexta, as an example, gets a broader label. That's going to be a very meaningful contributor to our overall performance. And a number of other programs are continuing to advance. Risankizumab is an example, I think, is ahead of schedule by a significant amount of time. 494 continues to advance very well. And so generally, what I'd say is we're very confident in what our outlook looks like, and it's consistent with what we communicated to you back in October of 2015."

So I'm not going to necessarily give you the absolute color on what our assumption is in 2017 as it relates to price. But I'd say we don't have a consistent view of the TNF market to the one that was described by Amgen. And I think every product obviously has a different perspective in the marketplace. Maybe it's worthwhile to walk through HUMIRA in a little bit of detail because I know there's always a lot of interest in it, and that will give you, I think, a perspective of where we stand overall. I mean, if you step back and you look at where HUMIRA is, take the international market first, HUMIRA continues to perform as we described it despite the fact that we've seen the launch of Enbrel biosimilars in that market now for about 7 or 8 months, I would guess, maybe 9 months, something like that, that they've actually been in the marketplace. They've had a very modest impact. We're delivering mid-single-digit growth as we've described to you. In fact, this quarter, it was about 4.5%. Now the interesting thing is if you adjust for the impact of Venezuela, which will be a onetime impact in 2016, the underlying growth of our international business for HUMIRA is 7.6%. So good, strong growth. It's primarily volume growth because you typically have negative price in those international markets. So I'd say HUMIRA's performing exactly where we would have expected it to perform in the international markets. If you look at the U.S., I mean, U.S. has had just truly outstanding growth. If you look at the past 6 quarters, on average, HUMIRA has averaged about 25% growth. The last 2 quarters, second and third quarter, if you average the 2 of them together, the growth was 21.7%. If you make the adjustment for the ordering patterns that Bill described, third quarter was just over 20% growth. And as Bill indicated, we're forecasting 20% growth again in the fourth quarter. The October weeklies are consistent with that, and we obviously pay a lot of attention to HUMIRA. And so this brand continues to grow extremely well. And the vast majority of that growth is volume. If you look at market share, in the U.S., we continue to perform well. And probably the best way to look at market share would be if you track it at the beginning of 2016 and look at it through the latest data points that we have, which would be September data points, the overall market share for HUMIRA is about 31.8%. It's up 0.6% over that period of time, from January through September. Rheumatology, our share is 26.8%. It's increased a full point over that period of time. Gastro and Durham [ph], our market share remains basically flat at 43% and 35% market share. And so this brand continues to perform extremely well in the marketplace, and it's because of the attributes of this product and how well accepted it is by physicians and by patients. We're continuing to see good market growth. There's an anomaly in the IMS data because a large managed care organization has blinded their data, but it's still in the base. But what I would tell you is that if you look at script growth on HUMIRA, it's above 13% when you make the appropriate adjustments, and the market's growing high single digits, around 9% or so. So prescription growth continues to be extremely robust. And then if you look at our formulary position, we just finished our 2017, 2018 negotiations. We're pleased with how those negotiations sorted themselves out. We basically had the same level of strong market access for HUMIRA that we had in 2016. Net price, which we don't talk about a lot, but what I can tell you is there was only a very minimal, almost no change in net price between the 2016 contracts and the 2017 and '18 contracts. And all other attributes of the contract, like price protection, are consistent, basically consistent with what we've had previously. And so we feel good about our access in the marketplace. And so I think you can expect that HUMIRA's going to continue to perform well. I mean, every brand has its own set of issues that it has to deal with, and I'm certainly not in a position to be able to talk about their brand. But what I am in a position to talk about is how HUMIRA has performed and how we expect it to continue to perform going forward. Price is something that -- as I said, we look at it very carefully every single year, and we make a determination as to what we think is appropriate. And we'll do the exact same thing this year. We typically build in a conservative level of price into our planning assumptions because we don't want to be exposed in any way. And in the information that we provided you thus far, it includes that level of conservative assumptions built into it. As it relates to the comments on the litigation, that's not something I can talk about in a lot of detail. I would have interpreted their comments to be the same as the way you interpreted them. I don't think that's a big surprise. At the end of the day, when you look at the magnitude of our IP portfolio and you look at the risk of launching at risk against that portfolio, that would be a high-risk proposition for anyone. And we made our intentions very clear about we plan to enforce our IP against anyone who attempts to enter the marketplace and that we would -- if someone chose to make a decision to launch at risk, we would seek a PI. And I think the power of our IP, I think, is very clear in the marketplace. So hopefully, that was responsive to your question."

Now that doesn't mean you can't open something up. But at the end of the day, we had completed all of our negotiations at this point for the 2017 and '18 contract periods. My comment on net price was essentially, as you go in and you negotiate for your next contract, typically, there is pressure to take your rebates up, right? So that's -- if you put any price increase and the fall-through of price increase aside, it's what would you increase your rebates by over that period of time? That's what my comment was designed to address, that there was minimal to no change from that perspective, and your price will flow through based on the normal dynamics of how that would occur. And as I said, it was consistent with what we had in place from any levels of price protection in 2016. So it's basically business as usual for us going forward in '17 and '18. As far as indication-based pricing, I mean, I think that's a phenomena that hit -- that originally started in the area of oncology, where you could have an oncolytic agent that had very different activity or efficacy in one type of cancer versus another and is the value proposition the same. If you look at HUMIRA, typically, across the areas that we compete, HUMIRA is typically the gold standard in most of the areas that we compete in. I'd say, generally speaking, we have seen some interest in indication-based pricing and potentially doing that. That's got something good, as I said, I think fits well for HUMIRA because of its broad applicability and its level of performance across the range of indications that it has. But it's certainly something that has been of interest. I don't see that as a fundamental issue in the contracting that we've seen go forward for '17 and '18, at least for HUMIRA."

Could you help me just further categorize the slowing HUMIRA growth given the biosimilar impact that's obviously going to be pretty limited given the geography and limited time that the other TNF biosimilars have been in the market? How much is competition from the IL-17s in the psoriasis class? How much is saturation of indications? And how much is mandatory price reductions outside the U.S.? And I know you've given earnings guidance for next year. I wonder whether you'd like to give revenue guidance for HUMIRA. Second, AbbVie's enjoyed a mutually positive relationship with PBMs. In general, do you anticipate any change between relationships between the PBMs and the pharma industry given the political focus on the PBMs on the lack of transparency as well as the ongoing attorney general investigations? And then finally, for Mike, could you tell us what percentage of patients on IMBRUVICA run into problems with atrial fibrillation or coagulopathy? I'm obviously thinking about future competition from Astra's acalabrutinib."

But broadly, when you look at our assumptions that we had around biosimilars and the underlying growth of the markets, things have been progressing very, very well. So if you look at major markets across Europe, we've got market growing in the low teens, no changes there. And if you look at HUMIRA share, very, very minimal change year-over-year. REMICADE has not -- biosimilar REMICADE has not had a major impact on the brand in any way whatsoever. And Enbrel, as we had told you at the beginning of the year, we anticipated a 2 to 3 percentage growth impact, but that was more or less based on the pricing that we expected the biosimilar to come in at. So the biosimilars have been performing very much in line with our expectations. The new entrants to market, look, it's something we're watching very closely. But the reality is those new entrants tend to get slotted as for patients that are ultimately anti-TNF failures. And so while they are ultimately gaining some traction in the market and they're picking up market share, I don't think you should read that through as a direct erosion to the market share of HUMIRA. Again, in fact, we've got a very, very strong market share position across those markets."

When you say the brand is slowing, I'm not sure whether you're referencing what Bill said in his comments about the prior year inventory levels or you're just looking at, as in the U.S., as I said in my comments a moment ago, we've averaged over 6 quarters about 25%. And the last 2 quarters are more in the 21% range. There's obviously fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter. But if you look at the dollar contribution across those quarters of growth, it's fairly consistent. And there's always ins and outs. But at the end of the day, as the brand gets bigger, the percent growth is going to go down, and the brand has obviously grown significantly across that period of time. If you look at the IL-17s or some of the other brands, as I mentioned, in the market share, our market share in Durham [ph] is roughly flat. Clearly, we have the leadership position in that segment. And I think as we look at the dynamics within that market, just to reinforce what Bill said, it's typically the #2 player that's getting the bulk of any erosion in their market share with the entrance of a new mechanism, like a 17 as an example, because it is usually the second-line failure that they tend to get their market share from. And so HUMIRA has not had as much of a negative impact based on that because we're typically the first TNF that is used in those indications. On the PBMs, obviously, we've got to have good relationships with all of our customers, whether they be managed care organizations or PBMs. They are professional relationships. I think PBMs serve a very important purpose. They obviously allow plans to be able to have formularies that they can help manage. And that's the role that they play, and we play an important role with them. In being able to supply them with products, they can go on those formularies. And so I think it's a typical business relationship. And on IMBRUVICA, I mean, I don't know that we commented specifically about the rates. They're obviously relatively low rates.

I'm wondering if any of the sort of rhetoric and discussion around drug pricing and transparency around drug pricing, does that change your view on the tail for HUMIRA after we have biosimilar entry in whatever year that entry actually occurs in the U.S.? And then my second question. A couple of your key pipeline products are around -- also in the autoimmune oral JAK and your IL-23. I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the dynamics there because there's obviously competitors ahead of you in both of those spaces. You can be entering what appears to be pretty competitive and maybe price-sensitive markets as well, and you will not have the same sort of dominant position that you've enjoyed with HUMIRA.

And that strategy is designed for us to be able to maintain our position going forward. I think it's far enough out in the U.S. that we will have to see how the dynamics play out. I don't anticipate anything significantly changing that strategy based on how we would employ the strategy, based on the debates that we see going on and the market dynamics going on. I'll have Mike maybe talk a little bit about the JAKs and the IL-23s from a performance standpoint. But what I would say from a market standpoint is we have always tried to position that our follow-on products would be significantly differentiated versus others in the marketplace, and we've designed our clinical trials to be able to produce that level of differentiation. And I would expect that, if anything, we would be in a better position, based on our experience and our position in this market, to be able to launch these products successfully into the market as companion products behind what will be a workhorse product like HUMIRA.

And I think each of those assets stands up very well to that understanding of what we'll need to be competitive. With the JAK, for example, that's why we've focused on differentiated efficacy, strong efficacy in very difficult-to-treat patient populations and very, very strong data at the higher level's response, end points like remission, low disease activity, durable, ACR70s and the like. And for risankizumab, it was really the same thought process. We looked at those data, and we believed, based on a very substantial set of clinical trial results, that the efficacy there was truly differentiated. And we can point, for example, to the approximately 50% PASI 100 response for risankizumab in Phase IIb, with very favorable pharmaceutical properties of that agent, very favorable dosing that we believe is attainable in Phase III and in registration. So we're keeping that profile in mind, and we're advancing assets that we believe will be competitive in the future."

Now what we're not saying is that there will be no net price increase next year. We still have, within our contracts, the ability to raise price and see a positive impact on the P&L from those actions. The net price actually has to do with, without any future price increases, which, by the way, that isn't how we're modeling the year, what we would expect price would be on a constant basis without price increases. The contracts allow us to take net price. And any net price increases, any price increase that we took would have a positive impact on our bottom line. That's the way you need to think about it. That said, in 2017, we are planning conservatively, as we always do. We're approaching the 2017 guidance with the exact same philosophy on how we plan for price increases that we have in the past. So hopefully, that helps some. And then from a P&L management standpoint, look, the SG&A ratio, we're very pleased with. It's really a couple different things.

And all of those programs are very, very high ROI, which, as you can see -- as you can imagine, based on the sales growth."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'll discuss our third quarter performance, recent operational highlights, and I'll also share some high-level perspective regarding our growth profile for 2017. Mik",1411,"Thank you, Liz. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'll discuss our third quarter performance, recent operational highlights, and I'll also share some high-level perspective regarding our growth profile for 2017. Mike will then provide updates on our recent advancements across our R&D programs, and Bill will provide additional color on the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of this year. 
2016 is shaping up to be another very strong year, with operational revenue growth year-to-date of nearly 16% and EPS growth through 3 quarters up 14.6%. This follows a very strong 2015, where we delivered operational revenue growth of 22% and EPS growth of 29%. Based on our confidence in the performance of the business going forward, today we'll provide a view of 2017, which will once again demonstrate strong underlying performance.
Our third quarter results were ahead of our expectations, including adjusted earnings per share of $1.21, representing growth of 7.1% versus the third quarter of 2015. Our results included global operational sales growth of 8%, reflecting continued strong performance from our on-market business, led by HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, as well as other products in our portfolio. 
HUMIRA continues to drive robust performance, delivering global operational growth of more than 12% in the quarter. Despite increasing competition from new classes of drugs and indirect biosimilar competition in international markets, HUMIRA continues to demonstrate exceptional performance and durability across the 3 major market segments.
In rheumatology, HUMIRA continues to hold the #1 market share position with year-over-year share gains. In dermatology, we're seeing mid-teens volume growth, and we're maintaining a very strong #1 market share position with a 15-point lead over the #2 competitor. And in GI, we continue to see strong double-digit volume growth. 
Internationally, HUMIRA continues to maintain its strong position despite indirect biosimilar competition, which is tracking in line with our expectations.
We also continue to deliver on our oncology strategy. IMBRUVICA's performance in the quarter was outstanding, with third quarter global revenues to AbbVie of just over $500 million. We're continuing to drive strong uptake in CLL. In the second-line-plus CLL market, we continue to hold the leadership position, with more than 4 of 10 patients starting treatment with IMBRUVICA. And in the front-line setting, our market share position is steadily increasing, with nearly 1 of 5 patients now starting IMBRUVICA as first-line therapy. 
While we're pleased with this performance, we're still in the very early stages of our trajectory in the front-line setting. We're making progress in a number of important comparatives: in combination studies evaluating IMBRUVICA monotherapy; in combination therapy versus regimens such as BR and FCR, often considered the gold standards in the treatment of CLL. These studies are being run in different patient segments, including young and fit patients and the watch-and-wait population. And the results will add significantly to the breadth of data supporting IMBRUVICA and will provide physicians with more evidence of the compelling clinical benefit in the front-line setting. 
Additionally, in other approved indications, including mantle cell lymphoma and Waldenström's, IMBRUVICA holds the market-leading position in the relapsed/refractory segments. In geographies outside the U.S., IMBRUVICA continues to experience strong adoption in Europe and Canada and has recently been launched in several new markets, including Japan.
While CLL clearly represents the largest revenue contributor to IMBRUVICA's growth over our long-range plan, new indications will also augment our performance. To that end, there is potential for several IMBRUVICA regulatory submissions and approvals over the next few years, including relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma, which is currently under regulatory review; chronic graft-versus-host disease, which we expect to submit for approval in the first half of 2017; front-line mantle cell lymphoma, which will add to our existing indication in relapsed/refractory MCL; as well as relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and front-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. For several of these indications, IMBRUVICA will be the only approved treatment, underscoring the importance of this therapy for patients.
Collectively, these new IMBRUVICA indications represent a significant incremental revenue opportunity for AbbVie. Mike will provide an update regarding some upcoming data flow for several of these potential new indications. 
Earlier this year, we received approval for Venclexta monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, who harbor the 17p deletion, a relatively small subset of the refractory patient population. In partnership with Roche/Genentech, we're continuing to make good progress with our launch within this indication, with Venclexta now added to the NCCN Guidelines and continued progress with formulary access. Physicians are gaining experience with the therapy, and we look forward to additional data next year in the broader relapsed/refractory setting. We also saw strong performance from several other products in our on-market portfolio, including Duodopa, Creon and international VIEKIRA.
In addition to our strong financial results, we have continued to advance our late-stage pipeline. Last week, at the ASRM meeting, we presented positive data on Elagolix in endometriosis, including additional results from our 2 pivotal studies. Results from these trials will support our U.S. regulatory application, which is on track for submission in 2017. 
We're nearing the completion of our registrational program for our next-generation HCV combination, which is on track for commercialization next year. Based on the data we've shared to date, we believe our next-generation HCV therapy will address the remaining unmet medical needs within this market, with high SVR rates across genotypes with 8 weeks of therapy.
We're making good progress with the risankizumab program, which is in development in partnership with BI. We recently completed, ahead of schedule, patient enrollment for the pivotal studies in psoriasis, with data from 3 of these trials expected in 2017. We recently launched Zinbryta for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and are in the early stages of our rollout in collaboration with Biogen. And we've also continued to advance assets from the Stemcentrx pipeline. We recently started a basket study evaluating Rova-T in several neuroendocrine tumors where DLL3 is expressed. And we also initiated a regimen selection study for Rova-T in front-line small cell lung cancer.
Based on our performance year-to-date, we're raising our full year 2016 guidance to $4.80 to $4.82 on an adjusted basis, reflecting growth of 12.1% at the midpoint. 
Over the past several months, we received a lot of interest regarding our expectations for 2017. While we're in the midst of our annual planning process, based on the continued strength of the business and especially HUMIRA and IMBRUVICA, we're now at a point where we can provide some high-level direction regarding our top and bottom line growth expectations for 2017. We expect low double-digit operational growth in 2017. 2017 will be another important year of investment in R&D as we expand our leadership position in immunology and hematological oncology and also build our position in solid tumors. 
As a result, we expect EPS growth of roughly 13% to 15% from the midpoint of our new 2016 guidance range. This level of performance positions AbbVie to be among the industry leaders for both revenue and EPS growth once again next year. We'll outline our detailed 2017 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call in January.
Since our inception in 2013, we've delivered strong financial results, and we're well positioned to deliver industry-leading growth again in 2017 for the third consecutive year. We continue to be proud of our strong execution, and we remain committed to our long-term strategic and financial objectives, which we outlined for you in October of 2015.
AbbVie represents a unique investment opportunity, offering both compelling growth along with a strong return of capital to investors, including a rapidly growing dividend. To that end, today we announced our Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly cash dividend of $0.57 per share to $0.64 per share, an increase of over 12%, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2017. We view the dividend as an important aspect of our investment identity and as a sign of our confidence in the business going forward. Since the company's inception in 2013, AbbVie has increased its dividend by more than 60%. 
In summary, the strategy we've put in place puts us in a position to deliver strong top and bottom line performance. We've established growth platforms in some of the largest and most attractive segments, and we've built a compelling pipeline in these areas, which will contribute significantly to our performance in the years to come. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mike for additional comments on our R&D programs. Mike?"

Once again, we had a very productive quarter in R&D, with significant progress across a number of programs. Today, I'll highlight key pipeline events that occurred during the quarter as well as some of our upcoming milestones. 
I'll start with oncology, an area where we are advancing our pipeline in both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. 
Turning our attention to solid tumors. We continue to make good progress with Rova-T. We recently began enrolling patients in 2 new studies, a Phase I 8-arm basket study in a broad set of neuroendocrine tumors and a Phase I/II regimen selection study in front-line small cell lung cancer. We expect to start seeing data from both studies in the second half of next year. The Rova-T program in relapsed/refractory small cell lung cancer is progressing well. We continue to see good results from the ongoing Phase I study, with patients still alive more than 2 years after receiving just 2 doses of Rova-T. 
Enrollment in the TRINITY study, our confirmatory third-line registrational trial in small cell lung cancer, is also going very well. And we expect this study to be fully enrolled within the next month. Data from TRINITY will be available next year, which will trigger the submission of our regulatory dossiers. 
We are also on the cusp of starting 2 additional Rova-T studies: Meru, [ph] the Phase III registrational trial evaluating standard chemotherapy followed by Rova-T in the front-line setting; and the Phase I/II combination study, evaluating Rova-T with Opdivo and with Opdivo and Yervoy in small cell lung cancer. We expect both trials to be up and running by the end of the year.
We're also making good progress with other assets from the Stemcentrx pipeline. In addition to Rova-T, we have 4 assets in the clinic and are on track to transition up to 5 additional programs into the clinic over the next year. This will add to our growing oncology pipeline of more than 35 late preclinical or clinical stage assets.
I'll now turn to our hem/onc programs. In the quarter, we announced our U.S. regulatory submission of a supplemental new drug application for the use of IMBRUVICA in previously treated patients with marginal zone lymphoma, a slow-growing form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, which accounts for roughly 12% of NHL cases. There are currently no approved treatments specifically indicated for patients with marginal zone lymphoma, and we expect a regulatory decision in the first half of 2017. The data that supported this regulatory submission will also be presented at the upcoming ASH meeting in December. 
Additionally, at ASH, we'll present data from the registration-enabling trial in chronic graft-versus-host disease as well as data from several other IMBRUVICA studies across multiple blood cancers, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. 
We've also made significant progress with the development of Venclexta, which was approved earlier this year in the U.S. under priority review for its first indication as monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL with a 17p deletion mutation, a small but medically important segment of the CLL market and an important first step for this exciting new therapy.
Earlier this month, we received Canadian approval for Venclexta in previously treated CLL patients with a 17p deletion mutation as well as in patients with no other treatment options regardless of their mutational status. 
We also received a positive opinion from the European CHMP for the treatment of relapsed/refractory CLL patients with 17p deletion or TP53 mutations. The CHMP also recommended approval of Venclexta for patients who have failed both chemo-immunotherapy and a B-cell inhibitor regardless of mutational status.
Venclexta has demonstrated strong efficacy, driving deep levels of response and durable disease control, both as monotherapy and in combination with RITUXAN in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL. Earlier this year, Venclexta received the FDA's breakthrough therapy designation for use in combination with rituximab for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We're expecting data from the MURANO study in the first half of next year, which will support a broader label in relapsed/refractory CLL. 
The breakthrough designation and the upcoming MURANO data are important milestones for Venclexta that will expand use to the broader relapsed/refractory CLL population. We remain excited about the long-term potential for this molecule and believe that Venclexta will be effective across a range of blood cancers.
We're particularly encouraged by the opportunity in AML as the data generated to date have demonstrated clear signs of efficacy. Earlier this year, Venclexta received its third breakthrough therapy designation for use in combination with hypomethylating agents for the treatment of patients with AML who are ineligible to receive standard induction with high-dose chemotherapy. We're moving quickly with Venclexta's development in AML and expect to begin our Phase III programs by the end of the year.
At the upcoming ASH meeting, we'll also present Venclexta data in a range of tumor types, including Phase I safety and efficacy data in both AML and multiple myeloma, as well as results from the mid-stage CONTRALTO and CAVALLI studies in follicular lymphoma and B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, respectively.
As we look ahead to 2017, there will be several additional key data readouts from our hematologic oncology portfolio that could enable registration of both IMBRUVICA and Venclexta in new indications. 
For IMBRUVICA, there are a number of planned interim analyses that could potentially lead to regulatory filings, including data in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma, front-line diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and in front-line mantle cell lymphoma. And for Venclexta, as I mentioned, we'll see data from the MURANO study, which will support a broader Venclexta label in CLL.
Now I'll move on to our immunology programs, where we continue to make great progress with our 2 late-stage immunology assets, risankizumab and ABT-494. As Rick mentioned, we have fully enrolled the Phase III psoriasis program for risankizumab and will begin to see data from these pivotal studies toward the end of next year. Interest in the psoriasis program has been very strong, as evidenced by the fact that we fully enrolled the 4 Phase III studies in just 7.5 months, well ahead of our planning assumptions. 
The registration trials in Crohn's disease are expected to begin next year. And we also intend to move risankizumab into late-stage studies in both ulcerative colitis and psoriatic arthritis by the end of 2017. The registration-enabling studies for ABT-494 in RA are also progressing very well, and we remain on track for data readouts from these Phase III studies during the first half of 2018.
The development program for ABT-494 in gastrointestinal disorders is also progressing well, with the Phase II study in Crohn's disease ongoing and a Phase II study in ulcerative colitis getting underway in the third quarter. Data from the Crohn's study should be available in the first half of 2017, with Phase III Crohn's study starting later in the year. 
We also recently began a Phase II study to evaluate our oral selective JAK1 inhibitor in atopic dermatitis. 
I'll now move to virology, where we're nearing the completion of our registrational program for our next-generation HCV regimen. This program was designed to investigate a faster path to cure for all genotypes of HCV and to address treatment areas of continued unmet need.
Based on the data we've presented today, our once-daily pan-genotypic regimen is highly effective and has the potential to cure a majority of HCV patients in just 8 weeks. The FDA recently granted breakthrough therapy designation for our next-generation regimen for the treatment of patients with chronic HCV who have failed previous therapy with directly acting antivirals in genotype 1. This designation is an important step in our efforts to bring our pan-genotypic regimen to market.
At the AASLD meeting in November, we'll be presenting pivotal data from our next-generation regimen, including results from 8-week cohorts in non-cirrhotics as well as data in patients who have failed prior DAA-containing regimens.
We expect to submit the NDA for our next-generation HCV regimen to the FDA by the end of this year and file the marketing authorization application with the EMA in the first quarter next year. And we remain on track for commercialization in the U.S. in 2017. We believe that AbbVie's pan-genotypic once-daily ribavirin-free HCV therapy will be competitively positioned and will be able to address the remaining unmet medical need within this market.
Finally, in the area of women's health, we are nearing completion of our Phase III endometriosis program, with regulatory submission planned for 2017. The Elagolix clinical development program includes the largest clinical trials conducted to date in endometriosis, with nearly 1,700 patients in 2 pivotal trials. 
At the ASRM Congress earlier this month, we presented detailed results from 2 pivotal studies, demonstrating that Elagolix reduced menstrual and non-menstrual pelvic pain associated with endometriosis compared to placebo. We also presented research on the economic and health care costs associated with endometriosis and endometriosis-related surgery in women in the United States. These data support AbbVie's continued efforts to pursue a regulatory filing of Elagolix as a potential new treatment option for the most prevalent symptoms of the disease.
In addition to the endometriosis program, we have Phase III studies underway in uterine fibroids. This program is investigating the effect of Elagolix on heavy bleeding related to this highly prevalent condition. We anticipate beginning to see data from this Phase III program late next year. 
So in summary, we are very pleased with the progress of our pipeline and are on track for further advancements in the remainder of 2016 and into 2017. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for additional comments on our third quarter performance. Bill?"

This morning, I'll review our third quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for 2016. 
In the quarter, we delivered strong operational sales growth of 8%, excluding a little more than 0.5% of unfavorable impact from foreign currency. We exceeded our adjusted earnings per share guidance, delivering growth of more than 7% compared to the third quarter of 2015. HUMIRA delivered another quarter of strong sales growth, with global sales of more than $4 billion, up 12.1% operationally. Globally, we continue to see strong volume growth across all therapeutic segments.
In the U.S., HUMIRA sales increased 16.7% compared to the prior year. The growth rate in the quarter was negatively impacted by 4 points due to higher customer ordering patterns in the prior year, a reversal of what we experienced with second quarter growth rates. Normalized for this, HUMIRA performance in the quarter exceeded 20%, comprised of low-teen prescription growth and single-digit price. Wholesaler inventory levels remained below half a month across all periods. 
On a year-to-date basis, HUMIRA U.S. sales growth exceeds 24%. For the fourth quarter, we forecast sales growth in excess of 20%, which will contribute to our full year forecast of above 20%.
International HUMIRA sales were more than $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 4.5% on an operational basis. Biosimilar REMICADE has not had a material impact on performance, and the Enbrel biosimilar continues to perform in line with our previously communicated assumptions. We continue to forecast HUMIRA international operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year. HUMIRA's unique product profile and AbbVie's strong commercial execution has made HUMIRA the #1 prescribed biologic, and we continue to see strong momentum for HUMIRA as market leader around the world.
Global IMBRUVICA net revenues in the third quarter were $501 million, up nearly 65% over prior year, driven by increased penetration in relapsed/refractory CLL and other indications as well as continued uptake in first-line CLL where we launched earlier this year. 
Global VIEKIRA sales in the third quarter were $378 million, down versus the prior year. Our international business delivered operational sales growth of nearly 31% in the quarter, driven by new launches and continued uptake. In the U.S., as we communicated earlier this year, we have seen market share loss and some price erosion due to the entrance of a new competitor in the market.
Global sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, grew 21.4% on an operational basis in the quarter, reflecting robust international growth and a modest level of U.S. sales. We also saw strong operational sales growth in the quarter from Creon, which was up 16.6%.
We are in the early stages of our commercial launches of Venclexta and Zinbryta, which had modest sales impact in the third quarter. We have begun our commercial rollout of Venclexta, with our first priority being to ensure adequate physician training and to give physicians an opportunity to gain experience with a dosing ramp. 
As we've outlined, our initial indication for Venclexta, relapsed/refractory CLL patients with a 17p deletion, represents a fairly small market segment estimated to be roughly $300 million. IMBRUVICA currently holds a strong market leadership position in this segment with well over 50% share. However, Venclexta is an asset that offers significant growth potential over the longer term. In the next several years, we expect to augment our label to address the broader relapsed/refractory CLL patient population, expanded earlier lines of therapy and broadened into other hematologic malignancies. 
The next major milestone for Venclexta will be the submission of data from the MURANO trial to regulatory authorities, which will expand the addressable patient population for Venclexta to all relapsed/refractory CLL patients, a much larger patient population. This will add meaningfully to Venclexta's growth beginning in 2018. 
Additionally, we expect further augmentation of the Venclexta label beginning in 2019, with a potential for first-line data and expansion into additional blood cancers.
In August, we launched Zinbryta in the U.S. The Zinbryta label requires the establishment of an appropriate REMS program. And we are on track with the required physician certification and training. While we're very early in the launch, we're encouraged by the level of physician and patient interest. For example, in the U.S., more than 80% of our high-priority physicians have been certified through the REMS program, enabling them to begin prescribing. Based on the approved labeling, we expect Zinbryta to be used as a third-line agent, offering a unique mechanism of action, compelling efficacy and convenient dosing.
Turning to the P&L profile for the quarter. The adjusted gross margin was 80.7% of sales. On a comparative year-over-year basis, this ratio reflects an adverse impact from foreign exchange of roughly 320 basis points. In addition, the adjusted gross margin reflects 110 basis points of unfavorable impact related to the Pharmacyclics acquisition, including the profit transfer for IMBRUVICA, which is booked as cost of goods sold. Adjusting for these impacts, the gross margin profile improved by approximately 170 basis points versus the prior year.
Adjusted R&D was 16.5% of sales, supporting pipeline opportunities in oncology, immunology, HCV and other areas. 
Adjusted SG&A was 21.4% of sales in the third quarter, down 160 basis points from the prior year as we drive operational efficiencies while maintaining our investments in our growth brands.
Adjusted operating margin was 42.8% of sales, down 210 basis points relative to the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the negative impact of exchange, the operating margin profile improved 120 basis points versus the prior year. We remain committed to achieving an adjusted operating margin target of greater than 50% of sales by 2020. 
Net interest expense was $250 million in the quarter, and the adjusted tax rate was 19.9% in the quarter.
Third quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding noncash intangible amortization expense and other specified items, was $1.21, up 7.1% year-over-year. 
Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of the year. Based on our strong business performance year-to-date and our confidence in our momentum going forward, we are raising our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range to $4.80 to $4.82, reflecting adjusted EPS growth of 12.1% at the midpoint. We are also updating our 2016 GAAP EPS guidance range to $3.74 to $3.76, which includes $1.06 per share of noncash intangible amortization expense and other specified items. 
Regarding the fourth quarter. We expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 to $1.20. This excludes roughly $0.22 of noncash amortization and other specified items. We expect high single-digit operational sales growth with minimal foreign exchange impacts in the quarter.
In closing, we delivered strong performance in the quarter. We've driven strong top and bottom line growth while also advancing our strategic priorities and our pipeline. And as Rick outlined, we're well positioned for strong growth again in 2017 as we expect to deliver low double-digit operational revenue growth and EPS growth of 13% to 15% from the midpoint of our new 2016 guidance range. This level of performance should place us among the industry leaders for both revenue and EPS growth once again next year. And underscoring our confidence in the business going forward, today we announced a 12.3% increase in our quarterly cash dividend, beginning with the dividend payable on February 2017. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Liz."

Maybe you can talk about what you're seeing from your perspective. Obviously, there is some industry concern in the marketplace about structural change to pricing. We saw McKesson announce -- highlight significant moderation in price increases next year, which caused them to lower their guidance. Novo significantly lowered their expectations. Amgen talked about TNF pricing basically going away. From your vantage point, what are you seeing? And maybe you can share with us changes that we should anticipate in our models with respect to net pricing for HUMIRA in the U.S. going forward. Secondly, we appreciate the early commentary and color on 2017 guidance, 13% to 15% earnings growth. However, that is a little bit below consensus. Maybe if you could just step back, you gave us 2020 guidance a couple of years ago. Maybe you could just step back and help us think about the cadence of earnings growth. AbbVie's a different company from the industry average just given the looming competition to HUMIRA. Maybe if you could just help us think about the growth of this company over the next 5 years, how you're thinking about it, how -- what you see relative to the plan that you put out a couple of years ago."

I think as you look at price, certainly, the rhetoric on price has been more intense than we've seen it in a number of years. And some of that is driven by the political environment, and some of it's driven by more fundamentals. I think if you look at our business specifically, our business is primarily a volume-driven business. That's not to say we don't benefit at all from price, but clearly, the vast majority of our growth comes from volume. And the key, I think, for our entire industry is to continue to drive innovation. And innovative products in general and innovative pharmaceuticals, I think, in general tend to save the health care system money over time. And I don't know that we've done everything we should do to be able to make sure that we get -- one, get that message out; and two, maybe support that message a little bit better than we have in the past. And so I think that's the key for the industry going forward, and that's the thing that we need to focus our attention on. And if you look at the products that we've been successful with, I think they have a good economic value proposition. HUMIRA's a good example of that as well. And so -- but I'd say, as we look at our planning process, just as we have in previous years, we tend to plan conservatively when it comes to price and then evaluate the market environment at the time that we ultimately get close to that period of time and make a decision around what is the appropriate pricing strategy. And our guidance in 2017 and our long-range plan are both reflective of that philosophy. That philosophy hasn't changed. I think if you look at the 2017 EPS forecast that we gave you, I'd say there's 2 things that -- in the consensus that are important to look at. One is if you looked at consensus, I don't believe everyone has rolled into their model the full year R&D expectation for the BI and the Stemcentrx acquisition. And so obviously, that was not reflected in the overall consensus numbers. The second thing is, if you look at gross margin, the consensus numbers, gross margin profile is off. And we've communicated that a couple of times. And where it's off is trying to calculate what the partnering products contribution will be. And I think if you look at those 2 factors, if you look at the top line, what we're communicating is very close to what the top line is. If you look at our overall operating expenses, certainly, SG&A, R&D's a little bit higher, SG&A's probably a bit lower but, net-net, probably a little bit higher. But the difference that you would see would be in the gross margin profile. The other thing I'd say is if you look at that level of performance, based on everything that we see, it will rank us certainly in the top tier, if not #1. Obviously, we have to see what others report but based on consensus that's out there today, so we're delivering another year of truly outstanding performance. As far as what we communicated to you from the long-range plan back in October, as I said in my formal comments, this is consistent with what we communicated. I'd say we're still on track to be able to deliver what we expected. And in fact, if anything, I'd say HUMIRA's probably ahead. I think there was a lot of surprise when we first communicated the $18 billion for HUMIRA. There's obviously less surprise now to that number based on our overall performance. And so I think we're tracking on what we had communicated. We're absolutely committed to delivering a 50% operating margin by 2020, and that's despite the negative impact that we will see from the partnering products. And we're committed to being able to drive that average compounded growth rate of EPS that we communicated as well as our top line. And we continue to have a lot of confidence in the business going forward. As we look at the pipeline rolling out, the assets in our late-stage pipeline, I think, are continuing to advance in a way that is consistent with what we thought back then. And those assets are starting to roll out now as Venclexta, as an example, gets a broader label. That's going to be a very meaningful contributor to our overall performance. And a number of other programs are continuing to advance. Risankizumab is an example, I think, is ahead of schedule by a significant amount of time. 494 continues to advance very well. And so generally, what I'd say is we're very confident in what our outlook looks like, and it's consistent with what we communicated to you back in October of 2015."

So I'm not going to necessarily give you the absolute color on what our assumption is in 2017 as it relates to price. But I'd say we don't have a consistent view of the TNF market to the one that was described by Amgen. And I think every product obviously has a different perspective in the marketplace. Maybe it's worthwhile to walk through HUMIRA in a little bit of detail because I know there's always a lot of interest in it, and that will give you, I think, a perspective of where we stand overall. I mean, if you step back and you look at where HUMIRA is, take the international market first, HUMIRA continues to perform as we described it despite the fact that we've seen the launch of Enbrel biosimilars in that market now for about 7 or 8 months, I would guess, maybe 9 months, something like that, that they've actually been in the marketplace. They've had a very modest impact. We're delivering mid-single-digit growth as we've described to you. In fact, this quarter, it was about 4.5%. Now the interesting thing is if you adjust for the impact of Venezuela, which will be a onetime impact in 2016, the underlying growth of our international business for HUMIRA is 7.6%. So good, strong growth. It's primarily volume growth because you typically have negative price in those international markets. So I'd say HUMIRA's performing exactly where we would have expected it to perform in the international markets. If you look at the U.S., I mean, U.S. has had just truly outstanding growth. If you look at the past 6 quarters, on average, HUMIRA has averaged about 25% growth. The last 2 quarters, second and third quarter, if you average the 2 of them together, the growth was 21.7%. If you make the adjustment for the ordering patterns that Bill described, third quarter was just over 20% growth. And as Bill indicated, we're forecasting 20% growth again in the fourth quarter. The October weeklies are consistent with that, and we obviously pay a lot of attention to HUMIRA. And so this brand continues to grow extremely well. And the vast majority of that growth is volume. If you look at market share, in the U.S., we continue to perform well. And probably the best way to look at market share would be if you track it at the beginning of 2016 and look at it through the latest data points that we have, which would be September data points, the overall market share for HUMIRA is about 31.8%. It's up 0.6% over that period of time, from January through September. Rheumatology, our share is 26.8%. It's increased a full point over that period of time. Gastro and Durham [ph], our market share remains basically flat at 43% and 35% market share. And so this brand continues to perform extremely well in the marketplace, and it's because of the attributes of this product and how well accepted it is by physicians and by patients. We're continuing to see good market growth. There's an anomaly in the IMS data because a large managed care organization has blinded their data, but it's still in the base. But what I would tell you is that if you look at script growth on HUMIRA, it's above 13% when you make the appropriate adjustments, and the market's growing high single digits, around 9% or so. So prescription growth continues to be extremely robust. And then if you look at our formulary position, we just finished our 2017, 2018 negotiations. We're pleased with how those negotiations sorted themselves out. We basically had the same level of strong market access for HUMIRA that we had in 2016. Net price, which we don't talk about a lot, but what I can tell you is there was only a very minimal, almost no change in net price between the 2016 contracts and the 2017 and '18 contracts. And all other attributes of the contract, like price protection, are consistent, basically consistent with what we've had previously. And so we feel good about our access in the marketplace. And so I think you can expect that HUMIRA's going to continue to perform well. I mean, every brand has its own set of issues that it has to deal with, and I'm certainly not in a position to be able to talk about their brand. But what I am in a position to talk about is how HUMIRA has performed and how we expect it to continue to perform going forward. Price is something that -- as I said, we look at it very carefully every single year, and we make a determination as to what we think is appropriate. And we'll do the exact same thing this year. We typically build in a conservative level of price into our planning assumptions because we don't want to be exposed in any way. And in the information that we provided you thus far, it includes that level of conservative assumptions built into it. As it relates to the comments on the litigation, that's not something I can talk about in a lot of detail. I would have interpreted their comments to be the same as the way you interpreted them. I don't think that's a big surprise. At the end of the day, when you look at the magnitude of our IP portfolio and you look at the risk of launching at risk against that portfolio, that would be a high-risk proposition for anyone. And we made our intentions very clear about we plan to enforce our IP against anyone who attempts to enter the marketplace and that we would -- if someone chose to make a decision to launch at risk, we would seek a PI. And I think the power of our IP, I think, is very clear in the marketplace. So hopefully, that was responsive to your question."

Now that doesn't mean you can't open something up. But at the end of the day, we had completed all of our negotiations at this point for the 2017 and '18 contract periods. My comment on net price was essentially, as you go in and you negotiate for your next contract, typically, there is pressure to take your rebates up, right? So that's -- if you put any price increase and the fall-through of price increase aside, it's what would you increase your rebates by over that period of time? That's what my comment was designed to address, that there was minimal to no change from that perspective, and your price will flow through based on the normal dynamics of how that would occur. And as I said, it was consistent with what we had in place from any levels of price protection in 2016. So it's basically business as usual for us going forward in '17 and '18. As far as indication-based pricing, I mean, I think that's a phenomena that hit -- that originally started in the area of oncology, where you could have an oncolytic agent that had very different activity or efficacy in one type of cancer versus another and is the value proposition the same. If you look at HUMIRA, typically, across the areas that we compete, HUMIRA is typically the gold standard in most of the areas that we compete in. I'd say, generally speaking, we have seen some interest in indication-based pricing and potentially doing that. That's got something good, as I said, I think fits well for HUMIRA because of its broad applicability and its level of performance across the range of indications that it has. But it's certainly something that has been of interest. I don't see that as a fundamental issue in the contracting that we've seen go forward for '17 and '18, at least for HUMIRA."

Could you help me just further categorize the slowing HUMIRA growth given the biosimilar impact that's obviously going to be pretty limited given the geography and limited time that the other TNF biosimilars have been in the market?

And I know you've given earnings guidance for next year. I wonder whether you'd like to give revenue guidance for HUMIRA. Second, AbbVie's enjoyed a mutually positive relationship with PBMs. In general, do you anticipate any change between relationships between the PBMs and the pharma industry given the political focus on the PBMs on the lack of transparency as well as the ongoing attorney general investigations? And then finally, for Mike, could you tell us what percentage of patients on IMBRUVICA run into problems with atrial fibrillation or coagulopathy?

But broadly, when you look at our assumptions that we had around biosimilars and the underlying growth of the markets, things have been progressing very, very well. So if you look at major markets across Europe, we've got market growing in the low teens, no changes there. And if you look at HUMIRA share, very, very minimal change year-over-year. REMICADE has not -- biosimilar REMICADE has not had a major impact on the brand in any way whatsoever. And Enbrel, as we had told you at the beginning of the year, we anticipated a 2 to 3 percentage growth impact, but that was more or less based on the pricing that we expected the biosimilar to come in at. So the biosimilars have been performing very much in line with our expectations. The new entrants to market, look, it's something we're watching very closely. But the reality is those new entrants tend to get slotted as for patients that are ultimately anti-TNF failures. And so while they are ultimately gaining some traction in the market and they're picking up market share, I don't think you should read that through as a direct erosion to the market share of HUMIRA. Again, in fact, we've got a very, very strong market share position across those markets."

When you say the brand is slowing, I'm not sure whether you're referencing what Bill said in his comments about the prior year inventory levels or you're just looking at, as in the U.S., as I said in my comments a moment ago, we've averaged over 6 quarters about 25%. And the last 2 quarters are more in the 21% range. There's obviously fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter. But if you look at the dollar contribution across those quarters of growth, it's fairly consistent. And there's always ins and outs. But at the end of the day, as the brand gets bigger, the percent growth is going to go down, and the brand has obviously grown significantly across that period of time. If you look at the IL-17s or some of the other brands, as I mentioned, in the market share, our market share in Durham [ph] is roughly flat. Clearly, we have the leadership position in that segment. And I think as we look at the dynamics within that market, just to reinforce what Bill said, it's typically the #2 player that's getting the bulk of any erosion in their market share with the entrance of a new mechanism, like a 17 as an example, because it is usually the second-line failure that they tend to get their market share from. And so HUMIRA has not had as much of a negative impact based on that because we're typically the first TNF that is used in those indications. On the PBMs, obviously, we've got to have good relationships with all of our customers, whether they be managed care organizations or PBMs. They are professional relationships. I think PBMs serve a very important purpose. They obviously allow plans to be able to have formularies that they can help manage. And that's the role that they play, and we play an important role with them. In being able to supply them with products, they can go on those formularies. And so I think it's a typical business relationship. And on IMBRUVICA, I mean, I don't know that we commented specifically about the rates. They're obviously relatively low rates.

And for bleeding events, we're seeing bleeding events in about that same range of patients. And again, there's a background rate in the population. With bleeding, most of the episodes of major bleeding that we've seen in our clinical trial program had generally been associated with other precipitants, so trauma or other events that might be associated with bleeding. And again, there's a background rate there as well."

You've talked obviously kind of how you see things relative to the longer-term guidance you gave last year. I just had a question more on the longer term because I think there's been a lot of expectation that once there is biosimilar HUMIRA available in the U.S., because it's under a relationship share with the PBMs, that the erosion of HUMIRA may be relatively slow. I'm wondering if any of the sort of rhetoric and discussion around drug pricing and transparency around drug pricing, does that change your view on the tail for HUMIRA after we have biosimilar entry in whatever year that entry actually occurs in the U.S.? And then my second question. A couple of your key pipeline products are around -- also in the autoimmune oral JAK and your IL-23. I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the dynamics there because there's obviously competitors ahead of you in both of those spaces. You can be entering what appears to be pretty competitive and maybe price-sensitive markets as well, and you will not have the same sort of dominant position that you've enjoyed with HUMIRA. So how do you think about the opportunity to get into those markets, coming behind competitors, with price again being a potential issue?"

And that strategy is designed for us to be able to maintain our position going forward. I think it's far enough out in the U.S. that we will have to see how the dynamics play out. I don't anticipate anything significantly changing that strategy based on how we would employ the strategy, based on the debates that we see going on and the market dynamics going on. I'll have Mike maybe talk a little bit about the JAKs and the IL-23s from a performance standpoint. But what I would say from a market standpoint is we have always tried to position that our follow-on products would be significantly differentiated versus others in the marketplace, and we've designed our clinical trials to be able to produce that level of differentiation. And I would expect that, if anything, we would be in a better position, based on our experience and our position in this market, to be able to launch these products successfully into the market as companion products behind what will be a workhorse product like HUMIRA. We still anticipate that HUMIRA will be the workhorse product that will handle the vast majority of the volume, particularly in the beginning. And these products will fit into different segments going forward in a complementary way. And I think that gives us an advantage, not a disadvantage, in the marketplace. Mike?"

And I think each of those assets stands up very well to that understanding of what we'll need to be competitive. With the JAK, for example, that's why we've focused on differentiated efficacy, strong efficacy in very difficult-to-treat patient populations and very, very strong data at the higher level's response, end points like remission, low disease activity, durable, ACR70s and the like. And for risankizumab, it was really the same thought process. We looked at those data, and we believed, based on a very substantial set of clinical trial results, that the efficacy there was truly differentiated. And we can point, for example, to the approximately 50% PASI 100 response for risankizumab in Phase IIb, with very favorable pharmaceutical properties of that agent, very favorable dosing that we believe is attainable in Phase III and in registration. So we're keeping that profile in mind, and we're advancing assets that we believe will be competitive in the future."

The duration of therapy, I think we've communicated historically, has been in the area of about 75% of the clinical trial experience. I haven't seen the data in the last couple of months. But I think in first-line, it's consistent with that, and it has been increasing slightly in the relapsed/refractory area. But it's certainly at a very respectable level and certainly isn't anything that we're concerned about at all. I mean, it's certainly in a level that we would expect it to be going forward. And so I think the adoption of IMBRUVICA in that first-line, I think it's -- the speed of adoption in that first-line is an indication of the power of the data that we've seen in RESONATE-2 and physicians' receptivity to that data, both from a PFS and an overall survival standpoint. That's really what's driving a lot of the usage of this product.

But really, at the end of the day, when we look at the brand and we look at the dynamics around the brand and we look at the prior year destock that we saw in the second quarter and the subsequent restock in the third quarter, there is nothing that is alarming us about this third quarter. You have to remember that our second quarter results had 26.7% growth. That was largely related -- that difference from the 20% was largely related to a destocking event in the second quarter of 2015.

So each of these 8 arms is going to look for a response rate in refractory patients with those tumors. And when we see a response rate that we view as indicative of good activity, we would then have the ability to expand out both those cohorts and start additional studies that could be registration-enabling, following the same conceptual strategy that we did with Rova-T in small cell. Of course, the nature of what each registrational program would look like would be tailored to the individual tumor type.

Now what we're not saying is that there will be no net price increase next year. We still have, within our contracts, the ability to raise price and see a positive impact on the P&L from those actions. The net price actually has to do with, without any future price increases, which, by the way, that isn't how we're modeling the year, what we would expect price would be on a constant basis without price increases. The contracts allow us to take net price. And any net price increases, any price increase that we took would have a positive impact on our bottom line. That's the way you need to think about it. That said, in 2017, we are planning conservatively, as we always do. We're approaching the 2017 guidance with the exact same philosophy on how we plan for price increases that we have in the past. So hopefully, that helps some. And then from a P&L management standpoint, look, the SG&A ratio, we're very pleased with. It's really a couple different things. There is a leverage impact from the rapidly growing top line that obviously we've been putting -- delivering over the last few quarters. That said, we look at our spend. We're looking at admin very, very closely. We're looking at the productivity of all of our SG&A investments, as you would expect us to, and we fund projects based on an ROI and a return.
