Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. 
Turning to Slide 3, today, we announced a quarterly loss and annual results that were significantly below prior years. Pat will walk you through the financial details but prior to that, I would like to provide a few thoughts. In 2015, we delivered strong underlying operating results. We had one of our best years in personal safety, process safety and environmental performance. On most measures, we either matched 2014's record low or set new lows in 2015. The downstream business produced strong financial performance, underpinned by one of the best years ever in terms of facility utilization and reliability. In upstream, we grew production by 2%, within the guidance we provided a year ago. Additionally, we logged a 5-year reserve replacement ratio of 113%. Despite the strong operating results and oversupplied market led prices to fall to levels not seen since 2014. As expected, our financial results suffered. Across the corporation, we are responding to this low price environment. Our priorities remain completing projects under construction and reducing spend of both operating expense and capital to levels consistent with current conditions. We'll also continue to divest assets where we can obtain a good value. Our #1 financial priority is to maintain and grow the dividend. We have a strong balance sheet for precisely transition times like this. Pat will now take you through our financial results."

Thanks, John. I will be presenting 3 slides on our financial results. Additional earnings and production variance slides along with the tabulation of special items are available in the Appendix section of the presentation on our website. 
Turning now to Slide 4, an overview of our financial performance. The company's fourth quarter loss was $588 million or $0.31 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange, impairments and other special items, earnings for the quarter totaled $491 million or $0.26 per share. For the year, earnings were $4.6 billion or $5.6 billion, excluding special items and foreign exchange. Return on capital employed was 2.5%, and our debt ratio at year-end was approximately 20%. During the fourth quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends, bringing our total for the year to $8 billion or $4.28 per share. 2015 was the 28th consecutive year of annual per share dividend increases. 
Turning to Slide 5. Cash generated from operations was $4.6 billion during the quarter and $19.5 billion for the full year. Fourth quarter cash flow declined because of lower commodity prices and lower downstream margins. Proceeds from asset sales for 2015 were $5.7 billion, bringing our 2-year total to more than $11 billion. Cash capital expenditures were $7.4 billion for the quarter and $29.5 billion for the full year. At year-end, our cash and cash equivalents totaled more than $11 billion. During 2015, we borrowed approximately $11 billion and at year-end, our net debt stood at $27 billion, resulting in a net debt ratio of approximately 15%. 
Slide 6 compares 2015 full year earnings with 2014. Earnings for 2015 were $4.6 billion or approximately $14.7 billion lower than the 2014 result. Special items such as asset impairment, project suspensions and other surcharges along with lower gains on asset sales reduced earnings between periods by $3.1 billion, while the change in foreign exchange impacts increased earnings by approximately $300 million. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased $14.6 billion between periods as lower realizations were only slightly offset by higher liftings, lower operating costs and other items. Downstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by $2.3 billion, primarily due to higher margins. The variance in the other segments primarily reflect lower tax items. I'd like to now turn it back to John."

During 2015, total spend was down approximately $9 billion or more than 12%. Capital outlays alone were down $6 billion. Part of this reduction was long scheduled as in-progress major capital projects were completed and outlays ramp down. In addition, capital expenditure savings were achieved because of deliberate choices being made to reprioritize and replace investments and by challenging supply chain costs. Operating expenses also declined between years. The largest impact occurred in our upstream and corporate segments, reflecting purposeful initiative to rationalize headcount and boost workflow efficiencies. In upstream, declining costs and growing production led to a lower operating cost per barrel, which is expected to exceed 10% when the final results are reported in our 10-K. 
Looking to 2016, we expect to see additional spend reduction in the range of 13% to 18% as the full year run rate effects of many of the 2015 initiatives come to bear and incremental cost-saving projects are implemented. 
Turning to Slide 8. Our investment priorities remain consistent. We will fund investments to ensure safe, reliable operations, complete the projects already under construction, enable investment in high-return short-cycle opportunities and preserve options for viable long-cycle projects. 
In December, we announced the 2016 capital program of $26.6 billion, which was within the guidance range provided on our third quarter earnings call. Since then, market conditions have deteriorated, and we will be responsive. Flexibility in our capital programs allows discretionary spend with a likely outcome for 2016 being near the bottom of our guidance range. 
Looking beyond 2016, our flexibility will continue to increase, and we expect further reductions in our capital program. 
Turning to Slide 9. Divestitures are a normal part of our portfolio. We will divest assets that no longer have a strategic fit or do not compete for capital with our other investment alternatives. Our asset sales program has been successful as well-timed transactions capture good value and generated $11.5 billion in cash through the end of 2015. Over 2016 and '17, we are targeting another $5 billion to $10 billion in investments. Publicly known in-progress transactions include New Zealand and South Africa downstream businesses, the Hawaii refinery, upstream and pipeline assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and gas storage assets in Canada. Additional opportunities are being pursued and will be disclosed in due course when commercial sensitivities permit. In all cases, we will only sell assets where we can realize fair value. 
Turning to Slide 10. In 2015, we grew annual production by 2%. Ramp-ups at major capital projects, including Jack/St. Malo and Tubular Bells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Bibiyana expansion in Bangladesh along with the shale and tight production growth of approximately 30%, contributed to increased volumes. Additionally, current prices benefited production through PSC and other entitlement effects. Offsetting to increase this was the effect of a shut-in of the Partition Zone production, the impact of asset sales and a base decline of less than 2%. For 2016, production guidance is a range is flat to 4% growth. The uncertainty is a reflection of market conditions, current activities and divestment. To clarify, production from the Partition Zone remain shut in. The exact timing of production restart is unknown and dependent on dispute resolutions between sovereign states. Contribution from major capital project start-ups and ramp-ups will be significant in 2016, and small movements in timing or the pace of ramp-ups can make a significant difference in annual production. Uncertainty and exact timing and precise composition of asset divestments will be another variable because we are value driven on all sales. 
Finally, current market conditions will create impacts related to PSC and other pricing-related entitlement effects. Additionally, low prices will restrict our overall spend levels, which in turn, will result in somewhat higher base decline rates. 
Turning to Slide 11. Our reserve replacement in 2015 was 107%. We saw significant adds in our shale and tight assets, which reflects strong well performance results and new geologic data in these place. Additional volumes were booked based upon development drilling results at Wheatstone. Strong base business performance resulted in positive reserve revisions including Tengiz, Thailand, Nigeria and the Gulf of Mexico. Commodity price impact benefited entitlement volumes for profit-sharing and the variable royalty contracts. Our 5-year reserve replacement ratio is 113%. 
Now let's talk about progress on our major capital projects starting with Gorgon. Turning to Slide 12, at Gorgon, system commissioning from Train 1 in in the final stages with key process units starting up, a cooldown cargo delivered and systems calling underway. The first LNG production is expected within the next few weeks with first cargo anticipated soon after that. We will be ramping up Train 1 in the months ahead. Gas for Train 1 startup will come from wells. These wells have been successfully flow tested, and initial performance indications look good. 
On Trains 2 and 3, all modules have been delivered to site, and construction is progressing. from Train 1 are being applied in key milestones have been achieved on schedule, with start-ups expected at approximately 6-month intervals after Train 1. 
Turning to Wheatstone on Slide 13. On the upstream portion of the project, hookup and commissioning of the offshore platform is progressing. The trunk line is ready for service, and final tie in work is ongoing. 6 of 9 wells are drilled and completed offering sufficient well capacity for the first train. At the plant site, the operations center and LNG loading jetty is complete and APAC Hydro testing is ongoing. As previously communicated, initial module fabrication in Malaysia was delayed. We were successful in mitigating further delays, and all modules required for Train 1 are now on site. Piping and cabling work is ongoing. The pace of this work will determine critical path towards first LNG, which is expected to be mid-year 2017. Train 2 modules are underway and on track. 
Turning to Slide 15. I've just run through the steps we've already taken to improve our financial results and to be responsive to current market conditions. on the elements we control, operating expenses, capital outlays and project execution, you can expect even more improvements in 2016. However, price remains a significant uncertainty. I'll come back to that in just a minute. What I would like to talk about is on a project that we have -- that are also contributing to our performance. If you look at the chart on Page 14, you'll see that we have significant progress on new projects. We have the Lianzi and Moho Nord, which came on in the fourth quarter; Chuandongbei, the first time for Chuandongbei to come online; and here in January of 2016, we're seeing progress on Angola LNG as recommissioning is underway. We expect introduce gas to the plant later this quarter and have first LNG cargo in the second quarter. Mafumeira Sul in Angola, Banff in Indonesia and in the North Sea are also progressing towards expected start-up later in the year. I mentioned that the price is a very significant uncertainty to us going forward. 
If you look at Slide 15, you'll see a chart that was put together by Wood Mac. This obviously represents a significant source of uncertainty in cash flows going forward. But consistent with many of you, we believe demand will continue to grow. The larger wildcard of uncertainty, if you will, is supply. Non-OPEC liquids production, which is shown on this chart, remain much more resilient in 2015 that most predicted. With a significant contraction in global investment cost by low prices, the world with the supplies drop off. Wood Mac shows that growing this year thereby pushing the oil market into better balance. Until that balance occurs, prices will continue to be constrained, and the financial damage to the energy sector seen in 2015 will continue. Relative to balance sheet strength and growing flexibility on our spend, Chevron will be advantage relative to the others in this industry as prices rebound. We are well positioned to benefit when the market does balance and prices begin to rise because of the leverage that we have and our growing production profile. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. [Operator Instructions] We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. So Jonathan, please open up the lines."

On the third quarter call, you build out a bridge to cover the dividend with free cash flow by 2017, which looked fairly reasonable on the $50 or so environment, and you highlight the flexibility for 2016 in the slide. So, I guess, I was wondering as we're looking out into 2017 if we're sub-$50, how low can you realistically go with additional CapEx and OpEx cuts before you feel like you might need asset sales or the balance sheet to bridge the gap? Is there a level of CapEx that don't want to go below?"

The level of spend -- if we continue to see the kinds of prices that we're seeing now, the cost of goods and services will continue to decline. We've got the impact of foreign exchange rates, et cetera. The biggest change between what we'll spend this year and next year is really the ramp-down from major capital projects. So for example, this year, we'll be spending about $6 billion on LNG projects around the world. Obviously, finishing Angola LNG and then as we wind down Gorgon and have little more spend on Wheatstone, we expect next year that spend will be under $2 billion. So you've gained $4 billion right there, and then our flexible the growth as time goes by. We all have to invest to keep our operations reliable. We will still have some projects that are under construction and being completed and additional commitments in drilling off of platforms and things of that sort. But I think our flexibility is significant. We gave you a range of $20 billion to $24 billion, but we're going to continue to drive that number down. I guess, my overall message is that we're going to continue to live within our means that we have, and that obviously makes sense to finish the projects under construction. We have a strong balance sheet. And maybe I'll offer a couple of comments in that area because a lot of people ask. I've given the priority as being in growing the dividend and in order to do that, obviously, you do have to invest in the business because we are a depleting resource business. So those are always the first 2 priorities that we have, consistent with good economics on spending. We've indicated that we're in a long-cycle business. And in such a long cycle business where you can have ups and downs in the commodity markets and you get started on long cycle projects, you need a strong balance sheet. And so we have always advertise that and indicated that a AA rating was what we were looking for. And that is what's really indicative of meeting to have a strong balance sheet. But the reason you keep a strong balance sheet is so you can withstand the ups and downs of the business. And right now, we're in the downs with prices low and so we'll use our balance sheet this year. Almost regardless of where prices are during the year. And we're going to cut costs. We're going to produce spend where we can, and that flexibility grows in time. We work very closely with the rating agencies. We talk to our rating agencies. They see our internal forecast around our business. They see more than you do, in other words, and so we'll be very clear where our priorities are, where the visibility is. And then they have to do their job. But we think that we will retain a very strong balance sheet and the ability to withstand the ups and downs."

And really, it pertains to the big LNG projects and the projects that are under construction. So we're going to continue to work spend down, and there's always a little bit more flexibility. There's the uncertainty of exchange rate and things of that nature, but I don't want to flag a significant reduction below the range, below the 26 6 million that's in our budget and below the range that we talked about. Because I don't want to shut in all rigs around the world, for example. There obviously are things that you could do, but I don't think of a proper thing to do given our expectations going forward. For example, we've done terrific work in the Permian Basin to get our costs down. And we want to keep that momentum going. So we have 6 operated rigs. There are 14 nonoperated rigs. We want to continue that activity. Our group has done a terrific job of getting cost down. And obviously, at $30, every business is stressed, but we think that supply is going to be needed, and we want to continue the activity that we have there and to continue to drive down cost that want to continue that activity. So there's a little bit more room, but I don't want to flag something outside that range. Maybe I'll let  -- I offer some comments on sort of the philosophy. Maybe I'll let Pat talk about interaction with the rating agencies and our view on what sort of minimum requirement might be."

They've indicated that many of the companies are up for review. I am certain that Chevron will be in that queue right after the first tiering go through. So if a downgrade does occur and, I think they've been moving in that direction, but if that were to occur, we would not be -- the only one that would happen to. I don't see it materially impacting our cost of funds or materially impacting our ability to secure financing. And in terms of the minimum, I guess, I don't think of it that way. We have a strong balance sheet even after were to be a downgrade. We have a very strong balance sheet, amongst the strongest in the industry. And we've already committed and said multiple times that we are going to get balanced. We will live within our cash flow. And I think that is the profile we put forward to the rating agencies."

The world's going to need deepwater oil. It's a significant resources over time, those barrels are going to be needed. Now right now, the cost in the deepwater haven't come down quite as fast as they have on sure. We obviously have seen some rig rate reductions, but in general, as we get to deeper and deeper water, some projects are challenged. We have mentioned last year in our Analyst Meeting that we thought it would take larger key accumulations to make some of these deepwater projects successful. So the process numbers are being worked, but you're going to the bigger key relations and larger hubs in order to justify the infrastructure and then tiebacks similarly will be somewhat higher prices. We have some special charges in the fourth quarter and $0.5 billion was right now is. And that's a project that we fought would go forward. First, we thought it might have the potential to be a hub and then we thought it might have the potential to be a tiebacks or can I won't say that, that project at have gone forward and that it would it be minimum thresholds depending upon your forward view of prices. But relative to our alternatives, we felt that for the foreseeable future, we got better places to put our money. And so we made a very difficult position to not go forward with that project. And so the clock was ticking where it's going to require $2 billion of investments over the next 3 years so we just felt that over the next few years, we are going to have a better place to put our money, notably the Permian. And so it's -- the art of choices being made. Now we have a good position. We've have been successful as anyone. And we have been successful in driving cost down. We've seen -- I mean, really unbelievable progress last year. We had a 30% reduction in days per 10,000 feet in '15 versus '14. So our experience in the Lower tertiary, in particular, we're getting better and better at understanding and driving cost down. We're encouraged by what we've got anchor. We've got some appraisal work that's undergoing there. We've got another potential hub development within a group of fields that we had put together with a couple of quarters and industry to trying to create a hub class development.

I will probably give you -- we'll give you a more complete answer when we get to March where we have a chance to read through it. But I wish is if you look at growth not just through '17 but through '18, we feel pretty good about it and that's largely in front of the products we haven't quite in 2018, you'll have a full year of production obviously from our big LNG projects, which you won't have in '17. We also have other projects that remain under construction now that will come during that period, projects like key in Canada and Big Foot and others that will come on in that window. So we'll have continuing momentum from those projects, and we'll be ramping up our shale activity during that. It's notably in the Permian. So I think the profile will be attractive beyond 2017. Now ultimately, the cumulative effect of the reduction in capital, if they persist at a low level will be filled. But I think we'll have a little more resilient than people think. Now that sort of things being equal depending upon where prices are, depending upon positive and things of that sort, both in terms of what sort of spend do you need to sustain production and definitely, that will be a function of a lot of things, notably the cost environment that we see. I do think that our position in the Permian gives us a little bit of an advantage over others during this period because you've seen some of the numbers we've given you. Previously, we have the capability to ramp that up and mitigate some of the declines. So even if we see a slight increase in our base decline, which has been tracking at under 2%, even if that goes up a little bit, we should be able to substantially mitigate a lot of that through the productivity that we have in the shale. But we'll try to give you a little more -- a little longer term outlook our upcoming Meeting in March, if that's okay."

That's just a function of contracts and the competitive environment overseas. So one, we'll be working that's very hard. We'll be working additional efficiencies. Just as an example, our -- we have -- we still have reorganizations in flight. So our employee count was down about 3,200 between the end of '14 to the end of '15. There are another 4,000 coming this year, and a lot of that work is ongoing right now. So we're being careful. We're pretty thoughtful about the way we do this sort of work to make sure that we keep the right people in our organization for the longer-term. But the reality is activity is likely to be lower, and we do have a number of projects that will be ramping down, and that we're going to work to be fair about how we do that so that we keep a lot of the great talent that we have that's been working around the world. But there's no question. We're looking at organizations and have a number of reorganizations in flight. Our desire is to keep moving that. But I would say on a dollar basis, when you're growing production and bringing on the asset, you have operating expense that you will incur. That's why we gave you the unit OpEx number. But we drove that one down. There's still some final allocations for what goes into the 10-K in the oil and gas disclosure but it's down over $2 a barrel. And I think that general trend, we're going to continue to drive that number down. Remember in our OpEx, 40% of our OpEx is downstream. And our downstream has record performance this year and, as you know, they've had restructuring underway for some time. And it's not that they're immune from some of the efforts we have to produce cost, but I don't think you'll see a structural shift in our downstream cost.

A lot of people left the payroll in December, and so those benefits will be found in the ongoing work that I described in the upstream. So my message is driving it hard.

From a strategic point of view, there are some opportunities out there that will be tough to execute. And if we can't execute them, we won't sell them. If you look at the kinds of things we have sold, we've gotten very good value. So for example, the last 2 years, there was a lot of strength in infrastructure market, selling pipelines for example. And on strategy grounds, valuation grounds, we felt that we were going to limit our investment in the pipeline business to those that are critical to upstream and downstream sector and we can sell those, things like Caltex Australia. We thought values were very strong and assets -- we've been very well-aligned with them, but that they were heading off potential to be the growth direction, and we felt that from our strategic point of view that it might be best exit when we did.

But I mean anything we haven't taken out FID, you have some flexibility to go back to the providers of those services. And that's why we delayed our costs.

But to part of it is also the major that we can capture the cost reductions that are available -- that might be available in the marketplace. And sometimes, you have to just say we're not going to do that if we don't get better cost and that tends to focus partners and others. And so we expect that the declining break even as a result of those initiatives both the reframe project in some cases or to try to drive costs out. In terms of what we've got actually plant, most of the effort -- most of the things that we would call FIDs, I really think like infield drilling so for example, the next phase of drilling at the next stage of drilling in Jack/St. Malo, which are utilizing existing rigs and drilling off of existing -- to support existing infrastructure. In terms of big, new greenfield projects, it's relatively few. There are some that could be in the budget, but it's going to depend on that price cost balance I've been talking about.

You're right, it is very tough times. The couple of thoughts that I'll give you. One, I think the cost reduction but we're going after, most of them will be permanent. For example, the efficiency that we've guided our drilling, those are permanent regardless of what happens to rig rates going forward to what it is a Deepwater that I talked about earlier for not. So that's number one. Number two, I think the benefits that we're taking on at some of our organization to some of our structures, I think a lot of that will be permanent. And I think we've undervalued what simplicity org structures can provide. So obviously, we think announced some players. We've got rolling with organizations that are being implemented around the world, and I think that diversity and clarity will be a positive for the business. In terms of resource capture, there are better opportunities today than there might have been a year ago. And the balance between what I'll say the expectations and a value of resource is getting better aligned. So there are opportunities emerging. I meet our priority, is obviously things I talked about this morning. But we are in a resource business, and you do want to be attentive to the opportunities that are out there."

Our base today has been cut because we operated very reliably, and it's gotten quite efficient in our business. And so we have been able to mitigate the declines. We've also flagged those with a lower level of spending and base business, infield drilling in places like Bakers Field and elsewhere, you are going to see declined slightly higher. So that's why we suggest that, and we do expect to see that across the industry. The history has shown given downturns like this, you can see an increase of a percent or 2 industry-wide in that base decline. So that is -- I think that's clear. In terms of the resiliency that we've seen in production, it's partly related to that, but to me, it's been -- if you look at 2015, the impact of projects that were in flight has probably been more than we as an industry anticipated. So we're not the only ones with Jack/St. Malos and Bibiyanas and other projects that are under construction better that are coming up. Second of course, you've had the impact of hedges and the unconventional business and the brief update that took place in the middle of 2015 in prices did allow additional hedges. So you've still got a few hedges that are out there in the industry in 2016 that will allow some level of activity. But increasingly, all that's wearing off as the projects come online, as base business declined start to take over and as hedges are no longer available. And so I think that's why you're seeing those volumes. The other piece that I've consistently said has been underrepresented is the stress around the world, the stress on governments, the stress on those government partners, national oil companies and others. And you've seen announcements that have been made because while we tend to think of living within our means as a function of forward capital spend, for host governments living within their means, it's social. It's a choice between social spending and reinvesting in the business. And you've seen some of those choices play out in the guidance that has been given by host governments to national oil companies in certain countries. And so I think all the cumulative weight of all this action will tend to bring things in balance. And you still have potential sources of supply out there. Obviously, Iran is bringin volumes on, but I think the trend is inexorable."

So how much of volume potentially variances there and the start-ups, the divestments, the price effects and the spend levels? Because it feels like that 100,000 barrels is actually not that wide. It picket seems bigger percentage but not so much volumes."

The range is wide and you've got multiple moving parts in the business. Let me see if I can give you a little bit of color. Just if you look at the dividends of $30 and $60 per barrel just on price effects, it can be over 100,000 barrels a day for that alone. And so you're right, there is a range there. And what happens in a place like Indonesia, for example, for a given level of spend and you have cost barrel reimbursement, the lower the price, the more barrels you get. And these curves are all linear in different locations around the world. And so there is considerable variability from price alone. If you think about ramp-up of production, I'll give you an example on Gorgon. Gorgon, the 3 trains in Gorgon, our share is a little over 200,000 barrels a day. So if you think about each train is 65,000 to 70,000 barrels a day. And we said we expect production within to commence within a few weeks. There's an industry curve. The industry average is around ramp-up schedule that takes place over a period of months. And to the extent at the high end of that range really have a small start-up. We have the well capacity. So you could have a very rapid ramp-up. Our people in Australia don't know what they don't know, and so we have taken more of an average approach. And to the extent you count is something unusual, you can be on the downside of that. Our people in Angola LNG at this point are pretty gun shy because we've had challenges, but that's 60,000 barrels a day. And we said that we expect to be introducing gas later this quarter, and to have cargoes the second quarter. But there's variability around that and the ramp-up, and so all of those -- and by the way, there's a second train in Gorgon as well later this year. So all of those can impact the pace of development. And then, I guess, just the outright spend that's a function of rigs and activity. I think it's fair to say that if we keep seeing prices in the low 30s, we're going to drop rigs as the principals on. And then that last piece is one that I will provide much specifics is really divestments because we've indicated for example that our shallow water and activity that we have packages for shale out there, and those have some volumes attached to them. I mean there's some other potential assets in the upstream under consideration, but it really depends on getting the value and timing of those. And so that is why you get a range of you are correct. The range can be broader than indicated there, but that I felt if I give you any broader range, you'd say this is wasn't very helpful."

Turn to Slide 3. Today, we announced a quarterly loss and annual results that were significantly below prior years. Pat will walk you through the financial details but prior to that, I would like to provide a few thoughts. In 2015, we delivered strong underlying operating results. We had one of our best years in personal safety, process safety and environmental performance. On most measures, we either matched 2014's record low or set new lows in 2015. The downstream business produced strong financial performance, underpinned by one of the best years ever in terms of facility utilization and reliability. In upstream, we grew production by 2%, within the guidance we provided a year ago. Additionally, we logged a 5-year reserve replacement ratio of 113%. Despite the strong operating results and oversupplied market led prices to fall to levels not seen since 2014. As expected, our financial results suffered. Across the corporation, we are responding to this low price environment. Our priorities remain completing projects under construction and reducing spend both operating expense and capital to levels consistent with current conditions. We will also continue to divest assets where we can obtain a good value. Our #1 financial priority is to maintain and grow the dividend. We have a strong balance sheet for precisely transition times like this. Pat will now take you through our financial results."

Thanks, John. I will be presenting 3 slides on our financial results. Additional earnings and production variance slides along with the tabulation of special items are available in the Appendix section of the presentation on our website. 
Turning now to Slide 4, an overview of our financial performance. The company's fourth quarter loss was $588 million or $0.31 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange, impairments and other special items, earnings for the quarter totaled $491 million or $0.26 per share. For the year, earnings were $4.6 billion or $5.6 billion, excluding special items and foreign exchange. Return on capital employed was 2.5%, and our debt ratio at year-end was approximately 20%. During the fourth quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends, bringing our total for the year to $8 billion or $4.28 per share. 2015 was the 28th consecutive year of annual per share dividend increases. 
Turning to Slide 5. Cash generated from operations was $4.6 billion during the fourth quarter and $19.5 billion for the full year. Fourth quarter cash flow declined because of lower commodity prices and lower downstream margins. Proceeds from asset sales for 2015 were $5.7 billion, bringing our 2-year total to more than $11 billion. Cash capital expenditures were $7.4 billion for the quarter and $29.5 billion for the full year. At year-end, our cash and cash equivalents totaled more than $11 billion. During 2015, we borrowed approximately $11 billion and at year-end, our net debt stood at $27 billion, resulting in a net debt ratio of approximately 15%. 
Slide 6 compares 2015 full year earnings with 2014. Earnings for 2015 were $4.6 billion or approximately $14.7 billion lower than the 2014 result. Special items such as asset impairments, project suspensions and other charges along with lower gains on asset sales reduced earnings between periods by $3.1 billion, while the change in foreign exchange impacts increased earnings by approximately $300 million. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased $14.6 billion between periods as lower realizations were only slightly offset by higher liftings, lower operating costs and other items. Downstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by $2.2 billion, primarily due to higher margins. The variance in the other segment primarily reflect lower tax items. I'd like to now turn it back to John."

We are aggressively reducing investments and driving costs out of our business. During 2015, total spend was down approximately $9 billion or more than 12%. Capital outlays alone were down $6 billion. Part of this reductio",1407,"Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 7. We are aggressively reducing investments and driving costs out of our business. During 2015, total spend was down approximately $9 billion or more than 12%. Capital outlays alone were down $6 billion. Part of this reduction was long scheduled as in-progress major capital projects were completed and outlays ramp down. In addition, capital expenditure savings were achieved because of deliberate choices being made to reprioritize and repace investments and by challenging supply chain costs. Operating expenses also declined between years. The largest impact occurred in our upstream and corporate segments, reflecting purposeful initiative to rationalize headcount and boost workflow efficiencies. In upstream, declining costs and growing production led to a lower operating cost per barrel, which is expected to exceed 10% when the final results are reported in our 10-K. 
Looking to 2016, we expect to see additional spend reduction in the range of 13% to 18% as the full year run rate effects of many of the 2015 initiatives come to bear and incremental cost-saving projects are implemented. 
Turn to Slide 8. Our investment priorities remain consistent. We will fund investments to ensure safe, reliable operations, complete the projects already under construction, enable investment in high-return short-cycle opportunities and preserve options for viable long-cycle projects. 
In December, we announced the 2016 capital program of $26.6 billion, which was within the guidance range provided on our third quarter earnings call. Since then, market conditions have deteriorated, and we will be responsive. Flexibility in our capital program allows discretion in our spend with a likely outcome for 2016 being near the bottom of our guidance range. 
Looking beyond 2016, our flexibility will continue to increase, and we expect further reductions in our capital program. 
Turn to Slide 9. Divestitures are a normal part of our portfolio. We will divest assets that no longer have a strategic fit or do not compete for capital with our other investment alternatives. Our asset sales program has been successful as well-timed transactions have capture good value and generated $11.5 billion in cash through the end of 2015. Over 2016 and '17, we are targeting another $5 billion to $10 billion in investments. Publicly known in-progress transactions include New Zealand and South Africa downstream businesses, the Hawaii refinery, upstream and pipeline assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and gas storage assets in Canada. Additional opportunities are being pursued and will be disclosed in due course when commercial sensitivities permit. In all cases, we will only sell assets where we can realize fair value. 
Turn to Slide 10. In 2015, we grew annual production by 2%. Ramp-ups at major capital projects, including Jack/St. Malo and Tubular Bells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Bibiyana expansion in Bangladesh along with shale and tight production growth of approximately 30%, contributed to increased volumes. Additionally, current prices benefited production through PSC and other entitlement effects. Offsetting the increases was the effect of a shut-in of the Partition Zone production, the impact of asset sales and a base decline of less than 2%. Our -- for 2016, production guidance is a range of flat to 4% growth. The uncertainty is a reflection of market conditions, current activities and divestments. To clarify, production from the Partition Zone remain shut in. The exact timing of production restart is unknown and dependent on dispute resolutions between sovereign states. Contributions from major capital project start-ups and ramp-ups will be significant in 2016, and small movements in timing or the pace of ramp-ups can make a significant difference in annual production. Uncertainty in the exact timing and precise composition of asset divestments will be another variable because we are value-driven on all sales. 
Finally, current market conditions will create impacts related to PSC and other pricing-related entitlement effects. Additionally, low prices will restrict our overall spend levels, which in turn, will result in somewhat higher base decline rates. 
Turning to Slide 11. Our reserve replacement in 2015 was 107%. We saw significant adds in our shale and tight assets, which reflects strong well performance results and new geologic data in these plays. Additional volumes were booked based upon development drilling results at Wheatstone. Strong base business performance resulted in positive reserve revisions including Tengiz, Thailand, Nigeria and the Gulf of Mexico. Commodity price impact benefited entitlement volumes for profit-sharing and variable royalty contracts. Our 5-year reserve replacement ratio is 113%. 
Now let's talk about progress on our major capital projects starting with Gorgon. Turn to Slide 12, at Gorgon, system commissioning from Train 1 is in the final stages with key process units starting up, a cooldown cargo delivered and system cooling underway. The first LNG production is expected within the next few weeks with first cargo anticipated soon after that. We will be ramping up Train 1 in the months ahead. Gas for Train 1 startup will come from Io-Jansz wells. These wells have been successfully flow tested, and initial performance indications look good. 
On Trains 2 and 3, all modules have been delivered to site, and construction is progressing. Lessons learned from train 1 are being applied and key milestones have been achieved on schedule, with start-ups expected at approximately 6-month intervals after Train 1. 
Turning to Wheatstone on Slide 13. On the upstream portion of the project, hookup and commissioning of the offshore platform is progressing. The trunkline is ready for service, and the final tie in work is ongoing. 6 of 9 wells are drilled and completed offering sufficient well capacity for the first train. At the plant site, the operations center and LNG loading jetty are complete and tank hydro-testing is ongoing. As previously communicated, initial module fabrication in Malaysia was delayed. We were successful in mitigating further delays, and all modules required for Train 1 are now on site. Piping and cabling work is ongoing. The pace of this work will determine critical path towards first LNG, which is expected to be mid-year 2017. Train 2 modules are underway and on track. 
Turning to Slide 15. I've just run through the steps we've already taken to improve our financial results and to be responsive to current market conditions. on the elements we control, operating expenses, capital outlays and project execution, you can expect even more improvements in 2016. However, price remains a significant uncertainty. I'll come back to that in just a minute. What I would like to talk about is other projects that we have -- that are also contributing to our performance. If you look at the chart on Page 14, you'll see that we have significant progress on new projects. We have the Lianzi and Moho Nord, which came on in the fourth quarter; Chuandongbei, the first train to Chuandongbei has come online; and here in January of 2016, we're seeing progress on Angola LNG as recommissioning is underway. We expect introduce gas to the plant later this quarter and have first LNG cargo in the second quarter. Mafumeira Sul in Angola, Bangka in Indonesia and Alder in the North Sea are also progressing towards expected start-up later in the year. I mentioned that price is a very significant uncertainty to us going forward. 
If you look at Slide 15, you'll see a chart that was put together by Wood Mac. This obviously represents a significant source of uncertainty in cash flows going forward. But consistent with many of you, we believe demand will continue to grow. The larger wildcard or uncertainty, if you will, is supply. Non-OPEC liquids production, which is shown on this chart, remain much more resilient in 2015 that most predicted. With a significant contraction in global investment caused by low prices, the world would see supplies drop off. Wood Mac shows that occurring this year thereby pushing the oil market into better balance. Until that balance occurs, prices will continue to be constrained, and the financial damage to the energy sector seen in 2015 will continue. Relative to balance sheet strength and growing flexibility on our spend, Chevron will be advantage relative to the others in this industry as prices rebound. We are well positioned to benefit when the market does balance and price begin to rise because of the leverage that we have and our growing production profile. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. [Operator Instructions] We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. So Jonathan, please open the lines."

On the third quarter call, you build us a bridge to cover the dividend with free cash flow by 2017, which looked fairly reasonable on the $50-or-so environment, and you highlight the flexibility for 2016 in the slide. So, I guess, I was wondering just looking out to 2017 if we're sub-$50, how low can you realistically go with additional CapEx and OpEx cuts before you feel like you might need asset sales or the balance sheet to bridge the gap? Is there a level of CapEx you really don't want to go below?"

The level of spend -- if we continue to see the kinds of prices that we're seeing now, the cost of goods and services will continue to decline. We've got the impact of foreign exchange rates, et cetera. The biggest change between what we'll spend this year and next year is really the ramp-down from major capital projects. So for example, this year, we'll be spending about $6 billion on LNG projects around the world. Obviously, finishing Angola LNG and then as we wind down Gorgon and have little more spend on Wheatstone, we expect next year that spend will be under $2 billion. So you gain $4 billion right there, and then our flexible grows as time goes by. We obviously have to invest to keep our operations reliable. We will still have some projects that are under construction and being completed and additional commitments in drilling off of platforms and things of that sort. But I think our flexibility is significant. We gave you a range of $20 billion to $24 billion, but we're going to continue to drive that number down. I guess, my overall message is that we're going to continue to live within our means that we have, and it obviously makes sense to finish the projects under construction. We have a strong balance sheet. And maybe I'll offer a couple of comments in that area because a lot of people ask. I've given the priority as to pay and grow the dividend and in order to do that, obviously, you do have to invest in the business because we are a depleting resource business. So those are always the first 2 priorities that we have, consistent with good economics on the spending. We've indicated that we're in a long cycle business. And in such a long cycle business where you can have ups and downs in the commodity markets and you get started on long cycle projects, you need a strong balance sheet. And so we have always advertise that and indicated that a AA rating was what we were looking for. And that was -- that's really indicative of needing to have a strong balance sheet. But the reason you keep a strong balance sheet is so you can withstand the ups and downs of the business. And right now, we're in the downs with prices low and so we'll use our balance sheet this year. Almost regardless of where prices are during the year. And we're going to cut costs. We're going to reduce spend where we can, and that flexibility grows in time. We work very closely with the rating agencies. We talk to rating agencies. They see our internal forecast around our business. They see more than you do, in other words. And so we'll be very clear where our priorities are, where the visibility is. And then they have to do their job. But we think that we will retain a very strong balance sheet and the ability to withstand these ups and downs."

When prices came down, we consciously delayed FID so that we could get additional definition around the project, get greater certainty around what the cost would be and frankly, to drive costs down given the opportunity that is present given the conditions in the industry. And we've had some success with that. But we're not at the point where we're ready to take FID today with low prices that we're seeing, we're working closely with our partners to ensure that we have adequate funding for the project and to further take costs down.

There's the uncertainty of exchange rates and things of that sort, but I don't want to flag a significant reduction below the range, below the $26.6 million that's in our budget and below the range that we've talked about. Because I don't want to shut in all rigs around the world, for example. There, obviously, are things that you could do that I don't think are the proper things to do given our expectations going forward. We've -- for example, we've done terrific work in the Permian Basin to get our cost down. And we want to keep that momentum going. So we have 6 operated rigs. There are 14 nonoperated rigs. We want to continue that activity. Our group has done a terrific job of getting cost down. And obviously, at $30, every business is stressed, but we think that supply is going to be needed, and we want to continue the activity that we have there, need to continue to drive down cost but we want to continue that activity. So there's a little bit more room, but I don't want to flag something outside the range. Maybe I'll let -- I offered some comments on sort of the philosophy. Maybe I'll let Pat talk a little bit about interaction with the rating agencies and our view on what sort of minimum requirements might be."

They've indicated that many of the companies are up for review. I am certain that Chevron will be in that queue right after the first tiering goes through. So if a downgrade does occur and, I think they've been moving in that direction, but if that were to occur, we would not be the only one that that would happen to. I don't see it materially impacting our cost of funds or materially impacting our ability to secure financing. And in terms of a minimum, I guess, I don't think of it that way. We have a strong balance sheet even if there were to be a downgrade. We have a very strong balance sheet, amongst the strongest in the industry. And we've already committed and said multiple times that we are going to get balanced. We will live within our cash flow. And I think that is the profile that we put forward to the rating agencies."

And, I guess, if I can take just a second and to sort of -- to back up a little bit, if you look at the macro environment on where supply is going to come from to meet any demand estimate that might be out there. The world's going to need deepwater oil. It is a significant resources and over time, those barrels are going to be needed. Now right now, the cost in the deepwater haven't come down quite as fast as they have onshore. We obviously have seen some rig rate reductions, but in general, as we get to deeper and deeper water, some projects are challenged. We have mentioned last year in our Analyst Meeting that we felt it would take larger accumulations to make some of these deepwater projects successful. So the precise numbers are being worked, but you're going to need bigger accumulations and larger hubs in order to justify the infrastructure. And then tiebacks, similarly, will need somewhat higher prices. We have some special charges in the fourth quarter and $0.5 billion was writing off Buckskin and Moccasin. And that's a project that we thought would go forward. First, we thought it might be -- it might have the potential to be a hub and then we thought it had the potential to be a tieback. And I won't say that, that project couldn't have gone forward and then it wouldn't meet minimum thresholds depending upon your forward view of prices. But relative to our alternatives, we felt that for the foreseeable future, we've got better places to put our money. And so we made a very difficult decision to not go forward with that project. And so the clock was ticking where it was going to require $2 billion of investments over the next few years and we just felt during -- over the next few years, we are going to have a better place to put our money, notably the Permian. So it's -- there are tough choices being made. Now we have a good position in deepwater, we've been as successful as anyone there. And we have been successful in driving cost down. We've seen -- I mean, really unbelievable progress last year. We had a 30% reduction in days per 10,000 feet in '15 versus '14. So our experience in the Lower Tertiary, in particular, we're getting better and better at understanding it and driving cost down. We're encouraged by what we've got at Anchor, we've got some appraisal work that's undergoing there. We've got another potential hub development with a group of fields that we had put together with a couple of partners in the industry to try to create a hub class development. And -- but this is a work in progress for us to make sure we can have a resource cost balance to make these projects attractive to meet our thresholds. I'm confident we'll be able to do that. It's just that we were push with Buckskin and Moccasin and you're seeing others make similar choices if it doesn't quite fit relative to their alternatives."

But I would just say, if you look at growth not just through '17 but through '18, we feel pretty good about it and that's largely a function of the projects we have in flight. In 2018, you'll have a full year of production obviously from our big LNG projects, which you won't have in '17. We also have other projects that remain under construction now that will come on during that period, projects like Hebron in Canada and Big Foot and others that will come on in that window. So we'll have a continuing momentum from those projects, and we'll be ramping up our shale activity during that period notably in the Permian. So I think the profile will be attractive beyond 2017. Now ultimately, the cumulative effect of the reductions in capital, if they persist at a low level will be felt. But I think we'll have a little more resilience than people think. Now that's other things being equal depending upon where prices are, depending upon asset sales and things of that sort. But in terms of what sort of spend do you need to sustain production indefinitely, that will be a function of a lot of things, notably the cost environment that we see. I do think that our position in the Permian gives us a little bit of an advantage over others during this period because you've seen some of the numbers we've given you previously, we have the capability to ramp that up and mitigate some of the declines. So even if we see a slight increase in our base decline, which has been tracking at under 2%, even if that goes up a little bit, we should be able to substantially mitigate a lot of that through the activity that we have in the shale. But we'll try to give you a little more -- a little longer term outlook in our upcoming Meeting in March, if that's okay."

I will say we got more success in the U.S. than internationally, number one. And so we'll continue to drive that hard. That's just a function of contracts and the competitive environment overseas. So one, we'll be working that very hard. We'll be working additional efficiencies. Just as an example, our -- we haven't -- we still have reorganizations in flight. So our employee count was down about 3,200 between the end of '14 to the end of '15. There are another 4,000 coming this year, and a lot of that work is ongoing right now. So we're being careful. We're pretty thoughtful about the way we do this sort of work to make sure that we keep the right people in our organization for the longer-term. But the reality is activity is likely to be lower, and we do have a number of projects that will be ramping down, and that we're going to work to be fair about how we do that so that we keep a lot of the great talent that we have that's been working around the world. But there's no question. We're looking at organizations and have a number of reorganizations in flight. So our desire is to keep moving that. Now I will say on a dollar basis, when you're growing production and bringing on new asset, you have operating expense that you will incur. That's why we gave you the unit OpEx number. But we drove that one down. It will be -- there's still some final allocations for what goes in the 10-K in the oil and gas disclosure but it's down over $2 a barrel. And I think that general trend, we're going to continue to drive that number down. Remember in our OpEx, 40% of our OpEx is downstream. And our downstream had record performance this year and, as you know, they've had restructuring underway for some time. And it's not that they're immune from some of the efforts we have to reduce cost, but I don't think you'll see a structural shift in our downstream cost. The corporate center, we've obviously looked at and made some significant changes. A lot of people left the payroll in December, and so those benefits will be felt in the ongoing work that I described in the upstream.

But remember, 2014 production was about 80,000 barrels a day. When you start up mid-year, you don't start up at 80,000. You start at something lower than that because the facilities have been mothballed and preserved for a period of time. So that's what's reflected. To the extent that agreement is reached and there have been discussions, to the extent agreement is reached and start it up sooner, it'll be to the higher end of that range and to the extent that it continues, the bottom of the range is 0.

I think, it's a terrible market to be trying to sell most assets out there, particularly, obviously oil-related assets. And that's why I've been pretty circumspect around asset sales. We sold $11 billion over the last 2 years, but we're giving you a $5 billion to $10 billion for the next 2 years in the numbers that I've given you. And from a strategic point of view, there are some opportunities out there that, I think, will be tough to execute. And if we can't execute them, we won't sell them. If you look at the kinds of things we have sold, we've gotten very good value. So for example, the last 2 years, there was a lot of strength in the infrastructure market, selling pipelines, for example. And on strategy grounds and on valuation grounds, we felt that we were going to limit our investments in the pipeline business to those that are critical to our upstream and downstream sector and we can sell those, things like Caltex Australia. We thought values were very strong and assets had -- we've been very well-aligned with them, but that they were heading off potentially in a growth direction, and we felt that from our strategic point of view that it might -- it be best to exit when we did. So we've been very careful, and I can tell you the assets going forward, we don't advertise them but you look at the ones where there's information in the public domain, I think you'll see that those are assets where there are potential buyers out there at good value. So I think your admonition is a very good one, and it's why we haven't put big numbers out there."

Obviously, for any project we had in flight, we went back to the -- to all the project teams and create expectation that they will look to try to capture cost reductions. And in some cases where you have -- where your big contracts and the terms and conditions are fixed, you are where you are. But on anything where you have not taken FID, you have some flexibility to go back to the providers of those services. And that's why we've delayed our costs. I mean part of the recycle of projects is to see if there's a different development scheme and things like that. For example, Rosebank has a different development scheme. But part of it is also to be sure you can capture the cost reductions that are available -- that might be available in the marketplace. And sometimes, you have to just say ""We're not going to this if we don't get better cost,"" and that tends to focus partners and others. So we expect to see declining breakevens as a result of those initiatives both to reframe projects in some cases or to try to drive costs out. In terms of what we've got actually plan, most of the effort -- most of the things that we would call FIDs are really things like infield drilling. So for example, the next phase of drilling at Agbami, the next stage of drilling at Jack/St. Malo, which are utilizing existing rigs and drilling off of existing -- to support existing infrastructure. In terms of big new greenfield projects, it's relatively few. There are some that could be in the budget, but it's going to depend on that price cost balance I've been talking about. And that's why I say we have significant flexibility going forward as we complete things like Gorgon, Wheatstone, Mafumeira Sul, Angola LNG and others."

We have been on a pathway in the Permian. First, assessing what we have. So we've been drilling both vertical and horizontal wells. Over the last year, we've really converted our entire program to horizontal wells and really getting -- in overused term, getting our factory model in place, and we've done that. And our costs are now very competitive with some of the best in the business. So that is taking place, and we want to continue that effort. Our view is not that prices are going to stay at the low range they are today. But part of living within your means is limiting just how many rigs you deploy. We've got 6 operated rigs today. We've got 14 inter-JV rigs that are operating today. We think that's about the right balance. We have flexibility to move up. And what I've told our people, if they stay on the cost trajectory that they are, we're going to look to fund them. The economics in some of the best areas at strip type prices work, but not as good as we like at higher prices but they work. And so that obviously is guiding us. But I would hate to lose the momentum that we have in the Permian with some of the cost reduction efforts we have underway. And we've told you, we've got 3,000 locations that we think are meet economic threshold at $50.

You're right, it is very tough times. A couple of thoughts that I'll give you. One, I think the cost reductions but we're going after, most of them will be permanent. For example, the efficiencies that we've gained in our drilling, those are permanent regardless of what happens to rig rates going forward, so whether it's a deepwater that I talked about earlier for onshore, so that's number one. Number two, I think the benefits that we're taking on in some of our organization and some of our structures, I think a lot of that will be permanent. And I think we've undervalued what simplicity in org structures can provide. So obviously, we're taking out some layers where we've got rolling reorganizations that are being implemented around the world, and I think that simplicity and clarity will be a positive for the business.

Our base decline has been good because we've operated very reliably, and we've actually gotten quite efficient in our business. So we have been able to mitigate the declines. We've also flagged though that with the lower level of spending on base business, infield drilling in places like Bakersfield and elsewhere, you are going to see declined slightly higher. So that's why we've suggested that, and we do expect to see that across the industry. The history has shown during downturns like this, you can see an increase of a 1% or 2% industry-wide in that base decline. So that is -- I think that's clear. In terms of the resiliency that we've seen in production, it's partly related to that but it's -- to me, it's been -- if you look at 2015, the impact of projects that were in flight has probably been more than we as an industry anticipated. So we're not the only ones with Jack/St. Malos and Bibiyanas and other projects that are under construction better that are coming up. Secondly, of course, you've had the impact of hedges in the unconventional business and the brief uptick that took place in the middle of 2015 in prices did allow additional hedges. So you've still got a few hedges that are out there in the industry in 2016 that will allow some level of activity. But increasingly, all that's wearing off. As all the projects come online, as base business decline start to take over and as hedges are no longer available. And so I think that's why you're seeing those volumes. The other piece that I've consistently said has been underrepresented is the stress around the world, the stress on host governments, the stress on those government partners, national oil companies and others. And you've seen announcements that have been made because while we tend to think of living within our means as a function of forward capital spend, for host governments living within their means is social. The choice between social spending and reinvesting in the business. And you've seen some of those choices play out in the guidance that's been given to -- by host governments to national oil companies in certain countries. And so I think all of the cumulative weight of all this action will tend to bring things into balance. And you still have potential sources of supply out there. Obviously, Iran is bringing volumes on, but I think the trend is inexorable."

The range is wide and you've got multiple moving parts in the business. Let me see if I can give you a little bit of color. Just if you look at [indiscernible] $30 and $60 per barrel just on price effects, it can be over 100,000 barrels a day for that alone. And so you're right, there is a range there. And what happens in a place like Indonesia, for example, for a given level of spend and you have cost barrel reimbursement, the lower the price, the more barrels you get. And these curves are all linear in different locations around the world. So there is a considerable variability from price alone. If you think about ramp-up of production, I'll give you an example on Gorgon. Gorgon, the 3 trains in Gorgon, our share is a little over 200,000 barrels a day. So if you think about each train is 65,000 to 70,000 barrels a day. And we've said that we expect production within -- to commence within a few weeks. There's an industry curve. The industry average is around ramp-up schedule that takes place over a period of months. To the extent at the high end of that range where you have a smooth start-up. We have the well capacity. So you could have a very rapid ramp-up. Our people in Australia don't know what they don't know, and so we have taken more of an average approach. And to the extent you encounter something unusual, you can be on the downside of that. Our people in Angola LNG at this point are pretty gun shy because we've had challenges, but that's 60,000 barrels a day. And we've said that we expect to be introducing gas later this quarter, and to have cargoes in the second quarter. But there's variability around that and the ramp-up, and so all of those -- and by the way, there's a second train in Gorgon as well later this year. So all of those can impact the pace of development. And then, there's just the outright spend that's a function of rigs and activity. I think it's fair to say that if we keep seeing prices in the low 30s, we're going to drop rigs as the price moves on. And then the last piece and is one that I won't provide much in the way of specifics is really divestments because we've indicated for example that our shallow water or shelf activities we that have packages for sale out there, and those have some volumes attached to them. And then there is some other potential assets in the upstream that are under consideration, but it really depends on getting the value and the timing of those. And so that is why you get a range and you are correct, the range can be broader than indicated there, but that we -- I felt if I give you any broader range, you'd say this is wasn't very helpful."

Well, just -- I know you've heard over the years but if I just to ground everyone's on the phone, I -- what we said over many years is that we're in the resource business. It's declining and we will replace resource through a combination of exploration, discovered resource participation and acquisitions. And Chevron has done that over time. Our growth position has been pretty good and so M&A hasn't been a particular priority for us. But we are mindful of the opportunities that are out there. I wouldn't want you to think our focus is anything other than getting the projects we have under construction and completing the work we have and ramping up the assets that we have because I think we've got a pretty nice business profile going forward. But we do need to look at what is out there and we're going to be value-driven, but there are opportunities that could present themselves in the current market. So we'll be mindful of that. But remember, we're trying to grow the dividend and invest for the long term here. And so we're not driven -- we're not particularly transaction-driven at any period of time. I have time for 1 more question."

Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. 
Turning to Slide 3. Today, we announced a quarterly loss and annual results that were significantly below prior years. Pat will walk you through the financial details but prior to that, I would like to provide a few thoughts. In 2015, we delivered strong underlying operating results. We had one of our best years in personal safety, process safety and environmental performance. On most measures, we either matched 2014's record low or set new lows in 2015. The downstream business produced strong financial performance, underpinned by one of the best years ever in terms of facility utilization and reliability. In upstream, we grew production by 2%, within the guidance we provided a year ago. Additionally, we logged a 5-year reserve replacement ratio of 113%. Despite the strong operating results, an oversupplied market led prices to fall to levels not seen since 2014. As expected, our financial results suffered. Across the corporation, we are responding to this low price environment. Our priorities remain completing projects under construction and reducing spend both operating expense and capital to levels consistent with current conditions. We will also continue to divest assets where we can obtain a good value. Our #1 financial priority is to maintain and grow the dividend. We have a strong balance sheet for precisely transition times like this. Pat will now take you through our financial results."

Thanks, John. I will be presenting 3 slides on our financial results. Additional earnings and production variance slides along with the tabulation of special items are available in the Appendix section of the presentation on our website. 
Turning now to Slide 4, an overview of our financial performance. The company's fourth quarter loss was $588 million or $0.31 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange, impairments and other special items, earnings for the quarter totaled $491 million or $0.26 per share. For the year, earnings were $4.6 billion or $5.6 billion, excluding special items and foreign exchange. Return on capital employed was 2.5%, and our debt ratio at year-end was approximately 20%. During the fourth quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends, bringing our total for the year to $8 billion or $4.28 per share. 2015 was the 28th consecutive year of annual per share dividend increases. 
Turning to Slide 5. Cash generated from operations was $4.6 billion during the fourth quarter and $19.5 billion for the full year. Fourth quarter cash flow declined because of lower commodity prices and lower downstream margins. Proceeds from asset sales for 2015 were $5.7 billion, bringing our 2-year total to more than $11 billion. Cash capital expenditures were $7.4 billion for the quarter and $29.5 billion for the full year. At year-end, our cash and cash equivalents totaled more than $11 billion. During 2015, we borrowed approximately $11 billion and at year-end, our net debt stood at $27 billion, resulting in a net debt ratio of approximately 15%. 
Slide 6 compares 2015 full year earnings with 2014. Earnings for 2015 were $4.6 billion or approximately $14.7 billion lower than the 2014 results. Special items such as asset impairments, project suspensions and other charges along with lower gains on asset sales reduced earnings between periods by $3.1 billion, while the change in foreign exchange impacts increased earnings by approximately $300 million. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased $14.6 billion between periods as lower realizations were only slightly offset by higher liftings, lower operating costs and other items. Downstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by $2.2 billion, primarily due to higher margins. The variance in the other segment primarily reflects lower tax items. I'd like to now turn it back to John."

We are aggressively reducing investment and driving cost out of our business. During 2015, total spend was down approximately $9 billion or more than 12%. Capital outlays alone were down $6 billion. Part of this reduction",1411,"Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 7. We are aggressively reducing investment and driving cost out of our business. During 2015, total spend was down approximately $9 billion or more than 12%. Capital outlays alone were down $6 billion. Part of this reduction was long scheduled as in-progress major capital projects were completed and outlays ramped down. In addition, capital expenditure savings were achieved because of deliberate choices being made to reprioritize and repace investments and by challenging supply chain costs. Operating expenses also declined between years. The largest impact occurred in our upstream and corporate segments, reflecting purposeful initiatives to rationalize headcount and boost workflow efficiencies. In upstream, declining cost and growing production led to a lower operating cost per barrel, which is expected to exceed 10% when the final results are reported in our 10-K. 
Looking to 2016, we expect to see additional spend reduction in the range of 13% to 18% as the full year run rate effects of many of the 2015 initiatives come to bear and incremental cost-saving projects are implemented. 
Turn to Slide 8. Our investment priorities remain consistent. We will fund investments to ensure safe, reliable operations, complete the projects already under construction, enable investment in high-return short-cycle opportunities and preserve options for viable long-cycle projects. 
In December, we announced the 2016 capital program of $26.6 billion, which was within the guidance range provided on our third quarter earnings call. Since then, market conditions have deteriorated, and we will be responsive. Flexibility in our capital program allows discretion in our spend with a likely outcome for 2016 being near the bottom of our guidance range. 
Looking beyond 2016, our flexibility will continue to increase, and we expect further reductions in our capital program. 
Turn to Slide 9. Divestitures are a normal part of our portfolio work. We will divest assets that no longer have a strategic fit or do not compete for capital with our other investment alternatives. Our asset sales program has been successful as well-timed transactions have captured good value and generated $11.5 billion in cash through the end of 2015. Over 2016 and '17, we are targeting another $5 billion to $10 billion in investments. Publicly known in-progress transactions include New Zealand and South Africa downstream businesses, the Hawaii refinery, upstream and pipeline assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and gas storage assets in Canada. Additional opportunities are being pursued and will be disclosed in due course when commercial sensitivities permit. In all cases, we will only sell assets where we can realize fair value. 
Turn to Slide 10. In 2015, we grew annual production by 2%. Ramp-ups at major capital projects, including Jack/St. Malo and Tubular Bells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Bibiyana expansion in Bangladesh, along with shale and tight production growth of approximately 30%, contributed to increased volumes. Additionally, current prices benefited production through PSC and other entitlement effects. Offsetting the increases was the effect of a shut-in of the Partition Zone production, the impact of asset sales and a base decline of less than 2%. Our -- for 2016, our production guidance is a range of flat to 4% growth. The uncertainty is a reflection of market conditions, current activities and divestments. To clarify, production from the Partition Zone remains shut in. The exact timing of production restart is unknown and dependent on dispute resolutions between sovereign states. Contributions from major capital project start-ups and ramp-ups will be significant in 2016, and small movements in timing or the pace of ramp-ups can make a significant difference in annual production. Uncertainty in the exact timing and precise composition of asset divestments will be another variable because we are value-driven on all sales. 
Finally, current market conditions will create impacts related to PSC and other pricing-related entitlement effects. Additionally, low prices will restrict our overall spend levels, which in turn, will result in somewhat higher base decline rates. 
Turning to Slide 11. Our reserve replacement in 2015 was 107%. We saw significant adds in our shale and tight assets, which reflect strong well performance results and new geologic data in these plays. Additional volumes were booked based upon development drilling results at Wheatstone. Strong base business performance resulted in positive reserve revisions including Tengiz, Thailand, Nigeria and the Gulf of Mexico. Commodity price impact benefited entitlement volumes for profit-sharing and variable royalty contracts. Our 5-year reserve replacement ratio is 113%. 
Now let's talk about progress on our major capital projects starting with Gorgon. Turn to Slide 12, at Gorgon, system commissioning from Train 1 is in the final stages with key process units starting up, a cooldown cargo delivered and system cooling underway. The first LNG production is expected within the next few weeks with first cargo anticipated soon after that. We will be ramping up Train 1 in the months ahead. Gas for Train 1 startup will come from Io-Jansz wells. These wells have been successfully flow tested, and initial performance indications look good. 
On Trains 2 and 3, all modules have been delivered to site, and construction is progressing. Lessons learned from Train 1 are being applied and key milestones have been achieved on schedule, with start-ups expected at approximately 6-month intervals after Train 1. 
Turning to Wheatstone on Slide 13. On the upstream portion of the project, hookup and commissioning of the offshore platform is progressing. The trunkline is ready for service, and the final tie-in work is ongoing. 6 of 9 wells are drilled and completed offering sufficient well capacity for the first train. At the plant site, the operations center and LNG loading jetty are complete and tank hydro-testing is ongoing. As previously communicated, initial module fabrication in Malaysia was delayed. We were successful in mitigating further delays, and all modules required for Train 1 are now on site. Piping and cabling work is ongoing. The pace of this work will determine critical path towards first LNG, which is expected to be mid-year 2017. Train 2 module deliveries are underway and on track. 
Turning to Slide 15. I've just run through the steps we've already taken to improve our financial results and to be responsive to current market conditions. On the elements we control, operating expenses, capital outlays and project execution, you can expect even more improvements in 2016. However, price remains a significant uncertainty. I'll come back to that in just a minute. 
What I would like to talk about is other projects that we have -- that are also contributing to our performance. If you look at the chart on Page 14, you'll see that we have significant progress on new projects. We have the Lianzi and Moho Nord, which came on in the fourth quarter; Chuandongbei, the first train to Chuandongbei has come online; and here in January of 2016, we're seeing progress on Angola LNG as recommissioning is underway. We expect to introduce gas to the plant later this quarter and have first LNG cargo in the second quarter. Mafumeira Sul in Angola, Bangka in Indonesia and Alder in the North Sea are also progressing towards expected start-up later in the year. 
I mentioned that price is a very significant uncertainty to us going forward. If you look at Slide 15, you'll see a chart that was put together by Wood Mac. This obviously represents a significant source of uncertainty in cash flows going forward. But consistent with many of you, we believe demand will continue to grow. The larger wild card or uncertainty, if you will, is supply. Non-OPEC liquids production, which is shown on this chart, remained much more resilient in 2015 than most predicted. With a significant contraction in global investment caused by low prices, the world would see supplies drop off. Wood Mac shows that occurring this year thereby pushing the oil market into better balance. Until that balance occurs, prices will continue to be constrained, and the financial damage to the energy sector seen in 2015 will continue. Relative to balance sheet strength and growing flexibility on our spend, Chevron will be advantaged relative to the others in this industry as prices rebound. We are well positioned to benefit when the market does balance and prices begin to rise because of the leverage that we have and our growing production profile. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. [Operator Instructions] We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. So Jonathan, please open the lines."

On the third quarter call, you built us a bridge to cover the dividend with free cash flow by 2017, which looked fairly reasonable on the $50-or-so environment, and you highlight the flexibility for 2016 in the slide. So, I guess, I was wondering just looking out to 2017 if we're sub-$50, how low can you realistically go with additional CapEx and OpEx cuts before you feel like you might need asset sales or the balance sheet to bridge the gap? Is there a level of CapEx you really don't want to go below?"

The level of spend -- if we continue to see the kinds of prices that we're seeing now, the cost of goods and services will continue to decline. We've got the impact of foreign exchange rates, et cetera. The biggest change between what we'll spend this year and next year is really the ramp-down from major capital projects. So for example, this year, we'll be spending about $6 billion on LNG projects around the world. Obviously, finishing Angola LNG and then as we wind down Gorgon and have a little more spend on Wheatstone, we expect next year that spend will be under $2 billion. So you gain $4 billion right there, and then our flexibility grows as time goes by. We obviously have to invest to keep our operations reliable. We will still have some projects that are under construction and being completed and additional commitments in drilling off of platforms and things of that sort. But I think our flexibility is significant. We gave you a range of $20 billion to $24 billion, but we're going to continue to drive that number down. I guess, my overall message is that we're going to continue to live within our means that we have, and it obviously makes sense to finish the projects under construction. We have a strong balance sheet. And maybe I'll offer a couple of comments in that area because a lot of people ask. I've given the priority as to pay and grow the dividend and in order to do that, obviously, you do have to invest in the business because we are a depleting resource business. So those are always the first 2 priorities that we have, consistent with good economics on the spending. We've indicated that we're in a long cycle business. And in such a long cycle business where you can have ups and downs in the commodity markets and you get started on long cycle projects, you need a strong balance sheet. And so we have always advertised that and indicated that a AA rating was what we were looking for. And that was -- that's really indicative of needing to have a strong balance sheet. But the reason you keep a strong balance sheet is so you can withstand the ups and downs of the business. And right now, we're in the downs with prices low and so we'll use our balance sheet this year. Almost regardless of where prices are during the year. And we're going to cut costs. We're going to reduce spend where we can, and that flexibility grows in time. We work very closely with the rating agencies. We talk to rating agencies. They see our internal forecasts around our business. They see more than you do, in other words. And so we'll be very clear where our priorities are, where the visibility is. And then they have to do their job. But we think that we will retain a very strong balance sheet and the ability to withstand these ups and downs."

When prices came down, we consciously delayed FID so that we could get additional definition around the project, get greater certainty around what the costs would be and frankly, to drive costs down given the opportunity that is present given the conditions in the industry. And we've had some success with that. But we're not at the point where we're ready to take FID today with low prices that we're seeing, we're working closely with our partners to ensure that we have adequate funding for the project and to further take costs down.

There's the uncertainty of exchange rates and things of that sort, but I don't want to flag a significant reduction below the range, below the $26.6 million that's in our budget and below the range that we've talked about. Because I don't want to shut-in all rigs around the world, for example. There, obviously, are things that you could do that I don't think are the proper things to do given our expectations going forward. We've -- for example, we've done terrific work in the Permian Basin to get our costs down. And we want to keep that momentum going. So we have 6 operated rigs. There are 14 non-operated rigs. We want to continue that activity. Our group has done a terrific job of getting costs down. And obviously, at $30, every business is stressed, but we think that supplies are going to be needed, and we want to continue the activity that we have there. We need to continue to drive down cost but we want to continue that activity. So there's a little bit more room, but I don't want to flag something outside the range.

They've indicated that many of the companies are up for review. I am certain that Chevron will be in that queue right after the first tiering goes through. So if a downgrade does occur and, I think they've been moving in that direction, but if that were to occur, we would not be the only one that that would happen to. I don't see it materially impacting our cost of funds or materially impacting our ability to secure financing. And in terms of a minimum, I guess, I don't think of it that way. We have a strong balance sheet even if there were to be a downgrade. We have a very strong balance sheet, amongst the strongest in the industry. And we've already committed and said multiple times that we are going to get balanced. We will live within our cash flows. And I think that is the profile that we put forward to the rating agencies."

And, I guess, if I can take just a second and to sort of -- to back up a little bit, if you look at the macro environment on where supply is going to come from to meet any demand estimate that might be out there. The world's going to need deepwater oil. It is a significant resource and over time, those barrels are going to be needed. Now right now, the costs in the deepwater haven't come down quite as fast as they have onshore. We obviously have seen some rig rate reductions, but in general, as we get to deeper and deeper water, some projects are challenged. We have mentioned last year in our Analyst Meeting that we felt it would take larger accumulations to make some of these deepwater projects successful. So the precise numbers are being worked, but you're going to need bigger accumulations and larger hubs in order to justify the infrastructure. And then tiebacks, similarly, will need somewhat higher prices. We have some special charges in the fourth quarter and $0.5 billion was writing off Buckskin and Moccasin. And that's a project that we thought would go forward. First, we thought it might be -- it might have the potential to be a hub and then we thought it had the potential to be a tieback. And I won't say that, that project couldn't have gone forward and that it wouldn't meet minimum thresholds depending upon your forward view of prices. But relative to our alternatives, we felt that for the foreseeable future, we've got better places to put our money. And so we made a very difficult decision to not go forward with that project. And so the clock was ticking where it was going to require a couple billion dollars of investments over the next few years and we just felt during -- over the next few years, we are going to have a better places to put our money, notably the Permian. So it's -- there are tough choices being made. Now we have a good position in deepwater, we've been as successful as anyone there. And we have been successful in driving costs down. We've seen -- I mean, really unbelievable progress last year. We had a 30% reduction in days per 10,000 feet in '15 versus '14. So our experience in the Lower Tertiary, in particular, we're getting better and better at understanding it and driving costs down. We're encouraged by what we've got at Anchor, we've got some appraisal work that's undergoing there. We've got another potential hub development with a group of fields that we had put together with a couple of partners in the industry to try to create a hub class development. And -- but this is a work in progress for us to make sure we can have a resource cost balance to make these projects attractive to meet our thresholds. I'm confident we'll be able to do that. It's just that we were pushed with Buckskin and Moccasin and you're seeing others make similar choices if it doesn't quite fit relative to their alternatives."

I think we'll probably give you a -- we will give you a more complete answer when we get to March where we have a chance to run through it. But I would just say, if you look at growth not just through '17 but through '18, we feel pretty good about it and that's largely a function of the projects we have in flight. In 2018, you'll have a full year of production obviously from our big LNG projects, which you won't have in '17. We also have other projects that remain under construction now that will come on during that period, projects like Hebron in Canada and Big Foot and others that will come on in that window. So we'll have a continuing momentum from those projects, and we'll be ramping up our shale activity during that period notably in the Permian. So I think the profile will be attractive beyond 2017. Now ultimately, the cumulative effect of the reductions in capital, if they persist at a low level will be felt. But I think we'll have a little more resilience than people think. Now that's other things being equal, depending upon where prices are, depending upon asset sales and things of that sort. But in terms of what sort of spend do you need to sustain production indefinitely, that will be a function of a lot of things, notably the cost environment that we see. I do think that our position in the Permian gives us a little bit of an advantage over others during this period because you've seen some of the numbers we've given you previously, we have the capability to ramp that up and mitigate some of the declines. So even if we see a slight increase in our base decline, which has been tracking at under 2%, even if that goes up a little bit, we should be able to substantially mitigate a lot of that through the activity that we have in the shale. But we'll try to give you a little more -- a little longer term outlook in our upcoming meeting in March, if that's okay."

Obviously, there were costs in goods and services and our procurement group is having a fair degree of success. I will say we've had more success in the U.S. than internationally, number one. And so we'll continue to drive that hard. That's just a function of contracts and the competitive environment overseas. So one, we'll be working that very hard. We'll be working additional efficiencies. Just as an example, our -- we haven't -- we still have reorganizations in flight. So our employee count was down about 3,200 between the end of '14 to the end of '15. There are another 4,000 coming this year, and a lot of that work is ongoing right now. So we're being careful. We're pretty thoughtful about the way we do this sort of work to make sure that we keep the right people in our organization for the longer-term. But the reality is activity is likely to be lower, and we do have a number of projects that will be ramping down, and that we're going to work to be fair about how we do that so that we keep a lot of the great talent that we have that's been working around the world. But there's no question. We're looking at organizations and have a number of reorganizations in flight. So our desire is to keep moving that. Now I will say on a dollar basis, when you're growing production and bringing on new assets, you have operating expense that you will incur. That's why we gave you the unit OpEx number. But we drove that one down. It will be -- there's still some final allocations for what goes in the 10-K in the oil and gas disclosure but it's down over $2 a barrel. And I think that general trend, we're going to continue to drive that number down. Remember in our OpEx, 40% of our OpEx is downstream. And our downstream had record performance this year and, as you know, they've had restructuring underway for some time. And it's not that they're immune from some of the efforts we have to reduce cost, but I don't think you'll see a structural shift in our downstream cost. The corporate center, we've obviously looked at and made some significant changes. A lot of people left the payroll in December, and so those benefits will be felt in the ongoing work that I've described in the upstream. So my message is we're driving it hard but we're trying to be thoughtful so that we keep the talent we need for the long haul in the organization."

And from a strategic point of view, there are some opportunities out there that, I think, will be tough to execute. And if we can't execute them, we won't sell them. If you look at the kinds of things we have sold, we've gotten very good value. So for example, the last 2 years, there was a lot of strength in the infrastructure market, selling pipelines, for example. And on strategy grounds and on valuation grounds, we felt that we were going to limit our investments in the pipeline business to those that are critical to our upstream and downstream sector and we can sell those, things like Caltex Australia. We thought values were very strong and assets had -- we've been very well-aligned with them, but that they were heading off potentially in a growth direction, and we felt that from our strategic point of view that it might -- it be best to exit when we did. So we've been very careful, and I can tell you the assets going forward, we don't advertise them but if you look at the ones where there's information in the public domain, I think you'll see that those are assets where there are potential buyers out there at good value.

And in some cases where you have -- where you bid contracts and the terms and conditions are fixed, you are where you are. But on anything where you have not taken FID, you have some flexibility to go back to the providers of those services. And that's why we've delayed our costs. I mean, part of the recycle of projects is to see if there's a different development scheme and things like that. For example, Rosebank has a different development scheme. But part of it is also to be sure you can capture the cost reductions that are available -- that might be available in the marketplace. And sometimes, you have to just say ""We're not going to this if we don't get better costs,"" and that tends to focus partners and others. So we expect to see declining breakevens as a result of those initiatives both to reframe projects in some cases or to try to drive costs out.

In terms of big new greenfield projects, it's relatively few. There are some that could be in the budget, but it's going to depend on that price cost balance I've been talking about. And that's why I say we have significant flexibility going forward as we complete things like Gorgon, Wheatstone, Mafumeira Sul, Angola LNG and others."

So we feel pretty good about that. And those are medium-term type contracts that we've put in place. So we feel good about it. But during the ramp-up, we've got contracts that are available for these volumes. Now as far as the overall LNG market, it's lousy. When you look at the spot cargoes and prices, and I expect we're going to go through a challenging -- as an industry, we're going to go through a challenging period for any of volumes that will be sold spot into the marketplace."

Maybe you've talked kind of indirectly a bit about your view towards the short cycle on the U.S. onshore in the near term, and I appreciate some of that color. But can you talk about trends and activity levels in volumes, in particularly in the Permian? And I guess, just in the broader sense, how you look to manage the shorter cycle spend over the near to medium term? I mean it sounds like it's clearly taking preference over long cycle spend. But what's dictating the difference between spending $3 billion or $2 billion or $1.5 billion? So how do you manage that over the medium term?"

We have been on a pathway in the Permian. First, assessing what we have. So we've been drilling both vertical and horizontal wells. Over the last year, we've really converted our entire program to horizontal wells and really getting -- an overused term, getting our factory model in place, and we've done that. And our costs are now very competitive with some of the best in the business. So that is taking place, and we want to continue that effort. Our view is not that prices are going to stay at the low range they are today. But part of living within your means is limiting just how many rigs you deploy. We've got 6 operated rigs today. We've got 14 n-o [ph] JV rigs that are operating today. We think that's about the right balance. We have flexibility to move up. And what I've told our people, if they stay on the cost trajectory that they are, we're going to look to fund them. The economics in some of the best areas at strip type prices work. They're not as good as we'd like at higher prices but they work. And so that obviously is guiding us. But I would hate to lose the momentum that we have in the Permian with some of the cost reduction efforts we have underway. And we've told you, we've got 3,000 locations that we think are -- meet economic thresholds at $50. So obviously prices aren't $50 today, but it's indicative of the strength of the portfolio that we have."

You're right, it is very tough times. A couple of thoughts that I'll give you. One, I think the cost reductions we're going after, most of them will be permanent. For example, the efficiencies that we've gained in our drilling, those are permanent regardless of what happens to rig rates going forward, so whether it's a deepwater that I talked about earlier or onshore, so that's number one. Number two, I think the benefits that we're taking on in some of our organization and some of our structures, I think a lot of that will be permanent. And I think we've undervalued what simplicity in org structures can provide. So obviously, we're taking out some layers. We've got rolling reorganizations that are being implemented around the world, and I think that simplicity and clarity will be a positive for the business. In terms of resource capture, there are better opportunities today than there might have been a year ago. And the balance between what I'll say the expectations and the value of resource is getting better aligned. So there are opportunities emerging. I mean, our priority is, obviously, the things I've been talking about this morning. But we are in a resource business, and you do want to be attentive to the opportunities that are out there."

Our base decline has been good because we've operated very reliably, and we've actually gotten quite efficient in our business. So we have been able to mitigate the declines. We've also flagged though that with the lower level of spending on base business, infill drilling in places like Bakersfield and elsewhere, you are going to see declines slightly higher. So that's why we've suggested that, and we do expect to see that across the industry. The history has shown during downturns like this, you can see an increase of a 1% or 2% industry-wide in that base decline. So that is -- I think that's clear. In terms of the resiliency that we've seen in production, it's partly related to that, but it's -- to me, it's been -- if you look at 2015, the impact of projects that were in flight has probably been more than we, as an industry, anticipated. So we're not the only ones with Jack/St. Malos and Bibiyanas and other projects that are under construction that are coming up. Secondly, of course, you've had the impact of hedges in the unconventional business and the brief uptick that took place in the middle of 2015 in prices did allow additional hedges. So you've still got a few hedges that are out there in the industry in 2016 that will allow some level of activity. But increasingly, all that's wearing off. As all the projects come online, as base business declines start to take over and as hedges are no longer available. And so I think that's why you're seeing those volumes. The other piece that I've consistently said has been underrepresented is the stress around the world, the stress on host governments, the stress on those government partners, national oil companies and others. And you've seen announcements that have been made because while we tend to think of living within our means as a function of forward capital spend, for host governments living within their means is social. The choice between social spending and reinvesting in the business. And you've seen some of those choices play out in the guidance that's been given to -- by host governments to national oil companies in certain countries. And so I think all of the cumulative weight of all this action will tend to bring things into balance. And you still have potential sources of supply out there. Obviously, Iran is bringing volumes on, but I think the trend is inexorable."

So how much volume potentially variances there in the start-ups, the divestments, the price effects and the spend levels? Because it feels like that 100,000 variance is actually not that wide. It seems big in percentage but not so much in volume."

The range is wide and you've got multiple moving parts in the business. Let me see if I can give you a little bit of color. Just if you look at the difference between $30 and $60 per barrel just on price effects, it can be over 100,000 barrels a day for that alone. And so you're right, there is a range there. And what happens in a place like Indonesia, for example, for a given level of spend and you have cost barrel reimbursement, the lower the price, the more barrels you get. And these curves aren't all linear in different locations around the world. So there is a considerable variability from price alone. If you think about ramp-up of production, I'll give you an example on Gorgon. Gorgon, the 3 trains in Gorgon, our share is a little over 200,000 barrels a day. So if you think about each train is 65,000 to 70,000 barrels a day. And we've said that we expect production within -- to commence within a few weeks. There's an industry curve. The industry average is around ramp-up schedule that takes place over a period of months. To the extent you're at the high end of that range where you have a smooth start-up. We have the well capacity. So you could have a very rapid ramp-up. Our people in Australia don't know what they don't know, and so we have taken more of an average approach. And to the extent you encounter something unusual, you can be on the downside of that. Our people in Angola LNG at this point are pretty gun shy because we've had challenges, but that's 60,000 barrels a day. And we've said that we expect to be introducing gas later this quarter, and to have cargoes in the second quarter. But there's variability around that in the ramp-up, and so all of those -- and by the way, there's a second train at Gorgon as well later this year. So all of those can impact the pace of development. And then, there's just the outright spend that's a function of rigs and activity. I think it's fair to say that if we keep seeing prices in the low 30s, we're going to drop rigs as the price moves on. And then the last piece and it's one that I won't provide much in the way of specifics is really divestments because we've indicated for example that our shallow water, our shelf activities, that we have packages for sale out there, and those have some volumes attached to them. And then there is some other potential assets in the upstream that are under consideration, but it really depends on getting value and the timing of those. And so that is why you get a range and you are correct, the range can be broader than indicated there, but that we -- I felt if I give you any broader range, you'd say this is wasn't very helpful."

Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. 
Turning to Slide 3. Today, we announced a quarterly loss and annual results that were significantly below prior years. Pat will walk you through the financial details, but prior to that, I would like to provide a few thoughts. 
In 2015, we delivered strong underlying operating results. We had one of our best years in personal safety, process safety and environmental performance. On most measures, we either matched 2014's record low or set new lows in 2015. The downstream business produced strong financial performance underpinned by one of the best years ever in terms of facility utilization and reliability. In upstream, we grew production by 2%, within the guidance we provided a year ago. Additionally, we logged a 5-year reserve replacement ratio of 113%. 
Despite the strong operating results, an oversupplied market led prices to fall to levels not seen since 2014. As expected, our financial results suffered. Across the corporation, we are responding to this low price environment. Our priorities remain completing projects under construction and reducing spend, both operating expense and capital, to levels consistent with current conditions. We will also continue to divest assets where we can obtain a good value. Our #1 financial priority is to maintain and grow the dividend. We have a strong balance sheet for precisely transition times like this. Pat will now take you through our financial results."

Thanks, John. I will be presenting 3 slides on our financial results. Additional earnings and production variance slides along with the tabulation of special items are available in the Appendix section of the presentation on our website. 
Turning now to Slide 4, an overview of our financial performance. The company's fourth quarter loss was $588 million or $0.31 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange, impairments and other special items, earnings for the quarter totaled $491 million or $0.26 per share. For the year, earnings were $4.6 billion or $5.6 billion, excluding special items and foreign exchange. Return on capital employed was 2.5%, and our debt ratio at year-end was approximately 20%. During the fourth quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends, bringing our total for the year to $8 billion or $4.28 per share. 2015 was the 28th consecutive year of annual per share dividend increases. 
Turning to Slide 5. Cash generated from operations was $4.6 billion during the fourth quarter and $19.5 billion for the full year. Fourth quarter cash flow declined because of lower commodity prices and lower downstream margins. Proceeds from asset sales for 2015 were $5.7 billion, bringing our 2-year total to more than $11 billion. Cash capital expenditures were $7.4 billion for the quarter and $29.5 billion for the full year. At year-end, our cash and cash equivalents totaled more than $11 billion. During 2015, we borrowed approximately $11 billion. And at year-end, our net debt stood at $27 billion, resulting in a net debt ratio of approximately 15%. 
Slide 6 compares 2015 full year earnings with 2014. Earnings for 2015 were $4.6 billion or approximately $14.7 billion lower than the 2014 results. Special items such as asset impairments, project suspensions and other charges along with lower gains on asset sales reduced earnings between periods by $3.1 billion, while the change in foreign exchange impacts increased earnings by approximately $300 million. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased $14.6 billion between periods as lower realizations were only slightly offset by higher liftings, lower operating costs and other items. Downstream results excluding special items and foreign exchange increased by $2.2 billion, primarily due to higher margins. The variance in the other segment primarily reflects lower tax items.

We are aggressively reducing investment and driving cost out of our business. During 2015, total spend was down approximately $9 billion or more than 12%. Capital outlays alone were down $6 billion. Part of this reduction",1410,"Thanks, Pat. Turning to Slide 7. We are aggressively reducing investment and driving cost out of our business. During 2015, total spend was down approximately $9 billion or more than 12%. Capital outlays alone were down $6 billion. Part of this reduction was long scheduled as in-progress major capital projects were completed and outlays ramped down. In addition, capital expenditure savings were achieved because of deliberate choices being made to reprioritize and repace investments and by challenging supply chain costs. Operating expenses also declined between years. The largest impact occurred in our upstream and corporate segments, reflecting purposeful initiatives to rationalize headcount and boost workflow efficiencies. In upstream, declining cost and growing production led to a lower operating cost per barrel, which is expected to exceed 10% when the final results are reported in our 10-K. 
Looking to 2016, we expect to see additional spend reduction in the range of 13% to 18% as the full year run rate effects of many of the 2015 initiatives come to bear and incremental cost-saving projects are implemented. 
Turn to Slide 8. Our investment priorities remain consistent. We will fund investments to ensure safe, reliable operations, complete the projects already under construction, enable investment in high-return short-cycle opportunities and preserve options for viable long-cycle projects. 
In December, we announced the 2016 capital program of $26.6 billion, which was within the guidance range provided on our third quarter earnings call. Since then, market conditions have deteriorated, and we will be responsive. Flexibility in our capital program allows discretion in our spend with a likely outcome for 2016 being near the bottom of our guidance range. 
Looking beyond 2016, our flexibility will continue to increase, and we expect further reductions in our capital program. 
Turn to Slide 9. Divestitures are a normal part of our portfolio work. We will divest assets that no longer have a strategic fit or do not compete for capital with our other investment alternatives. Our asset sales program has been successful as well-timed transactions have captured good value and generated $11.5 billion in cash through the end of 2015. Over 2016 and '17, we are targeting another $5 billion to $10 billion in investments. Publicly known in-progress transactions include New Zealand and South Africa downstream businesses, the Hawaii refinery, upstream and pipeline assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf and gas storage assets in Canada. Additional opportunities are being pursued and will be disclosed in due course when commercial sensitivities permit. In all cases, we will only sell assets where we can realize fair value. 
Turn to Slide 10. In 2015, we grew annual production by 2%. Ramp-ups at major capital projects, including Jack/St. Malo and Tubular Bells in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Bibiyana expansion in Bangladesh, along with shale and tight production growth of approximately 30%, contributed to increased volumes. Additionally, current prices benefited production through PSC and other entitlement effects. Offsetting the increases was the effect of a shut-in of the Partitioned Zone production, the impact of asset sales and a base decline of less than 2%. 
Our -- for 2016, our production guidance is a range of flat to 4% growth. The uncertainty is a reflection of market conditions, current activities and divestments. To clarify, production from the Partitioned Zone remains shut in. The exact timing of production restart is unknown and dependent on dispute resolutions between sovereign states. Contributions from major capital project start-ups and ramp-ups will be significant in 2016, and small movements in timing or the pace of ramp-ups can make a significant difference in annual production. Uncertainty in the exact timing and precise composition of asset divestments will be another variable because we are value-driven on all sales. 
Finally, current market conditions will create impacts related to PSC and other pricing-related entitlement effects. Additionally, low prices will restrict our overall spend levels which, in turn, will result in somewhat higher base decline rates. 
Turning to Slide 11. Our reserve replacement in 2015 was 107%. We saw significant adds in our shale and tight assets, which reflect strong well performance results and new geologic data in these plays. Additional volumes were booked based upon development drilling results at Wheatstone. Strong base business performance resulted in positive reserve revisions including Tengiz, Thailand, Nigeria and the Gulf of Mexico. Commodity price impact benefited entitlement volumes for profit-sharing and variable royalty contracts. Our 5-year reserve replacement ratio is 113%. 
Now let's talk about progress on our major capital projects starting with Gorgon. Turn to Slide 12, at Gorgon, system commissioning from Train 1 is in the final stages with key process units starting up, a cooldown cargo delivered and system cooling underway. The first LNG production is expected within the next few weeks with first cargo anticipated soon after that. We will be ramping up Train 1 in the months ahead. Gas for Train 1 startup will come from Io-Jansz wells. These wells have been successfully flow tested, and initial performance indications look good. 
On Trains 2 and 3, all modules have been delivered to site, and construction is progressing. Lessons learned from Train 1 are being applied and key milestones have been achieved on schedule, with start-ups expected at approximately 6-month intervals after Train 1. 
Turning to Wheatstone on Slide 13. On the upstream portion of the project, hookup and commissioning of the offshore platform is progressing. The trunkline is ready for service, and the final tie-in work is ongoing. 6 of 9 wells are drilled and completed, offering sufficient well capacity for the first train. At the plant site, the operations center and LNG loading jetty are complete and tank hydro-testing is ongoing. As previously communicated, initial module fabrication in Malaysia was delayed. We were successful in mitigating further delays, and all modules required for Train 1 are now on site. Piping and cabling work is ongoing. The pace of this work will determine critical path towards first LNG, which is expected to be midyear 2017. Train 2 module deliveries are underway and on track. 
Turning to Slide 15. I've just run through the steps we've already taken to improve our financial results and to be responsive to current market conditions. On the elements we control, operating expenses, capital outlays and project execution, you can expect even more improvements in 2016. However, price remains a significant uncertainty. I'll come back to that in just a minute. 
What I would like to talk about is other projects that we have that are also contributing to our performance. If you look at the chart on Page 14, you'll see that we have significant progress on new projects. We have the Lianzi and Moho Nord, which came on in the fourth quarter; Chuandongbei. The first train to Chuandongbei has come online, and here in January of 2016, we're seeing progress on Angola LNG as recommissioning is underway. We expect to introduce gas to the plant later this quarter and have first LNG cargo in the second quarter. Mafumeira Sul in Angola, Bangka in Indonesia and Alder in the North Sea are also progressing towards expected start-up later in the year. 
I mentioned that price is a very significant uncertainty to us going forward. If you look at Slide 15, you'll see a chart that was put together by Wood Mac. This obviously represents a significant source of uncertainty in cash flows going forward. But consistent with many of you, we believe demand will continue to grow. The larger wild card or uncertainty, if you will, is supply. Non-OPEC liquids production, which is shown on this chart, remained much more resilient in 2015 than most predicted. 
With a significant contraction in global investment caused by low prices, the world would see supplies drop off. Wood Mac shows that occurring this year thereby pushing the oil market into better balance. Until that balance occurs, prices will continue to be constrained, and the financial damage to the energy sector seen in 2015 will continue. Relative to balance sheet strength and growing flexibility on our spend, Chevron will be advantaged relative to the others in this industry as prices rebound. We are well positioned to benefit when the market does balance and prices begin to rise because of the leverage that we have and our growing production profile. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. [Operator Instructions] We will do our best to get all of your questions answered. So Jonathan, please open the lines."

On the third quarter call, you built us a bridge to cover the dividend with free cash flow by 2017, which looked fairly reasonable on the $50-or-so environment, and you highlight the flexibility for 2016 in the slide. So I guess, I was wondering just looking out to 2017, if we're sub-$50, how low can you realistically go with additional CapEx and OpEx cuts before you feel like you might need asset sales or the balance sheet to bridge the gap? Is there a level of CapEx you really don't want to go below?"

And Phil, we're obviously working that number very closely.

The level of spend -- if we continue to see the kinds of prices that we're seeing now, the cost of goods and services will continue to decline. We've got the impact of foreign exchange rates, et cetera. The biggest change between what we'll spend this year and next year is really the ramp down from major capital projects. So for example, this year, we'll be spending about $6 billion on LNG projects around the world. Obviously, finishing Angola LNG and then as we wind down Gorgon and have a little more spend on Wheatstone, we expect next year that spend will be under $2 billion. So you gain $4 billion right there, and then our flexibility grows as time goes by. We obviously have to invest to keep our operations reliable. We will still have some projects that are under construction and being completed and additional commitments in drilling off of platforms and things of that sort. But I think our flexibility is significant. We gave you a range of $20 billion to $24 billion, but we're going to continue to drive that number down. I guess my overall message is that we're going to continue to live within our means that we have, and it obviously makes sense to finish the projects under construction. We have a strong balance sheet. And maybe I'll offer a couple of comments in that area because a lot of people ask. I've given the priority as to pay and grow the dividend, and in order to do that, obviously, you do have to invest in the business because we are a depleting resource business. So those are always the first 2 priorities that we have, consistent with good economics on the spending. We've indicated that we're in a long-cycle business. And in such a long-cycle business where you can have ups and downs in the commodity markets and you get started on long-cycle projects, you need a strong balance sheet. And so we have always advertised that and indicated that a AA rating was what we were looking for. And that was -- that's really indicative of needing to have a strong balance sheet. But the reason you keep a strong balance sheet is so you can withstand the ups and downs of the business. And right now, we're in the downs with prices low, and so we'll use our balance sheet this year, almost regardless of where prices are during the year. And we're going to cut costs. We're going to reduce spend where we can, and that flexibility grows in time. We work very closely with the rating agencies. We talk to rating agencies. They see our internal forecasts around our business. They see more than you do, in other words. And so we'll be very clear where our priorities are, where the visibility is, and then they have to do their job. But we think that we will retain a very strong balance sheet and the ability to withstand these ups and downs."

And the next phase of opportunity there is the Wellhead Pressure Management Project and the future growth project. And we've been working this for some time. We consciously delayed FID. When prices came down, we consciously delayed FID so that we could get additional definition around the project, get greater certainty around what the costs would be and, frankly, to drive costs down given the opportunity that is present given the conditions in the industry. And we've had some success with that. But we're not at the point where we're ready to take FID today with low prices that we're seeing. We're working closely with our partners to ensure that we have adequate funding for the project and to further take costs down. We have been pacing investment. We've been doing critical infrastructure work. But we're still working this project to get it in condition for FID.

There's the uncertainty of exchange rates and things of that sort, but I don't want to flag a significant reduction below the range, below the $26.6 billion that's in our budget and below the range that we've talked about because I don't want to shut-in all rigs around the world, for example. There, obviously, are things that you could do that I don't think are the proper things to do given our expectations going forward. We've -- for example, we've done terrific work in the Permian Basin to get our costs down. And we want to keep that momentum going. So we have 6 operated rigs. There are 14 non-operated rigs. We want to continue that activity. Our group has done a terrific job of getting costs down. And obviously, at $30, every business is stressed, but we think that supplies are going to be needed, and we want to continue the activity that we have there. We need to continue to drive down cost but we want to continue that activity. So there's a little bit more room, but I don't want to flag something outside the range. Maybe I'll let -- I offered some comments on sort of the philosophy. Maybe I'll let Pat talk a little bit about interaction with the rating agencies and our view on what sort of minimum requirements might be."

They've indicated that many of the companies are up for review. I am certain that Chevron will be in that queue right after the first tiering goes through. So if a downgrade does occur and, I think they've been moving in that direction, but if that were to occur, we would not be the only one that, that would happen to. I don't see it materially impacting our cost of funds or materially impacting our ability to secure financing. And in terms of a minimum, I guess, I don't think of it that way. We have a strong balance sheet even if there were to be a downgrade. We have a very strong balance sheet, amongst the strongest in the industry. And we've already committed and said multiple times that we are going to get balanced. We will live within our cash flows.

And it's one of the areas that, I think, we and others in the industry are looking at very closely. And I guess, if I can take just a second and to sort of -- to back up a little bit, if you look at the macro environment on where supply is going to come from to meet any demand estimate that might be out there, the world's going to need deepwater oil. It is a significant resource and, over time, those barrels are going to be needed. Now right now, the costs in the deepwater haven't come down quite as fast as they have onshore. We obviously have seen some rig rate reductions, but in general, as we get to deeper and deeper water, some projects are challenged. We have mentioned last year in our Analyst Meeting that we felt it would take larger accumulations to make some of these deepwater projects successful. So the precise numbers are being worked, but you're going to need bigger accumulations and larger hubs in order to justify the infrastructure. And then tiebacks, similarly, will need somewhat higher prices. We have some special charges in the fourth quarter and $0.5 billion was writing off Buckskin and Moccasin. And that's a project that we thought would go forward. First, we thought it might be -- it might have the potential to be a hub and then we thought it had the potential to be a tieback. And I won't say that, that project couldn't have gone forward and that it wouldn't meet minimum thresholds depending upon your forward view of prices. But relative to our alternatives, we felt that for the foreseeable future, we've got better places to put our money. And so we made a very difficult decision to not go forward with that project. And so the clock was ticking where it was going to require a couple billion dollars of investments over the next few years and we just felt during -- over the next few years, we are going to have a better places to put our money, notably the Permian. So it's -- there are tough choices being made. Now we have a good position in deepwater, we've been as successful as anyone there. And we have been successful in driving costs down. We've seen -- I mean, really unbelievable progress last year. We had a 30% reduction in days per 10,000 feet in '15 versus '14. So our experience in the Lower Tertiary, in particular, we're getting better and better at understanding it and driving costs down. We're encouraged by what we've got at Anchor, we've got some appraisal work that's undergoing there. We've got another potential hub development with a group of fields that we had put together with a couple of partners in the industry to try to create a hub class development. And -- but this is a work in progress for us to make sure we can have a resource cost balance to make these projects attractive to meet our thresholds. I'm confident we'll be able to do that. It's just that we were pushed with Buckskin and Moccasin and you're seeing others make similar choices if it doesn't quite fit relative to their alternatives."

In 2018, you'll have a full year of production obviously from our big LNG projects, which you won't have in '17. We also have other projects that remain under construction now that will come on during that period, projects like Hebron in Canada and Big Foot and others that will come on in that window. So we'll have a continuing momentum from those projects, and we'll be ramping up our shale activity during that period notably in the Permian. So I think the profile will be attractive beyond 2017. Now ultimately, the cumulative effect of the reductions in capital, if they persist at a low level, will be felt. But I think we'll have a little more resilience than people think. Now that's other things being equal, depending upon where prices are, depending upon asset sales and things of that sort. But in terms of what sort of spend do you need to sustain production indefinitely, that will be a function of a lot of things, notably the cost environment that we see. I do think that our position in the Permian gives us a little bit of an advantage over others during this period because you've seen some of the numbers we've given you previously, we have the capability to ramp that up and mitigate some of the declines. So even if we see a slight increase in our base decline, which has been tracking at under 2%, even if that goes up a little bit, we should be able to substantially mitigate a lot of that through the activity that we have in the shale. But we'll try to give you a little more -- a little longer-term outlook in our upcoming meeting in March, if that's okay."

Obviously, there were costs in goods and services and our procurement group is having a fair degree of success. I will say we've had more success in the U.S. than internationally, number one. And so we'll continue to drive that hard. That's just a function of contracts and the competitive environment overseas. So one, we'll be working that very hard. We'll be working additional efficiencies. Just as an example, our -- we haven't -- we still have reorganizations in flight. So our employee count was down about 3,200 between the end of '14 to the end of '15. There are another 4,000 coming this year, and a lot of that work is ongoing right now. So we're being careful. We're pretty thoughtful about the way we do this sort of work to make sure that we keep the right people in our organization for the longer term. But the reality is activity is likely to be lower, and we do have a number of projects that will be ramping down, and that we're going to work to be fair about how we do that so that we keep a lot of the great talent that we have that's been working around the world. But there's no question. We're looking at organizations and have a number of reorganizations in flight. So our desire is to keep moving that. Now I will say on a dollar basis, when you're growing production and bringing on new assets, you have operating expense that you will incur. That's why we gave you the unit OpEx number. But we drove that one down. It will be -- there's still some final allocations for what goes in the 10-K in the oil and gas disclosure but it's down over $2 a barrel. And I think that general trend, we're going to continue to drive that number down. Remember in our OpEx, 40% of our OpEx is downstream. And our downstream had record performance this year and, as you know, they've had restructuring underway for some time. And it's not that they're immune from some of the efforts we have to reduce cost, but I don't think you'll see a structural shift in our downstream cost. The corporate center, we've obviously looked at and made some significant changes. A lot of people left the payroll in December, and so those benefits will be felt in the ongoing work that I've described in the upstream. So my message is we're driving it hard, but we're trying to be thoughtful so that we keep the talent we need for the long haul in the organization."

When you start up midyear, you don't start up at 80,000. You start out at something lower than that because the facilities have been mothballed and preserved for a period of time. So that's what's reflected. To the extent that agreement is reached and there have been discussions, to the extent agreement is reached and it started up sooner, it'll be to the higher end of that range; and to the extent that it continues, the bottom of the range is 0, if they don't start up at all this year."

I think it's a terrible market to be trying to sell most assets out there, particularly, obviously oil-related assets. And that's why I've been pretty circumspect around asset sales. We sold $11 billion over the last 2 years, but we're giving you a $5 billion to $10 billion for the next 2 years in the numbers that I've given you. And from a strategic point of view, there are some opportunities out there that, I think, will be tough to execute. And if we can't execute them, we won't sell them. If you look at the kinds of things we have sold, we've gotten very good value. So for example, the last 2 years, there was a lot of strength in the infrastructure market, selling pipelines, for example. And on strategy grounds and on valuation grounds, we felt that we were going to limit our investments in the pipeline business to those that are critical to our upstream and downstream sector and we can sell those, things like Caltex Australia. We thought values were very strong and assets had -- we've been very well-aligned with them, but that they were heading off potentially in a growth direction, and we felt that from our strategic point of view that it might -- it be best to exit when we did. So we've been very careful, and I can tell you, the assets going forward, we don't advertise them. But if you look at the ones where there's information in the public domain, I think you'll see that those are assets where there are potential buyers out there at good value.

And in some cases where you have -- where you bid contracts and the terms and conditions are fixed, you are where you are. But on anything where you have not taken FID, you have some flexibility to go back to the providers of those services. And that's why we've delayed our costs. I mean, part of the recycle of projects is to see if there's a different development scheme and things like that. For example, Rosebank has a different development scheme. But part of it is also to be sure you can capture the cost reductions that are available -- that might be available in the marketplace. And sometimes, you have to just say ""We're not going to do this if we don't get better costs,"" and that tends to focus partners and others. So we expect to see declining breakevens as a result of those initiatives both to reframe projects in some cases or to try to drive costs out. In terms of what we've got actually planned, most of the effort -- most of the things that we would call FIDs are really things like infill drilling. So for example, the next phase of drilling at Agbami, the next phase of drilling at Jack/St. Malo, which are utilizing existing rigs and drilling off of existing -- to support existing infrastructure. In terms of big, new, greenfield projects, it's relatively few. There are some that could be in the budget, but it's going to depend on that price-cost balance I've been talking about.

Our view is not that prices are going to stay at the low range they are today. But part of living within your means is limiting just how many rigs you deploy. We've got 6 operated rigs today. We've got 14 NOJV rigs that are operating today. We think that's about the right balance. We have flexibility to move up. And what I've told our people, if they stay on the cost trajectory that they are, we're going to look to fund them. The economics in some of the best areas at strip-type prices work.

Secondly, of course, you've had the impact of hedges in the unconventional business and the brief uptick that took place in the middle of 2015 in prices did allow additional hedges. So you've still got a few hedges that are out there in the industry in 2016 that will allow some level of activity. But increasingly, all that's wearing off as all the projects come online, as base business declines start to take over and as hedges are no longer available. And so I think that's why you're seeing those volumes. The other piece that I've consistently said has been underrepresented is the stress around the world, the stress on host governments, the stress on those government partners, national oil companies and others. And you've seen announcements that have been made because while we tend to think of living within our means as a function of forward capital spend, for host governments, living within their means is social, the choice between social spending and reinvesting in the business. And you've seen some of those choices play out in the guidance that's been given to -- by host governments to national oil companies in certain countries. And so I think all of the cumulative weight of all this action will tend to bring things into balance. And you still have potential sources of supply out there. Obviously, Iran is bringing volumes on, but I think the trend is inexorable."

So how much volume potentially variances there in the start-ups, the divestments, the price effects and the spend levels? Because it feels like that 100,000 variance actually is not that wide. It seems big in percentage but not so much in volume."

The range is wide and you've got multiple moving parts in the business. Let me see if I can give you a little bit of color. Just if you look at the difference between $30 and $60 per barrel, just on price effects, it can be over 100,000 barrels a day for that alone. And so you're right, there is a range there. And what happens in a place like Indonesia, for example, for a given level of spend and you have cost barrel reimbursement, the lower the price, the more barrels you get. And these curves aren't all linear in different locations around the world. So there is a considerable variability from price alone. If you think about ramp-up of production, I'll give you an example on Gorgon. Gorgon, the 3 trains in Gorgon, our share is a little over 200,000 barrels a day. So if you think about each train is 65,000 to 70,000 barrels a day. And we've said that we expect production within -- to commence within a few weeks. There's an industry curve. The industry average is around ramp-up schedule that takes place over a period of months. To the extent you're at the high end of that range where you have a smooth start-up, we have the well capacity. So you could have a very rapid ramp-up. Our people in Australia don't know what they don't know, and so we have taken more of an average approach. And to the extent you encounter something unusual, you can be on the downside of that. Our people in Angola LNG at this point are pretty gun shy because we've had challenges, but that's 60,000 barrels a day. And we've said that we expect to be introducing gas later this quarter, and to have cargoes in the second quarter. But there's variability around that in the ramp-up, and so all of those -- and by the way, there's a second train at Gorgon as well later this year. So all of those can impact the pace of development. And then, there's just the outright spend that's a function of rigs and activity. I think it's fair to say that if we keep seeing prices in the low 30s, we're going to drop rigs as the price moves on. And then the last piece, and it's one that I won't provide much in the way of specifics, is really divestments because we've indicated, for example, that our shallow water, our shelf activities, that we have packages for sale out there, and those have some volumes attached to them. And then there is some other potential assets in the upstream that are under consideration, but it really depends on getting value and the timing of those, and so that is why you get a range. And you are correct, the range can be broader than indicated there, but that we -- I felt if I give you any broader range, you'd say this wasn't very helpful."

He also oversees our Centers of Excellence for upstream, including drilling. Also joining me on the call is Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
I'll begin with key messages from our March 2016 Security Analyst Meeting, followed by a recap of our first quarter 2016 financial results. Joe will provide some color around our spend reduction initiatives and discuss recent updates on key projects, prior to my concluding remarks.
Turning now to Slide 3. Our Analyst Day was about 7 weeks ago now, and I thought it would be worthwhile to reiterate the primary messages from that series of sessions. Preserving and growing the dividend is our first priority. Our intention is to be able to cover the dividend in 2017. Our capital spend profile is coming down. We are completing major capital projects already under construction but otherwise reducing long-cycle spend. We are lowering our cost structure to better match a low price environment by improving efficiencies, streamlining the organization and working with suppliers to achieve cost reductions.
At the same time, we expect our cash inflows to be growing. Production increases will occur as we bring on and ramp up projects. While volume growth is sensitive to any number of unknowns such as prices, divestments, ramp-up profile, we anticipate volume growth through the end of the decade using reasonable estimates for these and other uncertainties.
The cash generation of the new assets coming online is substantial to the point where these production adds are expected to raise the overall cash margin per barrel of the entire portfolio even absent any increase in price.
This year, we plan to use some of our borrowing capacity to complete projects. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, and we believe we can come through the lows of this price cycle with long-term financial strength intact. Our investment will shift to a higher proportion of short-cycle projects. Not only are many of these brownfield opportunities, but they will give us greater capital flexibility going forward to help limit further debt increases. 
Finally, we are focused on improving financial returns, reducing pre-productive capital, moving towards more short-cycle higher-return investments, lowering our cost structure and improving execution on major capital projects.
Turning to Slide 4, an overview of our financial performance. The company's first quarter loss was $725 million or negative $0.39 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange and special items, as detailed in an appendix slide, the loss for the quarter totaled $211 million or a negative $0.11 per share. Cash from operations for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and our debt ratio at quarter end was 22%. Our net debt ratio was 18%.
During the first quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we announced the dividend of $1.07 per share payable to stockholders of record as of May 19. We currently yield 4.2%.
Turning to Slide 5. Cash generated from operations was $1.1 billion during the first quarter. Obviously, upstream cash generation has been heavily penalized by low commodity prices. Downstream continues to generate strong cash flow, although seasonal patterns are evident. 
During the quarter, operating cash flow reflected about $1 billion of working capital requirements as well as certain pension contributions. In addition, affiliate dividends were modest in the quarter, a pattern that is clearly price-related as we expect cash generation to improve going forward, as our costs come down and as prices move up. 
Cash capital expenditures were $5.6 billion, a decrease of approximately 27% from first quarter 2015. At quarter end, our cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $8.9 billion, and our net debt position was about $33 billion.
Turning to Slide 6. Slide 6 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. First quarter 2016 results were $3.3 billion lower than first quarter 2015 results. About half of this quarter-on-quarter decline was in special items and foreign exchange. Overall, special items accounted for a negative variance between quarters of $755 million, the bulk of which related to last year's recognition of both asset sale gain and the favorable impact of changes in U.K. petroleum tax regulation.
A swing in foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings by $900 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations and do not generally affect the cash.
Excluding special items and foreign exchange, upstream earnings decreased approximately $1.6 billion between quarters. Lower crud realizations were partially offset by higher sales volume and lower operating and exploration expenses. The realization change was in line with our sensitivity of $350 million per dollar change in Brent.
Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by approximately $475 million, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margin. The variance in the other segment was primarily from lower corporate tax items. 
Turning to Slide 7. I'll now compare results for first quarter 2016 with the fourth quarter 2015. First quarter results were $137 million lower than fourth quarter. A swing in special items, mainly the absence of fourth quarter's impairment and project suspension charges, increased earnings by $930 million. Foreign exchange impacts went the other way, decreasing earnings by $365 million between periods. Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by approximately $750 million between quarters, primarily reflecting lower realizations, again in line with our sensitivity.
Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were lower by $163 million. Weaker refining margins were partially offset by stronger trading results, lower operating expenses and the absence of year-end inventory charges from a draw into higher cost to prior year layers.
The variance in the other segment largely reflects lower corporate charges.
Slide 8 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015. Net production decreased by 7,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital project ramp-ups, primarily at Gorgon and Australia, Chuandongbei in China and Lianzi in in West Africa, increased production by 11,000 barrels per day. The absence of planned and unplanned downtime, mainly at Tengiz and Kazakhstan, increased production by 25,000 barrels per day between periods. Shale and tight production declined 5,000 barrels a day between quarters as external constraints such as weather impact and downtime at a third party processing facility impacted the Permian. Price and cost recovery effects associated with production sharing and variable royalty contracts decreased production by 18,000 barrels per day between quarters as lower crude prices were more than offset by the impact from lower spend on cost recovery.
The remaining variance in the base business and other primarily reflects natural field declines and other adjustments. All this said, first quarter volumes are up about 2% from full year 2015 production. This is right in the middle of the guidance range we provided in January and reaffirmed in March. We still believe this guidance is appropriate.
Slide 9 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil-equivalent production between the first quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2015. Net production decreased by 15,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects increased production by 38,000 barrels per day, primarily due to production ramp-ups from the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Bangladesh and West Africa, in addition to start-ups at Gorgon and Australia and Chuandongbei in China. Shale and tight production increased by 37,000 barrels per day due to the growth in the Permian and Marcellus in the U.S. and the Llarden Duvernay basins in Canada. 
Volumes associated with production sharing and variable royalty contracts increased production by 16,000 barrels per day as the positive impacts from lower crude prices was partially offset by the impacts of lower spending on cost recovery.
The shut-in of operations in the Partitioned Zone decreased production by approximately 76,000 barrels per day. The decrease of 30,000 barrels per day in the base business and other bar, primarily reflects normal field declines and the higher downtime activity, partially offset by production from new wells and favorable impact from reduced external constraints.
Turning now to Slide 10. We are making good progress at reducing our spend. These charts use a rolling fourth quarter average to illustrate capital and operating expense reductions. When comparing the rolling fourth quarter average of first quarter 2016 to the same period of the prior year, capital outlays are down 19%. In December, we announced the C&E program of $26.6 billion for the year. But as we noted in March, we are now targeting closer to $25 billion for the year. As we continue to finish major capital projects under construction, we will move to an absolute lower level of annual spend in future years as evidenced by our $17 billion to $22 billion range that we've given you for 2017 to 2018. Affordability considerations at the time will be paramount in determining actual budgets. Capital intensity will be going down. Capital discipline will be going up, using the same general pattern on operating expense, same downward pattern on operating expense. Expenses continue to rise through 2014 but then notably turn south in mid-2015 as our deliberate cost savings initiatives began to take hold. The rolling first quarter 2016 average is 6% lower than the comparable figure a year ago.
There are some transitional costs such as severance and rig termination fees that are incurred as we take steps to compete more effectively in the lower price environment. Once we're through with the transition cost and as we carry on with the implementation of our various cost savings initiatives, we expect to see continued movement towards the lower sustainable cost structure. Cost reduction momentum should continue through 2016 and 2017 as the full run rate of our actions is recognized.
Joe will now walk you through some specific examples of our cost reduction efforts before offering an update on key projects."

Our efforts are focused on achieving sustainable reductions and improving efficiencies. On the organizational side, to date, we have reduced our employee headcount by more than 4,000 relative to year-end 2014, and we are on target to achieve approximately 8,000 total employee reductions by the end of 2016. We're also on target to reduce our contracted workforce by about 6,500 from 2014 levels. 
At the analyst meeting, we shared with you examples of how -- of our improved drilling efficiencies in the Permian and Gulf of Mexico. So today, let me give you an additional example from the different regions in the world. In Thailand, operational discipline and streamlined processes have enhanced drilling execution efficiency, resulting in about 45% lower average days per 10,000 feet yield in a 2-year period, as you can see in the graph. And we are continuing to outperform our regional competitors. We're also focused on improving our efficiencies in logistics. One example in West Africa includes shifting from [indiscernible] dedicated vessels to a centrally managed fleet using a decision support center. As a result of this effort, we expect to achieve savings of 30% and reduce the number of vessels in that region by about 40%. We're also continuing to take advantage of our size and scale. In a different part of the world, we are coordinating contract awards with 1 supplier across 3 different regions and reducing the number of vessels by optimizing marine vessel size.
One of our focus areas is to retain gains achieved during this industry downturn. We are doing this across the globe. For example, in one region, we are taking advantage of the current downturn to negotiate with our main supplier, lock in lower rates through 2022 and upgrade with newer and more capable equipment. It not only improve our rates but is also expected to improve our reliability. As we look ahead in the supply chain, we see opportunities for more strategic supplier relationships and standardization. At the analyst meeting, we shared with you the cost savings achieved in the oilfield category. These reductions were achieved through standardization and supply rationalization where we went from having 35 suppliers in the past to 4 going forward. On Gorgon, we have worked to standardize and intend to replicate subsea equipment, generating procurement and installation efficiencies as well as considerable cost savings. And lastly, we've been working at standardizing the valves for some time, and we'll start deploying the standard valves on future projects.
Turning to Slide 12, let me give you some project updates. At Gorgon, we commenced LNG production on March 7. We ramped up total production to approximately 90,000 barrels per day, and we shipped the first cargo on March 21. Since late March, we have incurred downtime at the plant due to mechanical issues with the propane refrigerant circuit at Train 1. Repairs to this equipment are nearing completion, and we are in the process of reinstating the propane refrigerant circuit. We expect to restart Train 1 in the next few weeks and resume LNG production within the 30- to 60-day estimate we provided previously. We still expect to achieve Train 1 ramp-up within the previous guidance of 6 to 8 months from initial start-up. Construction on Trains 2 and 3 is progressing as planned, and we anticipate these trains being ready for start-up at roughly 6 months intervals.
Turning to Slide 13. At all 9 development wells are completed. We expect to release the drilling rig in the next few months following well cleanup activities. Offshore platform hookup and commissioning is progressing on track with this work expected to be complete well in advance of plant start-up. At the plant site, piping, electrical and instrumentation work is progressing well. Our plan reflects absorbed performance rates on other Australia LNG projects. Actual rates are currently on track with our plan, and the outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017. Train 2 construction work is also progressing on schedule. 12 of 24 process modules required for Train 2 startup are now on site, and module deliveries are meeting scheduled milestones.
Turning to Slide 14. I'd like to share a brief update on the other projects, which we are expecting to start up this year. At Angola LNG, gas has been introduced into the plant, and the team is working to the start-up process with dehydration ongoing ahead of commencing liquefaction. We expect LNG production eminently and anticipate shipping the next cargo in May. At hookup and commissioning is ongoing. All structures topsides and pipelines are installed, and the living quarters platform is now occupied, enabling increased manpower on piping, electrical and commissioning work. Batch drilling of the first 10 wells is complete, and first production is expected later this year. At Chuandongbei, Train 1 started up in January, and we were able to ramp up to full capacity within 30 days. Train 2 came online in early April, and ramp-up is in progress. We expect to start Train 3 this quarter. At Alder, topside has been installed, and subsea installation work is progressing. At well completions are currently ongoing. First production is expected from both these projects later this year.
Pat will now share an update of our asset sales program."

They generate needed cash, and they enable a more strategic, effective and capital-efficient portfolio. Over the next 2 years, we are targeting $5 billion to $10 billion in sales proceeds. The assets targeted for sale are marketable, and we believe the prospective transactions are executable as well. We generally do not discuss specific assets targeted for sale until we have a transaction. However, there has been growing media coverage since our Analyst Day on a few of these prospective sales and as such, we wanted to provide updates where possible. 
The chart highlights some specific transactions that are in the public domain. You will note the vast majority of these are not oil price-sensitive and thus, we expect to be able to obtain good value on the sale. There were no significant transactions in the first quarter, but activity had picked up in the second quarter. Already known second quarter transactions include the sale of our interest in 2 gas storage facilities in Western Canada, the sale of our KLM pipeline in Western San Joaquin crude oil pipelines in California and the divestiture of 19 sales and associated assets located primarily in the Gulf of Mexico Alder shall and in Louisiana State waters.
In 2015, we signed an agreement to sell our New Zealand downstream operations subject to certain regulatory approval. Those regulatory approvals were received yesterday, and we now anticipate final closing mid-year.
Just last week, we reached an agreement to sell our assets in Hawaii. The sale includes a 58,000-barrel per day refinery, interest in a 58-site branded service station network, 4 product distribution terminals, pipeline systems and other downstream-related assets. This transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016.
In addition, we are soliciting interest to sell our 75% shareholding in South Africa downstream. We are also exploring potential interest in our geothermal business and Myanmar upstream assets. In aggregate, while it's always difficult to be precise about specific timing, we currently have line of sight on around $2 billion in proceeds, maybe a little higher for 2016. And because we have multiple transactions in the queue, including those not highlighted on the slide, we have confidence in achieving our 2-year $5 billion to $10 billion target.
Turning to Slide 16, I'd like to close with another slide from our recent investor session. It's an illustration of how we get cash balance next year. In this slide, we used $52 Brent as it was the actual average price in 2015 and in line with averages sell side analyst price targets for 2017. However, we are committed to balancing at any reasonable price. Spending will come down significantly this year and next as major development projects get finished and come online as we high grade future investments to shorter-cycle higher-return opportunity and as we get more efficient and lower our cost structure. Cash generation will grow, not only because of production but also because of accretive cash margins on the new production. We'll continue to streamline the portfolio. In short, we are taking the steps necessary to compete in the lower price environment. If a lower price environment persists for longer, we will adjust and pursue even more significant cost savings and even greater cuts in capital to continue to lower our cash flow breakeven. We intend to be a resilient competitor regardless of the price environment.
Okay. That concludes our prepared remarks. And we're now ready to take some questions. [Operator Instructions] Jonathan, please open the lines for questions."

Obviously, our immediate financial environment makes this challenging. We have long said that we'll raise the dividend when our cash flow and our earnings allow it to be sustained. And obviously, in first quarter, that was not the circumstances that we found ourselves in and, therefore, a deferral was prudent. I think going forward, the timing will obviously be dependent upon future cash, future earnings, what happens to price, what happens to our project ramp-up, how all that plays out in future quarters. We'll also have to take a look at that we think is happening to commodity prices over a longer sweep of time because, again, we're looking at a dividend being essentially a commitment in perpetuity. We're very aware of our 28-year record of consecutive annual per share payment increases, and that will be taken into account. So the board will take all this into account as it looks at dividends each and every quarter."

Well, let me start by saying that prices were very low in the first quarter. As Pat mentioned, there were more a number of onetime events in the first quarter, which adversely impacted our production. Going forward, we still expect to realize the growth range we provided at our analyst meeting. The key for us is to really exercise the things within our control, and that is to continue to drive cost down and to improve our efficiencies. And we have given several proof points in the past about how much progress we've done in that regard. We're now in full horizontal factory mode in the Permian. We brought our well cost down by about 40%, and we have about 4,000 well locations that offer us a 10% rate of return at around $50 WTI. And when you add on top of all of that the royalty advances that have, we see our activity in the Permian as being very, very strong. So the key for us is to continue to be competitive, and we do that very well because we also have a JV, so we have a good line of sight on how well other people are operating in the basin. And of course, we screen them based on our own economics and lastly, the royalty advantage give us a tremendous boost here."

But frankly, if we find ourselves in a different place, affordability is a paramount consideration here for us, and we will continue to prioritize and high grade our opportunities. Our primary methodology in terms of capital allocation starts from what do we absolutely need to do to maintain reliability, maintain the asset integrity. And after that, after we have kind of concluded what that is for the operations, then we build up our capital program after that, and we have a great deal of flexibility. So each and every one of those layers of additional spend will have significant hurdles that they have to overcome, and affordability becomes an overriding consideration. So we'll continue to manage capital down commensurate with the price environment. We'll continue to push forward with our asset sales. I mentioned only 2 billion or so line of sight, maybe a little bit more for this year, but we see our way clear to the 5 billion to 10 billion program.

There's nothing necessarily magic about the 30%. It was just an indicative place to do a measurement versus ourselves versus peers. But I would see as you go through the lows of a price cycle, you would expect your debt burden to increase into the 30%-ish range, maybe a little bit higher on a temporary basis but if you look through the whole cycle I think a good place for the company like Chevron with projects that we take on, our size our scale our scope would be probably in the low 20s through the cycle, but getting into the 30%-ish range, we could handle that if it's temporary."

In terms of the prioritization though, let me just go back to the logic and the process that we have for building up the capital program. We start with the integrity and reliability foundation and in each and every layer of projects above that competes on its merit on a returns focus kind of basis and we will balance the short cycle investment and we will balance initiation and commitment to larger, longer-cycle capital projects. Again, the only one that upsized kind of queued up here and the near term would be future growth projects. So we will take all of that into account, the overlying -- overarching objective though is to get balanced on cash in 2017. And we continue to be very focused on capital discipline, and so there will be high hurdle rates for all of the products coming forward for possible inclusion in the capital budget."

In fact, 80% of our spend, in development spend over the next few years is going to be geared towards brownfield development, such as Jack/St. Malo and Tahiti, where we actually have good economics. We've already said the single low breakeven is in the $20 to $40 Brent range. We also demonstrated tremendous improvement in drilling and completion efficiency, so we continue to bring the cost equation down. Now if are talking about new greenfield development, we got few things that need to happen there. Obviously, we need scale and the resource, but we also need to rethink about how we bring our development. We talked before about optimizing our development concept where we could be trading lower plateau and maybe NPV for greater capital efficiencies. And this is another place where we actually need our suppliers. We need to work closely with them to continue to drive the cost down. This is an important area for us to be good at, and we're committed to do that. Now in terms of how does the Permian compete, we just can't be a a Permian company. We have a lot of other places we actually have good resources. We talked about Tengiz, we talked about we talked about Indonesia. Australia is going to give us those opportunities allowed the Permian gives us tremendous advantage the size of our company will require us to actually be broader and to put our capital in places where we can get good economics but not to be solely 1 asset class company."

On the call with me today are Joe Geagea, Executive Vice President of Technology, Projects and Services. Many of you know Joe, but for those of you who don't, I thought it would be useful to highlight that he leads our technology, procurement and project functions. He also oversees our centers of excellence for upstream, including drilling. Also joining me on the call is Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We'll refer to slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
I'll begin with key messages from our March 2016 Security Analyst Meeting, followed by a recap of our first quarter 2016 financial results. Joe will provide some color around our spend reduction initiatives and discuss recent updates on key projects prior to my concluding remarks.
Turning now to Slide 3. Our Analyst Day was about 7 weeks ago now, and I thought it would be worthwhile to reiterate the primary messages from that series of sessions. Preserving and growing the dividend is our first priority. Our intention is to be able to cover the dividend in 2017. Our capital spend profile is coming down. We are completing major capital projects already under construction but otherwise reducing long-cycle spend. We are lowering our cost structure to better match a low price environment by improving efficiencies, streamlining the organization and working with suppliers to achieve cost reductions.
At the same time, we expect our cash inflows to be growing. Production increases will occur as we bring on and ramp up projects. While volume growth is sensitive to any number of unknowns such as prices, divestments, ramp up profile, we anticipate volume growth through the end of the decade using reasonable estimates for these and other uncertainties.
The cash generation of the new assets coming online is substantial to the point where these production adds are expected to raise the overall cash margin per barrel of the entire portfolio even absent any increase in price.
This year, we plan to use some of our borrowing capacity to complete projects. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, and we believe we can come through the lows of this price cycle with long term financial strength intact. Our investment will shift to a higher proportion of short-cycle projects. Not only are many of these brownfield opportunities, but they will give us greater capital flexibility going forward to help limit further debt increases. 
Finally, we are focused on improving financial returns, reducing preproductive capital, moving towards more short-cycle higher-return investments, lowering our cost structure and improving execution on major capital projects.
Turning to Slide 4, an overview of our financial performance. The company's first quarter loss was $725 million or negative $0.39 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange and special items, as detailed in an appendix slide, the loss for the quarter totaled $211 million or a negative $0.11 per share. Cash from operations for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and our debt ratio at quarter end was 22%. Our net debt ratio was 18%.
During the first quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we announced a dividend of $1.07 per share payable to stockholders of record as of May 19. We currently yield 4.2%.
Turning to Slide 5. Cash generated from operations was $1.1 billion during the first quarter. Obviously, upstream cash generation has been heavily penalized by low commodity prices. Downstream continues to generate strong cash flow, although seasonal patterns are evident. 
During the quarter, operating cash flow reflected about $1 billion of working capital requirements as well as certain pension contributions. In addition, affiliate dividends were modest in the quarter, a pattern that is clearly price related as we expect cash generation to improve going forward as our costs come down and as prices move up. 
Cash capital expenditures were $5.6 billion, a decrease of approximately 27% from first quarter 2015. At quarter end, our cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $8.9 billion, and our net debt position was about $33 billion.
Turning to Slide 6. Slide 6 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. First quarter 2016 results were $3.3 billion lower than first quarter 2015 results. About half of this quarter-on-quarter decline was in special items and foreign exchange. Overall, special items accounted for a negative variance between quarters of $755 million, the bulk of which related to last year's recognition of both asset sale gain and the favorable impact of changes in U.K. petroleum tax regulations.
A swing in foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings by $900 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations and do not generally affect cash.
Excluding special items and foreign exchange, upstream earnings decreased approximately $1.6 billion between quarters. Lower crude realizations were partially offset by higher sales volumes and lower operating and exploration expenses. The realization change was in line with our sensitivity of $350 million per dollar change in Brent.
Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by approximately $475 million, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margin. The variance in the other segment was primarily from lower corporate tax items. 
Turning to Slide 7. I'll now compare results for the first quarter 2016 with the fourth quarter 2015. First quarter results were $137 million lower than fourth quarter. A swing in special items, mainly the absence of fourth quarter's impairment and project suspension charges, increased earnings by $930 million. Foreign exchange impacts went the other way, decreasing earnings by $365 million between periods. Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by approximately $750 million between quarters, primarily reflecting lower realizations, again in line with our sensitivity.
Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were lower by $163 million. Weaker refining margins were partially offset by stronger trading results, lower operating expenses and the absence of year-end inventory charges from a draw into higher cost to prior year layers.
The variance in the other segment largely reflects lower corporate charges.
Slide 8 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015. Net production decreased by 7,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital project ramp ups, primarily at Gorgon and Australia, Chuandongbei in China, and Lianzi and Moho Nord in West Africa increased production by 11,000 barrels per day. The absence of planned and unplanned downtime, mainly at Tengiz and Kazakhstan, increased production by 25,000 barrels per day between periods. Shale and tight production declined 5,000 barrels a day between quarters as external constraints such as weather impact and downtime at a third party processing facility impacted the Permian. Price and cost recovery effects associated with production sharing and variable royalty contracts decreased production by 18,000 barrels per day between quarters as lower crude prices were more than offset by the impact from lower spend on cost recovery.
The remaining variance in the base business and other bar primarily reflects natural field declines and other adjustments. All this said, first quarter volumes are up about 2% from full year 2015 production. This is right in the middle of the guidance range we provided in January and reaffirmed in March. We still believe this guidance is appropriate.
Slide 9 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil-equivalent production between the first quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2015. Net production decreased by 15,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects increased production by 38,000 barrels per day, primarily due to production ramp ups from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Bangladesh and West Africa, in addition to start ups at Gorgon and Australia and Chuandongbei in China. Shale and tight production increased by 37,000 barrels per day due to the growth in the Permian and Marcellus in the U.S. and the Liard and Duvernay basins in Canada. 
Volumes associated with production sharing and variable royalty contracts increased production by 16,000 barrels per day as the positive impacts from lower crude prices was partially offset by the impacts of lower spending on cost recovery.
A shut-in of operations in the Partitioned Zone decreased production by approximately 76,000 barrels per day. The decrease of 30,000 barrels per day in the base business and other bar primarily reflects normal field declines and higher downtime activity, partially offset by production from new wells and favorable impact from reduced external constraints.
Turning now to Slide 10. We are making good progress at reducing our spend. These charts use a rolling 4-quarter average to illustrate capital and operating expense reductions. When comparing the rolling 4-quarter average of first quarter 2016 to the same period of the prior year, capital outlays are down 19%. In December, we announced a C&E program of $26.6 billion for the year. But as we noted in March, we are now targeting closer to $25 billion for the year. As we continue to finish major capital projects under construction, we will move to an absolute lower level of annual spend in future years as evidenced by our $17 billion to $22 billion range that we've given you for 2017 to 2018. Affordability considerations at the time will be paramount in determining actual budgets. Capital intensity will be going down. Capital discipline will be going up. You see the same general pattern on operating expense, same downward pattern on operating expense. Expenses continue to rise through 2014 but then notably turn south in mid-2015 as our deliberate cost savings initiatives began to take hold. The rolling first quarter 2016 average is 6% lower than the comparable figure a year ago.
There are some transitional costs such as severance and rig termination fees that are incurred as we take steps to compete more effectively in a lower price environment. Once we're through with the transition cost and as we carry on with the implementation of our various cost savings initiatives, we expect to see continued movement towards a lower, sustainable cost structure. Cost reduction momentum should continue through 2016 and 2017 as the full run rate of our actions is recognized.
Joe will now walk you through some specific examples of our cost reduction efforts before offering an update on key projects."

Our efforts are focused on achieving sustainable reductions and improving efficiencies. On the organizational side, to date, we have reduced our employee headcount by more than 4,000 relative to year-end 2014, and we are on target to achieve approximately 8,000 total employee reductions by the end of 2016. We're also on target to reduce our contract to workforce by about 6,500 from 2014 levels. 
At the analyst meeting, we shared with you examples of how -- of our improved drilling efficiencies in the Permian and Gulf of Mexico. So today, let me give you an additional example from a different region of the world. In Thailand, operational discipline and streamline processes have enhanced drilling execution efficiency, resulting in about 45% lower average days per 10,000 feet drilled in a 2-year period, as you can see in the graph. And we are continuing to outperform our regional competitors. We're also focused on improving our efficiencies in logistics. One example in West Africa includes shifting from department dedicated vessels to a centrally managed fleet using a decision support center. As a result of this effort, we expect to achieve savings of 30% and reduce the number of vessels in that region by about 40%. We're also continuing to take advantage of our size and scale. In a different part of the world, we are coordinating contract awards with 1 supplier across 3 different regions and reducing the number of vessels by optimizing marine vessel size.
One of our focus areas is to retain gains achieved during this industry downturn. We are doing this across the globe. For example, in one region, we are taking advantage of the current downturn to negotiate with our main supplier, lock in lower rates through 2022 and upgrade with newer and more capable equipment. It not only improved our rates but is also expected to improve our reliability. As we look ahead in the supply chain, we see opportunities for more strategic supplier relationships and standardization. At the analyst meeting, we shared with you the cost savings achieved in the oilfield Tubulars category. These reductions were achieved through standardization and supply rationalization where we went from having 35 suppliers in the past to 4 going forward. On Gorgon, we have worked to standardize and intend to replicate subsea equipment, generating procurement and installation efficiencies as well as considerable cost savings. And lastly, we've been working at standardizing the valves for some time, and we will start deploying the standard valves on future projects.
Turning to Slide 12, let me give you some project updates. At Gorgon, we commenced LNG production on March 7. We ramped up total production to approximately 90,000 barrels per day, and we shipped the first cargo on March 21. Since late March, we have incurred downtime at the plant due to mechanical issues with the propane refrigerant circuit of Train 1. Repairs to this equipment are nearing completion, and we are in the process of reinstating the propane refrigerant circuit. We expect to restart Train 1 in the next few weeks and resume LNG production within the 30- to 60-day estimate we provided previously. We still expect to achieve Train 1 ramp up within the previous guidance of 6 to 8 months from initial startup. Construction on Trains 2 and 3 is progressing as planned, and we anticipate these trains being ready for start up at roughly 6 months intervals.
Turning to Slide 13. At Wheatstone, all 9 development wells are completed. We expect to release the drilling rig in the next few months following well cleanup activities. Offshore platform hookup and commissioning is progressing on track with this work expected to be complete well in advance of plant startup. At the plant site, piping, electrical and instrumentation work is progressing well. Our plan reflects absorbed performance rates on other Australian LNG projects. Actual rates are currently on track with our plan, and the outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017. Train 2 construction work is also progressing on schedule. 12 of 24 process modules required for Train 2 startup are now on site, and module deliveries are meeting scheduled milestones.
Turning to Slide 14. I'd like to share a brief update on the other projects, which we are expecting to start up this year. At Angola LNG, gas has been introduced into the plant, and the team is working through the start-up process with dehydration ongoing ahead of commencing liquefaction. We expect LNG production imminently and anticipate shipping the next cargo in May. At Mafumeira Sul, hookup and commissioning is ongoing. All structures, topsides, and pipelines are installed. And the living quarters platform is now occupied, enabling increased manpower on piping, electrical and commissioning work. Batch drilling of the first 10 wells is complete, and first production is expected later this year. At Chuandongbei, Train 1 started up in January, and we were able to ramp up to full capacity within 30 days. Train 2 came online in early April, and ramp up is in progress. We expect to start Train 3 this quarter. At Alder, topsides have been installed, and subsea installation work is progressing. At Bangka, well completions are currently ongoing. First production is expected from both these projects later this year.
Pat will now share an update on our asset sales program."

They generate needed cash, and they enable a more strategic, effective and capital-efficient portfolio. Over the next 2 years, we are targeting $5 billion to $10 billion in sales proceeds. The assets targeted for sale are marketable, and we believe the prospective transactions are executable as well. We generally do not discuss specific assets targeted for sale until we have a transaction. However, there has been growing media coverage since our Analyst Day on a few of these prospective sales and as such, we wanted to provide updates where possible. 
The chart highlights some specific transactions that are in the public domain. You will note the vast majority of these are not oil price sensitive and thus, we expect to be able to obtain good values on the sale. There were no significant transactions in the first quarter, but activity has picked up in the second quarter. Already known second quarter transactions include the sale of our interest in 2 gas storage facilities in Western Canada, the sale of our KLM pipeline in Western San Joaquin crude oil pipelines in California and the divestiture of 19 sales and associated assets located primarily in the Gulf of Mexico outer shelf and in Louisiana State waters.
In 2015, we signed an agreement to sell our New Zealand downstream operations subject to certain regulatory approval. Those regulatory approvals were received yesterday, and we now anticipate final closing mid-year.
Just last week, we reached an agreement to sell our assets in Hawaii. The sale includes the 58,000-barrel per day refinery, interest in a 58-site branded service station network, 4 product distribution terminals, pipeline systems and other downstream-related assets. This transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016.
In addition, we are soliciting interest to sell our 75% shareholding in South Africa downstream. We are also exploring potential interest in our geothermal business and Myanmar upstream assets. In aggregate, while it's always difficult to be precise about specific timing, we currently have line of sight on around $2 billion in proceeds, maybe a little higher for 2016. And because we have multiple transactions in the queue, including those not highlighted on the slide, we have confidence in achieving our 2-year $5 billion to $10 billion target.
Turning to Slide 16, I'd like to close with another slide from our recent investor session. It's an illustration of how we get cash balance next year. In this slide, we used $52 Brent as it was the actual average price in 2015 and in line with averages sell side analyst price targets for 2017. However, we are committed to balancing at any reasonable price. Spending will come down significantly this year and next as major development projects get finished and come online as we high grade future investments to shorter-cycle higher-return opportunity and as we get more efficient and lower our cost structure. Cash generation will grow, not only because of more production but also because of accretive cash margins on the new production. We'll continue to streamline the portfolio. In short, we are taking the steps necessary to compete in a lower price environment. If a lower price environment persists for longer, we will adjust and pursue even more significant cost savings and even greater cuts in capital to continue to lower our cash flow breakeven. We intend to be a resilient competitor regardless of the price environment.
Okay. That concludes our prepared remarks. And we're now ready to take some questions. [Operator Instructions] Jonathan, please open the lines for questions."

And obviously, in first quarter, that was not the circumstances that we found ourselves in and, therefore, a deferral was prudent. I think going forward, the timing will obviously be dependent upon future cash, future earnings, what happens to price, what happens to our project ramp up, how all that plays out in future quarters. We'll also have to take a look at what we think is happening to commodity prices over a longer sweep of time because, again, we're looking at a dividend as being essentially a commitment in perpetuity. We're very aware of our 28-year record of consecutive annual per share payment increases, and that will be taken into account.

As Pat mentioned, there were a number of onetime events in the first quarter, which adversely impacted our production. Going forward, we still expect to realize the growth range we provided at our analyst meeting. The key for us is to really exercise the things within our control, and that is to continue to drive cost down and to improve our efficiencies. And we have given several proof points in the past about how much progress we've done in that regard. We're now in full horizontal factory mode in the Permian. We brought our well cost down by about 40%, and we have about 4,000 well locations that offer us a 10% rate of return at around $50 WTI. And when you add on top of all of that the royalty advantage that have, we see our activity in the Permian as being very, very strong. So the key for us is to continue to be competitive, and we do that very well because we also have a OJV, so we have a good line of sight on how well other people are operating in the basin. And of course, we screen them based on our own economics and lastly, the royalty advantage give us a tremendous boost here."

But frankly, if we find ourselves in a different place, affordability is a paramount consideration here for us, and we will continue to prioritize and high grade our opportunities. Our primary methodology in terms of capital allocation starts from what do we absolutely need to do to maintain reliability, maintain the asset integrity. And after that, after we have kind of concluded what that is for the operation, then we build up our capital program after that, and we have a great deal of flexibility. So each and every one of those layers of additional spend will have significant hurdles that they have to overcome, and affordability becomes an overriding consideration. So we'll continue to manage capital down commensurate with the price environment. We'll continue to push forward with our asset sales. I mentioned only $2 billion or so line of sight, maybe a little bit more for this year, but we see our way clear to the $5 billion to $10 billion program. And obviously, for us to have confidence in saying it's $5 billion to $10 billion, we've got more lined up behind that because we know not every transaction will be executed in the time frame that we've outlined.

We showed a slide at the Security Analyst Meeting that said we could take somewhere between $25 billion to $30 billion of incremental debt that would take us up to about a 30% debt ratio. There's nothing necessarily magic about the 30%. It was just an indicative place to do a measurement versus ourselves versus peers. But I would see as you go through the lows of a price cycle, you would expect your debt burden to increase into the 30%-ish range, maybe a little bit higher on a temporary basis. But if you look through the whole cycle, I think a good place for a company like Chevron with the projects that we take on, our size, our scale, our scope would be probably in the low 20s through the cycle.

By virtue of the opportunities we have ahead of us in terms of moving towards more short cycle, frankly, all of the advantages that we have in the Permian, we have growing capital flexibility. So we will see shorter-cycle movement of there that obviously puts less of a strain on your balance sheet because you can adjust those as conditions permit. But we aren't going to continue to go forward with major capital projects, and FGP is the poster child for that. That's an important project for us, an economic project for us, to go forward with. And we will continue to do those. So I think of it as being, over time, a better balance between short cycle opportunities and long cycle opportunities. We're coming off a period that was significantly weighted by long duration, highly capital-intensive projects and we're moving the portfolio now, our investments now, to a better balance between those. So I think we've got tremendous amount of flexibility to not only reinvest in the business in short cycle, take on selective high-graded wonderful projects like FGP but also then have opportunity to restore the balance sheet. Those balancing activities, I mean that will all be part of our balancing considerations as we go forward."

We have Jack/St. Malo. We have Bibiyana expansion. We have Agbami 3. These are 3 recent examples where we actually delivered on cost and schedule. Having said that, we and the industry have learned a great deal over the last few years, and the only thing we can do is to actually take those learnings and apply them on future projects. Gorgon Train 2 and 3 and Wheatstone Trains 1 and 2 will benefit from all the learnings on Angola LNG and Gorgon Train 1. All the things, the initiatives we highlighted at the analyst meeting in terms of what it takes to actually improve our chances of execution, we are committed to doing those. We're moving a lot of things in-house, we're going to focus on design and engineering, we're going to assure those designs, we're going to pick the right contractors, we're going to work hard on the right contracting strategy. We need to get projects ready for execution. And we're applying all of those on FGP and recall the slide that we had back in March. FGP is going to be wonderful for us because it is countercyclical. We're going to go into a period where there's capacity in the industry. We're going to go into a period where we will have the right organizational capability working on those projects. And I think it's a tremendous time for us to actually deliver better on those projects. We will have lower execution risk as well on the base shale and tight. We've done look backs on our short-term investments, and we don't talk about them that much, but they actually beat the expectations always. So as we move into a short cycle, we're very confident delivering those as we take the learnings on the MCPs, whether it's FGP or other project we consider doing, I believe our chances of improving execution and delivering those projects should be improved."

In terms of the prioritization, though, let me just go back to the logic and the process that we have for building up the capital program. We start with the asset integrity and reliability foundation. And then each and every layer of projects above that competes on its merit on a returns focused kind of basis. And we will balance the short cycle investment, and we will balance initiation and commitment to larger, longer-cycle capital projects. Again, the only one of size that's kind of queued up here in the near term would be future growth project. So we will take all of that into account, the overlying -- overarching objective, though, is to get balanced on cash in 2017. And we continue to be very focused on capital discipline.

We've already said the single well breakeven is typically in the $20 to $40 Brent range. We've also demonstrated tremendous improvement in drilling and completion efficiency, so we continue to bring the cost equation down. Now if we're talking about new greenfield development, we've got few things that need to happen there. Obviously, we need scale and the resource, but we also need to rethink about how we bring our development. We talked before about optimizing our development concept where we could be trading lower plateau and maybe NPV for greater capital efficiencies.

On the call with me today are Joe Geagea, Executive Vice President of Technology, Projects and Services. Many of you know Joe, but for those of you who don't, I thought it would be useful to highlight that he leads our technology, procurement and project functions. He also oversees our centers of excellence for upstream, including drilling. Also joining me on the call is Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We'll refer to slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
I'll begin with key messages from our March 2016 Security Analyst Meeting, followed by a recap of our first quarter 2016 financial results. Joe will provide some color around our spend reduction initiatives and discuss recent updates on key projects prior to my concluding remarks.
Turning now to Slide 3. Our Analyst Day was about 7 weeks ago now, and I thought it would be worthwhile to reiterate the primary messages from that series of sessions. Preserving and growing the dividend is our first priority. Our intention is to be able to cover the dividend in 2017. Our capital spend profile is coming down. We are completing major capital projects already under construction but otherwise reducing long-cycle spend. We are lowering our cost structure to better match a low price environment by improving efficiencies, streamlining the organization and working with suppliers to achieve cost reductions.
At the same time, we expect our cash inflows to be growing. Production increases will occur as we bring on and ramp up projects. While volume growth is sensitive to any number of unknowns such as prices, divestments, ramp up profiles, we anticipate volume growth through the end of the decade using reasonable estimates for these and other uncertainties.
The cash generation of the new assets coming online is substantial to the point where these production adds are expected to raise the overall cash margin per barrel of the entire portfolio even absent any increase in price.
This year, we plan to use some of our borrowing capacity to complete projects. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, and we believe we can come through the lows of this price cycle with long term financial strength intact. Our investment will shift to a higher proportion of short-cycle projects. Not only are many of these brownfield opportunities, but they will give us greater capital flexibility going forward to help limit further debt increases. 
Finally, we are focused on improving financial returns, reducing preproductive capital, moving towards more short-cycle higher-return investments, lowering our cost structure and improving execution on major capital projects.
Turning to Slide 4, an overview of our financial performance. The company's first quarter loss was $725 million or negative $0.39 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange and special items, as detailed in an appendix slide, the loss for the quarter totaled $211 million or a negative $0.11 per share. Cash from operations for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and our debt ratio at quarter end was 22%. Our net debt ratio was 18%.
During the first quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we announced a dividend of $1.07 per share payable to stockholders of record as of May 19. We currently yield 4.2%.
Turning to Slide 5. Cash generated from operations was $1.1 billion during the first quarter. Obviously, upstream cash generation has been heavily penalized by low commodity prices. Downstream continues to generate strong cash flow, although seasonal patterns are evident. 
During the quarter, operating cash flow reflected about $1 billion of working capital requirements as well as certain pension contributions. In addition, affiliate dividends were modest in the quarter, a pattern that is clearly price related as we expect cash generation to improve going forward as our costs come down and as prices move up. 
Cash capital expenditures were $5.6 billion, a decrease of approximately 27% from first quarter 2015. At quarter end, our cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $8.9 billion, and our net debt position was about $33 billion.
Turning to Slide 6. Slide 6 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. First quarter 2016 results were $3.3 billion lower than first quarter 2015 results. About half of this quarter-on-quarter decline was in special items and foreign exchange. Overall, special items accounted for a negative variance between quarters of $755 million, the bulk of which related to last year's recognition of both asset sale gain and the favorable impact of changes in U.K. petroleum tax regulations.
A swing in foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings by $900 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations and do not generally affect cash.
Excluding special items and foreign exchange, upstream earnings decreased approximately $1.6 billion between quarters. Lower crude realizations were partially offset by higher sales volumes and lower operating and exploration expenses. The realization change was in line with our sensitivity of $350 million per dollar change in Brent.
Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by approximately $475 million, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margin. The variance in the other segment was primarily from lower corporate tax items. 
Turning to Slide 7. I'll now compare results for the first quarter 2016 with the fourth quarter 2015. First quarter results were $137 million lower than fourth quarter. A swing in special items, mainly the absence of fourth quarter's impairment and project suspension charges, increased earnings by $930 million. Foreign exchange impacts went the other way, decreasing earnings by $365 million between periods. Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by approximately $750 million between quarters, primarily reflecting lower realizations, again in line with our sensitivity.
Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were lower by $163 million. Weaker refining margins were partially offset by stronger trading results, lower operating expenses and the absence of year-end inventory charges from a draw into higher cost to prior year layers.
The variance in the other segment largely reflects lower corporate charges.
Slide 8 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015. Net production decreased by 7,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital project ramp ups, primarily at Gorgon in Australia, Chuandongbei in China, and Lianzi and Moho Nord in West Africa, increased production by 11,000 barrels per day. The absence of planned and unplanned downtime, mainly at Tengiz and Kazakhstan, increased production by 25,000 barrels per day between periods. Shale and tight production declined 5,000 barrels a day between quarters as external constraints such as weather impacts and downtime at a third party processing facility impacted the Permian. Price and cost recovery effects associated with production sharing and variable royalty contracts decreased production by 18,000 barrels per day between quarters as lower crude prices were more than offset by the impact from lower spend on cost recovery.
The remaining variance in the base business and other bar primarily reflects natural field declines and other adjustments. All this said, first quarter volumes are up about 2% from full year 2015 production. This is right in the middle of the guidance range we provided in January and reaffirmed in March. We still believe this guidance is appropriate.
Slide 9 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil-equivalent production between the first quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2015. Net production decreased by 15,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects increased production by 38,000 barrels per day, primarily due to production ramp ups from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Bangladesh and West Africa, in addition to startups at Gorgon in Australia and Chuandongbei in China. Shale and tight production increased by 37,000 barrels per day due to the growth in the Permian and Marcellus in the U.S. and the Liard and Duvernay basins in Canada. 
Volumes associated with production sharing and variable royalty contracts increased production by 16,000 barrels per day as the positive impact from lower crude prices was partially offset by the impacts of lower spending on cost recovery.
A shut-in of operations in the Partitioned Zone decreased production by approximately 76,000 barrels per day. The decrease of 30,000 barrels per day in the base business and other bar primarily reflects normal field declines and higher downtime activity, partially offset by production from new wells and favorable impact from reduced external constraints.
Turning now to Slide 10. We are making good progress at reducing our spend. These charts use a rolling 4-quarter average to illustrate capital and operating expense reductions. When comparing the rolling 4-quarter average of first quarter 2016 to the same period of the prior year, capital outlays are down 19%. In December, we announced a C&E program of $26.6 billion for the year. But as we noted in March, we are now targeting closer to $25 billion for the year. As we continue to finish major capital projects under construction, we will move to an absolute lower level of annual spend in future years as evidenced by our $17 billion to $22 billion range that we've given you for 2017 to 2018. Affordability considerations at the time will be paramount in determining actual budgets. Capital intensity will be going down. Capital discipline will be going up. You see the same general pattern on operating expense, same downward pattern on operating expense. Expenses continue to rise through 2014 but then notably turn south in mid-2015 as our deliberate cost savings initiatives began to take hold. The rolling first quarter 2016 average is 6% lower than the comparable figure a year ago.
There are some transitional costs such as severance and rig termination fees that are incurred as we take steps to compete more effectively in a lower price environment. Once we're through with the transition cost and as we carry on with the implementation of our various cost savings initiatives, we expect to see continued movement towards a lower, sustainable cost structure. Cost reduction momentum should continue through 2016 and 2017 as the full run rate of our actions is recognized.
Joe will now walk you through some specific examples of our cost reduction efforts before offering an update on key projects."

Now our efforts are focused on achieving sustainable reductions and improving efficiencies. On the organizational side, to date, we have reduced our employee headcount by more than 4,000 relative to year-end 2014, and we are on target to achieve approximately 8,000 total employee reductions by the end of 2016. We're also on target to reduce our contract to workforce by about 6,500 from 2014 levels. 
At the analyst meeting, we shared with you examples of how -- of our improved drilling efficiencies in the Permian and Gulf of Mexico. So today, let me give you an additional example from a different region of the world. In Thailand, operational discipline and streamline processes have enhanced drilling execution efficiency, resulting in about 45% lower average days per 10,000 feet drilled in a 2-year period, as you can see in the graph. And we are continuing to outperform our regional competitors. We're also focused on improving our efficiencies in logistics. One example in West Africa includes shifting from department dedicated vessels to a centrally managed fleet using a decision support center. As a result of this effort, we expect to achieve savings of 30% and reduce the number of vessels in that region by about 40%. We're also continuing to take advantage of our size and scale. In a different part of the world, we are coordinating contract awards with 1 supplier across 3 different regions and reducing the number of vessels by optimizing marine vessel size.
One of our focus areas is to retain gains achieved during this industry downturn. We are doing this across the globe. For example, in one region, we are taking advantage of the current downturn to negotiate with our main supplier, lock in lower rates through 2022 and upgrade with newer and more capable equipment. It not only improved our rates but is also expected to improve our reliability. As we look ahead in the supply chain, we see opportunities for more strategic supplier relationships and standardization. At the analyst meeting, we shared with you the cost savings achieved in the oilfield Tubulars category. These reductions were achieved through standardization and supply rationalization where we went from having 35 suppliers in the past to 4 going forward. On Gorgon, we have worked to standardize and intend to replicate subsea equipment, generating procurement and installation efficiencies as well as considerable cost savings. And lastly, we've been working at standardizing the valves for some time, and we will start deploying the standard valves on future projects.
Turning to Slide 12, let me give you some project updates. At Gorgon, we commenced LNG production on March 7. We ramped up total production to approximately 90,000 barrels per day, and we shipped the first cargo on March 21. Since late March, we have incurred downtime at the plant due to mechanical issues with the propane refrigerant circuit of Train 1. Repairs to this equipment are nearing completion, and we are in the process of reinstating the propane refrigerant circuit. We expect to restart Train 1 in the next few weeks and resume LNG production within the 30- to 60-day estimate we provided previously. We still expect to achieve Train 1 ramp up within the previous guidance of 6 to 8 months from initial startup. Construction on Trains 2 and 3 is progressing as planned, and we anticipate these trains being ready for startup at roughly 6 months’ intervals.
Turning to Slide 13. At Wheatstone, all 9 development wells are completed. We expect to release the drilling rig in the next few months following well cleanup activities. Offshore platform hookup and commissioning is progressing on track with this work expected to be complete well in advance of plant startup. At the plant site, piping, electrical and instrumentation work is progressing well. Our plan reflects absorbed performance rates on other Australian LNG projects. Actual rates are currently on track with our plan, and the outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017. Train 2 construction work is also progressing on schedule. 12 of 24 process modules required for Train 2 startup are now on site, and module deliveries are meeting scheduled milestones.
Turning to Slide 14. I'd like to share brief updates on the other projects, which we are expecting to start up this year. At Angola LNG, gas has been introduced into the plant, and the team is working through the start-up process with dehydration ongoing ahead of commencing liquefaction. We expect LNG production imminently and anticipate shipping the next cargo in May. At Mafumeira Sul, hookup and commissioning is ongoing. All structures, topsides, and pipelines are installed. And the living quarters platform is now occupied, enabling increased manpower on piping, electrical and commissioning work. Batch drilling of the first 10 wells is complete, and first production is expected later this year. At Chuandongbei, Train 1 started up in January, and we were able to ramp up to full capacity within 30 days. Train 2 came online in early April, and ramp up is in progress. We expect to start Train 3 this quarter. At Alder, topsides have been installed, and subsea installation work is progressing. At Bangka, well completions are currently ongoing. First production is expected from both these projects later this year.
Pat will now share an update on our asset sales program."

Asset sales are a routine part of our business. They generate needed cash, and they enable a more strategic, effective and capital-efficient portfolio.

They generate needed cash, and they enable a more strategic, effective and capital-efficient portfolio. Over the next 2 years, we are targeting $5 billion to $10 billion in sales proceeds. The assets targeted for sale are marketable, and we believe the prospective transactions are executable as well. We generally do not discuss specific assets targeted for sale until we have a transaction. However, there has been growing media coverage since our Analyst Day on a few of these prospective sales and as such, we wanted to provide updates where possible. 
The chart highlights some specific transactions that are in the public domain. You will note the vast majority of these are not oil price sensitive and thus, we expect to be able to obtain good values on the sale. There were no significant transactions in the first quarter, but activity has picked up in the second quarter. Already known second quarter transactions include the sale of our interest in 2 gas storage facilities in Western Canada, the sale of our KLM pipeline and Western San Joaquin crude oil pipelines in California and the divestiture of 19 sales and associated assets located primarily in the Gulf of Mexico outer shelf and in Louisiana State waters.
In 2015, we signed an agreement to sell our New Zealand downstream operations subject to certain regulatory approval. Those regulatory approvals were received yesterday, and we now anticipate final closing mid-year.
Just last week, we reached an agreement to sell our assets in Hawaii. The sale includes the 58,000-barrel per day refinery, interest in a 58-site branded service station network, 4 product distribution terminals, pipeline systems and other downstream-related assets. This transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016.
In addition, we are soliciting interest to sell our 75% shareholding in South Africa downstream. We are also exploring potential interest in our geothermal business and Myanmar upstream assets. In aggregate, while it's always difficult to be precise about specific timing, we currently have line of sight on around $2 billion in proceeds, maybe a little higher for 2016. And because we have multiple transactions in the queue, including those not highlighted on the slide, we have confidence in achieving our 2-year $5 billion to $10 billion target.
Turning to Slide 16, I'd like to close with another slide from our recent investor sessions. It's an illustration of how we get cash balance next year. In this slide, we used $52 Brent as it was the actual average price in 2015 and in line with averages sell side analyst price targets for 2017. However, we are committed to balancing at any reasonable price. Spending will come down significantly this year and next as major development projects get finished and come online as we high grade future investments to shorter-cycle higher-return opportunity and as we get more efficient and lower our cost structure. Cash generation will grow, not only because of more production but also because of accretive cash margins on the new production. We'll continue to streamline the portfolio. In short, we are taking the steps necessary to compete in a lower price environment. If a lower price environment persists for longer, we will adjust and pursue even more significant cost savings and even greater cuts in capital to continue to lower our cash flow breakeven. We intend to be a resilient competitor regardless of the price environment.
Okay. That concludes our prepared remarks. And we're now ready to take some questions. [Operator Instructions] Jonathan, please open the lines for questions."

And obviously, in first quarter, that was not the circumstances that we found ourselves in and, therefore, a deferral was prudent. I think going forward, the timing will obviously be dependent upon future cash, future earnings, what happens to price, what happens to our project ramp ups, how all that plays out in future quarters. We'll also have to take a look at what we think is happening to commodity prices over a longer sweep of time because, again, we're looking at a dividend as being essentially a commitment in perpetuity. We're very aware of our 28-year record of consecutive annual per share payment increases, and that will be taken into account. So the board will take all this into account as it looks at dividends each and every quarter."

As Pat mentioned, there were a number of onetime events in the first quarter, which adversely impacted our production. Going forward, we still expect to realize the growth range we provided at our analyst meeting. The key for us is to really exercise the things within our control, and that is to continue to drive cost down and to improve our efficiencies. And we have given several proof points in the past about how much progress we've done in that regard. We're now in full horizontal factory mode in the Permian. We brought our well cost down by about 40%, and we have about 4,000 well locations that offer us a 10% rate of return at around $50 WTI. And when you add on top of all of that the royalty advantage that have, we see our activity in the Permian as being very, very strong. So the key for us is to continue to be competitive, and we do that very well because we also have a OJV, so we have a good line of sight on how well other people are operating in the basin. And of course, we screen them based on our own economics and lastly, the royalty advantage give us a tremendous boost here."

Our primary methodology in terms of capital allocation starts from what do we absolutely need to do to maintain reliability, maintain the asset integrity. And after that, after we have kind of concluded what that is for the operation, then we build up our capital program after that, and we have a great deal of flexibility. So each and every one of those layers of additional spend will have significant hurdles that they have to overcome, and affordability becomes an overriding consideration. So we'll continue to manage capital down commensurate with the price environment. We'll continue to push forward with our asset sales. I mentioned only $2 billion or so line of sight, maybe a little bit more for this year, but we see our way clear to the $5 billion to $10 billion program. And obviously, for us to have confidence in saying it's $5 billion to $10 billion, we've got more lined up behind that because we know not every transaction will be executed in the time frame that we've outlined. So we feel confident about our ability to get cash balanced at any reasonable price here."

Ed, the way I look at this and the way we look at this really is that, obviously, when you're at the peak of a price cycle, that's when you want to have restored your balance sheet, have an ultraconservative balance sheet and that allows you to come through a price downturn. Right now, we're sitting at a 22% debt ratio. We showed a slide at the Security Analyst Meeting that said we could take somewhere between $25 billion to $30 billion of incremental debt that would take us up to about a 30% debt ratio. There's nothing necessarily magic about the 30%. It was just an indicative place to do a measurement versus ourselves versus peers. But I would see as you go through the lows of a price cycle, you would expect your debt burden to increase into the 30%-ish range, maybe a little bit higher on a temporary basis. But if you look through the whole cycle, I think a good place for a company like Chevron with the projects that we take on, our size, our scale, our scope would be probably in the low 20s through the cycle. But getting into the 30%-ish range, we could handle that if it's temporary."

So we will see shorter-cycle movement there that obviously puts less of a strain on your balance sheet because you can adjust those as conditions permit. But we are going to continue to go forward with major capital projects, and FGP is the poster child for that. That's an important project for us, an economic project for us, to go forward with. And we will continue to do those. So I think of it as being, over time, a better balance between short cycle opportunities and long cycle opportunities. We're coming off a period that was significantly weighted by long duration, highly capital-intensive projects and we're moving the portfolio now, our investments now, to a better balance between those. So I think we've got tremendous amount of flexibility to not only reinvest in the business in short cycle, take on selective high-graded wonderful projects like FGP but also then have opportunity to restore the balance sheet.

Gorgon Train 2 and 3 and Wheatstone Trains 1 and 2 will benefit from all the learnings on Angola LNG and Gorgon Train 1. All the things, the initiatives we highlighted at the analyst meeting in terms of what it takes to actually improve our chances of execution, we are committed to doing those.

We need to get projects ready for execution. And we're applying all of those on FGP and recall the slide that we had back in March. FGP is going to be wonderful for us because it is countercyclical. We're going to go into a period where there's capacity in the industry. We're going to go into a period where we will have the right organizational capability working on those projects.

We've done look backs on our short-term investments, and we don't talk about them that much, but they actually beat the expectations always.

In terms of the prioritization, though, let me just go back to the logic and the process that we have for building up the capital program. We start with the asset integrity and reliability foundation. And then each and every layer of projects above that competes on its merits on a returns-focused kind of basis. And we will balance the short cycle investment, and we will balance initiation and commitment to larger, longer-cycle capital projects. Again, the only one of size that's kind of queued up here in the near term would be future growth project. So we will take all of that into account, the overlying -- overarching objective, though, is to get balanced on cash in 2017. And we continue to be very focused on capital discipline. And so there will be high hurdle rates for all of the projects coming forward for possible inclusion in the capital budget."

Just to put it in context, we're already producing about 140,000 barrels a day in the Gulf of Mexico in the deepwater. And we do that through 5 operated assets and 4 nonoperated assets. We're also the largest leaseholder in the Gulf. So in the near term, with that footprint, we do see many brownfield deepwater opportunities. In fact, 80% of our spend -- development spend over the next few years is going to be geared toward brownfield development, such as Jack/St. Malo and Tahiti, where we actually have good economics. We've already said the single well breakeven is typically in the $20 to $40 Brent range. We've also demonstrated tremendous improvement in drilling and completion efficiency, so we continue to bring the cost equation down. Now if we're talking about new greenfield development, we've got few things that need to happen there. Obviously, we need scale and the resource, but we also need to rethink about how we bring our development. We talked before about optimizing our development concept where we could be trading lower plateau and maybe NPV for greater capital efficiencies. And this is another place where we actually need our suppliers. We need to work closely with them to continue to drive the cost down. This is an important area for us to be good at, and we're committed to do that. Now in terms of how does the Permian compete, we just can't be a Permian company. We have a lot of other places where actually we have good resources. We talked about Tengiz, we talked about Thailand, we talked about Indonesia. Australia is going to give us those opportunities. So yes, while the Permian give us tremendous advantage, the size of our company will require us to actually be broader and to put our capital in places where we can get good economics but not to be solely a one-asset class company."

Welcome to Chevron's second quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, Executive Vice President, Upstream; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2.
I'll begin with a recap of our second quarter 2016 financial results, and then Jay will provide an update on our upstream business prior to my concluding remarks.
Turning to Slide 3. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's second quarter loss was $1.5 billion or negative $0.78 per diluted share. Included in the quarter were impairments and other charges of $2.8 billion. These are primarily associated with certain assets prior to a combination of reservoir performance and price. Revenue from oil and gas production is not expected to recover costs. Excluding these items as well as the impact of asset sale gains of $420 million and foreign exchange effects of $279 million, earnings for the quarter totaled $661 million or $0.35 per share. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. 
Cash from operations for the quarter was $2.5 billion, and our debt ratio at quarter end was approximately 23%. Our net debt ratio was a bit under 20%. 
During the second quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we announced the dividend of $1.07 per share payable to stockholders of record as of August 19, 2016. We currently yield 4.2%.
Turning to Slide 4. Cash generated from operations was $2.5 billion during the second quarter and $3.7 billion year-to-date. Upstream cash generation was stronger than the first quarter, commensurate with rising crude prices. 
Working capital effects of $2 billion and $2 billion in deferred tax items, for example, those associated with tax loss positions, reduced year-to-date operating cash. These are generally transitory effects, which reverse in future periods. We expect a portion of the working capital drain to reverse later this year. 
Proceeds from asset sales for the quarter totaled $1.3 billion, mainly from the sale of our New Zealand marketing assets, Canadian natural gas storage assets and pipeline assets in North America. 
Cash capital expenditures were $4.5 billion, a decrease of over $3 billion from second quarter 2015 and down more than $1 billion from the first quarter of 2016. At quarter-end our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $9 billion, and our net debt position was $36 billion.
Turning to Slide 5. Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Second quarter 2016 results were $2 billion lower than second quarter 2015 results. Special items, primarily the absence of the second quarter 2015 gain on the sale of Caltex Australia Limited, partially offset by the second quarter 2016 gain on the sale of New Zealand marketing, reduced earnings by $1.4 billion between periods. In both quarters, depreciation expense was impacted by impairments and other charges. 
The swing in foreign exchange impacts improved earnings by $530 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations and do not generally affect cash. 
Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased $528 million between quarters. Lower crude realizations were partially offset by lower exploration and operating expenses as well as other unrelated positive variances. Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by $535 million, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses.
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll now compare results for the second quarter of 2016 with the first quarter of 2016. Second quarter results were $745 million lower than the first quarter. Net special items for impairments, projects suspensions and other related charges, decreased earnings by $2.2 billion between periods. Foreign exchange created a positive earnings variance of nearly $600 million between periods. Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased approximately $1.2 billion between quarters, primarily reflecting higher realizations in line with our price sensitivity as well as lower exploration and depreciation charges. Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were lower by $79 million as lower operating expenses were more than offset by inventory revaluation effects. The variance in the other segment largely reflects unfavorable corporate tax items.
Jay will now review our worldwide quarterly production and provide an update on our upstream operation. Jay?"

I'll start with second quarter 2016 production, and then provide an update on a few of our key upstream projects. Slide 7 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter 2016 and the second",1775,"Thanks, Pat. I'll start with second quarter 2016 production, and then provide an update on a few of our key upstream projects. Slide 7 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter 2016 and the second quarter 2015. Net production decreased by 68,000 barrels a day between these quarters, yielding first half 2016 production of 2.6 million barrels a day. Shale [indiscernible] production increased by 50,000 barrels a day, primarily due to growth in the Midland and Delaware basins in the Permian with the Marcellus, Duvernay and basin also reflecting year-on-year growth. 
Major capital projects increased production by 37,000 barrels a day as ramp-ups continue at Jack/St. Malo, Chuandongbei and Angola LNG. And we saw initial production from Gorgon. Disruptions due to external events accounted for the temporary shut-in of 63,000 barrels per day, which included the Partitioned Zone, security issues Nigeria and fires in Canada. The sale of our Michigan assets and several assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf resulted in decreased production of 44,000 barrels a day. The decrease of 48,000 barrels a day in the base business and other bar reflects normal field decline and higher turnaround activity, partially offset by new base business production from brownfield investments.
The chart shown on Slide 8 was presented in January and outlined our production guidance and uncertainties for 2016. The cumulative impact of the uncertainties has been unfavorable, and we expect to be near the bottom of the annualized guidance we provided. For example, we anticipated that oil production in the Partitioned Zone would be restarted by mid-year, which hasn't happened. As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2015, this field produced over 75,000 barrels of Chevron share. We've also worked through various start-up issues at Gorgon that impacted our first half production. We've been successful that our upstream divestment program, which is impacting our production. Transactions closed this year represent a daily production rate of just over 40,000 barrels a day, and we expect to see an additional 15,000 to 30,000 daily barrels leaving the portfolio before the end of this year. In addition to these uncertainties, production in the third quarter will be adversely impacted by a large number of turnarounds, including the second-generation plant at Tengiz. At the same time, our long anticipated queue of projects is now coming online. In the second half of this year, we expect to see sustained production from Angola LNG, Gorgon trains 1 and 2, and all 3 trains at Chuandongbei. We're also expecting continued growth from the Permian, which I'll talk further in a few minutes.
The overall results we expect to exit the year with the December production in the range of 2.65 million to 2.7 million barrels per day.
Turning to Slide 9. Funding the completion of projects under construction is our first capital allocation priority. At Gorgon, we're currently producing at 70% of Train 1's capacity or approximately 90,000 barrels per day. In early July, we took a short shut-in to address a number of issues and repair a minor leak. Production resumed mid-July, and the plant has been running smoothly since that time. We're incorporating all the experience gained from Train 1's construction, completion and initial operations and Trains 2 and 3. Construction on Trains 2 and 3 is progressing very well. We expect first LNG from Train 2 early in the fourth quarter and from Train 3 in the second quarter of 2017. At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017 for Train 1. The cleanup and testing of all 9 development wells has been completed, and the rig has been released. Initial results are in line with expectations. At the plant site, piping, electrical and instrumentation work is currently progressing very well. We're working to maintain this progress as we begin the transition to completion, commissioning and start-up activities. Train 2 construction work is also progressing per plan with start-up expected 6 to 8 months after Train 1.
Slide 10 shows our other 2016 start-ups. At Angola LNG modifications were completed at the plant and production restarted on May 20. Since restarting the plant, we've loaded 4 LNG and 7 LPG cargos. The plant was tested at 75% capacity and ran smoothly prior to the plant shutdown for strainer and other maintenance activities. The modifications of the gas conditioning section operated as designed, and all other repairs are complete. We expect to achieve sustained production during the third quarter. At Chuandongbei, Train3 started up in late May, and all 3 trains have delivered at full capacity and are now operational. There've been no changes since our previous update on older Mafumeira Sul or Bangka.
Turning to Slide 11. Our next capital priority is to fund high-return short-cycle base and shale and tight investments. First among these opportunities is the Permian where we have a large royalty advantage acreage position. We're raking excellent progress in the Permian towards the growth we discussed at our analyst meeting in March. Production this quarter was 21% or 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, higher than the second quarter of last year. Efficiency gains and the shift to more Chevron-operated rigs have more than offset the reduction in total rig count. We're delivering our plan with fewer rigs and less costs. 
Let's turn to Slide 12. As we've said before, one of our primary benchmarking metrics for our Permian assets is development cost per barrel. Since the second quarter of last year, we've reduced our unit development cost by approximately 30%. We've been able to accelerate our performance improvements by incorporating industry best practices and applying lessons learned from our joint ventures and contractors. As shown by the data, our development cost is competitive with our joint venture partners. The table shows improvement in our drilling, completion cost performance from recent pad drilling program. Over 7,500-foot laterals in the Midland Basin were averaging $5.6 million per well, which is a 25% reduction from what we showed you at our analyst meeting in March. Our recovery per well is also improving as we continue to implement learnings and optimize our lateral length, well completions and drawdown strategies. Earlier this year, we exceeded 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in a 24-hour well test on a 7,500-foot lateral well in the greater area. We also put our 100 company operated horizontal well in production and continue to gain confidence in our acreage characterization and performance. We're taking a disciplined measured approach to development, and we're optimizing and prioritizing a large number of available well locations. We're delivering on our objective to be a competitive operator whose royalty provision provides an incremental competitive advantage, and we're consistently improving our financial performance. 
Slide 13. In addition to the Permian and other large-scale short-cycle businesses such as San Joaquin in Thailand, we have a number of attractive major capital projects that leverage previous investments. The projects listed on this slide all take advantage of existing infrastructure, reducing development cost and cycle time. As they build upon existing development, they also tend to carry less subsurface and execution risk. The average development cost for these projects is around $15 a barrel. At Jack and St. Malo, we continue to ramp up production. In June, the combined production for both fields reached 110,000 barrels a day. This was accomplished through continued high-facility reliability and the start-up of the eighth well. The first Stage 2 well is expected to come online next month.
Turning Slide 14. A major brownfield opportunity we've talked about many times is the Future Growth and Wellhead Pressure Management Project in Tengiz. As we announced earlier this month, the TCO partnership sanctioned the project. WPMP provides additional wells and pressure boosting facilities to maintain production levels in the existing plant as reservoir pressures decline. As GP builds on the sour gas injection technology already proven an existing operations at Tengiz. It has additional production and gas injection capacity to increase total oil production by around 260,000 barrels a day. The project is designed to capture execution and infrastructure efficiencies and will take advantage of current market conditions. Incremental recovery is expected to be 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
Turning to Slide 15. FGP/WPMP is estimated to cost $36.8 billion, which includes $27 billion for facilities, $3.5 billion for wells and $6.2 billion for contingency and escalation. The development cost for the project is $18 a barrel. Operating and transportation costs are expected to be consistent with our existing operations. TCO had secured financing to ensure uninterrupted project funding utilizing a combination of bank loans, co-lending and bonds. Demand for the first tranche of the bond offering was strong, and the bonds were placed at an attractive interest rate.
Go to Slide 16. As I've discussed, we're committed to improving our project execution performance across the enterprise. I've used this slide previously to describe the actions we're taking on the projects in order to deliver strong execution performance and mitigate the amount of contingency consumed. We're confident these actions will improve our ability to deliver this project predictably and reliably, and I'll update you on a few examples. 
Engineering is currently greater than 50% complete, well ahead of industry practice of 25% or less at FID. Having a more advanced engineering design provides a better understanding of the quantity and quality of materials, equipment and labor required to execute the project and reduces the likelihood of out-of-sequence work and construction delays due to engineering issues. The project team and principal contractor have been integrated into one team with fewer layers of management, lower cost and more effective leadership.
Turning to Slide 17. We're pleased to see this project and our execution and are excited about the value the project brings to Kazakhstan, TCO and our shareholders. Tengiz is a world-class reservoir, and FGP/WPMP provides the foundation for the continued economic development of the field. The project utilizes technology already proven at Tengiz. It addresses declining reservoir pressure and enhances recovery from the reservoir. This countercyclical investment takes advantage of the current market in terms of cost saving, fabrication capacity and contractor capabilities. Project economics are attractive within the current concession life and include 20% contingency. The project provides additional upside opportunities, including future infill drilling, facility debottlenecking, increased oil production from existing plants as well as additional enhanced recovery projects. A concession expansion for utilizing less contingency will also provide additional benefits. Tengiz has been excellent asset for Chevron, and this investment will allow Tengiz to continue to generate value into the future.
I'll now hand back to Pat to discuss our progress on spend reductions."

If the current price environment persists, we will revisit the band of the range as our primary goal is to be cash-balanced. Year-to-date operating expense is also down, down 8% when compared to 2015, and we expect the downward quarterly trend to continue in the second half of this year as we realize the full year run rate organizational actions and supply chain initiatives.
Turning to Slide 19. Just a quick update on our asset sales program. Over the last 10 years, on average, we have received proceeds from asset sales of $2.9 billion per year. With the sale of our interest in Caltex Australia, 2016 [ph] was the highest dollar transaction year. Year-to-date, we have received proceeds of $1.4 billion covering several transactions: New Zealand marketing, Canadian gas storage assets, pipeline assets in California and upstream assets in the Gulf of Mexico. We have a number of potential transactions presently being worked. The larger publicly known transactions are noted on this slide. There are a few attributes that these transactions have in common. The assets are not essential to delivering on our strategy. The valuations are not particularly oil price-sensitive, and there are multiple interested buyers. We believe our sales programs executable and secure good value. We have confidence in achieving our $5 billion to $10 billion target for total proceeds over this year and next. And as I said last quarter, we have line of sight on around $2 billion for 2016.
I'd like to close the presentation here on Slide 20 by reiterating a few key points. We remain committed to becoming cash-balanced in 2017. Our projects are coming online, and we're making huge drives in lowering our cost structure and getting our capital outflows down. We're on track with our asset sales program. We see those as backend-loaded with more occurring in 2017 than this year. They are eminently doable. We believe they are realistic part of our cash-balancing program.
Looking out to the next 12 to 24 months, our profile is just as we have long said it would be: strong volume growth and cash flow margin accretion at the same time. That's a powerful combination offering tremendous value growth for our shareholders. Our financial priorities remain unchanged. We're committed to join the dividend as earnings and cash flow permit. We recognize the value our shareholders place on dividends and the value they place in our long history of annual dividend payment increases.
So that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. [Operator Instructions] Jonathan, can you please open the line?"

The deferred tax impacts will also reverse, and you need to think about these as tax loss carrybacks or tax loss carryforwards. Across the world, it depends on specific circumstance and specific jurisdictions what the specifics of that are. But in either case, we can either take these back against prior income or we can carry them forward against future income. So in our case, I know, for example, we will be filing for amended tax returns in 2017. So the point is that those negatives both on working capital and deferred tax, they're negatives right now, but they become positive in the future. And so when I -- when you think about this impact and it's pretty significant on a year-to-date basis, again $4 billion across 2 of those.

We've always had that our expectation is that Trains 2 and 3 would start up at roughly 6 month intervals, and we're pretty much still on that plan. We started up the first train in March, so we're projecting early in the fourth quarter for Train 2 and then Train 3 will follow along behind. So there's latitude in these quarters. We are seeing very good construction progress on 2 and 3. And importantly, all the lessons, as I said, that we've learned not only during the construction time but in the design and all the modifications we've had to make as we started Train 1, all that has been built into Train 2 as well as the actual hours to complete these projects. So we feel very encouraged by the results we're seeing. We're happy with the construction progress. We're well into commissioning of Train 2. So there, it's pretty much as we expected. As far as the ramp-up, our view has been 6 to 8 months. We kind of base that looking at LNG projects around the world. That's a normal kind of a ramp-up period. As I've said before, it's not so much that you're on this smooth curve from start-up to full capacity, but as you start up one of these plants, there are issues that have to be dealt with so you have periods of downtime as you go down to make modifications or fix some of the equipment that you have difficulty with on start-up, tuning loops, things like that. So it's really a function of the downtime, and the overall effect is a curve as you approach 100% capacity. So we still expect that 6 to 8 months kind of a ramp-up period. But again, with 2 and 3 and the benefit of experiences we're gaining on Train 1, their identical the signs to gives us a little bit of a head start in terms of that ramp-up for the second 2 trains."

O",623,"I think our economics is a little bit different than yours, Paul. I can get into the details of the fiscal terms that we work under with the contract, but we do see a better rate than what you're seeing. The transportation costs are quite good with CPC. Of course, with FBG, some portion of the throughput would have to go by rail, but it's going to be within the envelope of what we've already moved by rail prior to the expansion of CPCs, so we're quite comfortable with that. When you look at Gorgon overall -- FGP overall, I think there's a couple of things in terms of the economics. We have a very good understanding of this reservoir. It's largely been derisked. We've been operating it for 23 years. We have a very strong operating organization and maintenance organization there that's giving us very high reliability. So between the good reservoir models and our understanding of that reservoir as well as the operation and reliability we get from the facilities, this is a very good project for us in terms of the scale and the amount of capacity it adds. We also see that the market conditions right now are favorable, and the project is ready for execution. As we've talked about, the engineering is well advance, over 50%. The procurement is 67%. We have a very good understanding of what it's going to take to execute this project, and we've got a lot of the infrastructure already in place. Because effectively, this builds on the infrastructure that's already in Tengiz. So we see it as a relatively low-risk project from all those factors.
In terms of the opportunities, we see a lot of upside opportunity. We've done a great job in the past at Tengiz really got a proven track record of extracting incremental value out of the infrastructure once it's installed. If you look at SGP, for example, the second generation plant that started up in 2008, this really tested of the new technology that's being used at FGP. And since start-up, we've been able to increase the capacity that facility by 22% over nameplate, which gives us a lot of incremental capacity. FGP is actually simpler in terms of their processing facilities than SGP and we should expect to see similar types of upside opportunity. There's also upside when you look at the infill drilling that SGP puts in place, and SGP carries incrementally large gas handling capacity more than what's required right now. So as reservoir pressures continue to decline, not only do they help stabilize the platform, but we take that additional gas handling capacity and use it on existing facilities today and help handle that increase in gas oil ratio into the future. So there's a lot of upside benefits that have yet to come.  Of course, when we talk about the opportunity for contract extensions, we feel this is good for the company as well as ourselves. Now there's other assessments out there like many of you may have seen it there's a number of areas where we see some differences in our view and their view. As I said, we have a very well matched accurate reservoir model, history-matched model. We have a faster ramp-up on the project after completion. We also have a faster decline on the reservoir if we weren't doing the project than what is counting on. Both of those would drive value into the project And finally, Wood Macks has almost twice as many wells in their forecast that we carry in our development plan. So those are some key differences I would point out the as well as some of the upside potential we see in those projects."

Right now, we're sitting at the midway part of the year trending on $25 billion sort of range. We think that's where we could end and possibly a little bit lower than that. We're actually trending on 24 at the 6-month mark. We're thinking 25 may be -- 24 may be where we end the year. So somewhere between $24 billion and $25 billion, I think, is the appropriate level for you to think about. And then in terms of 2017 and 2018, we've given you the range there of the $17 billion to $22 billion. But obviously, we need to be market responsive. And so right now, we're thinking it's towards the lower end of that range. And if, in fact, the market doesn't move prices anywhere off of where they are today, we'll probably be lower than that or certainly at the very low end of that range. So that's as much guidance as I can give you on capital at the moment. We're rolling up the business plans, and we'll have more to say as we get towards the end of the year. On operating expense, our target really, we came down on operating expense, $2 billion between 2014 and 2015. And our target is to come down another $2 billion between 2015 and 2016.

We got an existing set of deepwater projects that are already in operation in the Gulf of Mexico, and they are very profitable. And more than that, they provide a good platform for additional investments as we talked about earlier in the presentation. Going forward, the key really is making our development costs down, and we're very focused on doing that in a couple of ways. Our deepwater drilling has improved fairly substantially. If you look at just in the last year or so, we've seen 30% faster drilling rates in the deepwater. And with the cost of rigs, that has a big impact. As we move forward we expect to see our costs go down as well as the rate drilling project go up. We're also looking at the facilities and getting them rightsized. What I mean by that is rather than chasing for peak production, for example, we may go a smaller facilities have a longer plateau of production higher capital efficiencies. So as we look at driving the cost per barrel development costs down, I think that's what's going to be required for new projects to be competitive with other opportunities in our portfolio. Once these projects are on, they have relatively low operating costs. We got good margins out of them. It's just the time between the initial expiration program and development wells and ultimately, the production that burdens these projects from an overall financial return standpoint. In terms of the that you asked about this project is still under assessment. I really don't want to comment too much further, but we're evaluating there may be some additional appraisal work to do, and then we'll be putting that against the other opportunities that we have. We do think the deepwater represents a good resource base, and it is important for meeting global demand in the future. So we think production for this area will continue. But as I said, our focus is on driving those development costs down, so that these projects are competitive with other opportunities in the portfolio."

We've made a commitment as well. There is an affordability component here. We made the commitment as well to get cash balanced in 2017.

Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, Executive Vice President, Upstream; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. I'll begin with a recap of our second quarter 2016 financial results, and then Jay will provide an update on our upstream business prior to my concluding remarks.
Turning to Slide 3. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. This company's second quarter loss was $1.5 billion or negative $0.78 per diluted share. Included in the quarter were impairments and other charges of $2.8 billion. These are primarily associated with certain assets where, through a combination of reservoir performance and price, revenue from oil and gas production is not expected to recover costs. Excluding these items as well as the impact of asset sale gains of $420 million and foreign exchange effects of $279 million, earnings for the quarter totaled $661 million or $0.35 per share. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. Cash from operations for the quarter was $2.5 billion, and our debt ratio at quarter end was approximately 23%. Our net debt ratio was a bit under 20%. During the second quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we announced a dividend of $1.07 per share payable to stockholders of record as of August 19, 2016. We currently yield 4.2%.
Turning to Slide 4. Cash generated from operations was $2.5 billion during the second quarter and $3.7 billion year-to-date. Upstream cash generation was stronger than the first quarter, commensurate with rising crude prices. Working capital effects of $2 billion and $2 billion in deferred tax items, for example, those associated with tax loss positions, reduced year-to-date operating cash. These are generally transitory effects, which reverse in future periods. We expect a portion of the working capital drain to reverse later this year. Proceeds from asset sales for the quarter totaled $1.3 billion, mainly from the sale of our New Zealand marketing assets, Canadian natural gas storage assets and pipeline assets in North America. Cash capital expenditures were $4.5 billion, a decrease of over $3 billion from second quarter 2015 and down more than $1 billion from the first quarter of 2016. At quarter end, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $9 billion, and our net debt position was $36 billion.
Turning to Slide 5. Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Second quarter 2016 results were $2 billion lower than second quarter 2015 results. Special items, primarily the absence of the second quarter 2015 gain on the sale of Caltex Australia Limited, partially offset by the second quarter 2016 gain on the sale of New Zealand marketing reduced earnings by $1.4 billion between periods. In both quarters, depreciation expense was impacted by impairments and other charges. The swing in foreign exchange impacts improved earnings by $530 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations and do not generally affect cash. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased $528 million between quarters. Lower crude realizations were partially offset by lower exploration and operating expenses as well as other unrelated positive variances. Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by $535 million, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses.
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll now compare results for the second quarter of 2016 with the first quarter of 2016. Second quarter results were $745 million lower than the first quarter. Net special items for impairments, project suspensions and other related charges decreased earnings by $2.2 billion between periods. Foreign exchange created a positive earnings variance of nearly $600 million between periods. Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased approximately $1.2 billion between quarters, primarily reflecting higher realizations, in line with our price sensitivity, as well as lower exploration and depreciation charges. Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were lower by $79 million as lower operating expenses were more than offset by inventory revaluation effects. The variance in the other segment largely reflects unfavorable corporate tax items.  
Jay will now review our worldwide quarterly production and provide an update on our upstream operations. Jay?"

I'll start with second quarter 2016 production and then provide an update on a few of our key upstream projects. 
Slide 7 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter 2016 and the second quarter 2015. Net production decreased by 68,000 barrels a day between these quarters, yielding first half 2016 production of 2.6 million barrels a day. Shale and tight production increased by 50,000 barrels a day, primarily due to growth in the Midland and Delaware basins and the Permian with the Marcellus, Vaca Muerta, Duvernay and Liard Basins also reflecting year-on-year growth. Major capital projects increased production by 37,000 barrels a day as ramp-ups continue at Jack/St. Malo, Chuandongbei and Angola LNG, and we saw initial production from Gorgon. Disruptions due to external events accounted for the temporary shut-in of 63,000 barrels per day, which included the Partitioned Zone, security issues in Nigeria and fires in Canada. The sale of our Michigan assets and several assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf resulted in decreased production of 44,000 barrels a day. The decrease of 48,000 barrels a day in the base business and other bar reflects normal field declines and higher turnaround activity, partially offset by new base business production from brownfield investments.
The chart shown on Slide 8 was presented in January and outlined our production guidance and uncertainties for 2016. The cumulative impact of the uncertainties has been unfavorable, and we expect to be near the bottom of the annualized guidance we provided. For example, we anticipated that oil production in the Partitioned Zone would be restarted by midyear, which hasn't happened. As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2015, this field produced over 75,000 barrels a day, Chevron share. We've also worked through various start-up issues at Gorgon that impacted our first half production. We've been successful with our upstream divestment program, which is impacting our production. Transactions closed this year represent a daily production rate of just over 40,000 barrels a day, and we expect to see an additional 15,000 to 30,000 daily barrels leaving the portfolio before the end of this year. 
In addition to these uncertainties, production in the third quarter will be adversely impacted by a large number of turnarounds, including the second-generation plant at Tengiz. At the same time, our long-anticipated queue of projects is now coming online. In the second half of this year, we expect to see sustained production from Angola LNG, Gorgon Trains 1 and 2, and all 3 trains at Chuandongbei. We're also expecting continued growth from the Permian, which I'll talk further in a few minutes. The overall result is that we expect to exit the year with the December production in the range of 2.65 million to 2.7 million barrels per day.
Turning to Slide 9. Funding the completion of projects under construction is our first capital allocation priority. At Gorgon, we're currently producing at 70% of Train 1's capacity or approximately 90,000 barrels per day. In early July, we took a short shutdown to address a number of issues and repair a minor leak. Production resumed mid-July, and the plant has been running smoothly since that time. We're incorporating all the experience gained from Train 1's construction, completion and initial operations into Trains 2 and 3. Construction on Trains 2 and 3 is progressing very well. We expect first LNG from Train 2 early in the fourth quarter and from Train 3 in the second quarter of 2017. 
At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017 for Train 1. The cleanup and testing of all 9 development wells has been completed, and the rig has been released. Initial results are in line with expectations. At the plant site, piping, electrical and instrumentation work is currently progressing very well. We're working to maintain this progress as we begin the transition to completion, commissioning and start-up activities. Train 2 construction work is also progressing per plan with start-up expected 6 to 8 months after Train 1.
Slide 10 shows our other 2016 start-ups. At Angola LNG, modifications were completed at the plant and production restarted on May 20. Since restarting the plant, we've loaded 4 LNG and 7 LPG cargos. The plant was tested at 75% capacity and ran smoothly prior to the planned shutdown for strainer and other maintenance activities. The modifications to the gas conditioning section operated as designed, and all other repairs are complete. We expect to achieve sustained production during the third quarter. At Chuandongbei, Train3 started up in late May, and all 3 trains have delivered at full capacity and are now operational. There've been no changes since our previous updates on Alder, Mafumeira Sul or Bangka.
Turning to Slide 11. Our next capital priority is to fund high-return, short-cycle base and shale and tight investments. First among these opportunities is the Permian, where we have a large royalty advantage acreage position. We're making excellent progress in the Permian towards the growth we discussed at our Analyst Meeting in March. Production this quarter was 21% or 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, higher than the second quarter of last year. Efficiency gains and a shift to more Chevron-operated rigs have more than offset the reduction in total rig count. We're delivering our plan with fewer rigs and less costs. 
Turning to Slide 12. As we've said before, one of our primary benchmarking metrics for our Permian assets is development cost per barrel. Since the second quarter of last year, we've reduced our unit development cost by approximately 30%. We've been able to accelerate our performance improvements by incorporating industry best practices and applying lessons learned from our joint ventures and contractors. As shown by the data, our development cost is competitive with our joint venture partners. The table shows improvement in our drilling and completion cost performance from recent pad drilling programs. For 7,500-foot laterals in the Midland Basin, we're averaging $5.6 million per well, which is a 25% reduction from what we showed you at our Analyst Meeting in March. 
Our recovery per well is also improving as we continue to implement learnings and optimize our lateral lengths, well completions and drawdown strategies. Earlier this year, we exceeded 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in a 24-hour well test on a 7,500-foot lateral well in the Greater Bryant G area. We also put our 100th company-operated horizontal well in production and continue to gain confidence in our acreage characterization and performance. We're taking a disciplined, measured approach to development, and we're optimizing and prioritizing the large number of available well locations. We're delivering on our objective to be a competitive operator, whose royalty provision provides an incremental competitive advantage, and we're consistently improving our financial performance. 
Slide 13. In addition to the Permian and other large-scale, short-cycle businesses, such as San Joaquin and Gulf of Thailand, we have a number of attractive major capital projects that leverage previous investments. The projects listed on this slide all take advantage of existing infrastructure, reducing development cost and cycle time. As they build upon existing developments, they also tend to carry less subsurface and execution risk. The average development cost for these projects is around $15 a barrel. At Jack and St. Malo, we continue to ramp up production. In June, the combined production for both fields reached 110,000 barrels a day. This was accomplished through continued high-facility reliability and the start-up of the eighth well. The first Stage 2 well is expected to come online next month.
Turning Slide 14. A major brownfield opportunity we've talked about many times is the Future Growth and Wellhead Pressure Management Project in Tengiz. As we announced earlier this month, the TCO partnership sanctioned the project. WPMP provides additional wells and pressure boosting facilities to maintain production levels in the existing plants as reservoir pressures decline. FGP builds on the sour gas injection technology already proven in existing operations at Tengiz. It adds additional production and gas injection capacity to increase total oil production by around 260,000 barrels a day. The project is designed to capture execution and infrastructure efficiencies and will take advantage of current market conditions. Incremental recovery is expected to be 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
Turning to Slide 15. FGP/WPMP is estimated to cost $36.8 billion, which includes $27 billion for facilities, $3.5 billion for wells and $6.2 billion for contingency and escalation. The development cost for the project is $18 a barrel. Operating and transportation costs are expected to be consistent with our existing operations. TCO has secured financing to ensure uninterrupted project funding, utilizing a combination of bank loans, co-lending and bonds. Demand for the first tranche of the bond offering was strong, and the bonds were placed at an attractive interest rate.
Go to Slide 16. As I've discussed, we're committed to improving our project execution performance across the enterprise. I've used this slide previously to describe the actions we're taking on the projects in order to deliver strong execution performance and mitigate the amount of contingency consumed. We're confident these actions will improve our ability to deliver this project predictably and reliably, and I'll update you on a few examples. 
Engineering is currently greater than 50% complete, well ahead of industry practice of 25% or less at FID. Having a more advanced engineering design provides a better understanding of the quantity and quality of materials, equipment and labor required to execute the project and reduces the likelihood of out-of-sequence work and construction delays due to engineering issues. The project team and principal contractor have been integrated into one team with fewer layers of management, lower cost and more effective leadership.
Turning to Slide 17. We're pleased to see this project and our execution and are excited about the value the project brings to Kazakhstan, TCO and our shareholders. Tengiz is a world-class reservoir, and FGP/WPMP provides the foundation for the continued economic development of the field. The project utilizes technology already proven at Tengiz. It addresses declining reservoir pressure and enhances recovery from the reservoir. This countercyclical investment takes advantage of the current market in terms of cost savings, fabrication capacity and contractor capabilities. Project economics are attractive within the current concession life and include 20% contingency. The project provides additional upside opportunities, including future infill drilling, facility debottlenecking, increased oil production from existing plants as well as additional enhanced recovery projects. A concession extension or utilizing less contingency would also provide additional benefits. Tengiz has been an excellent asset for Chevron, and this investment will allow Tengiz to continue to generate value into the future.
I'll now hand back to Pat to discuss our progress on spend reduction."

You'll note the steep reduction in quarterly C&E average over the past 3 years. Year-to-date, capital expenditures are down 31% when compared with 2015. We're on a trend line for 2016 C&E of $25 billion or less. For 2017, 2018, we anticipate capital expenditures between $17 billion and $22 billion. If the current price environment persists, we will revisit the bottom end of the range as our primary goal is to be cash-balanced. Year-to-date operating expense is also down, down 8% when compared to 2015, and we expect the downward quarterly trend to continue in the second half of this year as we realize the full year run rate organizational actions and supply chain initiatives.
Turning to Slide 19. Just a quick update on our asset sales program. Over the last 10 years, on average, we have received proceeds from asset sales of $2.9 billion per year. With the sale of our interest in Caltex Australia, 2015 was the highest dollar transaction year. Year-to-date, we have received proceeds of $1.4 billion covering several transactions: New Zealand marketing, Canadian gas storage assets, pipeline assets in California and upstream assets in the Gulf of Mexico. 
We have a number of potential transactions presently being worked. The larger publicly known transactions are noted on this slide. There are a few attributes that these transactions have in common. The assets are not essential to delivering on our strategy. Their valuations are not particularly oil price-sensitive, and there are multiple interested buyers. We believe our sales program is executable and that we can secure good value. We have confidence in achieving our $5 billion to $10 billion target for total proceeds over this year and next. And as I said last quarter, we have line of sight on around $2 billion for 2016.  
I'd like to close the presentation here on Slide 20 by reiterating a few key points. We remain committed to becoming cash-balanced in 2017. Our projects are coming online, and we're making huge strides in lowering our cost structure and getting our capital outflows down. We're on track with our asset sales program. We see those as bac-end loaded with more occurring in 2017 than this year. They're eminently doable. We believe they are a realistic part of our cash-balancing program. Looking out the next 12 to 24 months, our profile is just as we have long said it would be, strong volume growth and cash flow margin accretions at the same time. That's a powerful combination offering tremendous value growth for our shareholders. 
Our financial priorities remain unchanged. We're committed to drawing the dividend as earnings and cash flow permit. We recognize the value our shareholders place on dividends and the value they place in our long history of annual dividend payment increases.
So that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. [Operator Instructions]

The deferred tax impacts will also reverse, and you need to think about these as tax loss carrybacks or tax loss carryforwards. Across the world, it depends on specific circumstances and specific jurisdictions what the specifics of that are. But in either case, we can either take these back against prior income or we can carry them forward against future income. So in our case, I know, for example, we will be filing for amended tax returns in 2017. So the point is that those negatives, both on working capital and deferred tax, they're negatives right now, but they become positive in the future.

We've always said that our expectation is that Trains 2 and 3 would start up at roughly 6 month intervals, and we're pretty much still on that plan. We started up the first train in March, so we're projecting early in the fourth quarter for Train 2 and then Train 3 will follow along behind. So there's latitude in those quarters. We're seeing very good construction progress on 2 and 3. And importantly, all the lessons, as I said, that we've learned, not only during the construction time but in the design and all the modifications we've had to make as we started up Train 1, all that's been built into Train 2 as well as the actual hours to complete these projects. So we feel very encouraged by the results we're seeing. We're happy with the construction progress. We're well into commissioning of Train 2. So there, it's pretty much as we expected. As far as the ramp-up, our view has been 6 to 8 months. We kind of base that looking at LNG projects around the world. That's a normal kind of a ramp-up period. As I've said before, it's not so much that you're on this smooth curve from start-up to full capacity. But as you start up one of these plants, there are issues that have to be dealt with, and so you have periods of downtime as you go down to make modifications or fix some of the equipment that you have difficulty with -- on start-up, tuning loops, things like that. So it's really a function of the downtime, and the overall effect is a curve as you approach 100% capacity. So we still expect that 6 to 8 months kind of a ramp-up period. But again, with 2 and 3 and the benefit of the experiences we're gaining on Train 1, their identical designs gives us a little bit of a head start in terms of that ramp-up for the second 2 trains."

I can't get into details of the fiscal terms that we work under with the contract, but we do see a better rate than what you're seeing.

I can't get into details of the fiscal terms that we work under with the contract, but we do see a better rate than what you're seeing. The transportation costs are quite good with CPC. Of course, with FGP, some portion of the throughput would have to go by rail, but it's going to be within the envelope of what we've already moved by rail prior to the expansion of CPC. So we're quite comfortable with that. When we look at Gorgon overall -- or sorry, FGP overall, I think there's a couple of things in terms of the economics. We have a very good understanding of this reservoir. It's largely been derisked. We've been operating it for 23 years. We have a very strong operating organization and maintenance organization there that's giving us very high reliability. So between the good reservoir models and our understanding of that reservoir as well as the operation and reliability we get from the facilities, this is a very good project for us in terms of the scale and the amount of capacity it adds. We also see that the market conditions right now are favorable, and the project is ready for execution. As we've talked about, the engineering is well advanced, over 50%. The procurement is 67%. We have a very good understanding of what it's going to take to execute this project. And we've got a lot of the infrastructure already in place, because effectively, this builds on the infrastructure that's already in Tengiz. So we see it as a relatively low-risk project from all those factors. In terms of the opportunities though, we see a lot of upside opportunity. We've done a great job in the past at Tengiz. We've really got a proven track record of extracting incremental value out of the infrastructure once it's installed. If you look at SGP, for example, the second generation plant that started up in 2008, this really tested the new technology that's being used at FGP, and since start-up, we've been able to increase the capacity that facility by 22% over nameplate, which gives us a lot of incremental capacity. FGP is actually simpler in terms of the processing facilities than SGP, and we would expect to see similar types of upside opportunity. There's also upside when you look at the infill drilling that FGP puts in place, and FGP carries incrementally large gas-handling capacity more than what's required right now. So as the reservoir pressures continue to decline, not only does it help stabilize the platform, but we take that additional gas-handling capacity and use it on existing facilities today and help handle that increase in gas/oil ratio into the future. So there's a lot of upside benefits there yet to come. Of course, when we talk about the opportunity for contract extensions, we feel this is good for the company as well as ourselves. Now there's other assessments out there, like Wood Mac. Many of you may have seen it. There's a number of areas where we see some differences in our view and their view. As I said, we have a very well-matched, accurate reservoir model, history-matched model. We have a faster ramp-up on the project after completion. We also have a faster decline on the reservoir if we weren't doing the project than what Wood Mac is counting on. Both of those would drive value into the project. And finally, Wood Mac has almost twice as many wells in their forecast than we carry in our development plan. So those are some key differences I would point out as well as some of the upside potential we see with this project."

We've looked ahead and said these are the areas that cost us difficulty on these projects, and we've tried to mitigate each one of those. And I won't go through them in detail again. They're in the slides. I've talked about them before. But engineering represents one of the biggest challenges and our work to advance the engineering before FID but also advance the engineering before we start the execution. Before we cut the first deal for any of the fabrication, our models will be complete and 90 -- at the 90% point and design assurance-verified before we start any of the actual fabrication work on facilities. And we've done a tremendous amount of work on the design assurance reviews, and we're working to make sure the procurement is advanced. So that when we start the execution in the field, we know that we'll be able to move through that execution smoothly and in sequence.

Our view is that we would like to see a return to production. That's what we advocate. But in the meantime, what we've done are 2 things. We've tried to bring all the preservation work and maintain the field in a state of readiness so it can be restarted. We've also done quite a bit of work to understand and use the opportunity with our technical people to model the entire field and look for efficiencies that we can build into this field when it restarts, and we've been quite successful in some of the planning that we have for the restart. We've also been bringing our cost structures down, and there'll be more of that to come as this continues forward. In terms of Nigeria, this is an area where we've operated for a long time. There are some issues there. The government is working these issues. Our priority is on protecting people and making sure that we protect our operations. But I really won't say too much more about it other than this is an issue that continues to be address by the government."

We do see our cash flow circumstance improving over time here. We've got the confidence in our future growth and production. We've got confidence in our future cash generation. I'll take you back to the $2 per barrel margin increase that we showed at the Security Analyst Day on the portfolio. Assuming flat commodity prices, that's the margin accretion that we get out of these LNG projects predominantly. It raises the cash margin on the entire portfolio. And we also believe that we can compete very successfully and sustainably over time here with a much lower capital program because we've got assets, for example, like the Permian and other unconventionals.

We've got an existing set of deepwater projects that are already in operation in the Gulf of Mexico, and they're very profitable. And more than that, they provide a good platform for additional investment, as we talked about earlier in the presentation. Going forward, the key really is getting our development costs down. And we're very focused on doing that in a couple of ways. Our deepwater drilling has improved fairly substantially. If you look at just in the last year or so, we've seen 30% faster drilling rates in the deepwater. And with the cost of rigs, that has a big impact. As we move forward, we expect to see our rig cost go down as well as the rates of drilling progress go up. We're also looking at the facilities and getting them rightsized. What I mean by that is rather than chasing for peak production, for example, we may go at smaller facilities, have a longer plateau of production, higher capital efficiencies. So as we look at driving at cost per barrel, the development cost down, I think it -- that's what's going to be required for new projects to be competitive with other opportunities in our portfolio. Once these projects are on, they have relatively low operating costs. We get good margins out of them. It's just the time between the initial exploration program and development wells and, ultimately, the production that burdens these projects from an overall financial return standpoint. In terms of the Tiber that you asked about, this project is still under assessment. I really don't want to comment too much further. But we're evaluating it. There may be some additional appraisal work to do, and then we'll be putting that against some of the other opportunities that we have. We do think the deepwater represents a good resource base, and it is important for meeting global demand in the future. So we think production from this area will continue. But as I said, our focus is on driving those development costs down so that these projects are competitive with other opportunities in the portfolio."

We've made a commitment as well. There's an affordability component here. We've made a commitment as well to get cash-balanced in 2017. And because of the opportunity that we've got, both in the brownfield extensions as well as in the Permian unconventional-like activity, we believe we've got a very competitive capital program at $17 billion range.

But we've also been very focused on building efficiency in how we conduct our operations, and we talked about that in previous calls and at the SAM meeting. That work continues across the business. And as we drive more and more efficiency into our spend, we own that. We'll be able to retain that going forward. I think the other big area for us is improving the execution of projects, and it's partly doing things better internally. And I talked about what those things are. They're on that slide. But it's also taking advantage of market conditions like we're in now, where we can get the best yards working on our projects. We're not competing for yard resources and contractor capabilities. We can get the A team on these projects, and that really helps us execute better. And that's a sustainable through this period."

Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, Executive Vice President, Upstream; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. I'll begin with a recap of our second quarter 2016 financial results, and then Jay will provide an update on our upstream business prior to my concluding remarks.
Turning to Slide 3. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. This company's second quarter loss was $1.5 billion or negative $0.78 per diluted share. Included in the quarter were impairments and other charges of $2.8 billion. These are primarily associated with certain assets where, through a combination of reservoir performance and price, revenue from oil and gas production is not expected to recover costs. Excluding these items as well as the impact of asset sale gains of $420 million and foreign exchange effects of $279 million, earnings for the quarter totaled $661 million or $0.35 per share. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. Cash from operations for the quarter was $2.5 billion, and our debt ratio at quarter end was approximately 23%. Our net debt ratio was a bit under 20%. During the second quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we announced a dividend of $1.07 per share payable to stockholders of record as of August 19, 2016. We currently yield 4.2%.
Turning to Slide 4. Cash generated from operations was $2.5 billion during the second quarter and $3.7 billion year-to-date. Upstream cash generation was stronger than the first quarter, commensurate with rising crude prices. Working capital effects of $2 billion and $2 billion in deferred tax items, for example, those associated with tax loss positions, reduced year-to-date operating cash. These are generally transitory effects, which reverse in future periods. We expect a portion of the working capital drain to reverse later this year. Proceeds from asset sales for the quarter totaled $1.3 billion, mainly from the sale of our New Zealand marketing assets, Canadian natural gas storage assets and pipeline assets in North America. Cash capital expenditures were $4.5 billion, a decrease of over $3 billion from second quarter 2015 and down more than $1 billion from the first quarter of 2016. At quarter end, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $9 billion, and our net debt position was $36 billion.
Turning to Slide 5. Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Second quarter 2016 results were $2 billion lower than second quarter 2015 results. Special items, primarily the absence of the second quarter 2015 gain on the sale of Caltex Australia Limited, partially offset by the second quarter 2016 gain on the sale of New Zealand marketing reduced earnings by $1.4 billion between periods. In both quarters, depreciation expense was impacted by impairments and other charges. The swing in foreign exchange impacts improved earnings by $530 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations and do not generally affect cash. Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased $528 million between quarters. Lower crude realizations were partially offset by lower exploration and operating expenses as well as other unrelated positive variances. Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by $535 million, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses.
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll now compare results for the second quarter of 2016 with the first quarter of 2016. Second quarter results were $745 million lower than the first quarter. Net special items for impairments, project suspensions and other related charges decreased earnings by $2.2 billion between periods. Foreign exchange created a positive earnings variance of nearly $600 million between periods. Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased approximately $1.2 billion between quarters, primarily reflecting higher realizations, in line with our price sensitivity, as well as lower exploration and depreciation charges. Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were lower by $79 million as lower operating expenses were more than offset by inventory revaluation effects. The variance in the other segment largely reflects unfavorable corporate tax items.  
Jay will now review our worldwide quarterly production and provide an update on our upstream operations. Jay?"

I'll start with second quarter 2016 production and then provide an update on a few of our key upstream projects. 
Slide 7 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter 2016 and the second quarter 2015. Net production decreased by 68,000 barrels a day between these quarters, yielding first half 2016 production of 2.6 million barrels a day. Shale and tight production increased by 50,000 barrels a day, primarily due to growth in the Midland and Delaware basins and the Permian with the Marcellus, Vaca Muerta, Duvernay and Liard Basins also reflecting year-on-year growth. Major capital projects increased production by 37,000 barrels a day as ramp-ups continue at Jack/St. Malo, Chuandongbei and Angola LNG, and we saw initial production from Gorgon. Disruptions due to external events accounted for the temporary shut-in of 63,000 barrels per day, which included the Partitioned Zone, security issues in Nigeria and fires in Canada. The sale of our Michigan assets and several assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf resulted in decreased production of 44,000 barrels a day. The decrease of 48,000 barrels a day in the base business and other bar reflects normal field declines and higher turnaround activity, partially offset by new base business production from brownfield investments.
The chart shown on Slide 8 was presented in January and outlined our production guidance and uncertainties for 2016. The cumulative impact of the uncertainties has been unfavorable, and we expect to be near the bottom of the annualized guidance we provided. For example, we anticipated that oil production in the Partitioned Zone would be restarted by midyear, which hasn't happened. As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2015, this field produced over 75,000 barrels a day, Chevron share. We've also worked through various start-up issues at Gorgon that impacted our first half production. We've been successful with our upstream divestment program, which is impacting our production. Transactions closed this year represent a daily production rate of just over 40,000 barrels a day, and we expect to see an additional 15,000 to 30,000 daily barrels leaving the portfolio before the end of this year. 
In addition to these uncertainties, production in the third quarter will be adversely impacted by a large number of turnarounds, including the second-generation plant at Tengiz. At the same time, our long-anticipated queue of projects is now coming online. In the second half of this year, we expect to see sustained production from Angola LNG, Gorgon Trains 1 and 2, and all 3 trains at Chuandongbei. We're also expecting continued growth from the Permian, which I'll talk further in a few minutes. The overall result is that we expect to exit the year with the December production in the range of 2.65 million to 2.7 million barrels per day.
Turning to Slide 9. Funding the completion of projects under construction is our first capital allocation priority. At Gorgon, we're currently producing at 70% of Train 1's capacity or approximately 90,000 barrels per day. In early July, we took a short shutdown to address a number of issues and repair a minor leak. Production resumed mid-July, and the plant has been running smoothly since that time. We're incorporating all the experience gained from Train 1's construction, completion and initial operations into Trains 2 and 3. Construction on Trains 2 and 3 is progressing very well. We expect first LNG from Train 2 early in the fourth quarter and from Train 3 in the second quarter of 2017. 
At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017 for Train 1. The cleanup and testing of all 9 development wells has been completed, and the rig has been released. Initial results are in line with expectations. At the plant site, piping, electrical and instrumentation work is currently progressing very well. We're working to maintain this progress as we begin the transition to completion, commissioning and start-up activities. Train 2 construction work is also progressing per plan with start-up expected 6 to 8 months after Train 1.
Slide 10 shows our other 2016 start-ups. At Angola LNG, modifications were completed at the plant and production restarted on May 20. Since restarting the plant, we've loaded 4 LNG and 7 LPG cargos. The plant was tested at 75% capacity and ran smoothly prior to the planned shutdown for strainer and other maintenance activities. The modifications to the gas conditioning section operated as designed, and all other repairs are complete. We expect to achieve sustained production during the third quarter. At Chuandongbei, Train3 started up in late May, and all 3 trains have delivered at full capacity and are now operational. There've been no changes since our previous updates on Alder, Mafumeira Sul or Bangka.
Turning to Slide 11. Our next capital priority is to fund high-return, short-cycle base and shale and tight investments. First among these opportunities is the Permian, where we have a large royalty advantage acreage position. We're making excellent progress in the Permian towards the growth we discussed at our Analyst Meeting in March. Production this quarter was 21% or 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, higher than the second quarter of last year. Efficiency gains and a shift to more Chevron-operated rigs have more than offset the reduction in total rig count. We're delivering our plan with fewer rigs and less costs. 
Turning to Slide 12. As we've said before, one of our primary benchmarking metrics for our Permian assets is development cost per barrel. Since the second quarter of last year, we've reduced our unit development cost by approximately 30%. We've been able to accelerate our performance improvements by incorporating industry best practices and applying lessons learned from our joint ventures and contractors. As shown by the data, our development cost is competitive with our joint venture partners. The table shows improvement in our drilling and completion cost performance from recent pad drilling programs. For 7,500-foot laterals in the Midland Basin, we're averaging $5.6 million per well, which is a 25% reduction from what we showed you at our Analyst Meeting in March. 
Our recovery per well is also improving as we continue to implement learnings and optimize our lateral lengths, well completions and drawdown strategies. Earlier this year, we exceeded 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in a 24-hour well test on a 7,500-foot lateral well in the Greater Bryant G area. We also put our 100th company-operated horizontal well in production and continue to gain confidence in our acreage characterization and performance. We're taking a disciplined, measured approach to development, and we're optimizing and prioritizing the large number of available well locations. We're delivering on our objective to be a competitive operator, whose royalty provision provides an incremental competitive advantage, and we're consistently improving our financial performance. 
Slide 13. In addition to the Permian and other large-scale, short-cycle businesses, such as San Joaquin and Gulf of Thailand, we have a number of attractive major capital projects that leverage previous investments. The projects listed on this slide all take advantage of existing infrastructure, reducing development cost and cycle time. As they build upon existing developments, they also tend to carry less subsurface and execution risk. The average development cost for these projects is around $15 a barrel. At Jack and St. Malo, we continue to ramp up production. In June, the combined production for both fields reached 110,000 barrels a day. This was accomplished through continued high-facility reliability and the start-up of the eighth well. The first Stage 2 well is expected to come online next month.
Turning Slide 14. A major brownfield opportunity we've talked about many times is the Future Growth and Wellhead Pressure Management Project in Tengiz. As we announced earlier this month, the TCO partnership sanctioned the project. WPMP provides additional wells and pressure boosting facilities to maintain production levels in the existing plants as reservoir pressures decline. FGP builds on the sour gas injection technology already proven in existing operations at Tengiz. It adds additional production and gas injection capacity to increase total oil production by around 260,000 barrels a day. The project is designed to capture execution and infrastructure efficiencies and will take advantage of current market conditions. Incremental recovery is expected to be 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
Turning to Slide 15. FGP/WPMP is estimated to cost $36.8 billion, which includes $27 billion for facilities, $3.5 billion for wells and $6.2 billion for contingency and escalation. The development cost for the project is $18 a barrel. Operating and transportation costs are expected to be consistent with our existing operations. TCO has secured financing to ensure uninterrupted project funding, utilizing a combination of bank loans, co-lending and bonds. Demand for the first tranche of the bond offering was strong, and the bonds were placed at an attractive interest rate.
Go to Slide 16. As I've discussed, we're committed to improving our project execution performance across the enterprise. I've used this slide previously to describe the actions we're taking on the projects in order to deliver strong execution performance and mitigate the amount of contingency consumed. We're confident these actions will improve our ability to deliver this project predictably and reliably, and I'll update you on a few examples. 
Engineering is currently greater than 50% complete, well ahead of industry practice of 25% or less at FID. Having a more advanced engineering design provides a better understanding of the quantity and quality of materials, equipment and labor required to execute the project and reduces the likelihood of out-of-sequence work and construction delays due to engineering issues. The project team and principal contractor have been integrated into one team with fewer layers of management, lower cost and more effective leadership.
Turning to Slide 17. We're pleased to see this project and our execution and are excited about the value the project brings to Kazakhstan, TCO and our shareholders. Tengiz is a world-class reservoir, and FGP/WPMP provides the foundation for the continued economic development of the field. The project utilizes technology already proven at Tengiz. It addresses declining reservoir pressure and enhances recovery from the reservoir. This countercyclical investment takes advantage of the current market in terms of cost savings, fabrication capacity and contractor capabilities. Project economics are attractive within the current concession life and include 20% contingency. The project provides additional upside opportunities, including future infill drilling, facility debottlenecking, increased oil production from existing plants as well as additional enhanced recovery projects. A concession extension or utilizing less contingency would also provide additional benefits. Tengiz has been an excellent asset for Chevron, and this investment will allow Tengiz to continue to generate value into the future.
I'll now hand back to Pat to discuss our progress on spend reduction."

You'll note the steep reduction in quarterly C&E average over the past 3 years. Year-to-date, capital expenditures are down 31% when compared with 2015. We're on a trend line for 2016 C&E of $25 billion or less. For 2017, 2018, we anticipate capital expenditures between $17 billion and $22 billion. If the current price environment persists, we will revisit the bottom end of the range as our primary goal is to be cash-balanced. Year-to-date operating expense is also down, down 8% when compared to 2015, and we expect the downward quarterly trend to continue in the second half of this year as we realize the full year run rate organizational actions and supply chain initiatives.
Turning to Slide 19. Just a quick update on our asset sales program. Over the last 10 years, on average, we have received proceeds from asset sales of $2.9 billion per year. With the sale of our interest in Caltex Australia, 2015 was the highest dollar transaction year. Year-to-date, we have received proceeds of $1.4 billion covering several transactions: New Zealand marketing, Canadian gas storage assets, pipeline assets in California and upstream assets in the Gulf of Mexico. 
We have a number of potential transactions presently being worked. The larger publicly known transactions are noted on this slide. There are a few attributes that these transactions have in common. The assets are not essential to delivering on our strategy. Their valuations are not particularly oil price-sensitive, and there are multiple interested buyers. We believe our sales program is executable and that we can secure good value. We have confidence in achieving our $5 billion to $10 billion target for total proceeds over this year and next. And as I said last quarter, we have line of sight on around $2 billion for 2016.  
I'd like to close the presentation here on Slide 20 by reiterating a few key points. We remain committed to becoming cash-balanced in 2017. Our projects are coming online, and we're making huge strides in lowering our cost structure and getting our capital outflows down. We're on track with our asset sales program. We see those as bac-end loaded with more occurring in 2017 than this year. They're eminently doable. We believe they are a realistic part of our cash-balancing program. Looking out the next 12 to 24 months, our profile is just as we have long said it would be, strong volume growth and cash flow margin accretions at the same time. That's a powerful combination offering tremendous value growth for our shareholders. 
Our financial priorities remain unchanged. We're committed to drawing the dividend as earnings and cash flow permit. We recognize the value our shareholders place on dividends and the value they place in our long history of annual dividend payment increases.
So that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. [Operator Instructions]

Across the world, it depends on specific circumstances and specific jurisdictions what the specifics of that are. But in either case, we can either take these back against prior income or we can carry them forward against future income. So in our case, I know, for example, we will be filing for amended tax returns in 2017.

We've always said that our expectation is that Trains 2 and 3 would start up at roughly 6 month intervals, and we're pretty much still on that plan. We started up the first train in March, so we're projecting early in the fourth quarter for Train 2 and then Train 3 will follow along behind. So there's latitude in those quarters. We're seeing very good construction progress on 2 and 3. And importantly, all the lessons, as I said, that we've learned, not only during the construction time but in the design and all the modifications we've had to make as we started up Train 1, all that's been built into Train 2 as well as the actual hours to complete these projects. So we feel very encouraged by the results we're seeing. We're happy with the construction progress. We're well into commissioning of Train 2. So there, it's pretty much as we expected. As far as the ramp-up, our view has been 6 to 8 months. We kind of base that looking at LNG projects around the world. That's a normal kind of a ramp-up period. As I've said before, it's not so much that you're on this smooth curve from start-up to full capacity. But as you start up one of these plants, there are issues that have to be dealt with, and so you have periods of downtime as you go down to make modifications or fix some of the equipment that you have difficulty with -- on start-up, tuning loops, things like that. So it's really a function of the downtime, and the overall effect is a curve as you approach 100% capacity. So we still expect that 6 to 8 months kind of a ramp-up period. But again, with 2 and 3 and the benefit of the experiences we're gaining on Train 1, their identical designs gives us a little bit of a head start in terms of that ramp-up for the second 2 trains."

I can't get into details of the fiscal terms that we work under with the contract, but we do see a better rate than what you're seeing. The transportation costs are quite good with CPC. Of course, with FGP, some portion of the throughput would have to go by rail, but it's going to be within the envelope of what we've already moved by rail prior to the expansion of CPC. So we're quite comfortable with that. When we look at Gorgon overall -- or sorry, FGP overall, I think there's a couple of things in terms of the economics. We have a very good understanding of this reservoir. It's largely been derisked. We've been operating it for 23 years. We have a very strong operating organization and maintenance organization there that's giving us very high reliability. So between the good reservoir models and our understanding of that reservoir as well as the operation and reliability we get from the facilities, this is a very good project for us in terms of the scale and the amount of capacity it adds. We also see that the market conditions right now are favorable, and the project is ready for execution. As we've talked about, the engineering is well advanced, over 50%. The procurement is 67%. We have a very good understanding of what it's going to take to execute this project. And we've got a lot of the infrastructure already in place, because effectively, this builds on the infrastructure that's already in Tengiz. So we see it as a relatively low-risk project from all those factors. In terms of the opportunities though, we see a lot of upside opportunity. We've done a great job in the past at Tengiz. We've really got a proven track record of extracting incremental value out of the infrastructure once it's installed. If you look at SGP, for example, the second generation plant that started up in 2008, this really tested the new technology that's being used at FGP, and since start-up, we've been able to increase the capacity that facility by 22% over nameplate, which gives us a lot of incremental capacity. FGP is actually simpler in terms of the processing facilities than SGP, and we would expect to see similar types of upside opportunity. There's also upside when you look at the infill drilling that FGP puts in place, and FGP carries incrementally large gas-handling capacity more than what's required right now. So as the reservoir pressures continue to decline, not only does it help stabilize the platform, but we take that additional gas-handling capacity and use it on existing facilities today and help handle that increase in gas/oil ratio into the future. So there's a lot of upside benefits there yet to come. Of course, when we talk about the opportunity for contract extensions, we feel this is good for the company as well as ourselves. Now there's other assessments out there, like Wood Mac. Many of you may have seen it. There's a number of areas where we see some differences in our view and their view. As I said, we have a very well-matched, accurate reservoir model, history-matched model. We have a faster ramp-up on the project after completion. We also have a faster decline on the reservoir if we weren't doing the project than what Wood Mac is counting on. Both of those would drive value into the project. And finally, Wood Mac has almost twice as many wells in their forecast than we carry in our development plan. So those are some key differences I would point out as well as some of the upside potential we see with this project."

But then what we tried to do is take our experience on other very large projects, like Gorgon and Wheatstone, as well as projects we've done in Tengiz and build those in. We've looked ahead and said these are the areas that cost us difficulty on these projects, and we've tried to mitigate each one of those. And I won't go through them in detail again. They're in the slides. I've talked about them before. But engineering represents one of the biggest challenges and our work to advance the engineering before FID but also advance the engineering before we start the execution. Before we cut the first deal for any of the fabrication, our models will be complete and 90 -- at the 90% point and design assurance-verified before we start any of the actual fabrication work on facilities. And we've done a tremendous amount of work on the design assurance reviews, and we're working to make sure the procurement is advanced. So that when we start the execution in the field, we know that we'll be able to move through that execution smoothly and in sequence. We think all these brought together, along with our experience in Kazakhstan, is going to help us really stay focused on mitigating any use of that contingency. Contingency is expected to be used. What we're trying to do is reduce the risk and uncertainty so that we can minimize how much of it we do have to use."

We're actually trending on $24 billion at the 6-month mark, but we're thinking $25 billion may be -- sorry, $24 billion may be where we end the year. So somewhere between $24 billion and $25 billion, I think, is the appropriate level for you to think about. And then in terms of 2017 and 2018, we've given you the range there of the $17 billion to $22 billion. But obviously, we need to be market responsive. And so right now, we're thinking it's towards the lower end of that range. And if, in fact, the market doesn't move prices anywhere off of where they are today, we'll probably be lower than that or, certainly, at the very low end of that range. So that's as much guidance as I can give you on capital at the moment. We're rolling up the business plans, and we'll have more to say as we get towards the end of the year. On operating expense, our target really -- we came down on operating expense, $2 billion, between 2014 and 2015, and our target is to come down another $2 billion between 2015 and 2016.

We've got an existing set of deepwater projects that are already in operation in the Gulf of Mexico, and they're very profitable. And more than that, they provide a good platform for additional investment, as we talked about earlier in the presentation. Going forward, the key really is getting our development costs down. And we're very focused on doing that in a couple of ways. Our deepwater drilling has improved fairly substantially. If you look at just in the last year or so, we've seen 30% faster drilling rates in the deepwater. And with the cost of rigs, that has a big impact. As we move forward, we expect to see our rig cost go down as well as the rates of drilling progress go up. We're also looking at the facilities and getting them rightsized. What I mean by that is rather than chasing for peak production, for example, we may go at smaller facilities, have a longer plateau of production, higher capital efficiencies. So as we look at driving at cost per barrel, the development cost down, I think it -- that's what's going to be required for new projects to be competitive with other opportunities in our portfolio. Once these projects are on, they have relatively low operating costs. We get good margins out of them. It's just the time between the initial exploration program and development wells and, ultimately, the production that burdens these projects from an overall financial return standpoint. In terms of the Tiber that you asked about, this project is still under assessment. I really don't want to comment too much further. But we're evaluating it. There may be some additional appraisal work to do, and then we'll be putting that against some of the other opportunities that we have. We do think the deepwater represents a good resource base, and it is important for meeting global demand in the future. So we think production from this area will continue. But as I said, our focus is on driving those development costs down so that these projects are competitive with other opportunities in the portfolio."

But also, going forward, as we talked about the portfolio shift that we have, where we have a lot more of our future investments coming forward in the shorter-cycle Permian base activity as opposed to the long-cycle and large-duration major capital projects, that's really what drives the change in the absolute level of spending. We've made a commitment as well. There's an affordability component here. We've made a commitment as well to get cash-balanced in 2017. And because of the opportunity that we've got, both in the brownfield extensions as well as in the Permian unconventional-like activity, we believe we've got a very competitive capital program at $17 billion range. So I think of it as being a sustainable sort of capital level under prices that we have today."

Building on what Pat said, I think there's a lot of things that drive capital spending, and it can be everything from our current price environment to foreign exchange rates.

But we've also been very focused on building efficiency in how we conduct our operations, and we talked about that in previous calls and at the SAM meeting. That work continues across the business. And as we drive more and more efficiency into our spend, we own that. We'll be able to retain that going forward. I think the other big area for us is improving the execution of projects, and it's partly doing things better internally. And I talked about what those things are. They're on that slide. But it's also taking advantage of market conditions like we're in now, where we can get the best yards working on our projects. We're not competing for yard resources and contractor capabilities. We can get the A team on these projects, and that really helps us execute better. And that's a sustainable through this period."

Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, Executive Vice President, Upstream; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. I'll begin with a recap of our second quarter 2016 financial results, and then Jay will provide an update on our upstream business prior to my concluding remarks.
Turning to Slide 3. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's second quarter loss was $1.5 billion or negative $0.78 per diluted share. 
Included in the quarter were impairments and other charges of $2.8 billion. These are primarily associated with certain assets where, through a combination of reservoir performance and price, revenue from oil and gas production is not expected to recover costs. 
Excluding these items, as well as the impact of asset sale gains of $420 million and foreign exchange effects of $279 million, earnings for the quarter totaled $661 million or $0.35 per share. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. 
Cash from operations for the quarter was $2.5 billion, and our debt ratio at quarter end was approximately 23%. Our net debt ratio was a bit under 20%. 
During the second quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we announced a dividend of $1.07 per share payable to stockholders of record as of August 19, 2016. We currently yield 4.2%.
Turning to Slide 4. Cash generated from operations was $2.5 billion during the second quarter and $3.7 billion year-to-date. Upstream cash generation was stronger than the first quarter, commensurate with rising crude prices. 
Working capital effects of $2 billion and $2 billion in deferred tax items, for example, those associated with tax loss positions, reduced year-to-date operating cash. These are generally transitory effects, which reverse in future periods. We expect a portion of the working capital drain to reverse later this year. 
Proceeds from asset sales for the quarter totaled $1.3 billion, mainly from the sale of our New Zealand marketing assets, Canadian natural gas storage assets and pipeline assets in North America. 
Cash capital expenditures were $4.5 billion, a decrease of over $3 billion from second quarter 2015 and down more than $1 billion from the first quarter of 2016. 
At quarter end, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $9 billion, and our net debt position was $36 billion.
Turning to Slide 5. Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Second quarter 2016 results were $2 billion lower than second quarter 2015 results. 
Special items, primarily the absence of the second quarter 2015 gain on the sale of Caltex Australia Limited, partially offset by the second quarter 2016 gain on the sale of New Zealand marketing, reduced earnings by $1.4 billion between periods. 
In both quarters, depreciation expense was impacted by impairments and other charges. The swing in foreign exchange impacts improved earnings by $530 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations and do not generally affect cash. 
Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased $528 million between quarters. Lower crude realizations were partially offset by lower exploration and operating expenses, as well as other unrelated positive variances. 
Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by $535 million, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses.
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll now compare results for the second quarter of 2016 with the first quarter of 2016. Second quarter results were $745 million lower than the first quarter. 
Net special items for impairments, project suspensions and other related charges decreased earnings by $2.2 billion between periods. Foreign exchange created a positive earnings variance of nearly $600 million between periods. 
Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased approximately $1.2 billion between quarters, primarily reflecting higher realizations, in line with our price sensitivity, as well as lower exploration and depreciation charges. 
Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were lower by $79 million as lower operating expenses were more than offset by inventory revaluation effects. 
The variance in the other segment largely reflects unfavorable corporate tax items.  
Jay will now review our worldwide quarterly production and provide an update on our upstream operations. Jay?"
98506,369476045,1018023,"Chevron Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Chevron Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Pat.

I'll start with second quarter 2016 production and then provide an update on a few of our key upstream projects. 
Slide 7 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter 2016 and the second quarter 2015. Net production decreased by 68,000 barrels a day between these quarters, yielding first half 2016 production of 2.6 million barrels a day. 
Shale and tight production increased by 50,000 barrels a day, primarily due to growth in the Midland and Delaware basins and the Permian with the Marcellus, Vaca Muerta, Duvernay and Liard Basins also reflecting year-on-year growth. 
Major capital projects increased production by 37,000 barrels a day as ramp-ups continue at Jack/St. Malo, Chuandongbei and Angola LNG, and we saw initial production from Gorgon. 
Disruptions due to external events accounted for the temporary shut-in of 63,000 barrels per day, which included the Partitioned Zone, security issues in Nigeria and fires in Canada. 
The sale of our Michigan assets and several assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf resulted in decreased production of 44,000 barrels a day. The decrease of 48,000 barrels a day in the base business and other bar reflects normal field declines and higher turnaround activity, partially offset by new base business production from brownfield investments.
The chart shown on Slide 8 was presented in January and outlined our production guidance and uncertainties for 2016. The cumulative impact of the uncertainties has been unfavorable, and we expect to be near the bottom of the annualized guidance we provided. For example, we anticipated that oil production in the Partitioned Zone would be restarted by midyear, which hasn't happened. As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2015, this field produced over 75,000 barrels a day, Chevron's share. 
We've also worked through various start-up issues at Gorgon that impacted our first half production. We've been successful with our upstream divestment program, which is impacting our production. Transactions closed this year represent a daily production rate of just over 40,000 barrels a day, and we expect to see an additional 15,000 to 30,000 daily barrels leaving the portfolio before the end of this year. 
In addition to these uncertainties, production in the third quarter will be adversely impacted by a large number of turnarounds, including the second-generation plant at Tengiz. At the same time, our long-anticipated queue of projects is now coming online. In the second half of this year, we expect to see sustained production from Angola LNG, Gorgon Trains 1 and 2, and all 3 trains at Chuandongbei. We're also expecting continued growth from the Permian, which I'll talk further in a few minutes. 
The overall result is that we expect to exit the year with the December production in the range of 2.65 million to 2.7 million barrels per day.
Turning to Slide 9. Funding the completion of projects under construction is our first capital allocation priority. At Gorgon, we're currently producing at 70% of Train 1's capacity or approximately 90,000 barrels per day. In early July, we took a short shutdown to address a number of issues and repair a minor leak. Production resumed mid-July, and the plant has been running smoothly since that time. 
We're incorporating all the experience gained from Train 1's construction, completion and initial operations into Trains 2 and 3. Construction on Trains 2 and 3 is progressing very well. We expect first LNG from Train 2 early in the fourth quarter and from Train 3 in the second quarter of 2017. 
At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017 for Train 1. The cleanup and testing of all 9 development wells has been completed, and the rig has been released. Initial results are in line with expectations. At the plant site, piping, electrical and instrumentation work is currently progressing very well. We're working to maintain this progress as we begin the transition to completion, commissioning and start-up activities. Train 2 construction work is also progressing per plan with start-up expected 6 to 8 months after Train 1.
Slide 10 shows our other 2016 start-ups. At Angola LNG, modifications were completed at the plant and production restarted on May 20. Since restarting the plant, we've loaded 4 LNG and 7 LPG cargos. The plant was tested at 75% capacity and ran smoothly prior to the planned shutdown for strainer and other maintenance activities. The modifications to the gas conditioning section operated as designed, and all other repairs are complete. We expect to achieve sustained production during the third quarter. 
At Chuandongbei, Train3 started up in late May, and all 3 trains have delivered at full capacity and are now operational. There've been no changes since our previous updates on Alder, Mafumeira Sul or Bangka.
Turning to Slide 11. Our next capital priority is to fund high-return, short-cycle base and shale and tight investments. First among these opportunities is the Permian, where we have a large royalty advantaged acreage position. We're making excellent progress in the Permian towards the growth we discussed at our Analyst Meeting in March. Production this quarter was 21% or 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, higher than the second quarter of last year. Efficiency gains and a shift to more Chevron-operated rigs have more than offset the reduction in total rig count. We're delivering our plan with fewer rigs and less cost. 
Turning to Slide 12. As we've said before, one of our primary benchmarking metrics for our Permian assets is development cost per barrel. Since the second quarter of last year, we've reduced our unit development cost by approximately 30%. We've been able to accelerate our performance improvements by incorporating industry best practices and applying lessons learned from our joint ventures and contractors. 
As shown by the data, our development cost is competitive with our joint venture partners. The table shows improvement in our drilling and completion cost performance from recent pad drilling programs. For 7,500-foot laterals in the Midland Basin, we're averaging $5.6 million per well, which is a 25% reduction from what we showed you at our Analyst Meeting in March. 
Our recovery per well is also improving as we continue to implement learnings and optimize our lateral lengths, well completions and drawdown strategies. Earlier this year, we exceeded 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in a 24-hour well test on a 7,500-foot lateral well in the Greater Bryant G area. We also put our 100th company-operated horizontal well in production and continue to gain confidence in our acreage characterization and performance. 
We're taking a disciplined, measured approach to development, and we're optimizing and prioritizing the large number of available well locations. We're delivering on our objective to be a competitive operator, whose royalty position provides an incremental competitive advantage, and we're consistently improving our financial performance. 
Slide 13. In addition to the Permian and other large-scale, short-cycle businesses such as San Joaquin and Gulf of Thailand, we have a number of attractive major capital projects that leverage previous investments. The projects listed on this slide all take advantage of existing infrastructure, reducing development costs and cycle time. As they build upon existing developments, they also tend to carry less subsurface and execution risk. The average development cost for these projects is around $15 a barrel. 
At Jack and St. Malo, we continue to ramp up production. In June, the combined production for both fields reached 110,000 barrels a day. This was accomplished through continued high-facility reliability and the start-up of the eighth well. The first Stage 2 well is expected to come online next month.
Turning Slide 14. A major brownfield opportunity that we've talked about many times is the Future Growth and Wellhead Pressure Management Project in Tengiz. As we announced earlier this month, the TCO partnership sanctioned the project. WPMP provides additional wells and pressure-boosting facilities to maintain production levels in the existing plants as reservoir pressures decline. FGP builds on the sour gas injection technology already proven in existing operations at Tengiz. It adds additional production and gas injection capacity to increase total oil production by around 260,000 barrels a day. The project is designed to capture execution and infrastructure efficiencies and will take advantage of current market conditions. Incremental recovery is expected to be 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
Turning to Slide 15. FGP/WPMP is estimated to cost $36.8 billion, which includes $27 billion for facilities, $3.5 billion for wells and $6.2 billion for contingency and escalation. The development cost for the project is $18 a barrel. Operating and transportation costs are expected to be consistent with our existing operations. TCO has secured financing to ensure uninterrupted project funding, utilizing a combination of bank loans, co-lending and bonds. Demand for the first tranche of the bond offering was strong, and the bonds were placed at an attractive interest rate.
Go to Slide 16. As I've discussed, we're committed to improving our project execution performance across the enterprise. I've used this slide previously to describe the actions we're taking on the projects in order to deliver strong execution performance and mitigate the amount of contingency consumed. We're confident these actions will improve our ability to deliver this project predictably and reliably, and I'll update you on a few examples. 
Engineering is currently greater than 50% complete, well ahead of industry practice of 25% or less at FID. Having a more advanced engineering design provides a better understanding of the quantity and quality of materials, equipment and labor required to execute the project, and reduces the likelihood of out-of-sequence work and construction delays due to engineering issues. The project team and principal contractor have been integrated into one team with fewer layers of management, lower cost and more effective leadership.
Turning to Slide 17. We're pleased to see this project enter execution and are excited about the value the project brings to Kazakhstan, TCO and our shareholders. Tengiz is a world-class reservoir, and FGP/WPMP provides the foundation for the continued economic development of the field. The project utilizes technology already proven at Tengiz. It addresses declining reservoir pressure and enhances recovery from the reservoir. 
This countercyclical investment takes advantage of the current market in terms of cost savings, fabrication capacity and contractor capabilities. Project economics are attractive within the current concession life and include 20% contingency. 
The project provides additional upside opportunities, including future infill drilling, facility debottlenecking, increased oil production from existing plants, as well as additional enhanced recovery projects. A concession extension or utilizing less contingency would also provide additional benefits. Tengiz has been an excellent asset for Chevron, and this investment will allow Tengiz to continue to generate value into the future.
I'll now hand back to Pat to discuss our progress on spend reduction."

Year-to-date operating expense is also down, down 8% when compared to 2015, and we expect the downward quarterly trend to continue in the second half of this year as we realize the full year run rate of  organizational actions and supply chain initiatives.
Turning to Slide 19. Just a quick update on our asset sales program. Over the last 10 years, on average, we have received proceeds from asset sales of $2.9 billion per year. With the sale of our interest in Caltex Australia, 2015 was the highest dollar transaction year. Year-to-date, we have received proceeds of $1.4 billion covering several transactions: New Zealand marketing, Canadian gas storage assets, pipeline assets in California and upstream assets in the Gulf of Mexico. 
We have a number of potential transactions presently being worked. The larger publicly known transactions are noted on this slide. There are a few attributes that these transactions have in common. The assets are not essential to delivering on our strategy. Their valuations are not particularly oil price-sensitive, and there are multiple interested buyers. We believe our sales program is executable and that we can secure good value. We have confidence in achieving our $5 billion to $10 billion target for total proceeds over this year and next. And as I said last quarter, we have line of sight on around $2 billion for 2016.  
I'd like to close the presentation here on Slide 20 by reiterating a few key points. We remain committed to becoming cash-balanced in 2017. Our projects are coming online, and we're making huge strides in lowering our cost structure and getting our capital outflows down. We're on track with our asset sales program. We see those as back-end loaded with more occurring in 2017 than this year. They're eminently doable. We believe they are a realistic part of our cash-balancing program. 
Looking out the next 12 to 24 months, our profile is just as we have long said it would be: strong volume growth and cash flow margin accretions at the same time. That's a powerful combination offering tremendous value growth for our shareholders. 
Our financial priorities remain unchanged. We're committed to drawing the dividend as earnings and cash flow permit. We recognize the value our shareholders place on dividends and the value they place on our long history of annual dividend payment increases.
So that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. [Operator Instructions]

The deferred tax impacts will also reverse, and you need to think about these as tax loss carrybacks or tax loss carryforwards. Across the world, it depends on specific circumstances and specific jurisdictions what the specifics of that are. But in either case, we can either take these back against prior income or we can carry them forward against future income. So in our case, I know, for example, we will be filing for amended tax returns in 2017. So the point is that those negatives, both on working capital and deferred tax, they're negatives right now, but they become positives in the future. And so when I -- when you think about this impact -- and it's pretty significant on a year-to-date basis, again, $4 billion across 2 of those.

We've always said that our expectation is that Trains 2 and 3 would start up at roughly 6 month intervals, and we're pretty much still on that plan. We started up the first train in March, so we're projecting early in the fourth quarter for Train 2 and then Train 3 will follow along behind. So there's latitude in those quarters. We're seeing very good construction progress on 2 and 3. And importantly, all the lessons, as I said, that we've learned, not only during the construction time but in the design and all the modifications we've had to make as we've started up Train 1, all that's been built into Train 2, as well as the actual hours to complete these projects. So we feel very encouraged by the results we're seeing. We're happy with the construction progress. We're well into commissioning of Train 2. So there, it's pretty much as we'd expected. As far as the ramp-up, our view has been 6 to 8 months. We kind of base that looking at LNG projects around the world. That's a normal kind of a ramp-up period. As I've said before, it's not so much that you're on this smooth curve from start-up to full capacity. But as you start up one of these plants, there are issues that have to be dealt with, and so you have periods of downtime as you go down to make modifications or fix some of the equipment that you have difficulty with on start-up, tuning loops, things like that. So it's really a function of the downtime, and the overall effect is a curve as you approach 100% capacity. So we still expect that 6 to 8 months kind of a ramp-up period. But again, with 2 and 3 and the benefit of the experiences we're gaining on Train 1, their identical designs gives us a little bit of a head start in terms of that ramp-up for the second 2 trains."

I can't get into details of the fiscal terms that we work under with the contract, but we do see a better rate than what you're seeing.

I can't get into details of the fiscal terms that we work under with the contract, but we do see a better rate than what you're seeing. The transportation costs are quite good with CPC. Of course, with FGP, some portion of the throughput would have to go by rail, but it's going to be within the envelope of what we've already moved by rail prior to the expansion of CPC. So we're quite comfortable with that. When we look at Gorgon overall -- or sorry, FGP overall, I think there's a couple of things in terms of the economics. We have a very good understanding of this reservoir. It's largely been derisked. We've been operating it for 23 years. We have a very strong operating organization and maintenance organization there that's giving us very high reliability. So between the good reservoir models and our understanding of that reservoir, as well as the operation and reliability we get from the facilities, this is a very good project for us in terms of the scale and the amount of capacity it adds. We also see that the market conditions right now are favorable, and the project is ready for execution. As we've talked about, the engineering is well advanced, over 50%. The procurement is 67%. We have a very good understanding of what it's going to take to execute this project. And we've got a lot of the infrastructure already in place, because effectively, this builds on the infrastructure that's already in Tengiz. So we see it as a relatively low-risk project from all those factors. In terms of the opportunities though, we see a lot of upside opportunity. We've done a great job in the past at Tengiz and we've really got a proven track record of extracting incremental value out of the infrastructure once it's installed. If you look at SGP, for example, the second generation plant that started up in 2008, this really tested the new technology that's being used at FGP, and since start-up, we've been able to increase the capacity of that facility by 22% over nameplate, which gives us a lot of incremental capacity. FGP is actually simpler in terms of the processing facilities than SGP, and we would expect to see similar types of upside opportunity. There's also upside when you look at the infill drilling that FGP puts in place, and FGP carries incrementally large gas-handling capacity, more than what's required right now. So as the reservoir pressures continue to decline, not only does it help stabilize the platform, but we take that additional gas-handling capacity and use it on existing facilities today and help handle that increase in gas/oil ratio into the future. So there's a lot of upside benefits there yet to come. Of course, when we talk about the opportunity for contract extensions, we feel this is good for the company as well as ourselves. Now there's other assessments out there, like Wood Mac. Many of you may have seen it. There's a number of areas where we see some differences in our view and their view. As I said, we have a very well-matched, accurate reservoir model, history-matched model. We have a faster ramp-up on the project after completion. We also have a faster decline on the reservoir if we weren't doing the project. And what Wood Mac is counting on, both of those would drive value into the project. And finally, Wood Mac has almost twice as many wells in their forecast than we carry in our development plan. So those are some key differences I would point out as well as some of the upside potential we see with this project."

I mean, what we've really tried to do is both be reasonable and as practical -- realistic, I should say, in our view of what contingent is required on these very large projects. And this is based on our past, but also the industry experience in executing these projects. But then what we've tried to do is take our experience on other very large projects, like Gorgon and Wheatstone, as well as projects we've done in Tengiz and build those in. We've looked ahead and said these are the areas that cause us difficulty on these projects, and we've tried to mitigate each one of those. And I won't go through them in detail again. They're in the slides. I've talked about them before. But engineering represents one of the biggest challenges and our work to advance the engineering before FID but also advance the engineering before we start the execution. Before we cut the first deal for any of the fabrication, our models will be complete and 90 -- at the 90% point and design assurance-verified before we start any of the actual fabrication work on facilities. And we've done a tremendous amount of work on the design assurance reviews, and we're working to make sure the procurement is advanced. So that when we start the execution in the field, we know that we'll be able to move through that execution smoothly and in sequence. We think all these brought together, along with our experience in Kazakhstan, is going to help us really stay focused on mitigating any use of that contingency. Contingency is expected to be used. What we're trying to do is reduce the risk and uncertainty so that we can minimize how much of it we do have to use."

We're actually trending on $24 billion at the 6-month mark, but we're thinking $25 billion may be -- sorry, $24 billion may be where we end the year. So somewhere between $24 billion and $25 billion, I think is the appropriate level for you to think about. And then in terms of 2017 and 2018, we've given you the range there of the $17 billion to $22 billion. But obviously, we need to be market responsive. And so right now, we're thinking it's towards the lower end of that range. And if, in fact, the market doesn't move prices anywhere off of where they are today, we'll probably be lower than that or, certainly, at the very low end of that range. So that's as much guidance as I can give you on capital at the moment. We're rolling up the business plans, and we'll have more to say as we get towards the end of the year. On operating expense, our target really -- we came down on operating expense, $2 billion, between 2014 and 2015, and our target is to come down another $2 billion between 2015 and 2016.

We've got an existing set of deepwater projects that are already in operation in the Gulf of Mexico, and they're very profitable. And more than that, they provide a good platform for additional investment, as we talked about earlier in the presentation. Going forward, the key really is getting our development costs down. And we're very focused on doing that in a couple of ways. Our deepwater drilling has improved fairly substantially. If you look at just in the last year or so, we've seen 30% faster drilling rates in the deepwater. And with the cost of rigs, that has a big impact. As we move forward, we expect to see our rig costs go down as well as the rates of drilling progress go up. We're also looking at the facilities and getting them rightsized. What I mean by that is rather than chasing for peak production, for example, we may go at smaller facilities, have a longer plateau of production, higher capital efficiencies. So as we look at driving at cost per barrel, the development cost down, I think it -- that's what's going to be required for new projects to be competitive with other opportunities in our portfolio. Once these projects are on, they have relatively low operating costs. We get good margins out of them. It's just the time between the initial exploration program and development wells and, ultimately, the production that burdens these projects from an overall financial return standpoint. In terms of the Tiber that you asked about, this project is still under assessment. I really don't want to comment too much further. But we're evaluating it. There may be some additional appraisal work to do, and then we'll be putting that against some of the other opportunities that we have. We do think the deepwater represents a good resource base, and it is important for meeting global demand in the future. So we think production from this area will continue. But as I said, our focus is on driving those development costs down so that these projects are competitive with other opportunities in the portfolio."

Building on what Pat said, I think there's a lot of things that drive capital spending, and it can be everything from our current price environment to foreign exchange rates. But what we've really focused on in this near term had been 2 things. One is driving down the pricing from our vendors and contractors. That's probably more transitory. But we've also been very focused on building efficiency in how we conduct our operations, and we've talked about that in previous calls and at the SAM meeting. That work continues across the business. And as we drive more and more efficiency into our spend, we own that. We'll be able to retain that going forward. I think the other big area for us is improving the execution of projects, and it's partly doing things better internally. And I've talked about what those things are. They're on that slide. But it's also taking advantage of market conditions like we're in now, where we can get the best yards working on our projects. We're not competing for yard resources and contractor capabilities. We can get the A team on these projects, and that really helps us execute better. And that's a sustainable through this period."

Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, Executive Vice President, Upstream; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. I'll begin with a recap of our second quarter 2016 financial results, and then Jay will provide an update on our upstream business prior to my concluding remarks.
Turning to Slide 3. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's second quarter loss was $1.5 billion or negative $0.78 per diluted share. 
Included in the quarter were impairments and other charges of $2.8 billion. These are primarily associated with certain assets where, through a combination of reservoir performance and price, revenue from oil and gas production is not expected to recover costs. 
Excluding these items, as well as the impact of asset sale gains of $420 million and foreign exchange effects of $279 million, earnings for the quarter totaled $661 million or $0.35 per share. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. 
Cash from operations for the quarter was $2.5 billion, and our debt ratio at quarter end was approximately 23%. Our net debt ratio was a bit under 20%. 
During the second quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we announced a dividend of $1.07 per share payable to stockholders of record as of August 19, 2016. We currently yield 4.2%.
Turning to Slide 4. Cash generated from operations was $2.5 billion during the second quarter and $3.7 billion year-to-date. Upstream cash generation was stronger than the first quarter, commensurate with rising crude prices. 
Working capital effects of $2 billion and $2 billion in deferred tax items, for example, those associated with tax loss positions, reduced year-to-date operating cash. These are generally transitory effects, which reverse in future periods. We expect a portion of the working capital drain to reverse later this year. 
Proceeds from asset sales for the quarter totaled $1.3 billion, mainly from the sale of our New Zealand marketing assets, Canadian natural gas storage assets and pipeline assets in North America. 
Cash capital expenditures were $4.5 billion, a decrease of over $3 billion from second quarter 2015 and down more than $1 billion from the first quarter of 2016. 
At quarter end, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $9 billion, and our net debt position was $36 billion.
Turning to Slide 5. Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Second quarter 2016 results were $2 billion lower than second quarter 2015 results. 
Special items, primarily the absence of the second quarter 2015 gain on the sale of Caltex Australia Limited, partially offset by the second quarter 2016 gain on the sale of New Zealand marketing, reduced earnings by $1.4 billion between periods. 
In both quarters, depreciation expense was impacted by impairments and other charges. The swing in foreign exchange impacts improved earnings by $530 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations and do not generally affect cash. 
Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased $528 million between quarters. Lower crude realizations were partially offset by lower exploration and operating expenses, as well as other unrelated positive variances. 
Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by $535 million, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses.
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll now compare results for the second quarter of 2016 with the first quarter of 2016. Second quarter results were $745 million lower than the first quarter. 
Net special items for impairments, project suspensions and other related charges decreased earnings by $2.2 billion between periods. Foreign exchange created a positive earnings variance of nearly $600 million between periods. 
Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased approximately $1.2 billion between quarters, primarily reflecting higher realizations, in line with our price sensitivity, as well as lower exploration and depreciation charges. 
Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were lower by $79 million as lower operating expenses were more than offset by inventory revaluation effects. 
The variance in the other segment largely reflects unfavorable corporate tax items.  
Jay will now review our worldwide quarterly production and provide an update on our upstream operations. Jay?"

I'll start with second quarter 2016 production and then provide an update on a few of our key upstream projects. 
Slide 7 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter 2016 and the second quarter 2015. Net production decreased by 68,000 barrels a day between these quarters, yielding first half 2016 production of 2.6 million barrels a day. 
Shale and tight production increased by 50,000 barrels a day, primarily due to growth in the Midland and Delaware basins and the Permian with the Marcellus, Vaca Muerta, Duvernay and Liard Basins also reflecting year-on-year growth. 
Major capital projects increased production by 37,000 barrels a day as ramp-ups continue at Jack/St. Malo, Chuandongbei and Angola LNG, and we saw initial production from Gorgon. 
Disruptions due to external events accounted for the temporary shut-in of 63,000 barrels per day, which included the Partitioned Zone, security issues in Nigeria and fires in Canada. 
The sale of our Michigan assets and several assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf resulted in decreased production of 44,000 barrels a day. The decrease of 48,000 barrels a day in the base business and other bar reflects normal field declines and higher turnaround activity, partially offset by new base business production from brownfield investments.
The chart shown on Slide 8 was presented in January and outlined our production guidance and uncertainties for 2016. The cumulative impact of the uncertainties has been unfavorable, and we expect to be near the bottom of the annualized guidance we provided. For example, we anticipated that oil production in the Partitioned Zone would be restarted by midyear, which hasn't happened. As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2015, this field produced over 75,000 barrels a day, Chevron's share. 
We've also worked through various start-up issues at Gorgon that impacted our first half production. We've been successful with our upstream divestment program, which is impacting our production. Transactions closed this year represent a daily production rate of just over 40,000 barrels a day, and we expect to see an additional 15,000 to 30,000 daily barrels leaving the portfolio before the end of this year. 
In addition to these uncertainties, production in the third quarter will be adversely impacted by a large number of turnarounds, including the second-generation plant at Tengiz. At the same time, our long-anticipated queue of projects is now coming online. In the second half of this year, we expect to see sustained production from Angola LNG, Gorgon Trains 1 and 2, and all 3 trains at Chuandongbei. We're also expecting continued growth from the Permian, which I'll talk further in a few minutes. 
The overall result is that we expect to exit the year with the December production in the range of 2.65 million to 2.7 million barrels per day.
Turning to Slide 9. Funding the completion of projects under construction is our first capital allocation priority. At Gorgon, we're currently producing at 70% of Train 1's capacity or approximately 90,000 barrels per day. In early July, we took a short shutdown to address a number of issues and repair a minor leak. Production resumed mid-July, and the plant has been running smoothly since that time. 
We're incorporating all the experience gained from Train 1's construction, completion and initial operations into Trains 2 and 3. Construction on Trains 2 and 3 is progressing very well. We expect first LNG from Train 2 early in the fourth quarter and from Train 3 in the second quarter of 2017. 
At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017 for Train 1. The cleanup and testing of all 9 development wells has been completed, and the rig has been released. Initial results are in line with expectations. At the plant site, piping, electrical and instrumentation work is currently progressing very well. We're working to maintain this progress as we begin the transition to completion, commissioning and start-up activities. Train 2 construction work is also progressing per plan with start-up expected 6 to 8 months after Train 1.
Slide 10 shows our other 2016 start-ups. At Angola LNG, modifications were completed at the plant and production restarted on May 20. Since restarting the plant, we've loaded 4 LNG and 7 LPG cargos. The plant was tested at 75% capacity and ran smoothly prior to the planned shutdown for strainer and other maintenance activities. The modifications to the gas conditioning section operated as designed, and all other repairs are complete. We expect to achieve sustained production during the third quarter. 
At Chuandongbei, Train3 started up in late May, and all 3 trains have delivered at full capacity and are now operational. There've been no changes since our previous updates on Alder, Mafumeira Sul or Bangka.
Turning to Slide 11. Our next capital priority is to fund high-return, short-cycle base and shale and tight investments. First among these opportunities is the Permian, where we have a large royalty advantaged acreage position. We're making excellent progress in the Permian towards the growth we discussed at our Analyst Meeting in March. Production this quarter was 21% or 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, higher than the second quarter of last year. Efficiency gains and a shift to more Chevron-operated rigs have more than offset the reduction in total rig count. We're delivering our plan with fewer rigs and less cost. 
Turning to Slide 12. As we've said before, one of our primary benchmarking metrics for our Permian assets is development cost per barrel. Since the second quarter of last year, we've reduced our unit development cost by approximately 30%. We've been able to accelerate our performance improvements by incorporating industry best practices and applying lessons learned from our joint ventures and contractors. 
As shown by the data, our development cost is competitive with our joint venture partners. The table shows improvement in our drilling and completion cost performance from recent pad drilling programs. For 7,500-foot laterals in the Midland Basin, we're averaging $5.6 million per well, which is a 25% reduction from what we showed you at our Analyst Meeting in March. 
Our recovery per well is also improving as we continue to implement learnings and optimize our lateral lengths, well completions and drawdown strategies. Earlier this year, we exceeded 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in a 24-hour well test on a 7,500-foot lateral well in the Greater Bryant G area. We also put our 100th company-operated horizontal well in production and continue to gain confidence in our acreage characterization and performance. 
We're taking a disciplined, measured approach to development, and we're optimizing and prioritizing the large number of available well locations. We're delivering on our objective to be a competitive operator, whose royalty position provides an incremental competitive advantage, and we're consistently improving our financial performance. 
Slide 13. In addition to the Permian and other large-scale, short-cycle businesses such as San Joaquin and Gulf of Thailand, we have a number of attractive major capital projects that leverage previous investments. The projects listed on this slide all take advantage of existing infrastructure, reducing development costs and cycle time. As they build upon existing developments, they also tend to carry less subsurface and execution risk. The average development cost for these projects is around $15 a barrel. 
At Jack and St. Malo, we continue to ramp up production. In June, the combined production for both fields reached 110,000 barrels a day. This was accomplished through continued high-facility reliability and the start-up of the eighth well. The first Stage 2 well is expected to come online next month.
Turning Slide 14. A major brownfield opportunity that we've talked about many times is the Future Growth and Wellhead Pressure Management Project in Tengiz. As we announced earlier this month, the TCO partnership sanctioned the project. WPMP provides additional wells and pressure-boosting facilities to maintain production levels in the existing plants as reservoir pressures decline. FGP builds on the sour gas injection technology already proven in existing operations at Tengiz. It adds additional production and gas injection capacity to increase total oil production by around 260,000 barrels a day. The project is designed to capture execution and infrastructure efficiencies and will take advantage of current market conditions. Incremental recovery is expected to be 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
Turning to Slide 15. FGP/WPMP is estimated to cost $36.8 billion, which includes $27 billion for facilities, $3.5 billion for wells and $6.2 billion for contingency and escalation. The development cost for the project is $18 a barrel. Operating and transportation costs are expected to be consistent with our existing operations. TCO has secured financing to ensure uninterrupted project funding, utilizing a combination of bank loans, co-lending and bonds. Demand for the first tranche of the bond offering was strong, and the bonds were placed at an attractive interest rate.
Go to Slide 16. As I've discussed, we're committed to improving our project execution performance across the enterprise. I've used this slide previously to describe the actions we're taking on the projects in order to deliver strong execution performance and mitigate the amount of contingency consumed. We're confident these actions will improve our ability to deliver this project predictably and reliably, and I'll update you on a few examples. 
Engineering is currently greater than 50% complete, well ahead of industry practice of 25% or less at FID. Having a more advanced engineering design provides a better understanding of the quantity and quality of materials, equipment and labor required to execute the project, and reduces the likelihood of out-of-sequence work and construction delays due to engineering issues. The project team and principal contractor have been integrated into one team with fewer layers of management, lower cost and more effective leadership.
Turning to Slide 17. We're pleased to see this project enter execution and are excited about the value the project brings to Kazakhstan, TCO and our shareholders. Tengiz is a world-class reservoir, and FGP/WPMP provides the foundation for the continued economic development of the field. The project utilizes technology already proven at Tengiz. It addresses declining reservoir pressure and enhances recovery from the reservoir. 
This countercyclical investment takes advantage of the current market in terms of cost savings, fabrication capacity and contractor capabilities. Project economics are attractive within the current concession life and include 20% contingency. 
The project provides additional upside opportunities, including future infill drilling, facility debottlenecking, increased oil production from existing plants, as well as additional enhanced recovery projects. A concession extension or utilizing less contingency would also provide additional benefits. Tengiz has been an excellent asset for Chevron, and this investment will allow Tengiz to continue to generate value into the future.
I'll now hand back to Pat to discuss our progress on spend reduction."

You'll note the steep reduction in quarterly C&E average over the past 3 years. Year-to-date, capital expenditures are down 31% when compared with 2015. We're on a trend line for 2016 C&E of $25 billion or less. 
For 2017, 2018, we anticipate capital expenditures between $17 billion and $22 billion. If the current price environment persists, we will revisit the bottom end of the range as our primary goal is to be cash-balanced. 
Year-to-date operating expense is also down, down 8% when compared to 2015, and we expect the downward quarterly trend to continue in the second half of this year as we realize the full year run rate of  organizational actions and supply chain initiatives.
Turning to Slide 19. Just a quick update on our asset sales program. Over the last 10 years, on average, we have received proceeds from asset sales of $2.9 billion per year. With the sale of our interest in Caltex Australia, 2015 was the highest dollar transaction year. Year-to-date, we have received proceeds of $1.4 billion covering several transactions: New Zealand marketing, Canadian gas storage assets, pipeline assets in California and upstream assets in the Gulf of Mexico. 
We have a number of potential transactions presently being worked. The larger publicly known transactions are noted on this slide. There are a few attributes that these transactions have in common. The assets are not essential to delivering on our strategy. Their valuations are not particularly oil price-sensitive, and there are multiple interested buyers. We believe our sales program is executable and that we can secure good value. We have confidence in achieving our $5 billion to $10 billion target for total proceeds over this year and next. And as I said last quarter, we have line of sight on around $2 billion for 2016.  
I'd like to close the presentation here on Slide 20 by reiterating a few key points. We remain committed to becoming cash-balanced in 2017. Our projects are coming online, and we're making huge strides in lowering our cost structure and getting our capital outflows down. We're on track with our asset sales program. We see those as back-end loaded with more occurring in 2017 than this year. They're eminently doable. We believe they are a realistic part of our cash-balancing program. 
Looking out the next 12 to 24 months, our profile is just as we have long said it would be: strong volume growth and cash flow margin accretions at the same time. That's a powerful combination offering tremendous value growth for our shareholders. 
Our financial priorities remain unchanged. We're committed to drawing the dividend as earnings and cash flow permit. We recognize the value our shareholders place on dividends and the value they place on our long history of annual dividend payment increases.
So that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. [Operator Instructions]

The asset sales program, we'll give some further updates when we get to the SAM meeting on where we stand there, and some of those were already baked into that forecast. And of course, as we move forward and build a business plan this year, a lot of it's going to be responsive to the environment that we find ourselves as we move forward.

And on a year-to-date basis, both of them are worth about $2 billion each. From a working capital standpoint, I indicated that we expect a portion of that will reverse this year. The deferred tax impacts will also reverse, and you need to think about these as tax loss carrybacks or tax loss carryforwards. Across the world, it depends on specific circumstances and specific jurisdictions what the specifics of that are. But in either case, we can either take these back against prior income or we can carry them forward against future income. So in our case, I know, for example, we will be filing for amended tax returns in 2017. So the point is that those negatives, both on working capital and deferred tax, they're negatives right now, but they become positives in the future. And so when I -- when you think about this impact -- and it's pretty significant on a year-to-date basis, again, $4 billion across 2 of those. When you take that into account and you think about Gorgon and Wheatstone coming online and the $2-barrel margin accretion that we gave you over the whole portfolio, our outlook on cash flow generation going forward is quite positive."

We've always said that our expectation is that Trains 2 and 3 would start up at roughly 6 month intervals, and we're pretty much still on that plan. We started up the first train in March, so we're projecting early in the fourth quarter for Train 2 and then Train 3 will follow along behind. So there's latitude in those quarters. We're seeing very good construction progress on 2 and 3. And importantly, all the lessons, as I said, that we've learned, not only during the construction time but in the design and all the modifications we've had to make as we've started up Train 1, all that's been built into Train 2, as well as the actual hours to complete these projects. So we feel very encouraged by the results we're seeing. We're happy with the construction progress. We're well into commissioning of Train 2. So there, it's pretty much as we'd expected. As far as the ramp-up, our view has been 6 to 8 months. We kind of base that looking at LNG projects around the world. That's a normal kind of a ramp-up period. As I've said before, it's not so much that you're on this smooth curve from start-up to full capacity. But as you start up one of these plants, there are issues that have to be dealt with, and so you have periods of downtime as you go down to make modifications or fix some of the equipment that you have difficulty with on start-up, tuning loops, things like that. So it's really a function of the downtime, and the overall effect is a curve as you approach 100% capacity. So we still expect that 6 to 8 months kind of a ramp-up period. But again, with 2 and 3 and the benefit of the experiences we're gaining on Train 1, their identical designs gives us a little bit of a head start in terms of that ramp-up for the second 2 trains."

I can't get into details of the fiscal terms that we work under with the contract, but we do see a better rate than what you're seeing.

I can't get into details of the fiscal terms that we work under with the contract, but we do see a better rate than what you're seeing. The transportation costs are quite good with CPC. Of course, with FGP, some portion of the throughput would have to go by rail, but it's going to be within the envelope of what we've already moved by rail prior to the expansion of CPC. So we're quite comfortable with that. When we look at Gorgon overall -- or sorry, FGP overall, I think there's a couple of things in terms of the economics. We have a very good understanding of this reservoir. It's largely been derisked. We've been operating it for 23 years. We have a very strong operating organization and maintenance organization there that's giving us very high reliability. So between the good reservoir models and our understanding of that reservoir, as well as the operation and reliability we get from the facilities, this is a very good project for us in terms of the scale and the amount of capacity it adds. We also see that the market conditions right now are favorable, and the project is ready for execution. As we've talked about, the engineering is well advanced, over 50%. The procurement is 67%. We have a very good understanding of what it's going to take to execute this project. And we've got a lot of the infrastructure already in place, because effectively, this builds on the infrastructure that's already in Tengiz. So we see it as a relatively low-risk project from all those factors. In terms of the opportunities though, we see a lot of upside opportunity. We've done a great job in the past at Tengiz and we've really got a proven track record of extracting incremental value out of the infrastructure once it's installed. If you look at SGP, for example, the second generation plant that started up in 2008, this really tested the new technology that's being used at FGP, and since start-up, we've been able to increase the capacity of that facility by 22% over nameplate, which gives us a lot of incremental capacity. FGP is actually simpler in terms of the processing facilities than SGP, and we would expect to see similar types of upside opportunity. There's also upside when you look at the infill drilling that FGP puts in place, and FGP carries incrementally large gas-handling capacity, more than what's required right now. So as the reservoir pressures continue to decline, not only does it help stabilize the platform, but we take that additional gas-handling capacity and use it on existing facilities today and help handle that increase in gas/oil ratio into the future. So there's a lot of upside benefits there yet to come. Of course, when we talk about the opportunity for contract extensions, we feel this is good for the company as well as ourselves. Now there's other assessments out there, like Wood Mac. Many of you may have seen it. There's a number of areas where we see some differences in our view and their view. As I said, we have a very well-matched, accurate reservoir model, history-matched model. We have a faster ramp-up on the project after completion. We also have a faster decline on the reservoir if we weren't doing the project. And what Wood Mac is counting on, both of those would drive value into the project. And finally, Wood Mac has almost twice as many wells in their forecast than we carry in our development plan. So those are some key differences I would point out as well as some of the upside potential we see with this project."

We've looked ahead and said these are the areas that cause us difficulty on these projects, and we've tried to mitigate each one of those. And I won't go through them in detail again. They're in the slides. I've talked about them before. But engineering represents one of the biggest challenges and our work to advance the engineering before FID but also advance the engineering before we start the execution. Before we cut the first deal for any of the fabrication, our models will be complete and 90 -- at the 90% point and design assurance-verified before we start any of the actual fabrication work on facilities. And we've done a tremendous amount of work on the design assurance reviews, and we're working to make sure the procurement is advanced. So that when we start the execution in the field, we know that we'll be able to move through that execution smoothly and in sequence.

And on this point, you guys have had a pathway to improve returns in your materials for a few quarters now. And you've clearly made progress on the cost side based on today's results, and I think it was Slide 18 or so. So my question is if oil prices and financial performance recover in '16 and '17, can you envision a scenario whereby your financial priorities might shift for an intermediate-term period with a return of capital to shareholders having greater priority than spending, for instance? Or do you feel that between the cyclical timing and the low cost that we have today and the quality of your portfolio, that higher spending would almost surely be in the best interests of shareholders? So the question's about how you weigh the different financial options in the recovery scenario."

I do think -- I don't see that there's significant C&E increases coming for us. I think we're going to increase our dividend when cash flow permits it. We're going to make the investment profile that we've talked about where we're moving to shorter-cycle, higher-return projects and not as many of the long durations of return -- lower-return projects. FGP/WPMP is the only significant project that we have taken to FID. We do see additional major capital projects in our future, but they're not going to come with the same pace that we have had most recently here. We want to be much more ratable and predictable in our capital program. And we are going to have to take some of the cash that we're generating in the future and use it to restore our balance sheet."

I'll take you back to the $2 per barrel margin increase that we showed at the Security Analyst Day on the portfolio. Assuming flat commodity prices, that's the margin accretion that we get out of these LNG projects predominantly. It raises the cash margin on the entire portfolio.

We've got an existing set of deepwater projects that are already in operation in the Gulf of Mexico, and they're very profitable. And more than that, they provide a good platform for additional investment, as we talked about earlier in the presentation. Going forward, the key really is getting our development costs down. And we're very focused on doing that in a couple of ways. Our deepwater drilling has improved fairly substantially. If you look at just in the last year or so, we've seen 30% faster drilling rates in the deepwater. And with the cost of rigs, that has a big impact. As we move forward, we expect to see our rig costs go down as well as the rates of drilling progress go up. We're also looking at the facilities and getting them rightsized. What I mean by that is rather than chasing for peak production, for example, we may go at smaller facilities, have a longer plateau of production, higher capital efficiencies. So as we look at driving at cost per barrel, the development cost down, I think it -- that's what's going to be required for new projects to be competitive with other opportunities in our portfolio. Once these projects are on, they have relatively low operating costs. We get good margins out of them. It's just the time between the initial exploration program and development wells and, ultimately, the production that burdens these projects from an overall financial return standpoint. In terms of the Tiber that you asked about, this project is still under assessment. I really don't want to comment too much further. But we're evaluating it. There may be some additional appraisal work to do, and then we'll be putting that against some of the other opportunities that we have. We do think the deepwater represents a good resource base, and it is important for meeting global demand in the future. So we think production from this area will continue. But as I said, our focus is on driving those development costs down so that these projects are competitive with other opportunities in the portfolio."

We've made a commitment as well. There's an affordability component here. We've made a commitment as well to get cash-balanced in 2017. And because of the opportunity that we've got, both in the brownfield extensions as well as in the Permian unconventional-like activity, we believe we've got a very competitive capital program at a $17 billion range.

That work continues across the business. And as we drive more and more efficiency into our spend, we own that. We'll be able to retain that going forward. I think the other big area for us is improving the execution of projects, and it's partly doing things better internally. And I've talked about what those things are. They're on that slide. But it's also taking advantage of market conditions like we're in now, where we can get the best yards working on our projects. We're not competing for yard resources and contractor capabilities. We can get the A team on these projects, and that really helps us execute better. And that's a sustainable through this period."

Welcome to Chevron's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. On the call with me today are Jay Johnson, Executive Vice President, Upstream; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. I'll begin with a recap of our second quarter 2016 financial results, and then Jay will provide an update on our upstream business prior to my concluding remarks.
Turning to Slide 3. Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's second quarter loss was $1.5 billion or negative $0.78 per diluted share. 
Included in the quarter were impairments and other charges of $2.8 billion. These are primarily associated with certain assets where, through a combination of reservoir performance and price, revenue from oil and gas production is not expected to recover costs. 
Excluding these items as well as the impact of asset sale gains of $420 million and foreign exchange effects of $279 million, earnings for the quarter totaled $661 million or $0.35 per share. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation. 
Cash from operations for the quarter was $2.5 billion, and our debt ratio at quarter end was approximately 23%. Our net debt ratio was a bit under 20%. 
During the second quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we announced a dividend of $1.07 per share payable to stockholders of record as of August 19, 2016. We currently yield 4.2%.
Turning to Slide 4. Cash generated from operations was $2.5 billion during the second quarter and $3.7 billion year-to-date. Upstream cash generation was stronger than the first quarter, commensurate with rising crude prices. 
Working capital effects of $2 billion and $2 billion in deferred tax items, for example, those associated with tax loss positions, reduced year-to-date operating cash. These are generally transitory effects, which reverse in future periods. We expect a portion of the working capital drain to reverse later this year. 
Proceeds from asset sales for the quarter totaled $1.3 billion, mainly from the sale of our New Zealand marketing assets, Canadian natural gas storage assets and pipeline assets in North America. 
Cash capital expenditures were $4.5 billion, a decrease of over $3 billion from second quarter 2015 and down more than $1 billion from the first quarter of 2016. 
At quarter end, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $9 billion, and our net debt position was $36 billion.
Turning to Slide 5. Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Second quarter 2016 results were $2 billion lower than second quarter 2015 results. 
Special items, primarily the absence of the second quarter 2015 gain on the sale of Caltex Australia Limited, partially offset by the second quarter 2016 gain on the sale of New Zealand marketing, reduced earnings by $1.4 billion between periods. 
In both quarters, depreciation expense was impacted by impairments and other charges. The swing in foreign exchange impacts improved earnings by $530 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations and do not generally affect cash. 
Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased $528 million between quarters. Lower crude realizations were partially offset by lower exploration and operating expenses as well as other unrelated positive variances. 
Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by $535 million, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margins, partially offset by lower operating expenses.
Turning now to Slide 6. I'll now compare results for the second quarter of 2016 with the first quarter of 2016. Second quarter results were $745 million lower than the first quarter. 
Net special items for impairments, project suspensions and other related charges decreased earnings by $2.2 billion between periods. Foreign exchange created a positive earnings variance of nearly $600 million between periods. 
Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, increased approximately $1.2 billion between quarters, primarily reflecting higher realizations, in line with our price sensitivity as well as lower exploration and depreciation charges. 
Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were lower by $79 million as lower operating expenses were more than offset by inventory revaluation effects. 
The variance in the other segment largely reflects unfavorable corporate tax items. 
Jay will now review our worldwide quarterly production and provide an update on our upstream operations. Jay?"

I'll start with second quarter 2016 production and then provide an update on a few of our key upstream projects. 
Slide 7 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the second quarter 2016 and the second quarter 2015. Net production decreased by 68,000 barrels a day between these quarters, yielding first half 2016 production of 2.6 million barrels a day. 
Shale and tight production increased by 50,000 barrels a day, primarily due to growth in the Midland and Delaware basins and the Permian with the Marcellus, Vaca Muerta, Duvernay and Liard Basins also reflecting year-on-year growth. 
Major capital projects increased production by 37,000 barrels a day as ramp-ups continue at Jack/St. Malo, Chuandongbei and Angola LNG, and we saw initial production from Gorgon. 
Disruptions due to external events accounted for the temporary shut-in of 63,000 barrels per day, which included the Partitioned Zone, security issues in Nigeria and fires in Canada. 
The sale of our Michigan assets and several assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf resulted in decreased production of 44,000 barrels a day. The decrease of 48,000 barrels a day in the base business and other bar reflects normal field declines and higher turnaround activity, partially offset by new base business production from brownfield investments.
The chart shown on Slide 8 was presented in January and outlined our production guidance and uncertainties for 2016. The cumulative impact of the uncertainties has been unfavorable, and we expect to be near the bottom of the annualized guidance we provided. For example, we anticipated that oil production in the Partitioned Zone would be restarted by midyear, which hasn't happened. As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2015, this field produced over 75,000 barrels a day, Chevron's share. 
We've also worked through various start-up issues at Gorgon that impacted our first half production. We've been successful with our upstream divestment program, which is impacting our production. Transactions closed this year represent a daily production rate of just over 40,000 barrels a day, and we expect to see an additional 15,000 to 30,000 daily barrels leaving the portfolio before the end of this year. 
In addition to these uncertainties, production in the third quarter will be adversely impacted by a large number of turnarounds, including the second-generation plant at Tengiz. At the same time, our long-anticipated queue of projects is now coming online. In the second half of this year, we expect to see sustained production from Angola LNG, Gorgon Trains 1 and 2, and all 3 trains at Chuandongbei. We're also expecting continued growth from the Permian, which I'll talk further in a few minutes. 
The overall result is that we expect to exit the year with the December production in the range of 2.65 million to 2.7 million barrels per day.
Turning to Slide 9. Funding the completion of projects under construction is our first capital allocation priority. At Gorgon, we're currently producing at 70% of Train 1's capacity or approximately 90,000 barrels per day. In early July, we took a short shutdown to address a number of issues and repair a minor leak. Production resumed mid-July, and the plant has been running smoothly since that time. 
We're incorporating all the experience gained from Train 1's construction, completion and initial operations into Trains 2 and 3. Construction on Trains 2 and 3 is progressing very well. We expect first LNG from Train 2 early in the fourth quarter and from Train 3 in the second quarter of 2017. 
At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017 for Train 1. The cleanup and testing of all 9 development wells has been completed, and the rig has been released. Initial results are in line with expectations. At the plant site, piping, electrical and instrumentation work is currently progressing very well. We're working to maintain this progress as we begin the transition to completion, commissioning and start-up activities. Train 2 construction work is also progressing per plan with start-up expected 6 to 8 months after Train 1.
Slide 10 shows our other 2016 start-ups. At Angola LNG, modifications were completed at the plant and production restarted on May 20. Since restarting the plant, we've loaded 4 LNG and 7 LPG cargos. The plant was tested at 75% capacity and ran smoothly prior to the planned shutdown for strainer and other maintenance activities. The modifications to the gas conditioning section operated as designed, and all other repairs are complete. We expect to achieve sustained production during the third quarter. 
At Chuandongbei, Train3 started up in late May, and all 3 trains have delivered at full capacity and are now operational. There've been no changes since our previous updates on Alder, Mafumeira Sul or Bangka.
Turning to Slide 11. Our next capital priority is to fund high-return, short-cycle base and shale and tight investments. First among these opportunities is the Permian, where we have a large royalty advantaged acreage position. We're making excellent progress in the Permian towards the growth we discussed at our Analyst Meeting in March. Production this quarter was 21% or 24,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, higher than the second quarter of last year. Efficiency gains and a shift to more Chevron-operated rigs have more than offset the reduction in total rig count. We're delivering our plan with fewer rigs and less cost. 
Turning to Slide 12. As we've said before, one of our primary benchmarking metrics for our Permian assets is development cost per barrel. Since the second quarter of last year, we've reduced our unit development cost by approximately 30%. We've been able to accelerate our performance improvements by incorporating industry best practices and applying lessons learned from our joint ventures and contractors. 
As shown by the data, our development cost is competitive with our joint venture partners. The table shows improvement in our drilling and completion cost performance from recent pad drilling programs. For 7,500-foot laterals in the Midland Basin, we're averaging $5.6 million per well, which is a 25% reduction from what we showed you at our Analyst Meeting in March. 
Our recovery per well is also improving as we continue to implement learnings and optimize our lateral lengths, well completions and drawdown strategies. Earlier this year, we exceeded 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in a 24-hour well test on a 7,500-foot lateral well in the Greater Bryant G area. We also put our 100th company-operated horizontal well in production and continue to gain confidence in our acreage characterization and performance. 
We're taking a disciplined, measured approach to development, and we're optimizing and prioritizing the large number of available well locations. We're delivering on our objective to be a competitive operator, whose royalty position provides an incremental competitive advantage, and we're consistently improving our financial performance. 
Slide 13. In addition to the Permian and other large-scale, short-cycle businesses such as San Joaquin and Gulf of Thailand, we have a number of attractive major capital projects that leverage previous investments. The projects listed on this slide all take advantage of existing infrastructure, reducing development costs and cycle time. As they build upon existing developments, they also tend to carry less subsurface and execution risk. The average development cost for these projects is around $15 a barrel. 
At Jack and St. Malo, we continue to ramp up production. In June, the combined production for both fields reached 110,000 barrels a day. This was accomplished through continued high-facility reliability and the start-up of the eighth well. The first Stage 2 well is expected to come online next month.
Turning Slide 14. A major brownfield opportunity that we've talked about many times is the Future Growth and Wellhead Pressure Management Project in Tengiz. As we announced earlier this month, the TCO partnership sanctioned the project. WPMP provides additional wells and pressure-boosting facilities to maintain production levels in the existing plants as reservoir pressures decline. FGP builds on the sour gas injection technology already proven in existing operations at Tengiz. It adds additional production and gas injection capacity to increase total oil production by around 260,000 barrels a day. The project is designed to capture execution and infrastructure efficiencies and will take advantage of current market conditions. Incremental recovery is expected to be 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
Turning to Slide 15. FGP/WPMP is estimated to cost $36.8 billion, which includes $27 billion for facilities, $3.5 billion for wells and $6.2 billion for contingency and escalation. The development cost for the project is $18 a barrel. Operating and transportation costs are expected to be consistent with our existing operations. TCO has secured financing to ensure uninterrupted project funding, utilizing a combination of bank loans, co-lending and bonds. Demand for the first tranche of the bond offering was strong, and the bonds were placed at an attractive interest rate.
Go to Slide 16. As I've discussed, we're committed to improving our project execution performance across the enterprise. I've used this slide previously to describe the actions we're taking on the projects in order to deliver strong execution performance and mitigate the amount of contingency consumed. We're confident these actions will improve our ability to deliver this project predictably and reliably, and I'll update you on a few examples. 
Engineering is currently greater than 50% complete, well ahead of industry practice of 25% or less at FID. Having a more advanced engineering design provides a better understanding of the quantity and quality of materials, equipment and labor required to execute the project, and reduces the likelihood of out-of-sequence work and construction delays due to engineering issues. The project team and principal contractor have been integrated into one team with fewer layers of management, lower cost and more effective leadership.
Turning to Slide 17. We're pleased to see this project enter execution and are excited about the value the project brings to Kazakhstan, TCO and our shareholders. Tengiz is a world-class reservoir, and FGP/WPMP provides the foundation for the continued economic development of the field. The project utilizes technology already proven at Tengiz. It addresses declining reservoir pressure and enhances recovery from the reservoir. 
This countercyclical investment takes advantage of the current market in terms of cost savings, fabrication capacity and contractor capabilities. Project economics are attractive within the current concession life and include 20% contingency. 
The project provides additional upside opportunities, including future infill drilling, facility debottlenecking, increased oil production from existing plants as well as additional enhanced recovery projects. A concession extension or utilizing less contingency would also provide additional benefits. Tengiz has been an excellent asset for Chevron, and this investment will allow Tengiz to continue to generate value into the future.
I'll now hand back to Pat to discuss our progress on spend reduction."

You'll note the steep reduction in quarterly C&E average over the past 3 years. Year-to-date, capital expenditures are down 31% when compared with 2015. We're on a trend line for 2016 C&E of $25 billion or less. 
For 2017, 2018, we anticipate capital expenditures between $17 billion and $22 billion. If the current price environment persists, we will revisit the bottom end of the range as our primary goal is to be cash-balanced. 
Year-to-date operating expense is also down, down 8% when compared to 2015, and we expect the downward quarterly trend to continue in the second half of this year as we realize the full year run rate of organizational actions and supply chain initiatives.
Turning to Slide 19. Just a quick update on our asset sales program. Over the last 10 years, on average, we have received proceeds from asset sales of $2.9 billion per year. With the sale of our interest in Caltex Australia, 2015 was the highest dollar transaction year. Year-to-date, we have received proceeds of $1.4 billion covering several transactions: New Zealand marketing, Canadian gas storage assets, pipeline assets in California and upstream assets in the Gulf of Mexico. 
We have a number of potential transactions presently being worked. The larger publicly known transactions are noted on this slide. There are a few attributes that these transactions have in common. The assets are not essential to delivering on our strategy. Their valuations are not particularly oil price-sensitive, and there are multiple interested buyers. We believe our sales program is executable and that we can secure good value. We have confidence in achieving our $5 billion to $10 billion target for total proceeds over this year and next. And as I said last quarter, we have line of sight on around $2 billion for 2016. 
I'd like to close the presentation here on Slide 20 by reiterating a few key points. We remain committed to becoming cash-balanced in 2017. Our projects are coming online, and we're making huge strides in lowering our cost structure and getting our capital outflows down. We're on track with our asset sales program. We see those as back-end loaded with more occurring in 2017 than this year. They're eminently doable. We believe they are a realistic part of our cash-balancing program. 
Looking out the next 12 to 24 months, our profile is just as we have long said it would be: strong volume growth and cash flow margin accretions at the same time. That's a powerful combination offering tremendous value growth for our shareholders. 
Our financial priorities remain unchanged. We're committed to drawing the dividend as earnings and cash flow permit. We recognize the value our shareholders place on dividends and the value they place on our long history of annual dividend payment increases.
So that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take some questions. [Operator Instructions]

Across the world, it depends on specific circumstances and specific jurisdictions what the specifics of that are. But in either case, we can either take these back against prior income or we can carry them forward against future income. So in our case, I know, for example, we will be filing for amended tax returns in 2017. So the point is that those negatives, both on working capital and deferred tax, they're negatives right now, but they become positives in the future.

We started up the first train in March, so we're projecting early in the fourth quarter for Train 2 and then Train 3 will follow along behind. So there's latitude in those quarters. We're seeing very good construction progress on 2 and 3. And importantly, all the lessons, as I said, that we've learned, not only during the construction time but in the design and all the modifications we've had to make as we've started up Train 1, all that's been built into Train 2 as well as the actual hours to complete these projects. So we feel very encouraged by the results we're seeing. We're happy with the construction progress. We're well into commissioning of Train 2. So there, it's pretty much as we'd expected. As far as the ramp-up, our view has been 6 to 8 months. We kind of base that looking at LNG projects around the world. That's a normal kind of a ramp-up period. As I've said before, it's not so much that you're on this smooth curve from start-up to full capacity. But as you start up one of these plants, there are issues that have to be dealt with, and so you have periods of downtime as you go down to make modifications or fix some of the equipment that you have difficulty with on start-up, tuning loops, things like that. So it's really a function of the downtime, and the overall effect is a curve as you approach 100% capacity. So we still expect that 6 to 8 months kind of a ramp-up period. But again, with 2 and 3 and the benefit of the experiences we're gaining on Train 1, their identical designs gives us a little bit of a head start in terms of that ramp-up for the second 2 trains."

I can't get into details of the fiscal terms that we work under with the contract, but we do see a better rate than what you're seeing. The transportation costs are quite good with CPC.",627,"So I think our economics are a little bit different than yours, Paul. I can't get into details of the fiscal terms that we work under with the contract, but we do see a better rate than what you're seeing. The transportation costs are quite good with CPC. Of course, with FGP, some portion of the throughput would have to go by rail, but it's going to be within the envelope of what we've already moved by rail prior to the expansion of CPC. So we're quite comfortable with that. When we look at Gorgon overall -- or sorry, FGP overall, I think there's a couple of things in terms of the economics. We have a very good understanding of this reservoir. It's largely been derisked. We've been operating it for 23 years. We have a very strong operating organization and maintenance organization there that's giving us very high reliability. So between the good reservoir models and our understanding of that reservoir as well as the operation and reliability we get from the facilities, this is a very good project for us in terms of the scale and the amount of capacity it adds. We also see that the market conditions right now are favorable, and the project is ready for execution. As we've talked about, the engineering is well advanced, over 50%. The procurement is 67%. We have a very good understanding of what it's going to take to execute this project. And we've got a lot of the infrastructure already in place, because effectively, this builds on the infrastructure that's already in Tengiz. So we see it as a relatively low-risk project from all those factors. In terms of the opportunities though, we see a lot of upside opportunity. We've done a great job in the past at Tengiz and we've really got a proven track record of extracting incremental value out of the infrastructure once it's installed. If you look at SGP, for example, the second generation plant that started up in 2008, this really tested the new technology that's being used at FGP, and since start-up, we've been able to increase the capacity of that facility by 22% over nameplate, which gives us a lot of incremental capacity. FGP is actually simpler in terms of the processing facilities than SGP, and we would expect to see similar types of upside opportunity. There's also upside when you look at the infill drilling that FGP puts in place, and FGP carries incrementally large gas-handling capacity, more than what's required right now. So as the reservoir pressures continue to decline, not only does it help stabilize the platform, but we take that additional gas-handling capacity and use it on existing facilities today and help handle that increase in gas/oil ratio into the future. So there's a lot of upside benefits there yet to come. Of course, when we talk about the opportunity for contract extensions, we feel this is good for the company as well as ourselves. Now there's other assessments out there, like Wood Mac. Many of you may have seen it. There's a number of areas where we see some differences in our view and their view. As I said, we have a very well-matched, accurate reservoir model, history-matched model. We have a faster ramp-up on the project after completion. We also have a faster decline on the reservoir if we weren't doing the project. And what Wood Mac is counting on, both of those would drive value into the project. And finally, Wood Mac has almost twice as many wells in their forecast than we carry in our development plan. So those are some key differences I would point out as well as some of the upside potential we see with this project."

We've looked ahead and said these are the areas that cause us difficulty on these projects, and we've tried to mitigate each one of those. And I won't go through them in detail again. They're in the slides. I've talked about them before. But engineering represents one of the biggest challenges and our work to advance the engineering before FID but also advance the engineering before we start the execution. Before we cut the first deal for any of the fabrication, our models will be complete and 90 -- at the 90% point and design assurance-verified before we start any of the actual fabrication work on facilities. And we've done a tremendous amount of work on the design assurance reviews, and we're working to make sure the procurement is advanced. So that when we start the execution in the field, we know that we'll be able to move through that execution smoothly and in sequence. We think all these brought together, along with our experience in Kazakhstan, is going to help us really stay focused on mitigating any use of that contingency. Contingency is expected to be used.

And so right now, we're thinking it's towards the lower end of that range. And if, in fact, the market doesn't move prices anywhere off of where they are today, we'll probably be lower than that or, certainly, at the very low end of that range.

We've got an existing set of deepwater projects that are already in operation in the Gulf of Mexico, and they're very profitable. And more than that, they provide a good platform for additional investment, as we talked about earlier in the presentation. Going forward, the key really is getting our development costs down. And we're very focused on doing that in a couple of ways. Our deepwater drilling has improved fairly substantially. If you look at just in the last year or so, we've seen 30% faster drilling rates in the deepwater. And with the cost of rigs, that has a big impact. As we move forward, we expect to see our rig costs go down as well as the rates of drilling progress go up. We're also looking at the facilities and getting them rightsized. What I mean by that is rather than chasing for peak production, for example, we may go at smaller facilities, have a longer plateau of production, higher capital efficiencies. So as we look at driving at cost per barrel, the development cost down, I think it -- that's what's going to be required for new projects to be competitive with other opportunities in our portfolio. Once these projects are on, they have relatively low operating costs. We get good margins out of them. It's just the time between the initial exploration program and development wells and, ultimately, the production that burdens these projects from an overall financial return standpoint. In terms of the Tiber that you asked about, this project is still under assessment. I really don't want to comment too much further. But we're evaluating it. There may be some additional appraisal work to do, and then we'll be putting that against some of the other opportunities that we have. We do think the deepwater represents a good resource base, and it is important for meeting global demand in the future. So we think production from this area will continue. But as I said, our focus is on driving those development costs down so that these projects are competitive with other opportunities in the portfolio."

But also, going forward, as we talked about the portfolio shift that we have, where we have a lot more of our future investment coming forward in the shorter-cycle Permian base activity as opposed to the long-cycle and large-duration major capital projects, that's really what drives the change in the absolute level of spending. We've made a commitment as well. There's an affordability component here. We've made a commitment as well to get cash-balanced in 2017. And because of the opportunity that we've got, both in the brownfield extensions as well as in the Permian unconventional-like activity, we believe we've got a very competitive capital program at a $17 billion range.

Building on what Pat said, I think there's a lot of things that drive capital spending, and it can be everything from our current price environment to foreign exchange rates.

But we've also been very focused on building efficiency in how we conduct our operations, and we've talked about that in previous calls and at the SAM meeting. That work continues across the business. And as we drive more and more efficiency into our spend, we own that. We'll be able to retain that going forward. I think the other big area for us is improving the execution of projects, and it's partly doing things better internally. And I've talked about what those things are. They're on that slide. But it's also taking advantage of market conditions like we're in now, where we can get the best yards working on our projects. We're not competing for yard resources and contractor capabilities. We can get the A team on these projects, and that really helps us execute better. And that's a sustainable through this period."

Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and webcast.

We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. 
I'll begin with a recap of our third quarter 2016 financial and operational results, and then Bruce will provide an update on our Permian Basin business prior to my concluding remarks.
Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $1.3 billion or $0.68 per diluted share. Third quarter results included $290 million in special items related to a deferred tax benefit from the U.K. tax rate change and the receipt of an Ecuador arbitration award. Excluding these special items as well as the positive impact from foreign exchange effects of $72 million, earnings for the quarter totaled $921 million or $0.49 per share. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation.
Cash from operations for the quarter was $5.3 billion, and our debt ratio at quarter end was 23.7%. Our net debt ratio was approximately 20%. 
During the third quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividend. Earlier in the week, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.08 per share, payable to stockholders of record as of November 18, 2016. Our annual per-share payout for 2016 will be $4.29 per share and represents the 29th consecutive year of growth in the annual per-share payout. We currently yield 4.3%. 
Turning to Slide 4. Cash generated from operations was $5.3 billion during the third quarter and $9 billion year-to-date. Year-to-date working capital effects of $1.3 billion and $3.1 billion in deferred tax items, for example, those associated with tax loss [ph] positions reduced year-to-date operating cash. These are timing effects. 
Proceeds from asset sales totaled $800 million in the third quarter, including the sale of selected Gulf of Mexico assets. These transactions had a minimal impact on earnings in the quarter. Year-to-date asset sale proceeds are $2.2 billion. We continue to pursue a number of potential transactions, and we remain confident that we can achieve our $5 billion to $10 billion target for total proceeds over this year and next.
Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $4.1 billion, a decrease of $2.7 billion from the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date cash investment outlays have totaled approximately $14 billion. 
During the quarter, we advanced $2 billion to Tengizchevroil, or TCO, in support of the FGP project. This outflow was reflected in our cash flow statement as a borrowing by equity affiliates. This first co-lending tranche provides sufficient funding as the project commences. Future advances are expected, and the timing will be dependent upon oil prices, TCO's internal cash generation and the project's pace of investment.
At quarter end, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $7.7 billion, and our net debt position was $37.9 billion. 
Turning now to Slide 5. Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Third quarter 2016 results were $754 million lower than third quarter 2015 results. Special items, primarily the deferred tax benefit related to the U.K. tax rate change, the award of an Ecuador arbitration claim and the absence of third quarter 2015 asset impairments, increased earnings by $535 million between periods.
Lower foreign exchange gains decreased earnings by $322 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations.
Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were largely flat between quarters as lower crude realizations were offset by lower operating expenses and favorable tax impacts. Downstream results, excluding special items and FX, decreased by $1 billion, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margins and lower earnings from CP Chem.
Turning now to Slide 6. Here, I'll compare results for the third quarter of 2016 with the second quarter of 2016. Third quarter results were approximately $2.8 billion higher than the second quarter. The absence of second quarter 2016 charges associated with special items and the inclusion of third quarter gains from special items increased earnings by $2.7 billion between periods. Lower foreign exchange gains reduced earnings by approximately $200 million between periods. Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were comparable between quarters, in line with relatively flat Brent prices. Lower operational expenses were offset essentially by lower listings [ph] and adverse tax impacts.
Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were higher by $255 million, primarily resulting from the absence of unfavorable second quarter inventory valuation effects. Prices were generally rising during the second quarter but relatively flat during the third quarter.
Turning to Slide 7. Here, we compare the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the third quarter of 2016 and the third quarter 2015. Net production decreased by 26,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects increased production by 77,000 barrels a day as ramp-ups continued at Gorgon, Jack/St. Malo, Chuandongbei and Angola LNG. About half of this bar is Gorgon. Shale and tight production increased by 50,000 barrels per day, primarily due to the growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian with all shale and tight basins reflecting year-on-year growth. More than half of this bar is Permian production.
Our base business decline was 66,000 barrels per day. Production from new wells and other brownfield investments in the base added 39,000 barrels per day and helped hold the overall base decline rate to less than 2%.
The sale of our Michigan assets and several assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf resulted in decreased production of 47,000 barrels per day. Disruptions due to external events accounted for the temporary shut-in of 27,000 barrels per day, mainly due to security issues in Nigeria. Our planned turnaround activity was heavier than this time last year, resulting in a decrease of 26,000 barrels per day, the most significant of which was at TCO as we completed the turnaround of the second-generation plant. Based on 9 months of actual and our forecast for the fourth quarter, we anticipate full year 2016 production will be approximately 2.6 million barrels per day. 
Turning now to Slide 8. As we indicated on the second quarter call, we expect to exit the year with December production in the range of 2.65 million to 2.7 million barrels per day or growth in the range of 150,000 barrels per day from the third quarter average. A major contributor, as previously discussed, is TCO's return to production on September 9 following the largest planned turnaround in its history, ahead of schedule, under budget and without serious incidents or injuries. Over the course of 6 weeks, maintenance was conducted on more than 500 pieces of equipment. At its peak, over 8,800 employees and contractors were on site for the turnaround. The team worked proactively with over 30 contract companies on all stages of planning, preparation and execution. This was a large undertaking that was exceptionally well executed. 
The second contributor to volume growth in December is the ramp-up of our LNG projects, notably Gorgon. At Gorgon, Train 1 production is stable and Train 2 is now online. At Angola LNG, the plant reached a rate of approximately 5 million tonnes [ph] per year of LNG. Production has been suspended while minor modifications to reach full capacity are completed. Short-duration shutdowns are often experienced as facilities are ramped up to their full capacity. ALNG expects to restart the plant within the next couple of weeks and will continue to ramp up and fine-tune the system. 
Since the initial restart earlier this year, they have shipped 8 LNG cargoes and 16 LPG cargoes. In addition to LNG volume increases, we achieved first production from Bangka in August and expect first production from Alder before year-end. We also expect continued growth in our unconventional and from our base business investments.
Turning now to Slide 9. At Gorgon, total Train 1 LNG production has been stable at an average rate of 110,000 barrels per day, which is about 5 million tonnes [ph] per year. We are also producing about 6,700 barrels per day of condensates. As mentioned, Train 2 is running and producing LNG. Production is expected to ramp up over the coming months. We have shipped 17 cargoes to date, and with both trains now running, we expect to ship an average of 2 to 3 cargoes per week. Construction on Train 3 is progressing very well, and we expect first LNG in the second quarter of 2017. 
At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017 for Train 1. We are leveraging our experience from Gorgon and are pleased with our progress. All modules for Train 1 and Train 2 are now on site, and the installation of piping, electrical and instrumentation continue as planned. As we have foreshadowed, the delay in module delivery at Wheatstone has impacted project costs relative to the original 2011 estimate. We now forecast the total project cost at completion to be USD 34 billion. Chevron's share of the cost to complete the project is included in the $17 billion to $22 billion capital guidance range that we have previously communicated for the 2017 to 2018 years. 
Bruce will now provide an update on our activities in the Permian. Bruce?"

As we have shared previously, Chevron enjoys a very strong acreage position in the Permian Basin. Our acreage is extensive, covering about 2 million acres. We have major holdings in the best basin locations and enjoy a significant royalty advantage over our competitors. 
Our strategy in the Permian is centered on building a large-scale asset that delivers strong returns and generates free cash flow. To accomplish this, we have implemented a well [ph] factory, modeled after most -- modeled after the most efficient short-cycle operations in Chevron and in the industry. The goal of this factory is to create repeatable, high-value outcomes at sufficient scale that are material for Chevron. Decisions around many key design elements are consistently implemented, not only the obvious ones such as horizontal lateral length, well spacing and completion parameters, but also hundreds of other decisions that we face on a routine basis for which we want consistent outcomes. As we identify and verify improvements, they are quickly implemented into our basis of design. Our pace has been intentionally deliberate to allow us to incorporate the learnings and experience from our own work and that of the industry. The result is a high degree of confidence that we will achieve the outcomes we expect, our results are competitive and continue to improve.
Turning to Slide 11. You can see Chevron's acreage position in more detail. This slide is a map of the Permian Basin, inclusive of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. Our 2 million acres are depicted in blue, 1.5 million of which are in the Midland and Delaware Basins. Also depicted on the map are active Chevron-operated developments in blue and our nonoperated development areas in purple. 
We believe the quality of our acreage position is exceptional with multiple-stack geologic targets. Today, we estimate that almost 600,000 of our acres have a net value in excess of $50,000 per acre. We have an additional 350,000 acres with a net value between $20,000 and $50,000 per acre. The balance of our acreage is a mix. Some is of lower quality, some is still under evaluation, some lacks nearby infrastructure and some requires further appraisal. These estimates are a snapshot that assumes a simultaneous development, a flat $50 WTI price and are burdened with all development and production costs as we see them today. 
We're active in several company-operated and nonoperated joint venture development areas. We're currently running 8 drilling rigs on our operated acreage. We're standing up our ninth rig as we speak and expect to be at 10 by the end of the year. Another 10 rigs are currently drilling on our nonoperated development areas. We prioritize development areas by value, which considers expected ultimate recovery, cost of development, oil-gas [ph] split, availability of surface [ph] infrastructure and our overall certainty of outcome. 
Turning to Slide 12. To achieve strong returns, we
[Audio Gap]
we've accomplished this through our focus on improving [indiscernible] ultimate recovery, driving execution efficiencies and implementing supply chain savings. This is delivering capital performance that is competitive with the operators of our joint ventures. The trend of improvement is mirrored in our overall unit operating expense. The lower right graph reflects both the downward trend and competitive performance of our direct lease operating expense and illustrates a significant reduction of 45% from 2015. Our lease operating expense includes all costs required to operate a well and its associated facilities during its life. We expect these wells to produce for decades, so attention to operating efficiency unlocks value. 
Additionally, G&A, which is not included in the graph on the lower right, is a component of overall operating expense. Our year-to-date G&A is $3.50 a barrel, declining through the year and more than 20% from 2015. 
The third critical aspect of cash flow is product realizations. We've leveraged the scale of our core positions to systematically secure cost-effective priority access through the entire crude and gas value chain rather than simply selling production at the wellhead. Because of this, we have options available to respond to changing market and industry conditions. 
Turning to Slide 13. We expect activity and production from the Permian to grow through the end of the decade. As we discussed in our Analyst Day last March, by the end of 2020, Chevron's Permian shale and tight production is expected to reach 250,000 to 350,000 barrels per day. 
As you can see on the chart, we have initiated this growth. Production continues to track ahead of expectations and is 24% higher than third quarter 2015. We continually monitor our performance and have the option to adjust the pace of our growth as needed to optimize value from this asset. While growing production is important, we're focused on expanding margins by increasing efficiencies in our operations and on capturing maximum value from the resource base. We believe we're well positioned to make the Permian a legacy asset with strong returns and free cash flow.
I'll now hand back to Pat to discuss spend reductions. Pat?"

You can see on the charts the huge progress that we've made and continue to make in curtailing our outflows. We expect 2016 combined operating expense and capital expenditure outflows to be down more than $12 billion or more than 20% from 2015. We expect to meet, if not exceed, the commitment we made earlier in the year to have 2016 operating expenses come in $2 billion lower than 2015. And our C&E is trending below the guidance range previously provided for this year. We will likely end the year below $25 billion in capital outlays, in fact, potentially coming in closer to $24 billion. This is a tremendous amount of progress in a relatively short 24-month period of time to reset these key financial parameters consistent with the lower-for-longer price environment.
Turning to Slide 15. I'd like to close with just a couple of points. First, our financial priorities have not changed. Sustaining and growing the dividend is our first priority. The increase this quarter demonstrates that commitment, which is underpinned by a confidence in our future earnings and cash flow growth. 
Second, we are beginning to see evidence of that cash flow growth. Notably now that Gorgon Train 1 is operating well and Train 2 is successfully online and with Gorgon's Train 3 and Wheatstone's Trains 1 and 2 planned to come on in fairly rapid succession over the next 5 quarters. We have approximately 85% of the production from these 5 trains sold under long-term contracts. And at today's contractual LNG prices, this represents a significant revenue and cash margin boost.
Third, we have successfully transitioned to a lower price environment.  Of course, we are not resting on these recent accomplishments. We will continue to look for opportunities to improve cost and capital efficiency. We are poised to be a very resilient competitor in a low-priced world. Our Permian asset base speaks directly to this. Here, we have an abundance of riches in terms of the physical asset base, and we are successfully demonstrating the ability to develop this resource in a highly capital-efficient, returns-focused manner. 
With costs coming down, with C&E and capital intensity coming down, with our major LNG projects and the Permian production coming online to boost cash margins and production, our overall financial picture is set to improve in a meaningful way as we move into 2017. Our objective is to get cash balance in 2017 assuming $50 Brent prices. All of these improvements I have just noted, as well as targeted asset sales where we can transact for value, are key components supporting that objective.
So this concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take some questions. [Operator Instructions]

As you know, we have had a practice, when we have had pieces of our portfolio where we felt there wasn't longer-term strategic value or we felt others could -- would offer more value for it than it would obtain in our portfolio, we've been willing to make asset sales. And we've had a very routine practice of having assets sales over a long number of years here. I think the key to getting to that point in the decision process, though, is having a really good understanding of the value of the asset. And in the Permian Basin, there's been a great deal of fluidity in that evaluation over the last couple of years. There's been a great deal of additional appraisal and evaluation work, and there's been a great deal of greater understanding, but there still has been significant movement. In some cases, pieces of property have moved up by a factor of 10,000-fold. And that's the kind of thing that you would not want to get on the wrong side of if -- in your haste to make a decision about selling an asset. So our process will be to try to do evaluation and appraisal look, get a really good understanding of what this asset valuation is, and to the extent that we don't find it fitting into our longer-term development plan, then that, of course, we would look to other monetization options."

But again, this is an area that we'll update you when we get to the March Security Analyst Meeting. In reference to FGP, the future growth project in Tengiz, I think it's important to know that we are funding both of these projects, both the Permian fully and FGP. We think of these projects, these areas as being absolutely critical growth areas for us. So we're not starving the Permian because we've taken on FG. I think what people often miss around FGP is that there will be a tremendous loss of value if we didn't go forward with the wellhead pressure management project because the field will go into decline. It would be in serious decline, and that would be loss of value on the legacy asset. We're doing FGP and WPMP together because of synergies. That's a joint development concept, and there's a lot of upside that is not been kind of built into a lot of people's models, I guess I would say, about FGP that relate to debottlenecking. What we've been able to demonstrate in the past we hope to be able to do on a go-forward basis this additional gas handling facilities built in here that will over time allow greater oil production, contingencies we've talked through about being kind of fully contingent even though we're at 50% of engineering when we took FID. And then of course, down the road, obviously, we hope that this turns into concession extension. So there's a lot of potential upsides to FGP. I think Jay did a great job on our second quarter in running through all of those parameters."

The -- that original appropriation request was taken in 2011. And as you can all appreciate, the first 3 years of construction there was a much more heated market. But we've talked in the past about our link module delivery, and this really was one of the primary drivers behind the cost increase. They were delayed due to poor performance at one of the fabricating yards. Came to be that the contractor was unable to effectively manage the size and scale of the work scope that we've given that particular contractor. So we recognize that somewhat early on, and we did end up redirecting some of the work to other yards but even so, the modules were late. A second factor that I would comment on is underestimation of the materials that we're acquired. At the time we took FID on Wheatstone, we had engineering was about 15% complete, and so the rest was based on worlds of common factors. As we matured the engineering definition, the amount of quantities needed increased substantially, and so that really was a secondary reason behind the cost increase. I would say the second element was something that we have seen on Gorgon as well, and it is one of the primary areas where we are trying to improve our project execution going forward. As you know, we had FGP when we took FID on FGP, we were at about nearly a 50% engineering level.

So we have great strategic capabilities and basin positions in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater. We have the Tengiz project. We have the LNG project. We have pretty broad-based portfolio, and we're not looking to take all activity in the Permian, but value of the Permian and its tremendous economic capability and its capital efficiency, its great flexibility, its short-cycle high-returns attributes does make other parts of the portfolio have to compete for capital against that. So I think it raises the bar on incremental dollar is going to go, and I think Permian we get the first call but we will manage it as a portfolio. And over time, you should still expect us to have some significant other projects but we can pace of those projects quite nicely, I think, and match against -- always coming back to matching against the opportunities the Permian provides for us."

And we're providing you on this chart quarterly data, and it's an aggregation of everything that was completed in that particular quarter. And you're right to suspect that there is a little portfolio aspect to what goes on in any particular quarter. We have operations in both the Midland and the Delaware basin on the company-operated side and on the NOJV side as well. And the mix of activity in any particular quarter is going to cost the bars to be up and down a little bit. If we had the fourth quarter of 2015, you'd see 2 quarters where the company-operated bars are a little lower in the last 2 quarters where in NOJV  bars are a a little lower, but we would look internally in a much finer level of detail. Wolfcamp wells and essential Midland basin a mile and a half laterals and comparable in that activity or not and what do we address about that. So the overall performance is competitive, and I would tell you that there is a competitive group. There's a lead pack in the Permian, and we're were a part of that. And I think the data on Slide 12 shows that and some of the quarter-to-quarter variations are simply a function of which particular wells we're completing. And because our cost includes full cycle, there are facility costs in our bars in the quarter in which we start wells in a new area and have central tank batteries or other things that are being executed in that period."

They give us the right combination of unit price execution performance, access to technology and ability to grow with us. And then we've put in place some contractual arrangements with unit-based fixed terms. Some are index based, some performance incentives, but they're all intended to keep us on the competitive side of the price curve, irrespective of what commodity prices are doing.

You're hearing an awful lot about the Permian being one of the best investment opportunities that we have, and the great thing about that is that it's short cycle, it's high return, it's very flexible, and so that gives us -- it lowers our capital intensity gives us greater flexibility than we have had in several years. And the only other major project that we sanctioned at this point in time is TCO, and our share of that in terms of outflow would be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion a year over the next few years.

Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Bruce Niemeyer, Vice President, Mid-Continent business unit; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. 
I'll begin with a recap of our third quarter 2016 financial and operational results, and then Bruce will provide an update on our Permian Basin business prior to my concluding remarks.
Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $1.3 billion or $0.68 per diluted share. Third quarter results included $290 million in special items related to a deferred tax benefit from the U.K. tax rate change and the receipt of an Ecuador arbitration award. Excluding these special items as well as the positive impact from foreign exchange effects of $72 million, earnings for the quarter totaled $921 million or $0.49 per share. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation.
Cash from operations for the quarter was $5.3 billion, and our debt ratio at quarter end was 23.7%. Our net debt ratio was approximately 20%. 
During the third quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividend. Earlier in the week, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.08 per share, payable to stockholders of record as of November 18, 2016. Our annual per-share payout for 2016 will be $4.29 per share and represents the 29th consecutive year of growth in the annual per-share payout. We currently yield 4.3%. 
Turning to Slide 4. Cash generated from operations was $5.3 billion during the third quarter and $9 billion year-to-date. Year-to-date working capital effects of $1.3 billion and $3.1 billion in deferred tax items, for example, those associated with tax loss positions reduced year-to-date operating cash. These are timing effects. 
Proceeds from asset sales totaled $800 million in the third quarter, including the sale of selected Gulf of Mexico assets. These transactions had a minimal impact on earnings in the quarter. Year-to-date asset sale proceeds are $2.2 billion. We continue to pursue a number of potential transactions, and we remain confident that we can achieve our $5 billion to $10 billion target for total proceeds over this year and next.
Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $4.1 billion, a decrease of $2.7 billion from the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date cash investment outlays have totaled approximately $14 billion. 
During the quarter, we advanced $2 billion to Tengizchevroil, or TCO, in support of the FGP project. This outflow was reflected in our cash flow statement as a borrowing by equity affiliates. This first co-lending tranche provides sufficient funding as the project commences. Future advances are expected, and the timing will be dependent upon oil prices, TCO's internal cash generation and the project's pace of investment.
At quarter end, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $7.7 billion, and our net debt position was $37.9 billion. 
Turning now to Slide 5. Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Third quarter 2016 results were $754 million lower than third quarter 2015 results. Special items, primarily the deferred tax benefit related to the U.K. tax rate change, the award of an Ecuador arbitration claim and the absence of third quarter 2015 asset impairments, increased earnings by $535 million between periods.
Lower foreign exchange gains decreased earnings by $322 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations.
Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were largely flat between quarters as lower crude realizations were offset by lower operating expenses and favorable tax impacts. Downstream results, excluding special items and FX, decreased by $1 billion, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margins and lower earnings from CP Chem.
Turning now to Slide 6. Here, I'll compare results for the third quarter of 2016 with the second quarter of 2016. Third quarter results were approximately $2.8 billion higher than the second quarter. The absence of second quarter 2016 charges associated with special items and the inclusion of third quarter gains from special items increased earnings by $2.7 billion between periods. Lower foreign exchange gains reduced earnings by approximately $200 million between periods. Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were comparable between quarters, in line with relatively flat Brent prices. Lower operational expenses were offset essentially by lower liftings and adverse tax impacts.
Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were higher by $255 million, primarily resulting from the absence of unfavorable second quarter inventory valuation effects. Prices were generally rising during the second quarter but relatively flat during the third quarter.
Turning to Slide 7. Here, we compare the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the third quarter of 2016 and the third quarter 2015. Net production decreased by 26,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects increased production by 77,000 barrels a day as ramp-ups continued at Gorgon, Jack/St. Malo, Chuandongbei and Angola LNG. About half of this bar is Gorgon. Shale and tight production increased by 50,000 barrels per day, primarily due to the growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian with all shale and tight basins reflecting year-on-year growth. More than half of this bar is Permian production.
Our base business decline was 66,000 barrels per day. Production from new wells and other brownfield investments in the base added 39,000 barrels per day and helped hold the overall base decline rate to less than 2%.
The sale of our Michigan assets and several assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf resulted in decreased production of 47,000 barrels per day. Disruptions due to external events accounted for the temporary shut-in of 27,000 barrels per day, mainly due to security issues in Nigeria. Our planned turnaround activity was heavier than this time last year, resulting in a decrease of 26,000 barrels per day, the most significant of which was at TCO as we completed the turnaround of the second-generation plant. Based on 9 months of actual and our forecast for the fourth quarter, we anticipate full year 2016 production will be approximately 2.6 million barrels per day. 
Turning now to Slide 8. As we indicated on the second quarter call, we expect to exit the year with December production in the range of 2.65 million to 2.7 million barrels per day or growth in the range of 150,000 barrels per day from the third quarter average. A major contributor, as previously discussed, is TCO's return to production on September 9 following the largest planned turnaround in its history, ahead of schedule, under budget and without serious incidents or injuries. Over the course of 6 weeks, maintenance was conducted on more than 500 pieces of equipment. At its peak, over 8,800 employees and contractors were on site for the turnaround. The team worked proactively with over 30 contract companies on all stages of planning, preparation and execution. This was a large undertaking that was exceptionally well executed. 
The second contributor to volume growth in December is the ramp-up of our LNG projects, notably Gorgon. At Gorgon, Train 1 production is stable and Train 2 is now online. At Angola LNG, the plant reached a rate of approximately 5 million tonnes per year of LNG. Production has been suspended while minor modifications to reach full capacity are completed. Short-duration shutdowns are often experienced as facilities are ramped up to their full capacity. ALNG expects to restart the plant within the next couple of weeks and will continue to ramp up and fine-tune the system. 
Since the initial restart earlier this year, they have shipped 8 LNG cargoes and 16 LPG cargoes. In addition to LNG volume increases, we achieved first production from Bangka in August and expect first production from Alder before year-end. We also expect continued growth in our unconventional and from our base business investments.
Turning now to Slide 9. At Gorgon, total Train 1 LNG production has been stable at an average rate of 110,000 barrels per day, which is about 5 million tonnes per year. We are also producing about 6,700 barrels per day of condensates. As mentioned, Train 2 is running and producing LNG. Production is expected to ramp up over the coming months. We have shipped 17 cargoes to date, and with both trains now running, we expect to ship an average of 2 to 3 cargoes per week. Construction on Train 3 is progressing very well, and we expect first LNG in the second quarter of 2017. 
At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017 for Train 1. We are leveraging our experience from Gorgon and are pleased with our progress. All modules for Train 1 and Train 2 are now on site, and the installation of piping, electrical and instrumentation continue as planned. As we have foreshadowed, the delay in module delivery at Wheatstone has impacted project costs relative to the original 2011 estimate. We now forecast the total project cost at completion to be USD 34 billion. Chevron's share of the cost to complete the project is included in the $17 billion to $22 billion capital guidance range that we have previously communicated for the 2017 to 2018 years. 
Bruce will now provide an update on our activities in the Permian. Bruce?"

As we have shared previously, Chevron enjoys a very strong acreage position in the Permian Basin. Our acreage is extensive, covering about 2 million acres. We have major holdings in the best basin locations and enjoy a significant royalty advantage over our competitors. 
Our strategy in the Permian is centered on building a large-scale asset that delivers strong returns and generates free cash flow. To accomplish this, we have implemented a well factory, modeled after most -- modeled after the most efficient short-cycle operations in Chevron and in the industry. The goal of this factory is to create repeatable, high-value outcomes at sufficient scale that are material for Chevron. Decisions around many key design elements are consistently implemented, not only the obvious ones such as horizontal lateral length, well spacing and completion parameters, but also hundreds of other decisions that we face on a routine basis for which we want consistent outcomes. As we identify and verify improvements, they are quickly implemented into our basis of design. Our pace has been intentionally deliberate to allow us to incorporate the learnings and experience from our own work and that of the industry. The result is a high degree of confidence that we will achieve the outcomes we expect, our results are competitive and continue to improve.
Turning to Slide 11. You can see Chevron's acreage position in more detail. This slide is a map of the Permian Basin, inclusive of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. Our 2 million acres are depicted in blue, 1.5 million of which are in the Midland and Delaware Basins. Also depicted on the map are active Chevron-operated developments in blue and our nonoperated development areas in purple. 
We believe the quality of our acreage position is exceptional with multiple-stack geologic targets. Today, we estimate that almost 600,000 of our acres have a net value in excess of $50,000 per acre. We have an additional 350,000 acres with a net value between $20,000 and $50,000 per acre. The balance of our acreage is a mix. Some is of lower quality, some is still under evaluation, some lacks nearby infrastructure and some requires further appraisal. These estimates are a snapshot that assumes a simultaneous development, a flat $50 WTI price and are burdened with all development and production costs as we see them today. 
We're active in several company-operated and nonoperated joint venture development areas. We're currently running 8 drilling rigs on our operated acreage. We're standing up our ninth rig as we speak and expect to be at 10 by the end of the year. Another 10 rigs are currently drilling on our nonoperated development areas. We prioritize development areas by value, which considers expected ultimate recovery, cost of development, oil-gas split, availability of surface infrastructure and our overall certainty of outcome. 
Turning to Slide 12. To achieve strong returns, we focus on all elements necessary to generate cash flow: capital efficiency, operating expense and product realizations. The graph in the upper-right corner shows development cost per barrel, which, in our view, is the ultimate measure of capital performance as it incorporates all submetrics. We have achieved a 30% development cost reduction from 2015, fully inclusive of drilling, completions, facilities and associated G&A. We've accomplished this through a focus on improving expected ultimate recovery, driving execution efficiencies and implementing supply chain savings. This is delivering capital performance that is competitive with the operators of our joint ventures. The trend of improvement is mirrored in our overall unit operating expense. The lower right graph reflects both the downward trend and competitive performance of our direct lease operating expense and illustrates a significant reduction of 45% from 2015. Our lease operating expense includes all costs required to operate a well and its associated facilities during its life. We expect these wells to produce for decades, so attention to operating efficiency unlocks value. 
Additionally, G&A, which is not included in the graph on the lower right, is a component of overall operating expense. Our year-to-date G&A is $3.50 a barrel, declining through the year and more than 20% from 2015. 
The third critical aspect of cash flow is product realizations. We've leveraged the scale of our core positions to systematically secure cost-effective priority access through the entire crude and gas value chain rather than simply selling production at the wellhead. Because of this, we have options available to respond to changing market and industry conditions. 
Turning to Slide 13. We expect activity and production from the Permian to grow through the end of the decade. As we discussed in our Analyst Day last March, by the end of 2020, Chevron's Permian shale and tight production is expected to reach 250,000 to 350,000 barrels per day. 
As you can see on the chart, we have initiated this growth. Production continues to track ahead of expectations and is 24% higher than third quarter 2015. We continually monitor our performance and have the option to adjust the pace of our growth as needed to optimize value from this asset. While growing production is important, we're focused on expanding margins by increasing efficiencies in our operations and on capturing maximum value from the resource base. We believe we're well positioned to make the Permian a legacy asset with strong returns and free cash flow.
I'll now hand back to Pat to discuss spend reductions. Pat?"

You can see on the charts the huge progress that we've made and continue to make in curtailing our outflows. We expect 2016 combined operating expense and capital expenditure outflows to be down more than $12 billion or more than 20% from 2015. We expect to meet, if not exceed, the commitment we made earlier in the year to have 2016 operating expenses come in $2 billion lower than 2015. And our C&E is trending below the guidance range previously provided for this year. We will likely end the year below $25 billion in capital outlays, in fact, potentially coming in closer to $24 billion. This is a tremendous amount of progress in a relatively short 24-month period of time to reset these key financial parameters consistent with the lower-for-longer price environment.
Turning to Slide 15. I'd like to close with just a couple of points. First, our financial priorities have not changed. Sustaining and growing the dividend is our first priority. The increase this quarter demonstrates that commitment, which is underpinned by a confidence in our future earnings and cash flow growth. 
Second, we are beginning to see evidence of that cash flow growth. Notably now that Gorgon Train 1 is operating well and Train 2 is successfully online and with Gorgon's Train 3 and Wheatstone's Trains 1 and 2 planned to come on in fairly rapid succession over the next 5 quarters. We have approximately 85% of the production from these 5 trains sold under long-term contracts. And at today's contractual LNG prices, this represents a significant revenue and cash margin boost.
Third, we have successfully transitioned to a lower price environment.  Of course, we are not resting on these recent accomplishments. We will continue to look for opportunities to improve cost and capital efficiency. We are poised to be a very resilient competitor in a low-priced world. Our Permian asset base speaks directly to this. Here, we have an abundance of riches in terms of the physical asset base, and we are successfully demonstrating the ability to develop this resource in a highly capital-efficient, returns-focused manner. 
With costs coming down, with C&E and capital intensity coming down, with our major LNG projects and the Permian production coming online to boost cash margins and production, our overall financial picture is set to improve in a meaningful way as we move into 2017. Our objective is to get cash balance in 2017 assuming $50 Brent prices. All of these improvements I have just noted, as well as targeted asset sales where we can transact for value, are key components supporting that objective.
So this concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take some questions. [Operator Instructions]

I don't feel capital-limited in the Permian Basin, and our additions are targeted to ensure that we're getting the outcomes we intend and that are supportive of high returns and eventually generate -- generating free cash flow. We do expect to grow, as you noted. You can see that on Slide 13. And as we go forward, we have options. We continually monitor our performance and we adjust."

As you know, we have had a practice, when we have had pieces of our portfolio where we felt there wasn't longer-term strategic value or we felt others could -- would offer more value for it than it would obtain in our portfolio, we've been willing to make asset sales. And we've had a very routine practice of having assets sales over a long number of years here. I think the key to getting to that point in the decision process, though, is having a really good understanding of the value of the asset. And in the Permian Basin, there's been a great deal of fluidity in that evaluation over the last couple of years. There's been a great deal of additional appraisal and evaluation work, and there's been a great deal of greater understanding, but there still has been significant movement. In some cases, pieces of property have moved up by a factor of 10,000-fold. And that's the kind of thing that you would not want to get on the wrong side of if -- in your haste to make a decision about selling an asset. So our process will be to try to do evaluation and appraisal look, get a really good understanding of what this asset valuation is, and to the extent that we don't find it fitting into our longer-term development plan, then that, of course, we would look to other monetization options."

And so we're spending 1.5 [ph] here. You can see us potentially doubling that. And that is kind of the current view that we have. But again, this is an area that we'll update you when we get to the March Security Analyst Meeting. In reference to FGP, the future growth project in Tengiz, I think it's important to know that we are funding both of these projects, both the Permian fully and FGP. We think of these projects, these areas as being absolutely critical growth areas for us. So we're not starving the Permian because we've taken on FGP. I think what people often miss around FGP is that there will be a tremendous loss of value if we didn't go forward with the Wellhead Pressure Management Project because the field would go into decline. It would be in serious decline, and that would be loss of value on the legacy asset. We're doing FGP and WPMP together because of synergies. It's a joint development concept. And there's a lot of upside that has not been kind of built in to a lot of people's models, I guess I would say, about FGP that relate to debottlenecking. What we've been able to demonstrate in the past, we hope to be able to do on a go-forward basis. There's additional gas-handling facilities built in here that will, over time, allow greater oil production. Contingencies, we've talked through about being kind of fully contingent even though we're at 50% of engineering when we took FID. And then, of course, down the road, obviously, we hope that this turns into concession extension. So there's a lot of potential upsides to FGP. I think Jay did a great job on our second quarter call in kind of running through all of those parameters."

The -- that original appropriation request was taken in 2011. And as you can all appreciate, the first few years of construction there was in a much more heated market. But we've talked in the past about our late module delivery, and this really was one of the primary drivers behind the cost increase. They were delayed due to poor performance at one of the fabricating yards. It came to be that the contractor was unable to effectively manage the size and the scale of the work scope that we had given that particular contractor. So we recognized that somewhat early on, and we did end up redirecting some of the work to other yards. But even so, modules were late. A second factor that I would comment on is really an underestimation of the quantity of materials that were required. At the time we took FID on Wheatstone, we had -- engineering was at about 15% complete, and so the rest was based on worlds of common [ph] factors. As we matured the engineering definition, the amount of quantities needed increased substantially, and so that really was a secondary reason behind the cost increase. I would say the second element was something that we had seen on Gorgon as well, and it is one of the primary areas where we are trying to improve our project execution going forward. As you know, we had -- FGP, when we took FID on FGP, we were at about nearly a 50% engineering level. So this is one of the primary improvement practices that we're putting in place for future projects."

I think, when you have such an extraordinary asset base and the Permian, when it has as much kind of depth and breadth to it, and I don't mean that in the literal sense but a figurative sense, such huge economic strength. Everything in the portfolio really needs to be judged against those options. And so when I think about -- we don't believe we want to be just a single-asset class company. So we have great strategic capabilities and basin positions in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater. We have the Tengiz project that we talked about. We have the LNG projects. So we have pretty broad-based portfolio here, and we're not looking to take all activity down to the Permian. But the value of the Permian and its tremendous economic capability and its capital efficiency, its great flexibility, its short-cycle, high-return attribute does make other parts of the portfolio have to compete for capital against that. So I think it raises the bar on where that incremental dollar is going to go. And I think Permian will get the first call, but we will manage it as a portfolio. And over time, you should still expect us to have some significant other projects, but we can pace those projects quite nicely, I think, and match against -- always coming back to and matching against the opportunities that the Permian provides for us."

We have operations in both the Midland and Delaware Basin on the company-operated side and on the NOJV side as well. And the mix of activity in any particular quarter are going to cause those bars to be up and down a little bit. If we had the fourth quarter of 2015, you'd see 2 quarters where the company-operated bars are a little lower, and then the last 2 quarters where the NOJV bars are a little lower. But we would look internally in a much finer level of detail, Wolfcamp B wells in the Central Midland basin, 1.5-mile laterals, and are we comparable in that activity or not? And what do we address about that? So the overall performance is competitive, and I will tell you that there is a competitive group. There's a lead pack in the Permian, and we're a part of that. And I think the data on Slide 12 shows that, and some of the quarter-to-quarter variations are simply a function of which particular wells are completing. And because our costs include full cycle, there are facility costs in our bars in the quarter in which we start wells in a new area and have central tank batteries or other things that are being executed in that period."

We operate in a dynamic price environment and a dynamic activity environment. Over the last 2 years, we really leveraged the scale of Chevron where we have an advantage to do so. So tubulars, or the pipe that goes in the wells, is a key cost component, and Chevron buys a lot of pipe around the world. So we're able to leverage our worldwide supply chain effort to bring advantage to pricing to what we do. We also consolidate work with key suppliers -- have consolidated work to give us the right combination of unit price, execution, performance, access to technology and the ability to grow with us. And then we've put in place some contractual arrangements with unit-based fixed terms. Some are index-based, some use performance incentives, but they're all intended to keep us on the competitive side of the price curve, irrespective of what commodity prices are doing. Structurally, the things that stay with us in any price environment are multi-well pad designs, which we've done for a very long time, the acreage position that we have that allow us to drill longer lateral lengths, efficiencies in -- that we engage in on a daily basis in terms of something we call zipper fracking, where you have activities occurring simultaneously. And those will stay as regardless of what price does."

And we'll come out typically with a C&E press release after our board approves the plan. And I don't really want to get ahead of that, but obviously, all of the efficiencies -- the cost efficiencies that we've seen, Bruce just talked through some of those in his business unit, but those are going on around the globe in terms of supplier optimization, supplier rationalization and getting our supply chain costs down. That will continue, and I think we'll hold on to that. The one area where there probably is a little bit of an inflationary element will be the Permian, because that's where investment is being attracted. But when you look around the rest of the world, that is really not happening in the rest of the world. Investment is not going to those locations, so we're not seeing those kind of cost pressures.

You're hearing an awful lot about the Permian being one of the best investment opportunities that we have, and the great thing about that is that it's short cycle, it's high return, it's very flexible. And so that gives us -- it lowers our capital intensity, gives us greater flexibility than we have had in several years. And then the only other major project that we've sanctioned at this point in time is TCO, and our share of that in terms on outflow would be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion a year over the next few years. So we consider that to be very manageable, and that's within the $17 billion to $22 billion range that we've given you. So I think that's a reasonable range on C&E to expect for us under a regional -- a reasonable range of prices that might be anticipated."

Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Bruce Niemeyer, Vice President, Mid-Continent business unit; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. 
I'll begin with a recap of our third quarter 2016 financial and operational results, and then Bruce will provide an update on our Permian Basin business prior to my concluding remarks.
Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $1.3 billion or $0.68 per diluted share. Third quarter results included $290 million in special items related to a deferred tax benefit from the U.K. tax rate change and the receipt of an Ecuador arbitration award. Excluding these special items as well as the positive impact from foreign exchange effects of $72 million, earnings for the quarter totaled $921 million or $0.49 per share. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation.
Cash from operations for the quarter was $5.3 billion, and our debt ratio at quarter end was 23.7%. Our net debt ratio was approximately 20%. 
During the third quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividend. Earlier in the week, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.08 per share, payable to stockholders of record as of November 18, 2016. Our annual per-share payout for 2016 will be $4.29 per share and represents the 29th consecutive year of growth in the annual per-share payout. We currently yield 4.3%. 
Turning to Slide 4. Cash generated from operations was $5.3 billion during the third quarter and $9 billion year-to-date. Year-to-date working capital effects of $1.3 billion and $3.1 billion in deferred tax items -- for example, those associated with tax loss positions -- reduced year-to-date operating cash. These are timing effects. 
Proceeds from asset sales totaled $800 million in the third quarter, including the sale of selected Gulf of Mexico assets. These transactions had a minimal impact on earnings in the quarter. Year-to-date asset sale proceeds are $2.2 billion. We continue to pursue a number of potential transactions, and we remain confident that we can achieve our $5 billion to $10 billion target for total proceeds over this year and next.
Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $4.1 billion, a decrease of $2.7 billion from the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date cash investment outlays have totaled approximately $14 billion. 
During the quarter, we advanced $2 billion to Tengizchevroil, or TCO, in support of the FGP project. This outflow was reflected in our cash flow statement as a borrowing by equity affiliate. This first co-lending tranche provides sufficient funding as the project commences. Future advances are expected, and the timing will be dependent upon oil prices, TCO's internal cash generation and the project's pace of investment.
At quarter end, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $7.7 billion, and our net debt position was $37.9 billion. 
Turning now to Slide 5. Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Third quarter 2016 results were $754 million lower than third quarter 2015 results. Special items, primarily the deferred tax benefit related to the U.K. tax rate change, the award of an Ecuador arbitration claim and the absence of third quarter 2015 asset impairments, increased earnings by $535 million between periods.
Lower foreign exchange gains decreased earnings by $322 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations.
Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were largely flat between quarters as lower crude realizations were offset by lower operating expenses and favorable tax impacts. Downstream results, excluding special items and FX, decreased by $1 billion, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margins and lower earnings from CP Chem.
Turning now to Slide 6. Here, I'll compare results for the third quarter of 2016 with the second quarter of 2016. Third quarter results were approximately $2.8 billion higher than the second quarter. The absence of second quarter 2016 charges associated with special items and the inclusion of third quarter gains from special items increased earnings by $2.7 billion between periods. Lower foreign exchange gains reduced earnings by approximately $200 million between periods. Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were comparable between quarters, in line with relatively flat Brent prices. Lower operational expenses were offset essentially by lower liftings and adverse tax impacts.
Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were higher by $255 million, primarily resulting from the absence of unfavorable second quarter inventory valuation effects. Prices were generally rising during the second quarter but relatively flat during the third quarter.
Turning to Slide 7. Here, we compare the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the third quarter of 2016 and the third quarter 2015. Net production decreased by 26,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects increased production by 77,000 barrels a day as ramp-ups continued at Gorgon, Jack/St. Malo, Chuandongbei and Angola LNG. About half of this bar is Gorgon. Shale and tight production increased by 50,000 barrels per day, primarily due to the growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian with all shale and tight basins reflecting year-on-year growth. More than half of this bar is Permian production.
Our base business decline was 66,000 barrels per day. Production from new wells and other brownfield investments in the base added 39,000 barrels per day and helped hold the overall base decline rate to less than 2%.
The sale of our Michigan assets and several assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf resulted in decreased production of 47,000 barrels per day. Disruptions due to external events accounted for the temporary shut-in of 27,000 barrels per day, mainly due to security issues in Nigeria. Our planned turnaround activity was heavier than this time last year, resulting in a decrease of 26,000 barrels per day, the most significant of which was at TCO as we completed the turnaround of the second-generation plant. Based on 9 months of actual and our forecast for the fourth quarter, we anticipate full year 2016 production will be approximately 2.6 million barrels per day. 
Turning now to Slide 8. As we indicated on the second quarter call, we expect to exit the year with December production in the range of 2.65 million to 2.7 million barrels per day or growth in the range of 150,000 barrels per day from the third quarter average. A major contributor, as previously discussed, is TCO's return to production on September 9 following the largest planned turnaround in its history, ahead of schedule, under budget and without serious incidents or injuries. Over the course of 6 weeks, maintenance was conducted on more than 500 pieces of equipment. At its peak, over 8,800 employees and contractors were on site for the turnaround. The team worked proactively with over 30 contract companies on all stages of planning, preparation and execution. This was a large undertaking that was exceptionally well executed. 
The second contributor to volume growth in December is the ramp-up of our LNG projects, notably Gorgon. At Gorgon, Train 1 production is stable and Train 2 is now online. At Angola LNG, the plant reached a rate of approximately 5 million tonnes per year of LNG. Production has been suspended while minor modifications to reach full capacity are completed. Short-duration shutdowns are often experienced as facilities are ramped up to their full capacity. ALNG expects to restart the plant within the next couple of weeks and will continue to ramp up and fine-tune the system. 
Since the initial restart earlier this year, they have shipped 8 LNG cargos and 16 LPG cargos. In addition to LNG volume increases, we achieved first production from Bangka in August and expect first production from Alder before year-end. We also expect continued growth in our unconventionals and from our base business investments.
Turning now to Slide 9. At Gorgon, total Train 1 LNG production has been stable at an average rate of 110,000 barrels per day, which is about 5 million tonnes per year. We are also producing about 6,700 barrels per day of condensates. As mentioned, Train 2 is running and producing LNG. Production is expected to ramp up over the coming months. We have shipped 17 cargos to date, and with both trains now running, we expect to ship an average of 2 to 3 cargos per week. Construction on Train 3 is progressing very well, and we expect first LNG in the second quarter of 2017. 
At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017 for Train 1. We are leveraging our experience from Gorgon and are pleased with our progress. All modules for Train 1 and Train 2 are now on site, and the installation of piping, electrical and instrumentation continue as planned. As we have foreshadowed, the delay in module delivery at Wheatstone has impacted project costs relative to the original 2011 estimate. We now forecast the total project cost at completion to be USD 34 billion. Chevron's share of the cost to complete the project is included in the $17 billion to $22 billion capital guidance range that we have previously communicated for the 2017 to 2018 years. 
Bruce will now provide an update on our activities in the Permian. Bruce?"

As we have shared previously, Chevron enjoys a very strong acreage position in the Permian Basin. Our acreage is extensive, covering about 2 million acres. We have major holdings in the best basin locations and enjoy a significant royalty advantage over our competitors. 
Our strategy in the Permian is centered on building a large-scale asset that delivers strong returns and generates free cash flow. To accomplish this, we have implemented a well factory, modeled after most -- modeled after the most efficient short-cycle operations in Chevron and in industry. The goal of this factory is to create repeatable, high-value outcomes at sufficient scale that are material for Chevron. Decisions around many key design elements are consistently implemented, not only the obvious ones such as horizontal lateral length, well spacing and completion parameters, but also hundreds of other decisions that we face on a routine basis for which we want consistent outcomes. As we identify and verify improvements, they are quickly implemented into our basis of design. Our pace has been intentionally deliberate to allow us to incorporate the learnings and experience from our own work and that of the industry. The result is a high degree of confidence that we will achieve the outcomes we expect, our results are competitive and continue to improve.
Turning to Slide 11. You can see Chevron's acreage position in more detail. This slide is a map of the Permian Basin, inclusive of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. Our 2 million acres are depicted in blue, 1.5 million of which are in the Midland and Delaware Basins. Also depicted on the map are active Chevron-operated developments in blue and our nonoperated development areas in purple. 
We believe the quality of our acreage position is exceptional with multiple-stack geologic targets. Today, we estimate that almost 600,000 of our acres have a net value in excess of $50,000 per acre. We have an additional 350,000 acres with a net value between $20,000 and $50,000 per acre. The balance of our acreage is a mix. Some is of lower quality, some is still under evaluation, some lacks nearby infrastructure and some requires further appraisal. These estimates are a snapshot that assumes a simultaneous development, a flat $50 WTI price and are burdened with all development and production costs as we see them today. 
We're active in several company-operated and nonoperated joint venture development areas. We're currently running 8 drilling rigs on our operated acreage. We're standing up our ninth rig as we speak and expect to be at 10 by the end of the year. Another 10 rigs are currently drilling on our nonoperated development areas. We prioritize development areas by value, which considers expected ultimate recovery, cost of development, oil-gas split, availability of surface infrastructure and our overall certainty of outcome. 
Turning to Slide 12. To achieve strong returns, we focus on all elements necessary to generate cash flow: capital efficiency, operating expense and product realizations. The graph in the upper-right corner shows development cost per barrel, which, in our view, is the ultimate measure of capital performance as it incorporates all submetrics. We have achieved a 30% development cost reduction from 2015, fully inclusive of drilling, completions, facilities and associated G&A. We've accomplished this through a focus on improving expected ultimate recovery, driving execution efficiencies and implementing supply chain savings. This is delivering capital performance that is competitive with the operators of our joint ventures. The trend of improvement is mirrored in our overall unit operating expense. The lower right graph reflects both the downward trend and competitive performance of our direct lease operating expense and illustrates a significant reduction of 45% from 2015. Our lease operating expense includes all costs required to operate a well and its associated facilities during its life. We expect these wells to produce for decades, so attention to operating efficiency unlocks value. 
Additionally, G&A, which is not included in the graph on the lower right, is a component of overall operating expense. Our year-to-date G&A is $3.50 a barrel, declining through the year and more than 20% from 2015. 
The third critical aspect of cash flow is product realizations. We've leveraged the scale of our core positions to systematically secure cost-effective priority access through the entire crude and gas value chain rather than simply selling production at the wellhead. Because of this, we have options available to respond to changing market and industry conditions. 
Turning to Slide 13. We expect activity and production from the Permian to grow through the end of the decade. As we discussed in our Analyst Day last March, by the end of 2020, Chevron's Permian shale and tight production is expected to reach 250,000 to 350,000 barrels per day. 
As you can see on the chart, we have initiated this growth. Production continues to track ahead of expectations and is 24% higher than third quarter 2015. We continually monitor our performance and have the option to adjust the pace of our growth as needed to optimize value from this asset. While growing production is important, we're focused on expanding margins, by increasing efficiencies in our operations and on capturing maximum value from the resource base. We believe we're well positioned to make the Permian a legacy asset with strong returns and free cash flow.
I'll now hand back to Pat to discuss spend reductions. Pat?"

We continue to reduce our spend. You can see on the chart the huge progress that we've made and continue to make in curtailing our outflows. We expect 2016 combined operating expense and capital expenditure outflow",471,"Okay. Thank you, Bruce. Now on Slide 14. We continue to reduce our spend. You can see on the chart the huge progress that we've made and continue to make in curtailing our outflows. We expect 2016 combined operating expense and capital expenditure outflows to be down more than $12 billion or more than 20% from 2015. We expect to meet, if not exceed, the commitment we made earlier in the year to have 2016 operating expenses come in $2 billion lower than 2015. And our C&E is trending below the guidance range previously provided for this year. We will likely end the year below $25 billion in capital outlays; in fact, potentially coming in closer to $24 billion. This is a tremendous amount of progress in a relatively short 24-month period of time to reset these key financial parameters consistent with a lower-for-longer price environment.
Turning to Slide 15. I'd like to close with just a couple of points. First, our financial priorities have not changed. Sustaining and growing the dividend is our first priority. The increase this quarter demonstrates that commitment, which is underpinned by a confidence in our future earnings and cash flow growth. 
Second, we are beginning to see evidence of that cash flow growth. Notably now that Gorgon Train 1 is operating well and Train 2 is successfully online and with Gorgon's Train 3 and Wheatstone's Trains 1 and 2 planned to come on in fairly rapid succession over the next 5 quarters. We have approximately 85% of the production from these 5 trains sold under long-term contracts. And at today's contractual LNG prices, this represents a significant revenue and cash margin boost.
Third, we have successfully transitioned to a lower price environment. Of course, we are not resting on these recent accomplishments. We will continue to look for opportunities to improve cost and capital efficiency. We are poised to be a very resilient competitor in a low-priced world. Our Permian asset base speaks directly to this. Here, we have an abundance of riches in terms of the physical asset base, and we are successfully demonstrating the ability to develop this resource in a highly capital-efficient, returns-focused manner. 
With costs coming down, with C&E and capital intensity coming down, with our major LNG projects and the Permian production coming online to boost cash margins and production, our overall financial picture is set to improve in a meaningful way as we move into 2017. Our objective is to get cash balance in 2017 assuming $50 Brent prices. All of these improvements I have just noted, as well as targeted asset sales where we can transact for value, are key components supporting that objective.
So this concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take some questions. [Operator Instructions]

As you know, we have had a practice, when we have had pieces of our portfolio where we felt there wasn't longer-term strategic value or we felt others could -- would offer more value for it than it would obtain in our portfolio, we've been willing to make asset sales. And we've had a very routine practice of having asset sales over a long number of years here. I think the key to getting to that point in the decision process, though, is having a really good understanding of the value of the asset. And in the Permian Basin, there's been a great deal of fluidity in that evaluation over the last couple of years. There's been a great deal of additional appraisal and evaluation work, and there's been a great deal of greater understanding, but there still has been significant movement. In some cases, pieces of property have moved up by a factor of 10,000-fold. And that's the kind of thing that you would not want to get on the wrong side of it -- in your haste to make a decision about selling an asset. So our process will be to try to do evaluation and appraisal work, get a really good understanding of what this asset valuation is, and to the extent that we don't find it fitting into our longer-term development plans, then that, of course, we would look to other monetization options."

And so we're spending one and a half here. You can see us potentially doubling that. And that is kind of the current view that we have. But again, this is an area that we'll update you when we get to the March Security Analyst Meeting. In reference to FGP, the future growth project in Tengiz, I think it's important to know that we are funding both of these projects, both the Permian fully and FGP. We think of these projects, these areas as being absolutely critical growth areas for us. So we're not starving the Permian because we've taken on FGP. I think what people often miss around FGP is that there would be a tremendous loss of value if we didn't go forward with the Wellhead Pressure Management Project because the field would go into decline. It would be in serious decline, and that would be loss of value on a legacy asset. We're doing FGP and WPMP together because of synergies. It's a joint development concept. And there's a lot of upside that has not been kind of built in to a lot of people's models, I guess I would say, about FGP that relate to debottlenecking. What we've been able to demonstrate in the past, we hope to be able to do on a go-forward basis. There's additional gas-handling facilities built in here that will, over time, allow greater oil production. Contingencies, we've talked through about being kind of fully contingent even though we're at 50% of engineering when we took FID. And then, of course, down the road, obviously, we hope that this turns into concession extension. So there's a lot of potential upsides to FGP. I think Jay did a great job on our second quarter call in kind of running through all of those parameters."

The -- that original appropriation request was taken in 2011. And as you can all appreciate, the first few years of construction there was in a much more heated market. But we've talked in the past about our late module delivery, and this really was one of the primary drivers behind the cost increase. They were delayed due to poor performance at one of the fabricating yards. It came to be that the contractor was unable to effectively manage the size and the scale of the work scope that we had given that particular contractor. So we recognized that somewhat early on, and we did end up redirecting some of the work to other yards. But even so, the modules were late. A second factor that I would comment on is really an underestimation of the quantity of materials that were required. At the time we took FID on Wheatstone, we had -- engineering was at about 15% complete, and so the rest was based on rules of thumb and factors. As we matured the engineering definition, the amount of quantities needed increased substantially, and so that really was a secondary reason behind the cost increase. I would say this second element was something that we had seen on Gorgon as well, and it is one of the primary areas where we are trying to improve our project execution going forward. As you know, we had -- FGP, when we took FID on FGP, we were at about nearly a 50% engineering level. So this is one of the primary improvement practices that we're putting in place for future projects."

I think, when you have such an extraordinary asset base in the Permian, when it has as much kind of depth and breadth to it, and I don't mean that in a literal sense but a figurative sense, such huge economic strength, everything in the portfolio really needs to be judged against those options. And so when I think about -- we don't believe we want to be just a single-asset class company. So we have great strategic capabilities and basin positions in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater. We have the Tengiz project that we talked about. We have the LNG projects. So we have pretty broad-based portfolio here, and we're not looking to take all activity down to the Permian. But the value of the Permian and its tremendous economic capability and its capital efficiency, its great flexibility, its short-cycle, high-return attribute does make other parts of the portfolio have to compete for capital against that. So I think it raises the bar on where that incremental dollar is going to go. And I think Permian will get the first call, but we will manage it as a portfolio. And over time, you should still expect us to have some significant other projects, but we can pace those projects quite nicely, I think, and match against -- always coming back to and matching against the opportunities that the Permian provides for us."

And you're right to suspect that there's a little portfolio aspect to what goes on in any particular quarter. We have operations in both the Midland and Delaware Basin on the company-operated side and on the NOJV side as well. And the mix of activity in any particular quarter is going to cause those bars to be up and down a little bit. If we had the fourth quarter of 2015, you'd see 2 quarters where the company-operated bars are a little lower, and then the last 2 quarters where the NOJV bars are a little lower. But we would look internally in a much finer level of detail. Wolfcamp B wells in the Central Midland basin, 1.5-mile laterals, and are we comparable in that activity or not? And what do we address about that? So the overall performance is competitive, and I will tell you that there is a competitive group. There's a lead pack in the Permian, and we're a part of that. And I think the data on Slide 12 shows that, and some of the quarter-to-quarter variations are simply a function of which particular wells are completing. And because our costs include full cycle, there are facility costs in our bars in the quarter in which we start wells in a new area and have central tank batteries or other things that are being executed in that period."

The range that we put out for '17 to '18 is in the $17 billion to $22 billion range. I think we will be in that range. We're just going through and doing the prioritization at the moment. And we'll come out typically with a C&E press release after our board approves the plan. And I don't really want to get ahead of that, but obviously, all of the efficiencies -- the cost efficiencies that we've seen, Bruce just talked through some of those in his business unit, but those are going on around the globe in terms of supplier optimization, supplier rationalization and getting our supply chain costs down. That will continue, and I think we'll hold on to that. The one area where there probably is a little bit of an inflationary element will be the Permian, because that's where investment is being attracted. But when you look around the rest of the world, that is really not happening in the rest of the world. Investment is not going to those locations, so we're not seeing those kind of cost pressures. So we believe the efficiencies through the supply chain organization that we've been able to capture will hold there."

You're hearing an awful lot about the Permian being one of the best investment opportunities that we have, and the great thing about that is that it's short cycle, it's high return, it's very flexible. And so that gives us -- it lowers our capital intensity, gives us greater flexibility than we have had in several years.

Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Bruce Niemeyer, Vice President, Mid-Continent business unit; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. 
I'll begin with a recap of our third quarter 2016 financial and operational results, and then Bruce will provide an update on our Permian Basin business prior to my concluding remarks.
Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $1.3 billion or $0.68 per diluted share. Third quarter results included $290 million in special items related to a deferred tax benefit from the U.K. tax rate change and the receipt of an Ecuador arbitration award. Excluding these special items as well as the positive impact from foreign exchange effects of $72 million, earnings for the quarter totaled $921 million or $0.49 per share. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation.
Cash from operations for the quarter was $5.3 billion, and our debt ratio at quarter end was 23.7%. Our net debt ratio was approximately 20%. 
During the third quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividend. Earlier in the week, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.08 per share, payable to stockholders of record as of November 18, 2016. Our annual per-share payout for 2016 will be $4.29 per share and represents the 29th consecutive year of growth in the annual per-share payout. We currently yield 4.3%. 
Turning to Slide 4. Cash generated from operations was $5.3 billion during the third quarter and $9 billion year-to-date. Year-to-date working capital effects of $1.3 billion and $3.1 billion in deferred tax items -- for example, those associated with tax loss positions -- reduced year-to-date operating cash. These are timing effects. 
Proceeds from asset sales totaled $800 million in the third quarter, including the sale of selected Gulf of Mexico assets. These transactions had a minimal impact on earnings in the quarter. Year-to-date asset sale proceeds are $2.2 billion. We continue to pursue a number of potential transactions, and we remain confident that we can achieve our $5 billion to $10 billion target for total proceeds over this year and next.
Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $4.1 billion, a decrease of $2.7 billion from the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date cash investment outlays have totaled approximately $14 billion. 
During the quarter, we advanced $2 billion to Tengizchevroil, or TCO, in support of the FGP project. This outflow was reflected in our cash flow statement as a borrowing by equity affiliate. This first co-lending tranche provides sufficient funding as the project commences. Future advances are expected, and the timing will be dependent upon oil prices, TCO's internal cash generation and the project's pace of investment.
At quarter end, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $7.7 billion, and our net debt position was $37.9 billion. 
Turning now to Slide 5. Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Third quarter 2016 results were $754 million lower than third quarter 2015 results. Special items, primarily the deferred tax benefit related to the U.K. tax rate change, the award of an Ecuador arbitration claim and the absence of third quarter 2015 asset impairments, increased earnings by $535 million between periods.
Lower foreign exchange gains decreased earnings by $322 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations.
Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were largely flat between quarters as lower crude realizations were offset by lower operating expenses and favorable tax impacts. Downstream results, excluding special items and FX, decreased by $1 billion, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margins and lower earnings from CP Chem.
Turning now to Slide 6. Here, I'll compare results for the third quarter of 2016 with the second quarter of 2016. Third quarter results were approximately $2.8 billion higher than the second quarter. The absence of second quarter 2016 charges associated with special items and the inclusion of third quarter gains from special items increased earnings by $2.7 billion between periods. Lower foreign exchange gains reduced earnings by approximately $200 million between periods. Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were comparable between quarters, in line with relatively flat Brent prices. Lower operational expenses were offset essentially by lower liftings and adverse tax impacts.
Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were higher by $255 million, primarily resulting from the absence of unfavorable second quarter inventory valuation effects. Prices were generally rising during the second quarter but relatively flat during the third quarter.
Turning to Slide 7. Here, we compare the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the third quarter of 2016 and the third quarter 2015. Net production decreased by 26,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects increased production by 77,000 barrels a day as ramp-ups continued at Gorgon, Jack/St. Malo, Chuandongbei and Angola LNG. About half of this bar is Gorgon. Shale and tight production increased by 50,000 barrels per day, primarily due to the growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian with all shale and tight basins reflecting year-on-year growth. More than half of this bar is Permian production.
Our base business decline was 66,000 barrels per day. Production from new wells and other brownfield investments in the base added 39,000 barrels per day and helped hold the overall base decline rate to less than 2%.
The sale of our Michigan assets and several assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf resulted in decreased production of 47,000 barrels per day. Disruptions due to external events accounted for the temporary shut-in of 27,000 barrels per day, mainly due to security issues in Nigeria. Our planned turnaround activity was heavier than this time last year, resulting in a decrease of 26,000 barrels per day, the most significant of which was at TCO as we completed the turnaround of the second-generation plant. Based on 9 months of actual and our forecast for the fourth quarter, we anticipate full year 2016 production will be approximately 2.6 million barrels per day. 
Turning now to Slide 8. As we indicated on the second quarter call, we expect to exit the year with December production in the range of 2.65 million to 2.7 million barrels per day or growth in the range of 150,000 barrels per day from the third quarter average. A major contributor, as previously discussed, is TCO's return to production on September 9 following the largest planned turnaround in its history, ahead of schedule, under budget and without serious incidents or injuries. Over the course of 6 weeks, maintenance was conducted on more than 500 pieces of equipment. At its peak, over 8,800 employees and contractors were on site for the turnaround. The team worked proactively with over 30 contract companies on all stages of planning, preparation and execution. This was a large undertaking that was exceptionally well executed. 
The second contributor to volume growth in December is the ramp-up of our LNG projects, notably Gorgon. At Gorgon, Train 1 production is stable and Train 2 is now online. At Angola LNG, the plant reached a rate of approximately 5 million tonnes per year of LNG. Production has been suspended while minor modifications to reach full capacity are completed. Short-duration shutdowns are often experienced as facilities are ramped up to their full capacity. ALNG expects to restart the plant within the next couple of weeks and will continue to ramp up and fine-tune the system. 
Since the initial restart earlier this year, they have shipped 8 LNG cargos and 16 LPG cargos. In addition to LNG volume increases, we achieved first production from Bangka in August and expect first production from Alder before year-end. We also expect continued growth in our unconventionals and from our base business investments.
Turning now to Slide 9. At Gorgon, total Train 1 LNG production has been stable at an average rate of 110,000 barrels per day, which is about 5 million tonnes per year. We are also producing about 6,700 barrels per day of condensates. As mentioned, Train 2 is running and producing LNG. Production is expected to ramp up over the coming months. We have shipped 17 cargos to date, and with both trains now running, we expect to ship an average of 2 to 3 cargos per week. Construction on Train 3 is progressing very well, and we expect first LNG in the second quarter of 2017. 
At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017 for Train 1. We are leveraging our experience from Gorgon and are pleased with our progress. All modules for Train 1 and Train 2 are now on site, and the installation of piping, electrical and instrumentation continue as planned. As we have foreshadowed, the delay in module delivery at Wheatstone has impacted project costs relative to the original 2011 estimate. We now forecast the total project cost at completion to be USD 34 billion. Chevron's share of the cost to complete the project is included in the $17 billion to $22 billion capital guidance range that we have previously communicated for the 2017 to 2018 years. 
Bruce will now provide an update on our activities in the Permian. Bruce?"

As we have shared previously, Chevron enjoys a very strong acreage position in the Permian Basin. Our acreage is extensive, covering about 2 million acres. We have major holdings in the best basin locations and enjoy a significant royalty advantage over our competitors. 
Our strategy in the Permian is centered on building a large-scale asset that delivers strong returns and generates free cash flow. To accomplish this, we have implemented a well factory, modeled after most -- modeled after the most efficient short-cycle operations in Chevron and in industry. The goal of this factory is to create repeatable, high-value outcomes at sufficient scale that are material for Chevron. Decisions around many key design elements are consistently implemented, not only the obvious ones such as horizontal lateral length, well spacing and completion parameters, but also hundreds of other decisions that we face on a routine basis for which we want consistent outcomes. As we identify and verify improvements, they are quickly implemented into our basis of design. Our pace has been intentionally deliberate to allow us to incorporate the learnings and experience from our own work and that of the industry. The result is a high degree of confidence that we will achieve the outcomes we expect, our results are competitive and continue to improve.
Turning to Slide 11. You can see Chevron's acreage position in more detail. This slide is a map of the Permian Basin, inclusive of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. Our 2 million acres are depicted in blue, 1.5 million of which are in the Midland and Delaware Basins. Also depicted on the map are active Chevron-operated developments in blue and our nonoperated development areas in purple. 
We believe the quality of our acreage position is exceptional with multiple-stack geologic targets. Today, we estimate that almost 600,000 of our acres have a net value in excess of $50,000 per acre. We have an additional 350,000 acres with a net value between $20,000 and $50,000 per acre. The balance of our acreage is a mix. Some is of lower quality, some is still under evaluation, some lacks nearby infrastructure and some requires further appraisal. These estimates are a snapshot that assumes a simultaneous development, a flat $50 WTI price and are burdened with all development and production costs as we see them today. 
We're active in several company-operated and nonoperated joint venture development areas. We're currently running 8 drilling rigs on our operated acreage. We're standing up our ninth rig as we speak and expect to be at 10 by the end of the year. Another 10 rigs are currently drilling on our nonoperated development areas. We prioritize development areas by value, which considers expected ultimate recovery, cost of development, oil-gas split, availability of surface infrastructure and our overall certainty of outcome. 
Turning to Slide 12. To achieve strong returns, we focus on all elements necessary to generate cash flow: capital efficiency, operating expense and product realizations. The graph in the upper-right corner shows development cost per barrel, which, in our view, is the ultimate measure of capital performance as it incorporates all submetrics. We have achieved a 30% development cost reduction from 2015, fully inclusive of drilling, completions, facilities and associated G&A. We've accomplished this through a focus on improving expected ultimate recovery, driving execution efficiencies and implementing supply chain savings. This is delivering capital performance that is competitive with the operators of our joint ventures. The trend of improvement is mirrored in our overall unit operating expense. The lower right graph reflects both the downward trend and competitive performance of our direct lease operating expense and illustrates a significant reduction of 45% from 2015. Our lease operating expense includes all costs required to operate a well and its associated facilities during its life. We expect these wells to produce for decades, so attention to operating efficiency unlocks value. 
Additionally, G&A, which is not included in the graph on the lower right, is a component of overall operating expense. Our year-to-date G&A is $3.50 a barrel, declining through the year and more than 20% from 2015. 
The third critical aspect of cash flow is product realizations. We've leveraged the scale of our core positions to systematically secure cost-effective priority access through the entire crude and gas value chain rather than simply selling production at the wellhead. Because of this, we have options available to respond to changing market and industry conditions. 
Turning to Slide 13. We expect activity and production from the Permian to grow through the end of the decade. As we discussed in our Analyst Day last March, by the end of 2020, Chevron's Permian shale and tight production is expected to reach 250,000 to 350,000 barrels per day. 
As you can see on the chart, we have initiated this growth. Production continues to track ahead of expectations and is 24% higher than third quarter 2015. We continually monitor our performance and have the option to adjust the pace of our growth as needed to optimize value from this asset. While growing production is important, we're focused on expanding margins, by increasing efficiencies in our operations and on capturing maximum value from the resource base. We believe we're well positioned to make the Permian a legacy asset with strong returns and free cash flow.
I'll now hand back to Pat to discuss spend reductions. Pat?"

We continue to reduce our spend. You can see on the chart the huge progress that we've made and continue to make in curtailing our outflows. We expect 2016 combined operating expense and capital expenditure outflow",471,"Okay. Thank you, Bruce. Now on Slide 14. We continue to reduce our spend. You can see on the chart the huge progress that we've made and continue to make in curtailing our outflows. We expect 2016 combined operating expense and capital expenditure outflows to be down more than $12 billion or more than 20% from 2015. We expect to meet, if not exceed, the commitment we made earlier in the year to have 2016 operating expenses come in $2 billion lower than 2015. And our C&E is trending below the guidance range previously provided for this year. We will likely end the year below $25 billion in capital outlays; in fact, potentially coming in closer to $24 billion. This is a tremendous amount of progress in a relatively short 24-month period of time to reset these key financial parameters consistent with a lower-for-longer price environment.
Turning to Slide 15. I'd like to close with just a couple of points. First, our financial priorities have not changed. Sustaining and growing the dividend is our first priority. The increase this quarter demonstrates that commitment, which is underpinned by a confidence in our future earnings and cash flow growth. 
Second, we are beginning to see evidence of that cash flow growth. Notably now that Gorgon Train 1 is operating well and Train 2 is successfully online and with Gorgon's Train 3 and Wheatstone's Trains 1 and 2 planned to come on in fairly rapid succession over the next 5 quarters. We have approximately 85% of the production from these 5 trains sold under long-term contracts. And at today's contractual LNG prices, this represents a significant revenue and cash margin boost.
Third, we have successfully transitioned to a lower price environment. Of course, we are not resting on these recent accomplishments. We will continue to look for opportunities to improve cost and capital efficiency. We are poised to be a very resilient competitor in a low-priced world. Our Permian asset base speaks directly to this. Here, we have an abundance of riches in terms of the physical asset base, and we are successfully demonstrating the ability to develop this resource in a highly capital-efficient, returns-focused manner. 
With costs coming down, with C&E and capital intensity coming down, with our major LNG projects and the Permian production coming online to boost cash margins and production, our overall financial picture is set to improve in a meaningful way as we move into 2017. Our objective is to get cash balance in 2017 assuming $50 Brent prices. All of these improvements I have just noted, as well as targeted asset sales where we can transact for value, are key components supporting that objective.
So this concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take some questions. [Operator Instructions]

As you know, we have had a practice, when we have had pieces of our portfolio where we felt there wasn't longer-term strategic value or we felt others could -- would offer more value for it than it would obtain in our portfolio, we've been willing to make asset sales. And we've had a very routine practice of having asset sales over a long number of years here. I think the key to getting to that point in the decision process, though, is having a really good understanding of the value of the asset. And in the Permian Basin, there's been a great deal of fluidity in that evaluation over the last couple of years. There's been a great deal of additional appraisal and evaluation work, and there's been a great deal of greater understanding, but there still has been significant movement. In some cases, pieces of property have moved up by a factor of 10,000-fold. And that's the kind of thing that you would not want to get on the wrong side of it -- in your haste to make a decision about selling an asset. So our process will be to try to do evaluation and appraisal work, get a really good understanding of what this asset valuation is, and to the extent that we don't find it fitting into our longer-term development plans, then that, of course, we would look to other monetization options."

I mean, if you go back to Slide 13 here, I think we have said that -- and we said this back in the SAM and throughout the year here, that we could see that top light -- the top end of the light-blue portion of the profile there would result in approximately a doubling of our current activity levels. And so we're spending one and a half here. You can see us potentially doubling that. And that is kind of the current view that we have. But again, this is an area that we'll update you when we get to the March Security Analyst Meeting. In reference to FGP, the future growth project in Tengiz, I think it's important to know that we are funding both of these projects, both the Permian fully and FGP. We think of these projects, these areas as being absolutely critical growth areas for us. So we're not starving the Permian because we've taken on FGP. I think what people often miss around FGP is that there would be a tremendous loss of value if we didn't go forward with the Wellhead Pressure Management Project because the field would go into decline. It would be in serious decline, and that would be loss of value on a legacy asset. We're doing FGP and WPMP together because of synergies. It's a joint development concept. And there's a lot of upside that has not been kind of built in to a lot of people's models, I guess I would say, about FGP that relate to debottlenecking. What we've been able to demonstrate in the past, we hope to be able to do on a go-forward basis. There's additional gas-handling facilities built in here that will, over time, allow greater oil production. Contingencies, we've talked through about being kind of fully contingent even though we're at 50% of engineering when we took FID. And then, of course, down the road, obviously, we hope that this turns into concession extension. So there's a lot of potential upsides to FGP. I think Jay did a great job on our second quarter call in kind of running through all of those parameters."

The -- that original appropriation request was taken in 2011. And as you can all appreciate, the first few years of construction there was in a much more heated market. But we've talked in the past about our late module delivery, and this really was one of the primary drivers behind the cost increase. They were delayed due to poor performance at one of the fabricating yards. It came to be that the contractor was unable to effectively manage the size and the scale of the work scope that we had given that particular contractor. So we recognized that somewhat early on, and we did end up redirecting some of the work to other yards. But even so, the modules were late. A second factor that I would comment on is really an underestimation of the quantity of materials that were required. At the time we took FID on Wheatstone, we had -- engineering was at about 15% complete, and so the rest was based on rules of thumb and factors. As we matured the engineering definition, the amount of quantities needed increased substantially, and so that really was a secondary reason behind the cost increase. I would say this second element was something that we had seen on Gorgon as well, and it is one of the primary areas where we are trying to improve our project execution going forward. As you know, we had -- FGP, when we took FID on FGP, we were at about nearly a 50% engineering level. So this is one of the primary improvement practices that we're putting in place for future projects."

I think, when you have such an extraordinary asset base in the Permian, when it has as much kind of depth and breadth to it, and I don't mean that in a literal sense but a figurative sense, such huge economic strength, everything in the portfolio really needs to be judged against those options. And so when I think about -- we don't believe we want to be just a single-asset class company. So we have great strategic capabilities and basin positions in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater. We have the Tengiz project that we talked about. We have the LNG projects. So we have pretty broad-based portfolio here, and we're not looking to take all activity down to the Permian. But the value of the Permian and its tremendous economic capability and its capital efficiency, its great flexibility, its short-cycle, high-return attribute does make other parts of the portfolio have to compete for capital against that. So I think it raises the bar on where that incremental dollar is going to go. And I think Permian will get the first call, but we will manage it as a portfolio. And over time, you should still expect us to have some significant other projects, but we can pace those projects quite nicely, I think, and match against -- always coming back to and matching against the opportunities that the Permian provides for us."

We have operations in both the Midland and Delaware Basin on the company-operated side and on the NOJV side as well. And the mix of activity in any particular quarter is going to cause those bars to be up and down a little bit. If we had the fourth quarter of 2015, you'd see 2 quarters where the company-operated bars are a little lower, and then the last 2 quarters where the NOJV bars are a little lower. But we would look internally in a much finer level of detail. Wolfcamp B wells in the Central Midland basin, 1.5-mile laterals, and are we comparable in that activity or not? And what do we address about that? So the overall performance is competitive, and I will tell you that there is a competitive group. There's a lead pack in the Permian, and we're a part of that. And I think the data on Slide 12 shows that, and some of the quarter-to-quarter variations are simply a function of which particular wells are completing. And because our costs include full cycle, there are facility costs in our bars in the quarter in which we start wells in a new area and have central tank batteries or other things that are being executed in that period."

But in the period that we're talking about here, I don't see that change -- changing our view of the $17 billion to $22 billion range being appropriate for us. You're hearing an awful lot about the Permian being one of the best investment opportunities that we have, and the great thing about that is that it's short cycle, it's high return, it's very flexible. And so that gives us -- it lowers our capital intensity, gives us greater flexibility than we have had in several years. And the only other major project that we've sanctioned at this point in time is TCO, and our share of that in terms on outflow would be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion a year over the next few years. So we consider that to be very manageable, and that's within the $17 billion to $22 billion range that we've given you.

I'll begin with key messages from our March 2016 Security Analyst Meeting, followed by a recap of our first quarter 2016 financial results. Joe will provide some color around our spend reduction initiatives and discuss recent updates on key projects prior to my concluding remarks.
Turning now to Slide 3. Our Analyst Day was about 7 weeks ago now, and I thought it would be worthwhile to reiterate the primary messages from that series of sessions. Preserving and growing the dividend is our first priority. Our intention is to be able to cover the dividend in 2017. Our capital spend profile is coming down. We are completing major capital projects already under construction but otherwise reducing long-cycle spend. We are lowering our cost structure to better match a low price environment by improving efficiencies, streamlining the organization and working with suppliers to achieve cost reductions.
At the same time, we expect our cash inflows to be growing. Production increases will occur as we bring on and ramp up projects. While volume growth is sensitive to any number of unknowns such as prices, divestments, ramp up profiles, we anticipate volume growth through the end of the decade using reasonable estimates for these and other uncertainties.
The cash generation of the new assets coming online is substantial to the point where these production adds are expected to raise the overall cash margin per barrel of the entire portfolio even absent any increase in price.
This year, we plan to use some of our borrowing capacity to complete projects. We have one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, and we believe we can come through the lows of this price cycle with long term financial strength intact. Our investment will shift to a higher proportion of short-cycle projects. Not only are many of these brownfield opportunities, but they will give us greater capital flexibility going forward to help limit further debt increases. 
Finally, we are focused on improving financial returns, reducing preproductive capital, moving towards more short-cycle higher-return investments, lowering our cost structure and improving execution on major capital projects.
Turning to Slide 4, an overview of our financial performance. The company's first quarter loss was $725 million or negative $0.39 per diluted share. Excluding foreign exchange and special items, as detailed in an appendix slide, the loss for the quarter totaled $211 million or a negative $0.11 per share. Cash from operations for the quarter was $1.1 billion, and our debt ratio at quarter end was 22%. Our net debt ratio was 18%.
During the first quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividends. Earlier in the week, we announced a dividend of $1.07 per share payable to stockholders of record as of May 19. We currently yield 4.2%.
Turning to Slide 5. Cash generated from operations was $1.1 billion during the first quarter. Obviously, upstream cash generation has been heavily penalized by low commodity prices. Downstream continues to generate strong cash flow, although seasonal patterns are evident. 
During the quarter, operating cash flow reflected about $1 billion of working capital requirements as well as certain pension contributions. In addition, affiliate dividends were modest in the quarter, a pattern that is clearly price related as we expect cash generation to improve going forward as our costs come down and as prices move up. 
Cash capital expenditures were $5.6 billion, a decrease of approximately 27% from first quarter 2015. At quarter end, our cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $8.9 billion, and our net debt position was about $33 billion.
Turning to Slide 6. Slide 6 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. First quarter 2016 results were $3.3 billion lower than first quarter 2015 results. About half of this quarter-on-quarter decline was in special items and foreign exchange. Overall, special items accounted for a negative variance between quarters of $755 million, the bulk of which related to last year's recognition of both asset sale gain and the favorable impact of changes in U.K. petroleum tax regulations.
A swing in foreign exchange impacts decreased earnings by $900 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations and do not generally affect cash.
Excluding special items and foreign exchange, upstream earnings decreased approximately $1.6 billion between quarters. Lower crude realizations were partially offset by higher sales volumes and lower operating and exploration expenses. The realization change was in line with our sensitivity of $350 million per dollar change in Brent.
Downstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by approximately $475 million, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margin. The variance in the other segment was primarily from lower corporate tax items. 
Turning to Slide 7. I'll now compare results for the first quarter 2016 with the fourth quarter 2015. First quarter results were $137 million lower than fourth quarter. A swing in special items, mainly the absence of fourth quarter's impairment and project suspension charges, increased earnings by $930 million. Foreign exchange impacts went the other way, decreasing earnings by $365 million between periods. Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, decreased by approximately $750 million between quarters, primarily reflecting lower realizations, again in line with our sensitivity.
Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were lower by $163 million. Weaker refining margins were partially offset by stronger trading results, lower operating expenses and the absence of year-end inventory charges from a draw into higher cost to prior year layers.
The variance in the other segment largely reflects lower corporate charges.
Slide 8 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the first quarter of 2016 and the fourth quarter of 2015. Net production decreased by 7,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital project ramp ups, primarily at Gorgon in Australia, Chuandongbei in China, and Lianzi and Moho Nord in West Africa, increased production by 11,000 barrels per day. The absence of planned and unplanned downtime, mainly at Tengiz and Kazakhstan, increased production by 25,000 barrels per day between periods. Shale and tight production declined 5,000 barrels a day between quarters as external constraints such as weather impacts and downtime at a third party processing facility impacted the Permian. Price and cost recovery effects associated with production sharing and variable royalty contracts decreased production by 18,000 barrels per day between quarters as lower crude prices were more than offset by the impact from lower spend on cost recovery.
The remaining variance in the base business and other bar primarily reflects natural field declines and other adjustments. All this said, first quarter volumes are up about 2% from full year 2015 production. This is right in the middle of the guidance range we provided in January and reaffirmed in March. We still believe this guidance is appropriate.
Slide 9 compares the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil-equivalent production between the first quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2015. Net production decreased by 15,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects increased production by 38,000 barrels per day, primarily due to production ramp ups from the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Bangladesh and West Africa, in addition to startups at Gorgon in Australia and Chuandongbei in China. Shale and tight production increased by 37,000 barrels per day due to the growth in the Permian and Marcellus in the U.S. and the Liard and Duvernay basins in Canada. 
Volumes associated with production sharing and variable royalty contracts increased production by 16,000 barrels per day as the positive impact from lower crude prices was partially offset by the impacts of lower spending on cost recovery.
A shut-in of operations in the Partitioned Zone decreased production by approximately 76,000 barrels per day. The decrease of 30,000 barrels per day in the base business and other bar primarily reflects normal field declines and higher downtime activity, partially offset by production from new wells and favorable impact from reduced external constraints.
Turning now to Slide 10. We are making good progress at reducing our spend. These charts use a rolling 4-quarter average to illustrate capital and operating expense reductions. When comparing the rolling 4-quarter average of first quarter 2016 to the same period of the prior year, capital outlays are down 19%. In December, we announced a C&E program of $26.6 billion for the year. But as we noted in March, we are now targeting closer to $25 billion for the year. As we continue to finish major capital projects under construction, we will move to an absolute lower level of annual spend in future years as evidenced by our $17 billion to $22 billion range that we've given you for 2017 to 2018. Affordability considerations at the time will be paramount in determining actual budgets. Capital intensity will be going down. Capital discipline will be going up. You see the same general pattern on operating expense, same downward pattern on operating expense. Expenses continue to rise through 2014 but then notably turn south in mid-2015 as our deliberate cost savings initiatives began to take hold. The rolling first quarter 2016 average is 6% lower than the comparable figure a year ago.
There are some transitional costs such as severance and rig termination fees that are incurred as we take steps to compete more effectively in a lower price environment. Once we're through with the transition cost and as we carry on with the implementation of our various cost savings initiatives, we expect to see continued movement towards a lower, sustainable cost structure. Cost reduction momentum should continue through 2016 and 2017 as the full run rate of our actions is recognized.
Joe will now walk you through some specific examples of our cost reduction efforts before offering an update on key projects."

Now our efforts are focused on achieving sustainable reductions and improving efficiencies. On the organizational side, to date, we have reduced our employee headcount by more than 4,000 relative to year-end 2014, and we are on target to achieve approximately 8,000 total employee reductions by the end of 2016. We're also on target to reduce our contract to workforce by about 6,500 from 2014 levels. 
At the analyst meeting, we shared with you examples of how -- of our improved drilling efficiencies in the Permian and Gulf of Mexico. So today, let me give you an additional example from a different region of the world. In Thailand, operational discipline and streamline processes have enhanced drilling execution efficiency, resulting in about 45% lower average days per 10,000 feet drilled in a 2-year period, as you can see in the graph. And we are continuing to outperform our regional competitors. We're also focused on improving our efficiencies in logistics. One example in West Africa includes shifting from department dedicated vessels to a centrally managed fleet using a decision support center. As a result of this effort, we expect to achieve savings of 30% and reduce the number of vessels in that region by about 40%. We're also continuing to take advantage of our size and scale. In a different part of the world, we are coordinating contract awards with 1 supplier across 3 different regions and reducing the number of vessels by optimizing marine vessel size.
One of our focus areas is to retain gains achieved during this industry downturn. We are doing this across the globe. For example, in one region, we are taking advantage of the current downturn to negotiate with our main supplier, lock in lower rates through 2022 and upgrade with newer and more capable equipment. It not only improved our rates but is also expected to improve our reliability. As we look ahead in the supply chain, we see opportunities for more strategic supplier relationships and standardization. At the analyst meeting, we shared with you the cost savings achieved in the oilfield Tubulars category. These reductions were achieved through standardization and supply rationalization where we went from having 35 suppliers in the past to 4 going forward. On Gorgon, we have worked to standardize and intend to replicate subsea equipment, generating procurement and installation efficiencies as well as considerable cost savings. And lastly, we've been working at standardizing the valves for some time, and we will start deploying the standard valves on future projects.
Turning to Slide 12, let me give you some project updates. At Gorgon, we commenced LNG production on March 7. We ramped up total production to approximately 90,000 barrels per day, and we shipped the first cargo on March 21. Since late March, we have incurred downtime at the plant due to mechanical issues with the propane refrigerant circuit of Train 1. Repairs to this equipment are nearing completion, and we are in the process of reinstating the propane refrigerant circuit. We expect to restart Train 1 in the next few weeks and resume LNG production within the 30- to 60-day estimate we provided previously. We still expect to achieve Train 1 ramp up within the previous guidance of 6 to 8 months from initial startup. Construction on Trains 2 and 3 is progressing as planned, and we anticipate these trains being ready for startup at roughly 6 months’ intervals.
Turning to Slide 13. At Wheatstone, all 9 development wells are completed. We expect to release the drilling rig in the next few months following well cleanup activities. Offshore platform hookup and commissioning is progressing on track with this work expected to be complete well in advance of plant startup. At the plant site, piping, electrical and instrumentation work is progressing well. Our plan reflects absorbed performance rates on other Australian LNG projects. Actual rates are currently on track with our plan, and the outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017. Train 2 construction work is also progressing on schedule. 12 of 24 process modules required for Train 2 startup are now on site, and module deliveries are meeting scheduled milestones.
Turning to Slide 14. I'd like to share brief updates on the other projects, which we are expecting to start up this year. At Angola LNG, gas has been introduced into the plant, and the team is working through the start-up process with dehydration ongoing ahead of commencing liquefaction. We expect LNG production imminently and anticipate shipping the next cargo in May. At Mafumeira Sul, hookup and commissioning is ongoing. All structures, topsides, and pipelines are installed. And the living quarters platform is now occupied, enabling increased manpower on piping, electrical and commissioning work. Batch drilling of the first 10 wells is complete, and first production is expected later this year. At Chuandongbei, Train 1 started up in January, and we were able to ramp up to full capacity within 30 days. Train 2 came online in early April, and ramp up is in progress. We expect to start Train 3 this quarter. At Alder, topsides have been installed, and subsea installation work is progressing. At Bangka, well completions are currently ongoing. First production is expected from both these projects later this year.
Pat will now share an update on our asset sales program."

Asset sales are a routine part of our business. They generate needed cash, and they enable a more strategic, effective and capital-efficient portfolio. Over the next 2 years, we are targeting $5 billion to $10",611,"All right. Thanks, Joe. Turning to Slide 15. Asset sales are a routine part of our business. They generate needed cash, and they enable a more strategic, effective and capital-efficient portfolio. Over the next 2 years, we are targeting $5 billion to $10 billion in sales proceeds. The assets targeted for sale are marketable, and we believe the prospective transactions are executable as well. We generally do not discuss specific assets targeted for sale until we have a transaction. However, there has been growing media coverage since our Analyst Day on a few of these prospective sales and as such, we wanted to provide updates where possible. 
The chart highlights some specific transactions that are in the public domain. You will note the vast majority of these are not oil price sensitive and thus, we expect to be able to obtain good values on the sale. There were no significant transactions in the first quarter, but activity has picked up in the second quarter. Already known second quarter transactions include the sale of our interest in 2 gas storage facilities in Western Canada, the sale of our KLM pipeline and Western San Joaquin crude oil pipelines in California and the divestiture of 19 sales and associated assets located primarily in the Gulf of Mexico outer shelf and in Louisiana State waters.
In 2015, we signed an agreement to sell our New Zealand downstream operations subject to certain regulatory approval. Those regulatory approvals were received yesterday, and we now anticipate final closing mid-year.
Just last week, we reached an agreement to sell our assets in Hawaii. The sale includes the 58,000-barrel per day refinery, interest in a 58-site branded service station network, 4 product distribution terminals, pipeline systems and other downstream-related assets. This transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2016.
In addition, we are soliciting interest to sell our 75% shareholding in South Africa downstream. We are also exploring potential interest in our geothermal business and Myanmar upstream assets. In aggregate, while it's always difficult to be precise about specific timing, we currently have line of sight on around $2 billion in proceeds, maybe a little higher for 2016. And because we have multiple transactions in the queue, including those not highlighted on the slide, we have confidence in achieving our 2-year $5 billion to $10 billion target.
Turning to Slide 16, I'd like to close with another slide from our recent investor sessions. It's an illustration of how we get cash balance next year. In this slide, we used $52 Brent as it was the actual average price in 2015 and in line with averages sell side analyst price targets for 2017. However, we are committed to balancing at any reasonable price. Spending will come down significantly this year and next as major development projects get finished and come online as we high grade future investments to shorter-cycle higher-return opportunity and as we get more efficient and lower our cost structure. Cash generation will grow, not only because of more production but also because of accretive cash margins on the new production. We'll continue to streamline the portfolio. In short, we are taking the steps necessary to compete in a lower price environment. If a lower price environment persists for longer, we will adjust and pursue even more significant cost savings and even greater cuts in capital to continue to lower our cash flow breakeven. We intend to be a resilient competitor regardless of the price environment.
Okay. That concludes our prepared remarks. And we're now ready to take some questions. [Operator Instructions] Jonathan, please open the lines for questions."

Yes, sustaining and growing the dividend is still the first priority from a cash use standpoint for the corporation. It long has been and it continues to be. Obviously, our immediate financial environment makes this challenging. We have long said that we'll raise the dividend when our cash flow and our earnings allow it to be sustained. And obviously, in first quarter, that was not the circumstances that we found ourselves in and, therefore, a deferral was prudent. I think going forward, the timing will obviously be dependent upon future cash, future earnings, what happens to price, what happens to our project ramp ups, how all that plays out in future quarters. We'll also have to take a look at what we think is happening to commodity prices over a longer sweep of time because, again, we're looking at a dividend as being essentially a commitment in perpetuity. We're very aware of our 28-year record of consecutive annual per share payment increases, and that will be taken into account. So the board will take all this into account as it looks at dividends each and every quarter."

As Pat mentioned, there were a number of onetime events in the first quarter, which adversely impacted our production. Going forward, we still expect to realize the growth range we provided at our analyst meeting. The key for us is to really exercise the things within our control, and that is to continue to drive cost down and to improve our efficiencies. And we have given several proof points in the past about how much progress we've done in that regard. We're now in full horizontal factory mode in the Permian. We brought our well cost down by about 40%, and we have about 4,000 well locations that offer us a 10% rate of return at around $50 WTI. And when you add on top of all of that the royalty advantage that have, we see our activity in the Permian as being very, very strong. So the key for us is to continue to be competitive, and we do that very well because we also have a OJV, so we have a good line of sight on how well other people are operating in the basin. And of course, we screen them based on our own economics and lastly, the royalty advantage give us a tremendous boost here."

But frankly, if we find ourselves in a different place, affordability is a paramount consideration here for us, and we will continue to prioritize and high grade our opportunities. Our primary methodology in terms of capital allocation starts from what do we absolutely need to do to maintain reliability, maintain the asset integrity. And after that, after we have kind of concluded what that is for the operation, then we build up our capital program after that, and we have a great deal of flexibility. So each and every one of those layers of additional spend will have significant hurdles that they have to overcome, and affordability becomes an overriding consideration. So we'll continue to manage capital down commensurate with the price environment. We'll continue to push forward with our asset sales. I mentioned only $2 billion or so line of sight, maybe a little bit more for this year, but we see our way clear to the $5 billion to $10 billion program. And obviously, for us to have confidence in saying it's $5 billion to $10 billion, we've got more lined up behind that because we know not every transaction will be executed in the time frame that we've outlined.

That's a good thing. On the other hand, your debt burden is clearly going to be much higher, depends how long the down cycle lasts. So can you talk a little bit about where you want to sort of end up in terms of debt burden?

Ed, the way I look at this and the way we look at this really is that, obviously, when you're at the peak of a price cycle, that's when you want to have restored your balance sheet, have an ultraconservative balance sheet and that allows you to come through a price downturn. Right now, we're sitting at a 22% debt ratio. We showed a slide at the Security Analyst Meeting that said we could take somewhere between $25 billion to $30 billion of incremental debt that would take us up to about a 30% debt ratio. There's nothing necessarily magic about the 30%. It was just an indicative place to do a measurement versus ourselves versus peers. But I would see as you go through the lows of a price cycle, you would expect your debt burden to increase into the 30%-ish range, maybe a little bit higher on a temporary basis. But if you look through the whole cycle, I think a good place for a company like Chevron with the projects that we take on, our size, our scale, our scope would be probably in the low 20s through the cycle. But getting into the 30%-ish range, we could handle that if it's temporary."

So I'll just go back to our cash flow priorities: dividend is number one; reinvesting in the business, number two; and then prudent financial structure, strong balance sheet is number three.

So we will see shorter-cycle movement there that obviously puts less of a strain on your balance sheet because you can adjust those as conditions permit. But we are going to continue to go forward with major capital projects, and FGP is the poster child for that. That's an important project for us, an economic project for us, to go forward with. And we will continue to do those. So I think of it as being, over time, a better balance between short cycle opportunities and long cycle opportunities. We're coming off a period that was significantly weighted by long duration, highly capital-intensive projects and we're moving the portfolio now, our investments now, to a better balance between those. So I think we've got tremendous amount of flexibility to not only reinvest in the business in short cycle, take on selective high-graded wonderful projects like FGP but also then have opportunity to restore the balance sheet.

We start with the asset integrity and reliability foundation. And then each and every layer of projects above that competes on its merits on a returns-focused kind of basis.

We have a lot of other places where actually we have good resources. We talked about Tengiz, we talked about Thailand, we talked about Indonesia. Australia is going to give us those opportunities. So yes, while the Permian give us tremendous advantage, the size of our company will require us to actually be broader and to put our capital in places where we can get good economics but not to be solely a one-asset class company."

Welcome to Chevron's third quarter earnings conference call and webcast. On the call with me today are Bruce Niemeyer, Vice President, Mid-Continent business unit; and Frank Mount, General Manager of Investor Relations. We will refer to the slides that are available on Chevron's website.
Before we get started, please be reminded that this presentation contains estimates, projections and other forward-looking statements. We ask that you review the cautionary statement on Slide 2. 
I'll begin with a recap of our third quarter 2016 financial and operational results, and then Bruce will provide an update on our Permian Basin business prior to my concluding remarks.
Slide 3 provides an overview of our financial performance. The company's third quarter earnings were $1.3 billion or $0.68 per diluted share. Third quarter results included $290 million in special items related to a deferred tax benefit from the U.K. tax rate change and the receipt of an Ecuador arbitration award. Excluding these special items as well as the positive impact from foreign exchange effects of $72 million, earnings for the quarter totaled $921 million or $0.49 per share. A detailed reconciliation of special items and foreign exchange is included in the appendix to this presentation.
Cash from operations for the quarter was $5.3 billion, and our debt ratio at quarter end was 23.7%. Our net debt ratio was approximately 20%. 
During the third quarter, we paid $2 billion in dividend. Earlier in the week, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $1.08 per share, payable to stockholders of record as of November 18, 2016. Our annual per-share payout for 2016 will be $4.29 per share and represents the 29th consecutive year of growth in the annual per-share payout. We currently yield 4.3%. 
Turning to Slide 4. Cash generated from operations was $5.3 billion during the third quarter and $9 billion year-to-date. Year-to-date working capital effects of $1.3 billion and $3.1 billion in deferred tax items -- for example, those associated with tax loss positions -- reduced year-to-date operating cash. These are timing effects. 
Proceeds from asset sales totaled $800 million in the third quarter, including the sale of selected Gulf of Mexico assets. These transactions had a minimal impact on earnings in the quarter. Year-to-date asset sale proceeds are $2.2 billion. We continue to pursue a number of potential transactions, and we remain confident that we can achieve our $5 billion to $10 billion target for total proceeds over this year and next.
Cash capital expenditures for the quarter were $4.1 billion, a decrease of $2.7 billion from the third quarter of 2015. Year-to-date cash investment outlays have totaled approximately $14 billion. 
During the quarter, we advanced $2 billion to Tengizchevroil, or TCO, in support of the FGP project. This outflow was reflected in our cash flow statement as a borrowing by equity affiliate. This first co-lending tranche provides sufficient funding as the project commences. Future advances are expected, and the timing will be dependent upon oil prices, TCO's internal cash generation and the project's pace of investment.
At quarter end, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $7.7 billion, and our net debt position was $37.9 billion. 
Turning now to Slide 5. Slide 5 compares current quarter earnings with the same period last year. Third quarter 2016 results were $754 million lower than third quarter 2015 results. Special items, primarily the deferred tax benefit related to the U.K. tax rate change, the award of an Ecuador arbitration claim and the absence of third quarter 2015 asset impairments, increased earnings by $535 million between periods.
Lower foreign exchange gains decreased earnings by $322 million between periods. As a reminder, most of our foreign exchange impacts stem from balance sheet translations.
Upstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were largely flat between quarters as lower crude realizations were offset by lower operating expenses and favorable tax impacts. Downstream results, excluding special items and FX, decreased by $1 billion, primarily driven by lower worldwide refining margins and lower earnings from CP Chem.
Turning now to Slide 6. Here, I'll compare results for the third quarter of 2016 with the second quarter of 2016. Third quarter results were approximately $2.8 billion higher than the second quarter. The absence of second quarter 2016 charges associated with special items and the inclusion of third quarter gains from special items increased earnings by $2.7 billion between periods. Lower foreign exchange gains reduced earnings by approximately $200 million between periods. Upstream results, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were comparable between quarters, in line with relatively flat Brent prices. Lower operational expenses were offset essentially by lower liftings and adverse tax impacts.
Downstream earnings, excluding special items and foreign exchange, were higher by $255 million, primarily resulting from the absence of unfavorable second quarter inventory valuation effects. Prices were generally rising during the second quarter but relatively flat during the third quarter.
Turning to Slide 7. Here, we compare the change in Chevron's worldwide net oil equivalent production between the third quarter of 2016 and the third quarter 2015. Net production decreased by 26,000 barrels per day between quarters. Major capital projects increased production by 77,000 barrels a day as ramp-ups continued at Gorgon, Jack/St. Malo, Chuandongbei and Angola LNG. About half of this bar is Gorgon. Shale and tight production increased by 50,000 barrels per day, primarily due to the growth in the Midland and Delaware Basins in the Permian with all shale and tight basins reflecting year-on-year growth. More than half of this bar is Permian production.
Our base business decline was 66,000 barrels per day. Production from new wells and other brownfield investments in the base added 39,000 barrels per day and helped hold the overall base decline rate to less than 2%.
The sale of our Michigan assets and several assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf resulted in decreased production of 47,000 barrels per day. Disruptions due to external events accounted for the temporary shut-in of 27,000 barrels per day, mainly due to security issues in Nigeria. Our planned turnaround activity was heavier than this time last year, resulting in a decrease of 26,000 barrels per day, the most significant of which was at TCO as we completed the turnaround of the second-generation plant. Based on 9 months of actual and our forecast for the fourth quarter, we anticipate full year 2016 production will be approximately 2.6 million barrels per day. 
Turning now to Slide 8. As we indicated on the second quarter call, we expect to exit the year with December production in the range of 2.65 million to 2.7 million barrels per day or growth in the range of 150,000 barrels per day from the third quarter average. A major contributor, as previously discussed, is TCO's return to production on September 9 following the largest planned turnaround in its history, ahead of schedule, under budget and without serious incidents or injuries. Over the course of 6 weeks, maintenance was conducted on more than 500 pieces of equipment. At its peak, over 8,800 employees and contractors were on site for the turnaround. The team worked proactively with over 30 contract companies on all stages of planning, preparation and execution. This was a large undertaking that was exceptionally well executed. 
The second contributor to volume growth in December is the ramp-up of our LNG projects, notably Gorgon. At Gorgon, Train 1 production is stable and Train 2 is now online. At Angola LNG, the plant reached a rate of approximately 5 million tonnes per year of LNG. Production has been suspended while minor modifications to reach full capacity are completed. Short-duration shutdowns are often experienced as facilities are ramped up to their full capacity. ALNG expects to restart the plant within the next couple of weeks and will continue to ramp up and fine-tune the system. 
Since the initial restart earlier this year, they have shipped 8 LNG cargos and 16 LPG cargos. In addition to LNG volume increases, we achieved first production from Bangka in August and expect first production from Alder before year-end. We also expect continued growth in our unconventionals and from our base business investments.
Turning now to Slide 9. At Gorgon, total Train 1 LNG production has been stable at an average rate of 110,000 barrels per day, which is about 5 million tonnes per year. We are also producing about 6,700 barrels per day of condensates. As mentioned, Train 2 is running and producing LNG. Production is expected to ramp up over the coming months. We have shipped 17 cargos to date, and with both trains now running, we expect to ship an average of 2 to 3 cargos per week. Construction on Train 3 is progressing very well, and we expect first LNG in the second quarter of 2017. 
At Wheatstone, our outlook for first LNG remains mid-2017 for Train 1. We are leveraging our experience from Gorgon and are pleased with our progress. All modules for Train 1 and Train 2 are now on site, and the installation of piping, electrical and instrumentation continue as planned. As we have foreshadowed, the delay in module delivery at Wheatstone has impacted project costs relative to the original 2011 estimate. We now forecast the total project cost at completion to be USD 34 billion. Chevron's share of the cost to complete the project is included in the $17 billion to $22 billion capital guidance range that we have previously communicated for the 2017 to 2018 years. 
Bruce will now provide an update on our activities in the Permian. Bruce?"

As we have shared previously, Chevron enjoys a very strong acreage position in the Permian Basin. Our acreage is extensive, covering about 2 million acres. We have major holdings in the best basin locations and enjoy a significant royalty advantage over our competitors. 
Our strategy in the Permian is centered on building a large-scale asset that delivers strong returns and generates free cash flow. To accomplish this, we have implemented a well factory, modeled after most -- modeled after the most efficient short-cycle operations in Chevron and in industry. The goal of this factory is to create repeatable, high-value outcomes at sufficient scale that are material for Chevron. Decisions around many key design elements are consistently implemented, not only the obvious ones such as horizontal lateral length, well spacing and completion parameters, but also hundreds of other decisions that we face on a routine basis for which we want consistent outcomes. As we identify and verify improvements, they are quickly implemented into our basis of design. Our pace has been intentionally deliberate to allow us to incorporate the learnings and experience from our own work and that of the industry. The result is a high degree of confidence that we will achieve the outcomes we expect, our results are competitive and continue to improve.
Turning to Slide 11. You can see Chevron's acreage position in more detail. This slide is a map of the Permian Basin, inclusive of Southeast New Mexico and West Texas. Our 2 million acres are depicted in blue, 1.5 million of which are in the Midland and Delaware Basins. Also depicted on the map are active Chevron-operated developments in blue and our nonoperated development areas in purple. 
We believe the quality of our acreage position is exceptional with multiple-stack geologic targets. Today, we estimate that almost 600,000 of our acres have a net value in excess of $50,000 per acre. We have an additional 350,000 acres with a net value between $20,000 and $50,000 per acre. The balance of our acreage is a mix. Some is of lower quality, some is still under evaluation, some lacks nearby infrastructure and some requires further appraisal. These estimates are a snapshot that assumes a simultaneous development, a flat $50 WTI price and are burdened with all development and production costs as we see them today. 
We're active in several company-operated and nonoperated joint venture development areas. We're currently running 8 drilling rigs on our operated acreage. We're standing up our ninth rig as we speak and expect to be at 10 by the end of the year. Another 10 rigs are currently drilling on our nonoperated development areas. We prioritize development areas by value, which considers expected ultimate recovery, cost of development, oil-gas split, availability of surface infrastructure and our overall certainty of outcome. 
Turning to Slide 12. To achieve strong returns, we focus on all elements necessary to generate cash flow: capital efficiency, operating expense and product realizations. The graph in the upper-right corner shows development cost per barrel, which, in our view, is the ultimate measure of capital performance as it incorporates all submetrics. We have achieved a 30% development cost reduction from 2015, fully inclusive of drilling, completions, facilities and associated G&A. We've accomplished this through a focus on improving expected ultimate recovery, driving execution efficiencies and implementing supply chain savings. This is delivering capital performance that is competitive with the operators of our joint ventures. The trend of improvement is mirrored in our overall unit operating expense. The lower right graph reflects both the downward trend and competitive performance of our direct lease operating expense and illustrates a significant reduction of 45% from 2015. Our lease operating expense includes all costs required to operate a well and its associated facilities during its life. We expect these wells to produce for decades, so attention to operating efficiency unlocks value. 
Additionally, G&A, which is not included in the graph on the lower right, is a component of overall operating expense. Our year-to-date G&A is $3.50 a barrel, declining through the year and more than 20% from 2015. 
The third critical aspect of cash flow is product realizations. We've leveraged the scale of our core positions to systematically secure cost-effective priority access through the entire crude and gas value chain rather than simply selling production at the wellhead. Because of this, we have options available to respond to changing market and industry conditions. 
Turning to Slide 13. We expect activity and production from the Permian to grow through the end of the decade. As we discussed in our Analyst Day last March, by the end of 2020, Chevron's Permian shale and tight production is expected to reach 250,000 to 350,000 barrels per day. 
As you can see on the chart, we have initiated this growth. Production continues to track ahead of expectations and is 24% higher than third quarter 2015. We continually monitor our performance and have the option to adjust the pace of our growth as needed to optimize value from this asset. While growing production is important, we're focused on expanding margins, by increasing efficiencies in our operations and on capturing maximum value from the resource base. We believe we're well positioned to make the Permian a legacy asset with strong returns and free cash flow.
I'll now hand back to Pat to discuss spend reductions. Pat?"

We continue to reduce our spend. You can see on the chart the huge progress that we've made and continue to make in curtailing our outflows. We expect 2016 combined operating expense and capital expenditure outflow",471,"Okay. Thank you, Bruce. Now on Slide 14. We continue to reduce our spend. You can see on the chart the huge progress that we've made and continue to make in curtailing our outflows. We expect 2016 combined operating expense and capital expenditure outflows to be down more than $12 billion or more than 20% from 2015. We expect to meet, if not exceed, the commitment we made earlier in the year to have 2016 operating expenses come in $2 billion lower than 2015. And our C&E is trending below the guidance range previously provided for this year. We will likely end the year below $25 billion in capital outlays; in fact, potentially coming in closer to $24 billion. This is a tremendous amount of progress in a relatively short 24-month period of time to reset these key financial parameters consistent with a lower-for-longer price environment.
Turning to Slide 15. I'd like to close with just a couple of points. First, our financial priorities have not changed. Sustaining and growing the dividend is our first priority. The increase this quarter demonstrates that commitment, which is underpinned by a confidence in our future earnings and cash flow growth. 
Second, we are beginning to see evidence of that cash flow growth. Notably now that Gorgon Train 1 is operating well and Train 2 is successfully online and with Gorgon's Train 3 and Wheatstone's Trains 1 and 2 planned to come on in fairly rapid succession over the next 5 quarters. We have approximately 85% of the production from these 5 trains sold under long-term contracts. And at today's contractual LNG prices, this represents a significant revenue and cash margin boost.
Third, we have successfully transitioned to a lower price environment. Of course, we are not resting on these recent accomplishments. We will continue to look for opportunities to improve cost and capital efficiency. We are poised to be a very resilient competitor in a low-priced world. Our Permian asset base speaks directly to this. Here, we have an abundance of riches in terms of the physical asset base, and we are successfully demonstrating the ability to develop this resource in a highly capital-efficient, returns-focused manner. 
With costs coming down, with C&E and capital intensity coming down, with our major LNG projects and the Permian production coming online to boost cash margins and production, our overall financial picture is set to improve in a meaningful way as we move into 2017. Our objective is to get cash balance in 2017 assuming $50 Brent prices. All of these improvements I have just noted, as well as targeted asset sales where we can transact for value, are key components supporting that objective.
So this concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take some questions. [Operator Instructions]

And then, I suppose, the other question there would be, just given the position you have, would you maybe consider monetizing some of the position through acreage sales or through joint ventures?"

Production's grown from the third quarter of last year by 24%, further supporting the notion that we're growing, and our pace and rate of additions are intentional. Again, we're focused on returns. I don't feel capital-limited in the Permian Basin, and our additions are targeted to ensure that we're getting the outcomes we intend and that are supportive of high returns and eventually generate -- generating free cash flow. We do expect to grow, as you noted. You can see that on Slide 13. And as we go forward, we have options. We continually monitor our performance and we adjust."

As you know, we have had a practice, when we have had pieces of our portfolio where we felt there wasn't longer-term strategic value or we felt others could -- would offer more value for it than it would obtain in our portfolio, we've been willing to make asset sales. And we've had a very routine practice of having asset sales over a long number of years here. I think the key to getting to that point in the decision process, though, is having a really good understanding of the value of the asset. And in the Permian Basin, there's been a great deal of fluidity in that evaluation over the last couple of years. There's been a great deal of additional appraisal and evaluation work, and there's been a great deal of greater understanding, but there still has been significant movement. In some cases, pieces of property have moved up by a factor of 10,000-fold. And that's the kind of thing that you would not want to get on the wrong side of it -- in your haste to make a decision about selling an asset. So our process will be to try to do evaluation and appraisal work, get a really good understanding of what this asset valuation is, and to the extent that we don't find it fitting into our longer-term development plans, then that, of course, we would look to other monetization options."

And so we're spending one and a half here. You can see us potentially doubling that. And that is kind of the current view that we have. But again, this is an area that we'll update you when we get to the March Security Analyst Meeting. In reference to FGP, the future growth project in Tengiz, I think it's important to know that we are funding both of these projects, both the Permian fully and FGP. We think of these projects, these areas as being absolutely critical growth areas for us. So we're not starving the Permian because we've taken on FGP. I think what people often miss around FGP is that there would be a tremendous loss of value if we didn't go forward with the Wellhead Pressure Management Project because the field would go into decline. It would be in serious decline, and that would be loss of value on a legacy asset. We're doing FGP and WPMP together because of synergies. It's a joint development concept. And there's a lot of upside that has not been kind of built in to a lot of people's models, I guess I would say, about FGP that relate to debottlenecking. What we've been able to demonstrate in the past, we hope to be able to do on a go-forward basis. There's additional gas-handling facilities built in here that will, over time, allow greater oil production. Contingencies, we've talked through about being kind of fully contingent even though we're at 50% of engineering when we took FID. And then, of course, down the road, obviously, we hope that this turns into concession extension. So there's a lot of potential upsides to FGP. I think Jay did a great job on our second quarter call in kind of running through all of those parameters."

The -- that original appropriation request was taken in 2011. And as you can all appreciate, the first few years of construction there was in a much more heated market. But we've talked in the past about our late module delivery, and this really was one of the primary drivers behind the cost increase. They were delayed due to poor performance at one of the fabricating yards. It came to be that the contractor was unable to effectively manage the size and the scale of the work scope that we had given that particular contractor. So we recognized that somewhat early on, and we did end up redirecting some of the work to other yards. But even so, the modules were late. A second factor that I would comment on is really an underestimation of the quantity of materials that were required. At the time we took FID on Wheatstone, we had -- engineering was at about 15% complete, and so the rest was based on rules of thumb and factors. As we matured the engineering definition, the amount of quantities needed increased substantially, and so that really was a secondary reason behind the cost increase. I would say this second element was something that we had seen on Gorgon as well, and it is one of the primary areas where we are trying to improve our project execution going forward. As you know, we had -- FGP, when we took FID on FGP, we were at about nearly a 50% engineering level.

I think, when you have such an extraordinary asset base in the Permian, when it has as much kind of depth and breadth to it, and I don't mean that in a literal sense but a figurative sense, such huge economic strength, everything in the portfolio really needs to be judged against those options. And so when I think about -- we don't believe we want to be just a single-asset class company. So we have great strategic capabilities and basin positions in the Gulf of Mexico deepwater. We have the Tengiz project that we talked about. We have the LNG projects. So we have pretty broad-based portfolio here, and we're not looking to take all activity down to the Permian. But the value of the Permian and its tremendous economic capability and its capital efficiency, its great flexibility, its short-cycle, high-return attribute does make other parts of the portfolio have to compete for capital against that. So I think it raises the bar on where that incremental dollar is going to go. And I think Permian will get the first call, but we will manage it as a portfolio. And over time, you should still expect us to have some significant other projects, but we can pace those projects quite nicely, I think, and match against -- always coming back to and matching against the opportunities that the Permian provides for us."

We have operations in both the Midland and Delaware Basin on the company-operated side and on the NOJV side as well. And the mix of activity in any particular quarter is going to cause those bars to be up and down a little bit. If we had the fourth quarter of 2015, you'd see 2 quarters where the company-operated bars are a little lower, and then the last 2 quarters where the NOJV bars are a little lower. But we would look internally in a much finer level of detail. Wolfcamp B wells in the Central Midland basin, 1.5-mile laterals, and are we comparable in that activity or not? And what do we address about that? So the overall performance is competitive, and I will tell you that there is a competitive group. There's a lead pack in the Permian, and we're a part of that. And I think the data on Slide 12 shows that, and some of the quarter-to-quarter variations are simply a function of which particular wells are completing. And because our costs include full cycle, there are facility costs in our bars in the quarter in which we start wells in a new area and have central tank batteries or other things that are being executed in that period."

We operate in a dynamic price environment and a dynamic activity environment. Over the last 2 years, we really leveraged the scale of Chevron where we have an advantage to do so. So tubulars, or the pipe that goes in the wells, is a key cost component, and Chevron buys a lot of pipe around the world. So we're able to leverage our worldwide supply chain effort to bring advantage to pricing to what we do. We also consolidate work with key suppliers -- have consolidated work to give us the right combination of unit price, execution, performance, access to technology and the ability to grow with us. And then we've put in place some contractual arrangements with unit-based fixed terms. Some are index-based, some use performance incentives, but they're all intended to keep us on the competitive side of the price curve, irrespective of what commodity prices are doing. Structurally, the things that stay with us in any price environment are multi-well pad designs, which we've done for a very long time, the acreage position that we have that allow us to drill longer lateral lengths, efficiencies in -- that we engage in on a daily basis in terms of something we call zipper fracking, where you have activities occurring simultaneously. And those will stay as regardless of what price does."

And we'll come out typically with a C&E press release after our board approves the plan. And I don't really want to get ahead of that, but obviously, all of the efficiencies -- the cost efficiencies that we've seen, Bruce just talked through some of those in his business unit, but those are going on around the globe in terms of supplier optimization, supplier rationalization and getting our supply chain costs down. That will continue, and I think we'll hold on to that. The one area where there probably is a little bit of an inflationary element will be the Permian, because that's where investment is being attracted. But when you look around the rest of the world, that is really not happening in the rest of the world. Investment is not going to those locations, so we're not seeing those kind of cost pressures.

I think our own view here is that, in the medium term here, we're potentially going to be range-bound. We are constructive on price. I mean we do think, over time here, you will -- there will be price depreciation, but we see it being relatively modest. But in the period that we're talking about here, I don't see that change -- changing our view of the $17 billion to $22 billion range being appropriate for us. You're hearing an awful lot about the Permian being one of the best investment opportunities that we have, and the great thing about that is that it's short cycle, it's high return, it's very flexible. And so that gives us -- it lowers our capital intensity, gives us greater flexibility than we have had in several years. And the only other major project that we've sanctioned at this point in time is TCO, and our share of that in terms on outflow would be in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion a year over the next few years. So we consider that to be very manageable, and that's within the $17 billion to $22 billion range that we've given you. So I think that's a reasonable range on C&E to expect for us under a regional -- a reasonable range of prices that might be anticipated."
