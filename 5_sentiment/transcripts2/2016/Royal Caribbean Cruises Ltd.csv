As you may heard from Jason's voice, he has a cold this morning. So I'll use this opportunity to wish him a speedy recovery and ask him to sit on the other side of the room.
In any event, I'm pleased to have this opportunity to share more about our results in 2015 and our outlook as we entered 2016.
I admit that it is very satisfying to look back on 2015 and I'd like to take just a moment to celebrate a successful year.
On the revenue side, we achieved our target of 3.5% yield improvement, despite microeconomic and geopolitical challenges that threatened to take us off course. 
I said it before and it still holds true that while many factors may cause disturbances for short periods, our team has shown a very strong capability to make adjustments when circumstances change.
On the cost side, our team worked very hard to control this and we ended the year down 0.6%. We began the year expecting cost to be up 1% or less, where our finance organization and our operations team worked collaboratively to find further efficiencies and our working dollars. 
Looking at the full picture, we anticipated doubling our 2013 earnings per share and we exceeded that target by $0.03 a share at $4.83. The brands in delivering and I congratulate all the employees of our company who worked so hard to make this happen.
It's equally gratifying to note that along with the financial success that we're enjoying, our surveys indicate that the highest levels of employee engagement in our company's history.
Our annual survey had participation levels and indicated higher satisfaction across all categories. We firmly believe that happy employees lead to happy guests and that in turn leads to better yields.
This past year, we took a significant forward -- a significant step forward on this front by establishing hospitality training schools like the one in Tianjin China. This school teaches the art and the science of hospitality, that's an exciting challenge when most of the students have never themselves stayed in a hotel.
The development of this school marks another important step in further deepening our roots with the local community in Mainland, China, as it is a strategy partnership with the Tianjin Maritime College.
In July, we opened the second training school in Indonesia, and in May of 2016, we will open further school in Philippines.
Not only will these schools provide a stream of over 5,000 high-quality employees each year, they provide these individuals the opportunity to join in brand traveling all over the world and improving their community.
We also took a big step forward in our efforts to ensure the long-term health of the oceans by entering into a five-year global partnership with World Wide Life Fund. Our business depends on the health of the oceans, and we feel responsibility to uphold the highest standards of environmental stewardship.
Our partnership with WWF takes our efforts even further by setting specific and measurable targets for carbon emissions, sustainable seafood and destinations to stewardship.
We're serious about looking at our environment and our communities and I'm very pleased to join with the partner, equally passionate about these causes.
Turning to another topic, which we feel passionate about, Double-Double  remains through which we view all our decision-making at Royal Caribbean. Every employee can describe the program. Double 2014 earnings per share and double-digit ROIC by 2017.
As we look at our trajectory, 2015 paved the wave nicely, and the results we were anticipating during 2016 will keep us solidly on our path Double-Double.
The 2 key components of Double-Double to achieving our goals are growing revenue yields and maintaining cost discipline.
From a yield standpoint, our new buildings are attracting and maintaining strong pricing premiums.
Quantum of the Seas in Shanghai above the market and the innovative amenities that distinguish Quantum  are the exact same ones that will make Ovation of the Seas in Tianjin unique in that new market for her.
Finally, after 5 years, we welcoming the third vessel in our Oasis-class, Harmony of the Seas. We've seen the power of the Oasis-class and the longevity of its popularity. Early indications are the Harmony will not disappoint either.
In addition to our new builds outstanding performance, our existing fleet provides returns consistent with our needs of Double-Double.
At the same time, we're continually learning ways to enhance onboard revenue and apply these learnings to the existing fleet to continue to grow revenue yields there as well.
From a cost standpoint, our commitment to cost control remains steadfast. It's an extraordinary coincidence that in both of the past 2 years, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, ended up down 0.6%.
This cost control is not come easy, but we intend to continue to be disciplined in line with our Double-Double targets, but also keeping firmly in mind the strategic needs of the company for the ensuing period.
While I'm pleased to look back on the success of 2015, I'm eager to move on to 2016 and the great things to come.
Our metric indicate that we're still on course for our Double-Double targets, we remain in the solid book position, roughly equal to last year's record levels and at higher rates.
We're currently in the middle of our WAVE Period as I think you all know, and we're happy to report that it is proving to be a solid wave, as we have seen geopolitical concerns can also threaten the demand environment from time-to-time.
These to pockets of our portfolio and we generally manage through them.
It's important to note that when demand in one area of the globe is weaker, many times there's an increase in demand for other destinations. Our intent is to maximize the overall portfolio and we see that as one of the benefits of being a global player.
Although, the current strength of the overall market is a key driver, we attribute part of our favorable book position to our price integrity policy. As a reminder, our price integrity policy is our determination to avoid the common prior practice of implementing dramatic last-minute discounts, which cheapen our brand and upset our loyal customers.
The policy says that we will not implement any new discounts during the last weeks before selling with the time period varying by the length of the cruise. We first started this policy about a year ago, and we've made a number of tweaks to it as we perfected our formula.
In December, we decided to make the policy even clearer and broader. It continues to apply in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Ireland. Altogether, by the way those represent more than 2/3 of our revenue.
But we did decide that having different rules for different itinerary links was possibly confusing and definitely unnecessary.
We have therefore expanded the policy to make the know new discount period consistently 30 days regardless of itinerary.
The only exception continues to be 3- or 4-night sailings which are traditionally late bookers.
All of this makes the policy easier to understand and to implement.
We are strong believer that clarity and specificity in the program like this is important, because otherwise, the exceptions undermine the integrity of the program even if they are, in fact, very rare.
We now think we've got it right and we do not expect more changes in the near future.
At this time, we've had our policy in place for almost a year, and we have a better view of the results.
During this time, we have granted no exceptions to the policies since its adoption, and we have no intention of doing so now. Nevertheless, we've seen a double-digit percentage improvement in the booking window over this period and we believe that the policy help solidify brand preference.
An unforeseen benefit, we have found is the reduced number of bookings taken in a discount before we get to the focus period.
Living the spirit of the policy is helped our revenue managers make better pricing decisions, and it has been roundly applauded by the travel agents that are so central to our success.
When we introduced the policy, we'd transparent with you all that the upfront cost would result from some cabins going empty rather than being filled at deep last minute discounts. We know that in 2016, we will still see some residual impact leading to these empty cabins, but by 2017, we feel comfortable that the impact will be positive.
One last point I would like to touch on before turning it back to Jason is our share repurchase program. As you will recall, we announced a repurchase program during our call last October. That full program totals $500 million. Of the total, $200 million was part of an accelerated repurchase program, which we have completed. We expect to continue to purchase opportunistically throughout the year 2016 until before $500 million is completed. 
With that, it's a pleasure turn it back to Jason."

I will begin by taking you through our results for the fourth quarter.We have summarized our fourth quarter results on Slide 2. For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $0.94 per share, which was $0.04 above our guidance.",1733,"Thank you, Richard. I will begin by taking you through our results for the fourth quarter.
We have summarized our fourth quarter results on Slide 2. For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $0.94 per share, which was $0.04 above our guidance. 
Net revenue yields were up 4.9%, which was at the high-end of our expectations. A combination of new hardware, a stronger Caribbean and a successful new winter season in China helped drive the robust year-over-year improvement. Costs were 70 basis points better than guidance for the quarter, with net cruise costs, excluding fuel, down 4.7%.
I will now discuss full year results, which we've summarized on Slide 3. This year, we had record earnings and exceeded the $1 billion market. Adjusted net income was $1.07 billion, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $4.83. These record earnings also mark a second consecutive year of 40-plus percent growth in earnings.
Revenue yields increased 3.5% for the full year.
Yield improvements in the Caribbean, Europe and China more than offset weakness in Latin America.
Onboard revenue yield did not disappoint with a year-over-year improvement of 4%. The combination of new hardware, more onboard revenue venues on our upgraded ships and VOOM, the drove the majority of this improvement. We delivered a second consecutive year of costs improvement on a per unit with net cruise costs, excluding fuel, down 0.6%.
These costs improvements occurred in nonguests areas, mainly through identifying further synergies amongst our brands and leveraging scale in our back office.
Now I'd like to update you on what we're seeing in the demand environment. I will start by taking you through first quarter trends. 63% of Q1 capacity is in the Caribbean, 23% is in the Asia Pacific region and approximately 11% is in Brazil and Latin America.
The quarter as a whole has booked ahead of last year in both load factor and rate. Overall, we're seeing strong yield trends in Q1, driven by a significant year-over-year improvement in Caribbean and the addition of the winter China season. The strength of these 2 products is more than offsetting ongoing price and pressures in Latin America and Australia.
The WAVE Period is off to a good start with bookings for Q2 to Q4 sailings trending similarly to last year's level. As we entered Wave, we had significantly fewer staterooms left to sell on first quarter sailings in last year. 
So as expected, bookings for the first quarter have been lower than last year. For the full year, we're booked at a similar load factor to last year's record high and at a higher
 
Capacity is increasing 6.3% year-over-year as we welcome Harmony of the Seas and Ovation of the Seas into the fleet this spring.
The majority of our capacity growth is in the Asia Pacific region with the balance mostly in the Caribbean.
capacity will be up about 4% year-over-year as the product benefits from an upgrade hardware. In addition to Anthem of the Seas in the North East, we'll have a least 2 Oasis-class ships in the Caribbean in each quarter. We're also moderately increasing capacity in Europe driven by a handful of sailings on Ovation of the Seas before she began her journey to China. 
Once she arrives in China, Ovation will contribute to our 33% capacity growth in the Asia Pacific region. On the other hand, we've significantly scaled back our capacity in Brazil and Latin America. While these products will account for approximately 11% our capacity  in the first quarter, they will be reduced to less than 2% for the remainder of the year.
We're seeing particular strength from the North American consumer and our Caribbean and Alaska products are currently booked at record low factors. The Caribbean  accounts for 43% of our 2016 capacity and has booked ahead of same time last year in both load factor and rate.
Our Caribbean product consists of a wide variety of itineraries, ranging from weekend getaways to 14-night selling Caribbean  sailings. In general, we're seeing better trends than last year across Caribbean itineraries with 7-night and shorter sailings showing the most strength.
Overall, we're expecting mid-single digit yield growth for the Caribbean.
Alaska has booked nicely ahead of last year in both rate and volume, despite a 6% year-over-year increase in capacity. We anticipate mid-single-digit yield growth and what is expected to be a record-breaking year for the product.
Europe itineraries account for about 21% of our 2016 capacity. Although booked load factors for the product is slightly lower than same time last year's record levels, recent trends have been quite strong and load factor remains nicely higher than at this point in all other previous years.
We did experience a softening in North American demand for a short period after the Paris attacks in November. And there was a minor drop in bookings from European sourced markets. Demand quickly returned to typical levels, although pricing remains a low same time last year for Eastern Mediterranean sailings.
Prices for like hardware for Europe are up slightly versus same time last year. Overall, we're expecting a low single-digit yield decline for our European itineraries, primarily driven by hardware changes and pricing pressure and itinerary modifications that relate to be Eastern Mediterranean.
Asia Pacific itineraries will account for 19% of our 2016 capacity, following significant growth in both Australia and China. Yields for the Asia Pacific product as a whole are expected to be up low single digits, driven mainly by our increasing capacity and the high-yield in China market.
For the first time, we'll offer a year round china product as Quantum of the Seas make Shanghai her home for the full year. Her sister ship Ovation of the Seas will drive the remainder of our China capacity growth after she arrives in Tianjin at the end of June.
Significant industry capacity growth combined with the expansion of the season into off-peak periods and embarkation points -- ports has led us to forecast a low single-digit yield decline for China in 2016.
Nevertheless, China is expected to remain one of our highest yielding itineraries and is contributing to the company's overall yield growth.
The pricing environment in Australia remains a bit of a challenge given ongoing capacity growth in the region and the weakening of the Australian dollar. While Australia continues to deliver a strong seasonal yield, we expect yield in Australia to be flat to slightly down for the year.
Before getting into our 2016 guidance, I wanted to reiterate some of our previous comments we made during our last earnings call that relate to Pullmantur.
As a result of these -- of our rightsizing efforts, we expect to incur restructuring and related costs in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 per share during 2016. 
Additionally, as previously discussed, we intend on eliminating Pullmantur's two-month accounting lag during the first quarter of 2016. This change will result in a 14-month reporting period for Pullmantur this year with an estimated earnings per share by $0.10. 
For simplification and comparative purposes, we will be excluding all of these one-time adjustments from our key statistics. Hence, our GAAP earnings in 2016 will be slightly lower for these adjustments.
In all this into account, if you turn to Slide 4, you will see our guidance for 2016. This will be the second full year on our path towards Double-Double and our results remain on track. 
Net yields are expected to be up for the seventh consecutive year, with yield increasing 2% to 4%. Strong trends from North American products, additional capacity in the Asia Pacific region and another year of strong onboard revenue are expected to drive this improvement.
On the onboard side, new hardware and upgrades to our existing ships, a greater mix of capacity in Asia and further expansion of VOOM is expected to deliver another step change in shipboard revenue yield.
Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up 1% or less for the full year. While the full year demonstrates our cost discipline, the cadence of expenses through the year is linear. For example, our ddrydock in 2016 are concentrated in the first and fourth quarter. 
In addition, you will recall that in the second quarter of last year, we made investments in the China market to support Quantum of the Seas. This year, these investments are being made slightly earlier to support our year around China presence, Ovation of the Seas of arrival and to grow our Asia market footprint.
This is resulting in a shift and spend into the first quarter.
We anticipate fuel expense of $716 million for the year, and we're 66% hedged. Over the past several months, fuel prices have significantly weakened, while the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen versus our currencies. 
The combination of these 2 factors has resulted in a $0.14 per share headwind to 2016 earnings. Additionally, the recent rise in interest rates has impacted our 2016 earnings by $0.06 per share.
Based on current fuel prices, currency exchange rates and interest rates, we expect another record-breaking year with earnings per share between $5.90 and $6.10 per share.
The midpoint of this guidance represents a year-over-year increase of 24%, which comes on the heels of more than 40% growth delivered in each of the past 2 years.
Now I would like to walk you through our first quarter guidance on Slide 5. Net yields are expected to be up approximately 4% for the first quarter, driven by a strong Caribbean and the continuation of the winter season for Quantum in China. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up in the range of 4.5% to 5%, driven by a combination of factors. 
We're setting the groundwork for 2 new ships -- 2 new ship entries later this year, while also maximizing the moment of new marketing campaigns for our 2 largest brands during Wave.
Additionally, we will be investing earlier this year in Asia, as we look to continue to expand our leadership position in the market and diversify our channel mix.
As I mentioned earlier, much of this spend has been concentrated in the first quarter due to timing. Taking all this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the quarter to be approximately $0.30. 
With that, I would ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session."

Just to correct one point, the yields are down in China this year '16 versus '15 based upon all of the different elements that we just talked about. With regards to charter companies, it's quite a mix in relation to our total distribution, but over time obviously, we're being changing the mix of our distribution and we continue that journey. So literally every single year, we're doubling the number of agents selling Royal Caribbean in the China market. And of course, we're broadening regional footprint, especially, now with the introduction of Ovation in Tianjin. So it's true that some of the charter companies really out of Shanghai had some challenges in '15 in relation to in Korea and of course, the typhoon season, which was particularly difficult. And so some of the charters did experience some losses during some of the sailings, but having said that, they did particularly well the rest of the year with Royal Caribbean and have done well with Royal Caribbean over the past 9 years that we've been in the market. So there was a bit of a hiccup and of course, we -- as we are in The United States, we're long-term partners with our travel partners. So we've worked hard it finding some workarounds with them in terms our '16 inventory and how we work with them in terms of our cooperative marketing and this type of thing. So we feel that we've been very responsive to some of the feedback that we've had from some of these chartes. And we think we're in a fairly good position for '16. With regards to the differentiation of the brands, that's, I think, a highly relevant question. When you look at Royal Caribbean against the competition, we have been in the market now for 9 years and we've been investing over a 9-year period in the market. We have the newest hardware in the key ports, Quantum of the Seas has been a huge hit Shanghai, Ovation coming into Tianjin is doing very well. We have 8 consecutive years of being the top cruise line in China awarded by the Travel Trade Gazette and the Travel Weekly. We've been focused on launching consumer campaigns and we're -- in fact, we're launching a new campaign literally in the coming weeks. We've been working on expanding our distribution footprint and of course, we're the largest single cruise brand in China with a really professional and competent sales organization and marketing team who really have been with us for quite some time. So I think the spread between Royal Caribbean, international and the competing brands in the market is quite significant and a lot of that is driven by the hardware, Quantum and Ovation world-class leading hardware and they are the only brand-new ships in the China market."

There are a lot of headwinds in costs in 2016. Obviously, as we spend on mix into Asia, the cost of operating there is higher and some more upfront cost in the sales and marketing side as we're delivering 2 new ships this year. And also having VOOM, the fastest Internet bandwidth at Sea also has a high cost to it. So there are a lot of headwinds, but our efforts to try to continue to identify opportunity is never ending, but I think we think the 1% of less guidance is really our best view based all of our plans that we have to date to manage cost-effectively in 2016."

I do think that the Jason's focus on this is very helpful, but all of our leaders here Adam, Lisa, Michael, the others are really very focused on it. I'd also just maybe take the opportunity and talk a little bit about the timing of it during the year. You know I've said this in previous calls, we manage on an annual basis, and one thing that's unique about our business that I think distinguishes us from many others is that we have some significant big cost that we can shift around in terms of timing. So we would look at a booking pattern to say whether we order drydock ship in March or April, or September or October or what you have, and when we make those decisions, we simply don't pay attention internally to whether that falls at this quarter or that quarter, but those kinds of what we think of those as immaterial tweaking to get the best outcome, particularly, as it relates, for example, if I take a dry docking, we might find that for whatever reason, we were just booking better at the end of September than early October and we would just decide to shift drydock by if 1 quarter into another. From an operating point of view, they're I immaterial and those kinds of changes can actually help us in bringing our overall cost number down. But I fully recognize that as it relates to the individual quarters, they will distort the numbers. And unfortunately, that's simply a fact of life and we think our best strategy is to continue to focus on the year, we want to -- if it's cheaper for us to do in the March than April, we will do it in March rather than in April and the Double-Double, and so Double-Double has really been very helpful. You talked about our cost containment over the last number of years now, the Double-Double is actually a very helpful concept if everybody can focus on it and move towards that common goal. So I think that's why we had the results that we've had, but I do acknowledge it does relate to bumps in any given quarter or period."

The mix between ticketing onboard is actually pretty similar. You would index a little bit higher on the onboard side because you have Quantum coming in to the market. Now the point on profitability of the Chinese guests, it is still very much there. China is one of our highest yielding markets, the Quantum is one of our highest yielding products. It does -- it's a little bit more expensive to operate, but it also we get yields for those products. So it is very much contributing to our yields and it is very much contributing to our profits and our margins and our business, and I think our -- which is why our outlook continues to be very favorable for the Chinese market."

Yes, we think the cost performance has been excellent for a number of years now and we're quite proud of the work. And I think the fact that it comes at the same time that our level of guest satisfaction goes up as it's important feature for us because I think it's actually relatively easy to cut cost, if you don't care about the products to deliver to your guests, but we have been raising guest satisfaction while we've been cutting cost, and as you say this level of cost discipline is actually quite good. There are couple of things. One, we'll take credit for which is that we -- I think the management team has done a really very good job of looking for new ways of doing things, new efficiencies, et cetera. The other is and we did telegraph this when we're doing it, which is that we spend money which we thought would result in savings later on. And so -- and we talked about some of those things, we talked about the IT spending, we talked about some of the other stuff that we would doing, and so I think that also helps us a little bit by comparison. So -- but we're not resting on our that, we think there is more to be done continual efficiencies because even the guidance we've given, which now is for 2016, up marginally. Obviously, the inflation in the areas that we're looking at is higher than that. The answer to your second question was the compensation, yes. Our compensation is all the management teams compensation has a number of factors. One of which is, specifically, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, but on the other hand, another one of which is net revenue yields, another one is safety and environment. So we're trying to make sure that we're meeting our cost goals, our revenue goals, but also not doing things that put us in risk. This is a long-term business and we've worked hard to put Royal Caribbean in a position where it is solid on, if you will bottom line as well as just the earnings per share. I'm going to let Jason handle the last of those questions."

As you may have heard from Jason's voice, he has a cold this morning. So I'll use this opportunity to wish him a speedy recovery and ask him to sit on the other side of the room.
In any event, I'm pleased to have this opportunity to share more about our results in 2015 and our outlook as we enter 2016.
I admit that it's very satisfying to look back on 2015, and I'd like to take just a moment to celebrate a successful year.
On the revenue side, we achieved our target of 3.5% yield improvement, despite microeconomic and geopolitical challenges that threatened to take us off course. 
I said it before and it still holds true that while many factors may cause disturbances for short periods, our team has shown a very strong capability to make adjustments when circumstances change.
On the cost side, our team worked very hard to control this, and we ended the year down 0.6%. We began the year expecting cost to be up 1% or less, but our finance organization and our operations team worked collaboratively to find further efficiencies and husband our working dollars. 
Looking at the full picture, we anticipated doubling our 2013 earnings per share, and we exceeded that target by $0.03 a share at $4.83. The brands are delivering, and I congratulate all the employees of our company who worked so hard to make this happen.
It's equally gratifying to note that along with the financial success that we're enjoying, our surveys indicate that the highest levels of employee engagement in our company's history. Our annual survey had participation levels and indicated higher satisfaction across all categories. We firmly believe that happy employees lead to happy guests and that in turn leads to better yields.
This past year, we took a significant forward -- a significant step forward on this front by establishing hospitality training schools, like the one in Tianjin, China. This school teaches the art and the science of hospitality. That's an exciting challenge, when most of the students have never themselves stayed in a hotel.
The development of this school marks another important step in further deepening our roots with the local community in Mainland China, as it is a strategy partnership with the state-owned Tianjin Maritime College.
In July, we opened the second training school in Lombok, Indonesia. And in May of 2016, we will open further school in Pasig, Philippines.
Not only will these schools provide a stream of over 5,000 high-quality employees each year, they provide these individuals the opportunity to join in international brand, traveling all over the world and improving their community.
We also took a big step forward in our efforts to ensure the long-term health of the oceans by entering into a five-year global partnership with World Wildlife Fund. Our business depends on the health of the oceans, and we feel the responsibility to uphold the highest standards of environmental stewardship.
Our partnership with WWF takes our efforts even further by setting specific and measurable targets for carbon emissions, sustainable seafood and destinations to stewardship. We're serious about looking at our environment and our communities, and I'm very pleased to join with the partner equally passionate about these causes.
Turning to another topic, which we feel passionate about, Double-Double remains the lens through which we view all our decision making at Royal Caribbean. Every employee can describe the program. Double 2014 earnings per share and double-digit ROIC by 2017. As we look in our trajectory, 2015 paved the wave nicely, and the results we were anticipating during 2016 will keep us solidly on our path towards Double-Double.
The 2 key components of Double-Double to achieving our goals are: Growing revenue yields and maintaining cost discipline. From a yield standpoint, our new buildings are attracting and maintaining strong pricing premiums.
Quantum of the Seas in Shanghai is head and shoulders above the market, and the innovative amenities that distinguish Quantum are the exact same ones that will make Ovation of the Seas in Tianjin unique in that new market for her.
Finally, after 5 years, we're welcoming the third vessel in our Oasis class, Harmony of the Seas. We've seen the power of the Oasis class and the longevity of its popularity. Early indications are that Harmony will not disappoint either.
In addition to our new builds outstanding performance, our existing fleet provides returns, consistent with our needs of Double-Double. At the same time, we're continually learning ways to enhance onboard revenue and apply these learnings to the existing fleet to continue to grow revenue yields there as well.
From a cost standpoint, our commitment to cost control remains steadfast. It's an extraordinary coincidence that in both of the past 2 years, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, ended up down 0.6%.
This cost control does not come easy, but we intend to continue to be disciplined in line with our Double-Double targets, but also keeping firmly in mind the strategic needs of the company from the ensuing period.
While I'm pleased to look back on the success of 2015, I'm eager to move on to 2016 and the great things to come. Our metric indicate that we are still on course for our Double-Double targets. We'll remain in the solid book position, roughly equal to last year's record levels and at higher rates.
We're currently in the middle of our WAVE Period as I think you all know, and we're happy to report that it is proving to be a solid wave. As we have seen, geopolitical concerns can also threaten the demand environment from time-to-time. These threats are generally limited to pockets of our portfolio, and we generally manage through them.
It is important to note that when demand in one area of the globe is weaker, many times there is an increase in demand for other destinations. Our intent is to maximize the overall portfolio, and we see that as one of the benefits of being a global player.
Although the current strength of the overall market is a key driver, we attribute part of our favorable book position to our price integrity policy. As a reminder, our price integrity policy is our determination to avoid the common prior practice of implementing dramatic last-minute discounts, which cheapen our brand and upset our loyal customers.
The policy says that we will not implement any new discounts during the last weeks before sailing, with the time period varying by the length of the cruise. We first started this policy about a year ago, and we've made a number of tweaks to it as we perfected our formula.
In December, we decided to make the policy even clearer and broader. It continues to apply in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Ireland. Altogether by the way, those represent more than 2/3 of our revenue. But we did decide that having different rules for different itinerary lengths was possibly confusing and definitely unnecessary.
We have, therefore, expanded the policy to make the no-new discount period consistently 30 days, regardless of itinerary. The only exception continues to be 3- or 4-night sailings, which are traditionally late bookers. All of this makes the policy easier to understand and to implement.
We are a strong believer that clarity and specificity in the program like this is important because otherwise, the exceptions undermine the integrity of the program even if they are, in fact, very rare. We now think we've got it right, and we do not expect more changes in the near future. At this time, we had our policy in place for almost a year, and we have a better view of the results.
During this time, we have granted no exceptions to the policies, since its adoption, and we have no intention of doing so now. Nevertheless, we've seen a double-digit percentage improvement in the booking window over this period, and we believe that the policy helped solidify brand preference.
An unforeseen benefit we have found is the reduced number of bookings taken at a discount before we get to the focus period. Living the spirit of the policy has helped our revenue managers make better pricing decisions, and it has been roundly applauded by the travel agents that are so central to our success.
When we introduced the policy, we were transparent with you all that an upfront cost would result from some cabins going empty rather than being filled at deep last-minute discounts. We know that in 2016, we will still see some residual impact relating to these empty cabins, but by 2017, we feel comfortable that the impact will be positive.
One last point I would like to touch on before turning it back to Jason is our share repurchase program. As you will recall, we announced a repurchase program during our call last October. That full program totals $500 million. Of the total, $200 million was part of an accelerated purchase program, which we have completed. We expect to continue to purchase opportunistically throughout the year 2016 until before $500 million is completed. 
With that, it's pleasure to turn it back to Jason."

I will begin by taking you through our results for the fourth quarter. We have summarized our fourth quarter results on Slide 2.
For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $0.94 per share, which was $0.04 above our guidance. Net revenue yields were up 4.9%, which were at the high end of our expectations. A combination of new hardware, a stronger Caribbean and a successful new winter season in China helped drive the robust year-over-year improvement. Costs were 70 basis points better than guidance for the quarter, with net cruise costs, excluding fuel, down 4.7%.
I will now discuss full year results, which we've summarized on Slide 3. This year, we had record earnings and exceeded the $1 billion mark. Adjusted net income was $1.07 billion, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $4.83. These record earnings also mark a second consecutive year of 40-plus percent growth in earnings.
Revenue yields increased 3.5% for the full year. Yield improvements in the Caribbean, Europe and China more than offset weakness in Latin America. Onboard revenue yield did not disappoint, with a year-over-year improvement of 4%. The combination of new hardware, more onboard revenue venues on our upgraded ships and VOOM, the fastest Internet at sea, drove the majority of this improvement.
We delivered a second consecutive year of cost improvement on a per unit basis, with net cruise costs, excluding fuel, down 0.6%. These costs improvements occurred in nonguest-facing areas, mainly through identifying further synergies amongst our brands and leveraging scale in our back office.
Now I'd like to update you on what we are seeing in a demand environment. I will start by taking you through first quarter trends. 63% of Q1 capacity is in the Caribbean, 23% is in the Asia Pacific region and approximately 11% is in Brazil and Latin America.
The quarter as a whole is booked ahead of last year in both load factor and rate. Overall, we are seeing strong yield trends in Q1, driven by a significant year-over-year improvement in Caribbean pricing and the addition of the winter China season. The strength of these 2 products is more than offsetting ongoing pricing pressures in Latin America and Australia.
The WAVE Period is off to a good start, with bookings for Q2 to Q4 sailings trending similarly to last year's level. As we entered WAVE, we had significantly fewer staterooms left to sell on first quarter sailings in last year. So as expected, bookings for the first quarter have been lower than last year. For the full year, we are booked at a similar load factor to last year's record high and at a higher APD.
 
Capacity is increasing 6.3% year-over-year as we welcome Harmony of the Seas and Ovation of the Seas into the fleet this spring. The majority of our capacity growth is in the Asia Pacific region, with the balance mostly in the Caribbean.
Caribbean capacity will be up about 4% year-over-year as the product benefits from an upgrade in hardware. In addition to Anthem of the Seas in the Northeast, we will have the least 2 Oasis-class ships in the Caribbean in each quarter. We are also moderately increasing capacity in Europe, driven by a handful of sailings on Ovation of the Seas before she begins her journey to China. 
Once she arrives in China, Ovation will contribute to a 33% capacity growth in the Asia Pacific region. On the other hand, we have significantly scaled back our capacity in Brazil and Latin America. While these products will account for approximately 11% of our capacity in the first quarter, they will be reduced to less than 2% for the remainder of the year.
We are seeing particular strength from the North American consumer, and our Caribbean and Alaska products are currently booked at record load factors. The Caribbean accounts for 43% of our 2016 capacity and has booked ahead of same time last year in both load factor and rate.
Our Caribbean product consists of a wide variety of itineraries, ranging from weekend getaways to 14-night Southern Caribbean sailings. In general, we are seeing better trends than last year across Caribbean itineraries, with 7-night and shorter sailings showing the most strength. Overall, we are expecting mid-single-digit yield growth for the Caribbean.
Alaska has booked nicely ahead of last year in both rate and volume, despite a 6% year-over-year increase in capacity. We anticipate mid-single-digit yield growth in what is expected to be a record-breaking year for the product.
Europe itineraries account for about 21% of our 2016 capacity. Although booked load factors for the product is slightly lower than same time last year's record levels, recent trends have been quite strong and load factor remains nicely higher than at this point in all other previous years.
We did experience a softening in North American demand for a short period after the Paris attacks in November, and there was a minor drop in bookings from European-sourced markets. Demand quickly returned to typical levels, although pricing remains below same time last year for Eastern Mediterranean sailings.
Prices for like hardware for the rest of Europe are up slightly versus same time last year. Overall, we are expecting a low single-digit yield decline for our European itineraries, primarily driven by hardware changes and pricing pressure and itinerary modifications that relate to the Eastern Mediterranean.
Asia Pacific itineraries will account for 19% of our 2016 capacity, following significant growth in both Australia and China. Yields for the Asia Pacific product as a whole are expected to be up low single digits, driven mainly by our increasing capacity and the high yield in China market.
For the first time, we will offer a year-round China product as Quantum of the Seas makes Shanghai her home for the full year. Her sister ship, Ovation of the Seas, will drive the remainder of our China capacity growth after she arrives in Tianjin at the end of June.
Significant industry capacity growth combined with the expansion of the season into off-peak periods and second-tier embarkation points -- ports has led us to forecast a low single-digit yield decline for China in 2016. Nevertheless, China is expected to remain one of our highest-yielding itineraries and is contributing to the company's overall yield growth.
The pricing environment in Australia remains a bit of a challenge, given ongoing capacity growth in the region and the weakening of the Australian dollar. While Australia continues to deliver a strong seasonal yield, we expect yields in Australia to be flat to slightly down for the year.
Before getting into our 2016 guidance, I wanted to reiterate some of our previous comments we made during our last earnings call that relate to Pullmantur.
As a result of these -- of our rightsizing efforts, we expect to incur restructuring and related costs in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 per share during 2016. Additionally, as previously discussed, we intend on eliminating Pullmantur's 2-month accounting lag during the first quarter of 2016. This change will result in a 14-month reporting period for Pullmantur this year with an estimated to impact our earnings per share by $0.10. 
For simplification and comparative purposes, we will be excluding all of these onetime adjustments from our key statistics. Hence, our GAAP earnings in 2016 will be slightly lower for these adjustments.
Taking all this into account, if you turn to Slide 4, you will see our guidance for 2016. This will be the second full year on our path towards Double-Double, and our results remain on track. 
Net yields are expected to be up for the seventh consecutive year, with yields increasing 2% to 4%. Strong trends from North American products, additional capacity in the Asia Pacific region and another year of strong onboard revenue are expected to drive this improvement.
On the onboard side, new hardware and upgrades to our existing ships, a greater mix of capacity in Asia and further expansion of VOOM is expected to deliver another step change in shipboard revenue yield.
Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up 1% or less for the full year. While the full year demonstrates our cost discipline, the cadence of expenses through the year is not linear. For example, our drydocks in 2016 are concentrated in the first and fourth quarter. 
In addition, you will recall that in the second quarter of last year, we made investments in the China market to support Quantum of the Seas. This year, these investments are being made slightly earlier to support our year-round China presence, Ovation of the Seas of arrival and to grow our Asia market footprint. This is resulting in a shift in spend into the first quarter.
We anticipate fuel expense of $716 million for the year, and we are 66% hedged. Over the past several months, fuel prices have significantly weakened, while the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen versus our basket of currencies. The combination of these 2 factors has resulted in a $0.14 per share headwind to 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ] earnings. Additionally, the recent rise in interest rates has impacted our 2016 earnings by $0.06 per share.
Based on current fuel prices, currency exchange rates and interest rates, we expect another record-breaking year with earnings per share between $5.90 and $6.10 per share. The midpoint of this guidance represents a year-over-year increase of 24%, which comes on the heels of more than 40% growth delivered in each of the past 2 years.
Now I would like to walk you through our first quarter guidance on Slide 5. Net yields are expected to be up approximately 4% for the first quarter, driven by a strong Caribbean and the continuation of the winter season for Quantum in China. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up in the range of 4.5% to 5%, driven by a combination of factors. 
We are setting the groundwork for 2 new ships -- 2 new ship entries later this year, while also maximizing the momentum of new marketing campaigns for our 2 largest brands during WAVE. Additionally, we will be investing earlier this year in Asia, as we look to continue to expand our leadership position in the market and diversify our channel mix. As I mentioned earlier, much of this spend has been concentrated in the first quarter due to timing. Taking all this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the quarter to be approximately $0.30. 
With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session."

I was just wondering whether or not that's actually true and if there are issues, what is Royal Caribbean doing, if anything, to fix that?

Just to correct one point, the yields are slightly down in China this year '16 versus '15 based upon all of the different elements that we just talked about. With regards to charter companies, it's quite a mix in relation to our total distribution, but over time, obviously, we're being changing the mix of our distribution, and we continue that journey. So literally, every single year, we're doubling the number of agents who are selling Royal Caribbean in the China market. And of course, we're broadening regional footprint, especially, now with the introduction of Ovation in Tianjin. So it's true that some of the charter companies really out of Shanghai had some challenges in '15 in relation to MERS in Korea and, of course, the typhoon season, which was particularly difficult. And so some of the charters did experience some losses during some of the sailings. But having said that, they did particularly well the rest of the year with Royal Caribbean and have done well with Royal Caribbean over the past 9 years that we've been in the market. So it was a bit of a hiccup, and of course, we -- as we are in The United States, we're long-term partners with our travel partners. So we've worked hard at finding some workarounds with them in terms our '16 inventory and how we work with them in terms of our cooperative marketing and this type of thing. So we feel that we've been very responsive to some of the feedback that we've had from some of these charters. And we think we're in a fairly good position for '16. With regards to the differentiation of the brands, that's, I think, a highly relevant question. When you look at Royal Caribbean against the competition, we have been in the market now for 9 years, and we've been investing over a 9-year period in the market. We have the newest hardware in the key ports. Quantum of the Seas genuinely has been a huge hit out of Shanghai, Ovation coming into Tianjin is doing very well. We have 8 consecutive years of being the top cruise line in China awarded by the Travel Trade Gazette and the Travel Weekly. We've been focused on launching consumer campaigns, and we -- in fact, we're launching a new campaign literally in the coming weeks. We've been working on expanding our distribution footprint. And of course, we are the largest single cruise brand in China with a really professional and competent sales organization and marketing team, who really have been with us for quite some time. So I think the spread between Royal Caribbean International and the competing brands in the market is quite significant. And a lot of that is driven by the hardware, Quantum and Ovation world-class leading hardware, and they are the only brand-new ships in the China market."

And so that's -- that is ongoing and continuing. There are a lot of headwinds in costs in 2016. Obviously, as we spend on mix into Asia, the cost of operating there is higher and some more upfront costs in the sales and marketing side as we're delivering 2 new ships this year. And also, having VOOM, the fastest Internet bandwidth at Sea also has a high cost to it. So there are a lot of headwinds, but our efforts to try to continue to identify opportunity is never ending.

I do think that the Jason's focus on this is very helpful, but all of our leaders here Adam, Lisa, Michael, the others are really very focused on it. I'd also just maybe take the opportunity and talk a little bit about the timing of it during the year. You know I've said this in previous calls, we manage on an annual basis. And one thing that's a little unique about our business is I think distinguishes us from many others is that we have some significant big costs that we can shift around in terms of timing. So we would look at a booking pattern to say whether we ought to drydock a ship in March or April, or September or October or what have you. And when we make those decisions, we simply don't pay attention internally to whether that falls in this quarter or that quarter, but those kinds of what we think of those as immaterial tweaking to get the best outcome, particularly as it relates, for example, if I take a drydocking, we might find that for whatever reason, we were just booking better at the end of September than early October, and we would just decide to shift drydock by one quarter into another. From an operating point of view, they're immaterial. And those kinds of changes can actually help us in bringing our overall cost number down. But I fully recognize that as it relates to individual quarters, they will distort the numbers. And unfortunately, that's simply a fact of life, and we think our best strategy is to continue to focus on the year. We want to -- if it's cheaper for us to do in March than April, we'll do it in March rather than April and the Double-Double. And so Double-Double has really been very helpful. You talked about our cost containment over the last number of years now. The Double-Double is actually a very helpful concept that everybody can focus on and move towards that common goal. So I think that's why we've had the results that we've had, but I do acknowledge it does relate to bumps in any given quarter period."

The mix between ticketing onboard is actually pretty similar. You would index a little bit higher on the onboard side because you have Quantum coming in to the market. Now the point on profitability of the Chinese guests, it is still very much there. China is one of our highest-yielding markets, the product is one of our highest-yielding products. It's a little bit more expensive to operate, but also we get higher yields for those products.

I also think it's important to point out their yield. I know there's been a lot of concern about what's happening in the China marketplace with the consumer, and I think that the patterns that we're seeing with the Chinese consumer continue to show that they have a strong sentiment and a very strong desire for cruise. And a lot of the pressure on pricing just has to do with a lot of capacity coming in more seasonality in terms of the China offering and us going into other markets, which we've talked about before."

Yes, we think the cost performance has been excellent for a number of years now, and we're quite proud of the work. And I think the fact that it comes at the same time that our level of guest satisfaction goes up as it's important feature for us because I think it's actually relatively easy to cut cost if you don't care about the products that you deliver to your guests. But we have been raising guest satisfaction while we've been cutting cost. And as you say, this level of cost discipline is actually quite good. There are couple of things. One, we'll take credit for which is that we -- I think the management team has done a really very good job of looking for new ways of doing things, new efficiencies, et cetera. The other is -- and we did telegraph this when we're doing it, which is that we spent money which we thought would result in savings later on. And so -- and we talked about some of those things. We talked about the IT spending. We talked about some of the other stuff that we were doing. And so I think that also helps us a little bit by comparison. So -- but we're not resting on our laurels on that. We think there is more to be done, continual efficiencies because even the guidance we've given, which now is for 2016 up marginally, obviously, the inflation in the areas that we're looking at is higher than that. The answer to your second question, was the compensation, yes. Our compensation is all the management teams compensation has in a number of factors. One of which is, specifically, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, but on the other hand, another one of which is net revenue yields, another one is safety and environment. So we're trying to make sure that we're meeting our cost goals, our revenue goals, but also not doing things that put us at risk. This is a long-term business, and we've worked hard to put Royal Caribbean in a position, where it is solid on, if you will, the [indiscernible] bottom line as well as just the earnings per share.

As you may have heard from Jason's voice, he has a cold this morning. So I'll use this opportunity to wish him a speedy recovery and ask him to sit on the other side of the room.
In any event, I'm pleased to have this opportunity to share more about our results in 2015 and our outlook as we enter 2016.
I admit that it's very satisfying to look back on 2015, and I'd like to take just a moment to celebrate a successful year.
On the revenue side, we achieved our target of 3.5% yield improvement, despite macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges that threatened to take us off course. 
I said it before and it still holds true that while many factors may cause disturbances for short periods, our team has shown a very strong capability to make adjustments when circumstances change.
On the cost side, our team worked very hard to control this, and we ended the year down 0.6%. We began the year expecting cost to be up 1% or less, but our finance organization and our operations team worked collaboratively to find further efficiencies and husband our working dollars. 
Looking at the full picture, we anticipated doubling our 2013 earnings per share, and we exceeded that target by $0.03 a share at $4.83. The brands are delivering, and I congratulate all the employees of our company who worked so hard to make this happen.
It's equally gratifying to note that along with the financial success that we're enjoying, our surveys indicate that the highest levels of employee engagement in our company's history. Our annual survey had record participation levels and indicated higher satisfaction across all categories. We firmly believe that happy employees lead to happy guests and that in turn leads to better yields.
This past year, we took a significant forward -- a significant step forward on this front by establishing hospitality training schools, like the one in Tianjin, China. This school teaches the art and the science of hospitality. That's an exciting challenge, when most of the students have never themselves stayed in a hotel.
The development of this school marks another important step in further deepening our roots with the local community in Mainland China, as it is a strategy partnership with the state-owned Tianjin Maritime College.
In July, we opened the second training school in Lombok, Indonesia. And in May of 2016, we will open further school in Pasig, Philippines.
Not only will these schools provide a stream of over 5,000 high-quality employees each year, they provide these individuals the opportunity to join in international brand, traveling all over the world and improving their community.
We also took a big step forward in our efforts to ensure the long-term health of the oceans by entering into a five-year global partnership with World Wildlife Fund. Our business depends on the health of the oceans, and we feel the responsibility to uphold the highest standards of environmental stewardship.
Our partnership with WWF takes our efforts even further by setting specific and measurable targets for carbon emissions, sustainable seafood and destinations to stewardship. We're serious about looking at our environment and our communities, and I'm very pleased to join with the partner equally passionate about these causes.
Turning to another topic, which we feel passionate about, Double-Double remains the lens through which we view all our decision making at Royal Caribbean. Every employee can describe the program. Double 2014 earnings per share and double-digit ROIC by 2017. As we look in our trajectory, 2015 paved the wave nicely, and the results we were anticipating during 2016 will keep us solidly on our path towards Double-Double.
The 2 key components of Double-Double to achieving our goals are: Growing revenue yields and maintaining cost discipline. From a yield standpoint, our new buildings are attracting and maintaining strong pricing premiums.
Quantum of the Seas in Shanghai is head and shoulders above the market, and the innovative amenities that distinguish Quantum are the exact same ones that will make Ovation of the Seas in Tianjin unique in that new market for her.
Finally, after 5 years, we're welcoming the third vessel in our Oasis class, Harmony of the Seas. We've seen the power of the Oasis class and the longevity of its popularity. Early indications are that Harmony will not disappoint either.
In addition to our new builds outstanding performance, our existing fleet provides returns, consistent with our needs of Double-Double. At the same time, we're continually learning ways to enhance onboard revenue and apply these learnings to the existing fleet to continue to grow revenue yields there as well.
From a cost standpoint, our commitment to cost control remains steadfast. It's an extraordinary coincidence that in both of the past 2 years, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, ended up down 0.6%.
This cost control does not come easy, but we intend to continue to be disciplined in line with our Double-Double targets, but also keeping firmly in mind the strategic needs of the company from the ensuing period.
While I'm pleased to look back on the success of 2015, I'm eager to move on to 2016 and the great things to come. Our metric indicate that we are still on course for our Double-Double targets. We'll remain in the solid book position, roughly equal to last year's record levels and at higher rates.
We're currently in the middle of our WAVE Period as I think you all know, and we're happy to report that it is proving to be a solid wave. As we have seen, geopolitical concerns can also threaten the demand environment from time-to-time. These threats are generally limited to pockets of our portfolio, and we generally manage through them.
It is important to note that when demand in one area of the globe is weaker, many times there is an increase in demand for other destinations. Our intent is to maximize the overall portfolio, and we see that as one of the benefits of being a global player.
Although the current strength of the overall market is a key driver, we attribute part of our favorable book position to our price integrity policy. As a reminder, our price integrity policy is our determination to avoid the common prior practice of implementing dramatic last-minute discounts, which cheapen our brand and upset our loyal customers.
The policy says that we will not implement any new discounts during the last weeks before sailing, with the time period varying by the length of the cruise. We first started this policy about a year ago, and we've made a number of tweaks to it as we perfected our formula.
In December, we decided to make the policy even clearer and broader. It continues to apply in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Ireland. Altogether by the way, those represent more than 2/3 of our revenue. But we did decide that having different rules for different itinerary lengths was possibly confusing and definitely unnecessary.
We have, therefore, expanded the policy to make the no-new discount period consistently 30 days, regardless of itinerary. The only exception continues to be 3- or 4-night sailings, which are traditionally late bookers. All of this makes the policy easier to understand and to implement.
We are a strong believer that clarity and specificity in the program like this is important because otherwise, the exceptions undermine the integrity of the program even if they are, in fact, very rare. We now think we've got it right, and we do not expect more changes in the near future. At this time, we had our policy in place for almost a year, and we have a better view of the results.
During this time, we have granted no exceptions to the policies, since its adoption, and we have no intention of doing so now. Nevertheless, we've seen a double-digit percentage improvement in the booking window over this period, and we believe that the policy helped solidify brand preference.
An unforeseen benefit we have found is the reduced number of bookings taken at a discount before we get to the focus period. Living the spirit of the policy has helped our revenue managers make better pricing decisions, and it has been roundly applauded by the travel agents that are so central to our success.
When we introduced the policy, we were transparent with you all that an upfront cost would result from some cabins going empty rather than being filled at deep last-minute discounts. We know that in 2016, we will still see some residual impact relating to these empty cabins, but by 2017, we feel comfortable that the impact will be positive.
One last point I would like to touch on before turning it back to Jason is our share repurchase program. As you will recall, we announced a repurchase program during our call last October. That full program totals $500 million. Of the total, $200 million was part of an accelerated perk [ph] program, which we have completed. We expect to continue to purchase opportunistically throughout the year 2016 until the full $500 million is completed. 
With that, it's pleasure to turn it back to Jason."

I will begin by taking you through our results for the fourth quarter. We have summarized our fourth quarter results on Slide 2.For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $0.94 per share, which was $0.04 above our guidance.",1762,"Thank you, Richard. I will begin by taking you through our results for the fourth quarter. We have summarized our fourth quarter results on Slide 2.
For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $0.94 per share, which was $0.04 above our guidance. Net revenue yields were up 4.9%, which were at the high end of our expectations. A combination of new hardware, a stronger Caribbean and a successful new winter season in China helped drive the robust year-over-year improvement. Costs were 70 basis points better than guidance for the quarter, with net cruise costs, excluding fuel, down 4.7%.
I will now discuss full year results, which we've summarized on Slide 3. This year, we had record earnings and exceeded the $1 billion mark. Adjusted net income was $1.07 billion, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $4.83. These record earnings also mark a second consecutive year of 40-plus percent growth in earnings.
Revenue yields increased 3.5% for the full year. Yield improvements in the Caribbean, Europe and China more than offset weakness in Latin America. Onboard revenue yield did not disappoint, with a year-over-year improvement of 4%. The combination of new hardware, more onboard revenue venues on our upgraded ships and VOOM, the fastest Internet at sea, drove the majority of this improvement.
We delivered a second consecutive year of cost improvement on a per unit basis, with net cruise costs, excluding fuel, down 0.6%. These costs improvements occurred in nonguest-facing areas, mainly through identifying further synergies amongst our brands and leveraging scale in our back office.
Now I'd like to update you on what we are seeing in a demand environment. I will start by taking you through first quarter trends. 63% of Q1 capacity is in the Caribbean, 23% is in the Asia Pacific region and approximately 11% is in Brazil and Latin America.
The quarter as a whole is booked ahead of last year in both load factor and rate. Overall, we are seeing strong yield trends in Q1, driven by a significant year-over-year improvement in Caribbean pricing and the addition of the winter China season. The strength of these 2 products is more than offsetting ongoing pricing pressures in Latin America and Australia.
The WAVE Period is off to a good start, with bookings for Q2 to Q4 sailings trending similarly to last year's level. As we entered WAVE, we had significantly fewer staterooms left to sell on first quarter sailings in last year. So as expected, bookings for the first quarter have been lower than last year. For the full year, we are booked at a similar load factor to last year's record high and at a higher APD.
 
Capacity is increasing 6.3% year-over-year as we welcome Harmony of the Seas and Ovation of the Seas into the fleet this spring. The majority of our capacity growth is in the Asia Pacific region, with the balance mostly in the Caribbean.
Caribbean capacity will be up about 4% year-over-year as the product benefits from an upgrade in hardware. In addition to Anthem of the Seas in the Northeast, we will have at least 2 Oasis-class ships in the Caribbean in each quarter. We are also moderately increasing capacity in Europe, driven by a handful of sailings on Ovation of the Seas before she begins her journey to China. 
Once she arrives in China, Ovation will contribute to a 33% capacity growth in the Asia Pacific region. On the other hand, we have significantly scaled back our capacity in Brazil and Latin America. While these products will account for approximately 11% of our capacity in the first quarter, they will be reduced to less than 2% for the remainder of the year.
We are seeing particular strength from the North American consumer, and our Caribbean and Alaska products are currently booked at record load factors. The Caribbean accounts for 43% of our 2016 capacity and has booked ahead of same time last year in both load factor and rate.
Our Caribbean product consists of a wide variety of itineraries, ranging from weekend getaways to 14-night Southern Caribbean sailings. In general, we are seeing better trends than last year across Caribbean itineraries, with 7-night and shorter sailings showing the most strength. Overall, we are expecting mid-single-digit yield growth for the Caribbean.
Alaska has booked nicely ahead of last year in both rate and volume, despite a 6% year-over-year increase in capacity. We anticipate mid-single-digit yield growth in what is expected to be a record-breaking year for the product.
Europe itineraries account for about 21% of our 2016 capacity. Although booked load factors for the product is slightly lower than same time last year's record levels, recent trends have been quite strong and load factor remains nicely higher at this point in all other previous years.
We did experience a softening in North American demand for a short period after the Paris attacks in November, and there was a minor drop in bookings from European-sourced markets. Demand quickly returned to typical levels, although pricing remains below same time last year for Eastern Mediterranean sailings.
Prices for like hardware for the rest of Europe are up slightly versus same time last year. Overall, we are expecting a low single-digit yield decline for our European itineraries, primarily driven by hardware changes and pricing pressure and itinerary modifications that relate to the Eastern Mediterranean.
Asia Pacific itineraries will account for 19% of our 2016 capacity, following significant growth in both Australia and China. Yields for the Asia Pacific product as a whole are expected to be up low single digits, driven mainly by our increasing capacity and the high yield in China market.
For the first time, we will offer a year-round China product as Quantum of the Seas makes Shanghai her home for the full year. Her sister ship, Ovation of the Seas, will drive the remainder of our China capacity growth after she arrives in Tianjin at the end of June.
Significant industry capacity growth combined with the expansion of the season into off-peak periods and second-tier embarkation points -- ports has led us to forecast a low single-digit yield decline for China in 2016. Nevertheless, China is expected to remain one of our highest-yielding itineraries and is contributing to the company's overall yield growth.
The pricing environment in Australia remains a bit of a challenge, given ongoing capacity growth in the region and the weakening of the Australian dollar. While Australia continues to deliver a strong seasonal yield, we expect yields in Australia to be flat to slightly down for the year.
Before getting into our 2016 guidance, I wanted to reiterate some of our previous comments we made during our last earnings call that relate to Pullmantur.
As a result of these -- of our rightsizing efforts, we expect to incur restructuring and related costs in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 per share during 2016. Additionally, as previously discussed, we intend on eliminating Pullmantur's 2-month accounting lag during the first quarter of 2016. This change will result in a 14-month reporting period for Pullmantur this year with an estimated to impact our earnings per share by $0.10. 
For simplification and comparative purposes, we will be excluding all of these onetime adjustments from our key statistics. Hence, our GAAP earnings in 2016 will be slightly lower for these adjustments.
Taking all this into account, if you turn to Slide 4, you will see our guidance for 2016. This will be the second full year on our path towards Double-Double, and our results remain on track. 
Net yields are expected to be up for the seventh consecutive year, with yields increasing 2% to 4%. Strong trends from North American products, additional capacity in the Asia Pacific region and another year of strong onboard revenue are expected to drive this improvement.
On the onboard side, new hardware and upgrades to our existing ships, a greater mix of capacity in Asia and further expansion of VOOM is expected to deliver another step change in shipboard revenue yield.
Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up 1% or less for the full year. While the full year demonstrates our cost discipline, the cadence of expenses through the year is not linear. For example, our drydocks in 2016 are concentrated in the first and fourth quarter. 
In addition, you will recall that in the second quarter of last year, we made investments in the China market to support Quantum of the Seas. This year, these investments are being made slightly earlier to support our year-round China presence, Ovation of the Seas' arrival and to grow our Asia market footprint. This is resulting in a shift in spend into the first quarter.
We anticipate fuel expense of $716 million for the year, and we are 66% hedged. Over the past several months, fuel prices have significantly weakened, while the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen versus our basket of currencies. The combination of these 2 factors has resulted in a $0.14 per share headwind to 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ] earnings. Additionally, the recent rise in interest rates has impacted our 2016 earnings by $0.06 per share.
Based on current fuel prices, currency exchange rates and interest rates, we expect another record-breaking year with earnings per share between $5.90 and $6.10 per share. The midpoint of this guidance represents a year-over-year increase of 24%, which comes on the heels of more than 40% growth delivered in each of the past 2 years.
Now I would like to walk you through our first quarter guidance on Slide 5. Net yields are expected to be up approximately 4% for the first quarter, driven by a strong Caribbean and the continuation of the winter season for Quantum in China. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up in the range of 4.5% to 5%, driven by a combination of factors. 
We are setting the groundwork for 2 new ships -- 2 new ship entries later this year, while also maximizing the momentum of new marketing campaigns for our 2 largest brands during WAVE. Additionally, we will be investing earlier this year in Asia, as we look to continue to expand our leadership position in the market and diversify our channel mix. As I mentioned earlier, much of this spend has been concentrated in the first quarter due to timing. Taking all this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the quarter to be approximately $0.30. 
With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session."

Just to correct one point, the yields are slightly down in China this year '16 versus '15 based upon all of the different elements that we just talked about. With regards to charter companies, it's quite a mix in relation to our total distribution, but over time, obviously, we're being changing the mix of our distribution, and we continue that journey. So literally, every single year, we're doubling the number of agents who are selling Royal Caribbean in the China market. And of course, we're broadening our regional footprint, especially, now with the introduction of Ovation in Tianjin. So it's true that some of the charter companies really out of Shanghai had some challenges in '15 in relation to MERS in Korea and, of course, the typhoon season, which was particularly difficult. And so some of the charters did experience some losses during some of the sailings. But having said that, they did particularly well the rest of the year with Royal Caribbean and have done well with Royal Caribbean over the past 9 years that we've been in the market. So it was a bit of a hiccup, and of course, we -- as we are in The United States, we're long-term partners with our travel partners. So we've worked hard at finding some workarounds with them in terms our '16 inventory and how we work with them in terms of our cooperative marketing and this type of thing. So we feel that we've been very responsive to some of the feedback that we've had from some of these charters. And we think we're in a fairly good position for '16. With regards to the differentiation of the brands, that's, I think, a highly relevant question. When you look at Royal Caribbean against the competition, we have been in the market now for 9 years, and we've been investing over a 9-year period in the market. We have the newest hardware in the key ports. Quantum of the Seas genuinely has been a huge hit out of Shanghai, Ovation coming into Tianjin is doing very well. We have 8 consecutive years of being the top cruise line in China awarded by the Travel Trade Gazette and the Travel Weekly. We've been focused on launching consumer campaigns, and we -- in fact, we're launching a new campaign literally in the coming weeks. We've been working on expanding our distribution footprint. And of course, we are the largest single cruise brand in China with a really professional and competent sales organization and marketing team, who really have been with us for quite some time. So I think the spread between Royal Caribbean International and the competing brands in the market is quite significant. And a lot of that is driven by the hardware, Quantum and Ovation are world-class leading hardware, and they are the only brand-new ships in the China market."

But to add on to that, if you look at how your costs trended in 2015 versus your original guidance for the full year, they came in better than expected or lower than expected?

And so, as I said in the past, it's not one thing, it's thousands of little things that we do. The leadership, for example, Adam has given around supply chain and that team, the consolidation of our marine organization and finding more efficiencies in our back office is really what we just do day-to-day when we use the lens of Double-Double. And so that's -- that is ongoing and continuing. There are a lot of headwinds in costs in 2016. Obviously, as we expand our mix into Asia, the cost of operating there is higher and some more upfront costs in the sales and marketing side as we're delivering 2 new ships this year. And also, having VOOM, the fastest Internet bandwidth at Sea also has a high cost to it. So there are a lot of headwinds, but our efforts to try to continue to identify opportunity is never ending. But I think we think the 1% or less guidance is really our best view based off of all of our plans that we have to date to manage costs effectively in 2016."

I do think that the Jason's focus on this is very helpful, but all of our leaders here Adam, Lisa, Michael, the others are really very focused on it. I'd also just maybe take the opportunity and talk a little bit about the timing of it during the year. You know I've said this in previous calls, we manage on an annual basis. And one thing that's a little unique about our business is I think distinguishes us from many others is that we have some significant big costs that we can shift around in terms of timing. So we would look at a booking pattern to say whether we ought to drydock a ship in March or April, or September or October or what have you. And when we make those decisions, we simply don't pay attention internally to whether that falls in this quarter or that quarter, but those kinds of what we think of those as immaterial tweaking to get the best outcome, particularly as it relates, for example, if I take a drydocking, we might find that for whatever reason, we were just booking better at the end of September than early October, and we would just decide to shift drydock by one quarter into another. From an operating point of view, they're immaterial. And those kinds of changes can actually help us in bringing our overall cost number down. But I fully recognize that as it relates to individual quarters, they will distort the numbers. And unfortunately, that's simply a fact of life, and we think our best strategy is to continue to focus on the year. We want to -- if it's cheaper for us to do it in March than April, we'll do it in March rather than April and the Double-Double. And so Double-Double has really been very helpful. You talked about our cost containment over the last number of years now. The Double-Double is actually a very helpful concept that everybody can focus on and move towards that common goal. So I think that's why we've had the results that we've had, but I do acknowledge it does relate to bumps in any given quarter period."

And that obviously, when you have ships like Ovation come in, that also helps balance out some of the pressures we have on some of our older assets that are in our market, really non-Quantum class assets. The mix between ticketing onboard is actually pretty similar. You would index a little bit higher on the onboard side because you have Quantum coming in to the market. Now the point on profitability of the Chinese guests, it is still very much there. China is one of our highest-yielding markets, the product is one of our highest-yielding products. It's a little bit more expensive to operate, but also we get higher yields for those products. So it is very much contributing to our yields, and it is very much contributing to our profits and our margins and our business, and I think our -- which is why our outlook continues to be very favorable for the Chinese market."

Yes, we think the cost performance has been excellent for a number of years now, and we're quite proud of the work. And I think the fact that it comes at the same time that our level of guest satisfaction goes up as it's important feature for us because I think it's actually relatively easy to cut cost if you don't care about the products that you deliver to your guests. But we have been raising guest satisfaction while we've been cutting cost. And as you say, this level of cost discipline is actually quite good. There are couple of things. One, we'll take credit for which is that we -- I think the management team has done a really very good job of looking for new ways of doing things, new efficiencies, et cetera. The other is -- and we did telegraph this when we're doing it, which is that we spent money which we thought would result in savings later on. And so -- and we talked about some of those things. We talked about the IT spending. We talked about some of the other stuff that we were doing. And so I think that also helps us a little bit by comparison. So -- but we're not resting on our laurels on that. We think there is more to be done, continual efficiencies because even the guidance we've given, which now is for 2016 up marginally, obviously, the inflation in the areas that we're looking at is higher than that. The answer to your second question, was the compensation, yes. Our compensation is all the management teams compensation has in a number of factors. One of which is, specifically, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, but on the other hand, another one of which is net revenue yields, another one is safety and environment. So we're trying to make sure that we're meeting our cost goals, our revenue goals, but also not doing things that put us at risk. This is a long-term business, and we've worked hard to put Royal Caribbean in a position, where it is solid on, if you will, the triple [ph] bottom line as well as just the earnings per share. I'm going to let Jason handle the last of those questions."

As you may have heard from Jason's voice, he has a cold this morning. So I'll use this opportunity to wish him a speedy recovery and ask him to sit on the other side of the room.
In any event, I'm pleased to have this opportunity to share more about our results in 2015 and our outlook as we enter 2016.
I admit that it's very satisfying to look back on 2015, and I'd like to take just a moment to celebrate a successful year.
On the revenue side, we achieved our target of 3.5% yield improvement, despite macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges that threatened to take us off course. 
I said it before and it still holds true that while many factors may cause disturbances for short periods, our team has shown a very strong capability to make adjustments when circumstances change.
On the cost side, our team worked very hard to control this, and we ended the year down 0.6%. We began the year expecting cost to be up 1% or less, but our finance organization and our operations team worked collaboratively to find further efficiencies and husband our working dollars. 
Looking at the full picture, we anticipated doubling our 2013 earnings per share, and we exceeded that target by $0.03 a share at $4.83. The brands are delivering, and I congratulate all the employees of our company who worked so hard to make this happen.
It's equally gratifying to note that along with the financial success that we're enjoying, our surveys indicate that the highest levels of employee engagement in our company's history. Our annual survey had record participation levels and indicated higher satisfaction across all categories. We firmly believe that happy employees lead to happy guests and that in turn leads to better yields.
This past year, we took a significant forward -- a significant step forward on this front by establishing hospitality training schools, like the one in Tianjin, China. This school teaches the art and the science of hospitality. That's an exciting challenge, when most of the students have never themselves stayed in a hotel.
The development of this school marks another important step in further deepening our roots with the local community in Mainland China, as it is a strategy partnership with the state-owned Tianjin Maritime College.
In July, we opened the second training school in Lombok, Indonesia. And in May of 2016, we will open further school in Pasig, Philippines.
Not only will these schools provide a stream of over 5,000 high-quality employees each year, they provide these individuals the opportunity to join in international brand, traveling all over the world and improving their community.
We also took a big step forward in our efforts to ensure the long-term health of the oceans by entering into a five-year global partnership with World Wildlife Fund. Our business depends on the health of the oceans, and we feel the responsibility to uphold the highest standards of environmental stewardship.
Our partnership with WWF takes our efforts even further by setting specific and measurable targets for carbon emissions, sustainable seafood and destinations to stewardship. We're serious about looking at our environment and our communities, and I'm very pleased to join with the partner equally passionate about these causes.
Turning to another topic, which we feel passionate about, Double-Double remains the lens through which we view all our decision making at Royal Caribbean. Every employee can describe the program. Double 2014 earnings per share and double-digit ROIC by 2017. As we look in our trajectory, 2015 paved the wave nicely, and the results we were anticipating during 2016 will keep us solidly on our path towards Double-Double.
The 2 key components of Double-Double to achieving our goals are: Growing revenue yields and maintaining cost discipline. From a yield standpoint, our new buildings are attracting and maintaining strong pricing premiums.
Quantum of the Seas in Shanghai is head and shoulders above the market, and the innovative amenities that distinguish Quantum are the exact same ones that will make Ovation of the Seas in Tianjin unique in that new market for her.
Finally, after 5 years, we're welcoming the third vessel in our Oasis class, Harmony of the Seas. We've seen the power of the Oasis class and the longevity of its popularity. Early indications are that Harmony will not disappoint either.
In addition to our new builds outstanding performance, our existing fleet provides returns, consistent with our needs of Double-Double. At the same time, we're continually learning ways to enhance onboard revenue and apply these learnings to the existing fleet to continue to grow revenue yields there as well.
From a cost standpoint, our commitment to cost control remains steadfast. It's an extraordinary coincidence that in both of the past 2 years, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, ended up down 0.6%.
This cost control does not come easy, but we intend to continue to be disciplined in line with our Double-Double targets, but also keeping firmly in mind the strategic needs of the company from the ensuing period.
While I'm pleased to look back on the success of 2015, I'm eager to move on to 2016 and the great things to come. Our metric indicate that we are still on course for our Double-Double targets. We'll remain in the solid book position, roughly equal to last year's record levels and at higher rates.
We're currently in the middle of our WAVE Period as I think you all know, and we're happy to report that it is proving to be a solid wave. As we have seen, geopolitical concerns can also threaten the demand environment from time-to-time. These threats are generally limited to pockets of our portfolio, and we generally manage through them.
It is important to note that when demand in one area of the globe is weaker, many times there is an increase in demand for other destinations. Our intent is to maximize the overall portfolio, and we see that as one of the benefits of being a global player.
Although the current strength of the overall market is a key driver, we attribute part of our favorable book position to our price integrity policy. As a reminder, our price integrity policy is our determination to avoid the common prior practice of implementing dramatic last-minute discounts, which cheapen our brand and upset our loyal customers.
The policy says that we will not implement any new discounts during the last weeks before sailing, with the time period varying by the length of the cruise. We first started this policy about a year ago, and we've made a number of tweaks to it as we perfected our formula.
In December, we decided to make the policy even clearer and broader. It continues to apply in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and Ireland. Altogether by the way, those represent more than 2/3 of our revenue. But we did decide that having different rules for different itinerary lengths was possibly confusing and definitely unnecessary.
We have, therefore, expanded the policy to make the no-new discount period consistently 30 days, regardless of itinerary. The only exception continues to be 3- or 4-night sailings, which are traditionally late bookers. All of this makes the policy easier to understand and to implement.
We are a strong believer that clarity and specificity in the program like this is important because otherwise, the exceptions undermine the integrity of the program even if they are, in fact, very rare. We now think we've got it right, and we do not expect more changes in the near future. At this time, we had our policy in place for almost a year, and we have a better view of the results.
During this time, we have granted no exceptions to the policies, since its adoption, and we have no intention of doing so now. Nevertheless, we've seen a double-digit percentage improvement in the booking window over this period, and we believe that the policy helped solidify brand preference.
An unforeseen benefit we have found is the reduced number of bookings taken at a discount before we get to the focus period. Living the spirit of the policy has helped our revenue managers make better pricing decisions, and it has been roundly applauded by the travel agents that are so central to our success.
When we introduced the policy, we were transparent with you all that an upfront cost would result from some cabins going empty rather than being filled at deep last-minute discounts. We know that in 2016, we will still see some residual impact relating to these empty cabins, but by 2017, we feel comfortable that the impact will be positive.
One last point I would like to touch on before turning it back to Jason is our share repurchase program. As you will recall, we announced a repurchase program during our call last October. That full program totals $500 million. Of the total, $200 million was part of an accelerated perk [ph] program, which we have completed. We expect to continue to purchase opportunistically throughout the year 2016 until the full $500 million is completed. 
With that, it's pleasure to turn it back to Jason."

I will begin by taking you through our results for the fourth quarter. We have summarized our fourth quarter results on Slide 2.
For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $0.94 per share, which was $0.04 above our guidance. Net revenue yields were up 4.9%, which were at the high end of our expectations. A combination of new hardware, a stronger Caribbean and a successful new winter season in China helped drive the robust year-over-year improvement. Costs were 70 basis points better than guidance for the quarter, with net cruise costs, excluding fuel, down 4.7%.
I will now discuss full year results, which we've summarized on Slide 3. This year, we had record earnings and exceeded the $1 billion mark. Adjusted net income was $1.07 billion, resulting in adjusted earnings per share of $4.83. These record earnings also mark a second consecutive year of 40-plus percent growth in earnings.
Revenue yields increased 3.5% for the full year. Yield improvements in the Caribbean, Europe and China more than offset weakness in Latin America. Onboard revenue yield did not disappoint, with a year-over-year improvement of 4%. The combination of new hardware, more onboard revenue venues on our upgraded ships and VOOM, the fastest Internet at sea, drove the majority of this improvement.
We delivered a second consecutive year of cost improvement on a per unit basis, with net cruise costs, excluding fuel, down 0.6%. These costs improvements occurred in nonguest-facing areas, mainly through identifying further synergies amongst our brands and leveraging scale in our back office.
Now I'd like to update you on what we are seeing in a demand environment. I will start by taking you through first quarter trends. 63% of Q1 capacity is in the Caribbean, 23% is in the Asia Pacific region and approximately 11% is in Brazil and Latin America.
The quarter as a whole is booked ahead of last year in both load factor and rate. Overall, we are seeing strong yield trends in Q1, driven by a significant year-over-year improvement in Caribbean pricing and the addition of the winter China season. The strength of these 2 products is more than offsetting ongoing pricing pressures in Latin America and Australia.
The WAVE Period is off to a good start, with bookings for Q2 to Q4 sailings trending similarly to last year's level. As we entered WAVE, we had significantly fewer staterooms left to sell on first quarter sailings in last year. So as expected, bookings for the first quarter have been lower than last year. For the full year, we are booked at a similar load factor to last year's record high and at a higher APD.
 
Capacity is increasing 6.3% year-over-year as we welcome Harmony of the Seas and Ovation of the Seas into the fleet this spring. The majority of our capacity growth is in the Asia Pacific region, with the balance mostly in the Caribbean.
Caribbean capacity will be up about 4% year-over-year as the product benefits from an upgrade in hardware. In addition to Anthem of the Seas in the Northeast, we will have at least 2 Oasis-class ships in the Caribbean in each quarter. We are also moderately increasing capacity in Europe, driven by a handful of sailings on Ovation of the Seas before she begins her journey to China. 
Once she arrives in China, Ovation will contribute to a 33% capacity growth in the Asia Pacific region. On the other hand, we have significantly scaled back our capacity in Brazil and Latin America. While these products will account for approximately 11% of our capacity in the first quarter, they will be reduced to less than 2% for the remainder of the year.
We are seeing particular strength from the North American consumer, and our Caribbean and Alaska products are currently booked at record load factors. The Caribbean accounts for 43% of our 2016 capacity and has booked ahead of same time last year in both load factor and rate.
Our Caribbean product consists of a wide variety of itineraries, ranging from weekend getaways to 14-night Southern Caribbean sailings. In general, we are seeing better trends than last year across Caribbean itineraries, with 7-night and shorter sailings showing the most strength. Overall, we are expecting mid-single-digit yield growth for the Caribbean.
Alaska has booked nicely ahead of last year in both rate and volume, despite a 6% year-over-year increase in capacity. We anticipate mid-single-digit yield growth in what is expected to be a record-breaking year for the product.
Europe itineraries account for about 21% of our 2016 capacity. Although booked load factors for the product is slightly lower than same time last year's record levels, recent trends have been quite strong and load factor remains nicely higher at this point in all other previous years.
We did experience a softening in North American demand for a short period after the Paris attacks in November, and there was a minor drop in bookings from European-sourced markets. Demand quickly returned to typical levels, although pricing remains below same time last year for Eastern Mediterranean sailings.
Prices for like hardware for the rest of Europe are up slightly versus same time last year. Overall, we are expecting a low single-digit yield decline for our European itineraries, primarily driven by hardware changes and pricing pressure and itinerary modifications that relate to the Eastern Mediterranean.
Asia Pacific itineraries will account for 19% of our 2016 capacity, following significant growth in both Australia and China. Yields for the Asia Pacific product as a whole are expected to be up low single digits, driven mainly by our increasing capacity and the high yield in China market.
For the first time, we will offer a year-round China product as Quantum of the Seas makes Shanghai her home for the full year. Her sister ship, Ovation of the Seas, will drive the remainder of our China capacity growth after she arrives in Tianjin at the end of June.
Significant industry capacity growth combined with the expansion of the season into off-peak periods and second-tier embarkation points -- ports has led us to forecast a low single-digit yield decline for China in 2016. Nevertheless, China is expected to remain one of our highest-yielding itineraries and is contributing to the company's overall yield growth.
The pricing environment in Australia remains a bit of a challenge, given ongoing capacity growth in the region and the weakening of the Australian dollar. While Australia continues to deliver a strong seasonal yield, we expect yields in Australia to be flat to slightly down for the year.
Before getting into our 2016 guidance, I wanted to reiterate some of our previous comments we made during our last earnings call that relate to Pullmantur.
As a result of these -- of our rightsizing efforts, we expect to incur restructuring and related costs in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 per share during 2016. Additionally, as previously discussed, we intend on eliminating Pullmantur's 2-month accounting lag during the first quarter of 2016. This change will result in a 14-month reporting period for Pullmantur this year with an estimated to impact our earnings per share by $0.10. 
For simplification and comparative purposes, we will be excluding all of these onetime adjustments from our key statistics. Hence, our GAAP earnings in 2016 will be slightly lower for these adjustments.
Taking all this into account, if you turn to Slide 4, you will see our guidance for 2016. This will be the second full year on our path towards Double-Double, and our results remain on track. 
Net yields are expected to be up for the seventh consecutive year, with yields increasing 2% to 4%. Strong trends from North American products, additional capacity in the Asia Pacific region and another year of strong onboard revenue are expected to drive this improvement.
On the onboard side, new hardware and upgrades to our existing ships, a greater mix of capacity in Asia and further expansion of VOOM is expected to deliver another step change in shipboard revenue yield.
Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up 1% or less for the full year. While the full year demonstrates our cost discipline, the cadence of expenses through the year is not linear. For example, our drydocks in 2016 are concentrated in the first and fourth quarter. 
In addition, you will recall that in the second quarter of last year, we made investments in the China market to support Quantum of the Seas. This year, these investments are being made slightly earlier to support our year-round China presence, Ovation of the Seas' arrival and to grow our Asia market footprint. This is resulting in a shift in spend into the first quarter.
We anticipate fuel expense of $716 million for the year, and we are 66% hedged. Over the past several months, fuel prices have significantly weakened, while the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen versus our basket of currencies. The combination of these 2 factors has resulted in a $0.14 per share headwind to 2006 (sic) [ 2016 ] earnings. Additionally, the recent rise in interest rates has impacted our 2016 earnings by $0.06 per share.
Based on current fuel prices, currency exchange rates and interest rates, we expect another record-breaking year with earnings per share between $5.90 and $6.10 per share. The midpoint of this guidance represents a year-over-year increase of 24%, which comes on the heels of more than 40% growth delivered in each of the past 2 years.
Now I would like to walk you through our first quarter guidance on Slide 5. Net yields are expected to be up approximately 4% for the first quarter, driven by a strong Caribbean and the continuation of the winter season for Quantum in China. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up in the range of 4.5% to 5%, driven by a combination of factors. 
We are setting the groundwork for 2 new ships -- 2 new ship entries later this year, while also maximizing the momentum of new marketing campaigns for our 2 largest brands during WAVE. Additionally, we will be investing earlier this year in Asia, as we look to continue to expand our leadership position in the market and diversify our channel mix. As I mentioned earlier, much of this spend has been concentrated in the first quarter due to timing. Taking all this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share for the quarter to be approximately $0.30. 
With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session."

Now obviously, markets like China that are later in the bookings cycle can influence that.

What I was hoping you could clarify is that we get a lot of questions just about the charter companies, the charter agents and the status there. I think the view is that some of the charter agents are losing money on the China cruises in general. I was just wondering whether or not that's actually true and if there are issues, what is Royal Caribbean doing, if anything, to fix that? And then also, I'm just wondering if you're seeing any differences in how different Chinese brands are performing there versus your brand and others? How are you differentiated?

Just to correct one point, the yields are slightly down in China this year '16 versus '15 based upon all of the different elements that we just talked about. With regards to charter companies, it's quite a mix in relation to our total distribution, but over time, obviously, we're being changing the mix of our distribution, and we continue that journey. So literally, every single year, we're doubling the number of agents who are selling Royal Caribbean in the China market. And of course, we're broadening our regional footprint, especially, now with the introduction of Ovation in Tianjin. So it's true that some of the charter companies really out of Shanghai had some challenges in '15 in relation to MERS in Korea and, of course, the typhoon season, which was particularly difficult. And so some of the charters did experience some losses during some of the sailings. But having said that, they did particularly well the rest of the year with Royal Caribbean and have done well with Royal Caribbean over the past 9 years that we've been in the market. So it was a bit of a hiccup, and of course, we -- as we are in The United States, we're long-term partners with our travel partners. So we've worked hard at finding some workarounds with them in terms our '16 inventory and how we work with them in terms of our cooperative marketing and this type of thing. So we feel that we've been very responsive to some of the feedback that we've had from some of these charters. And we think we're in a fairly good position for '16. With regards to the differentiation of the brands, that's, I think, a highly relevant question. When you look at Royal Caribbean against the competition, we have been in the market now for 9 years, and we've been investing over a 9-year period in the market. We have the newest hardware in the key ports. Quantum of the Seas genuinely has been a huge hit out of Shanghai, Ovation coming into Tianjin is doing very well. We have 8 consecutive years of being the top cruise line in China awarded by the Travel Trade Gazette and the Travel Weekly. We've been focused on launching consumer campaigns, and we -- in fact, we're launching a new campaign literally in the coming weeks. We've been working on expanding our distribution footprint. And of course, we are the largest single cruise brand in China with a really professional and competent sales organization and marketing team, who really have been with us for quite some time. So I think the spread between Royal Caribbean International and the competing brands in the market is quite significant. And a lot of that is driven by the hardware, Quantum and Ovation are world-class leading hardware, and they are the only brand-new ships in the China market."

The leadership, for example, Adam has given around supply chain and that team, the consolidation of our marine organization and finding more efficiencies in our back office is really what we just do day-to-day when we use the lens of Double-Double. And so that's -- that is ongoing and continuing. There are a lot of headwinds in costs in 2016. Obviously, as we expand our mix into Asia, the cost of operating there is higher and some more upfront costs in the sales and marketing side as we're delivering 2 new ships this year. And also, having VOOM, the fastest Internet bandwidth at Sea also has a high cost to it. So there are a lot of headwinds, but our efforts to try to continue to identify opportunity is never ending. But I think we think the 1% or less guidance is really our best view based off of all of our plans that we have to date to manage costs effectively in 2016."

I do think that the Jason's focus on this is very helpful, but all of our leaders here Adam, Lisa, Michael, the others are really very focused on it. I'd also just maybe take the opportunity and talk a little bit about the timing of it during the year. You know I've said this in previous calls, we manage on an annual basis. And one thing that's a little unique about our business is I think distinguishes us from many others is that we have some significant big costs that we can shift around in terms of timing. So we would look at a booking pattern to say whether we ought to drydock a ship in March or April, or September or October or what have you. And when we make those decisions, we simply don't pay attention internally to whether that falls in this quarter or that quarter, but those kinds of what we think of those as immaterial tweaking to get the best outcome, particularly as it relates, for example, if I take a drydocking, we might find that for whatever reason, we were just booking better at the end of September than early October, and we would just decide to shift drydock by one quarter into another. From an operating point of view, they're immaterial. And those kinds of changes can actually help us in bringing our overall cost number down. But I fully recognize that as it relates to individual quarters, they will distort the numbers. And unfortunately, that's simply a fact of life, and we think our best strategy is to continue to focus on the year. We want to -- if it's cheaper for us to do it in March than April, we'll do it in March rather than April and the Double-Double. And so Double-Double has really been very helpful. You talked about our cost containment over the last number of years now. The Double-Double is actually a very helpful concept that everybody can focus on and move towards that common goal. So I think that's why we've had the results that we've had, but I do acknowledge it does relate to bumps in any given quarter period."

The mix between ticketing onboard is actually pretty similar. You would index a little bit higher on the onboard side because you have Quantum coming in to the market. Now the point on profitability of the Chinese guests, it is still very much there. China is one of our highest-yielding markets, the product is one of our highest-yielding products. It's a little bit more expensive to operate, but also we get higher yields for those products. So it is very much contributing to our yields, and it is very much contributing to our profits and our margins and our business, and I think our -- which is why our outlook continues to be very favorable for the Chinese market."

I also think it's important to point out -- I know there's been a lot of concern about what's happening in the China marketplace with the consumer, and I think that the patterns that we're seeing with the Chinese consumer continue to show that they have a strong sentiment and a very strong desire for cruise. And a lot of the pressure on pricing just has to do with a lot of capacity coming in more seasonality in terms of the China offering and us going into other markets, which we've talked about before."

Yes, we think the cost performance has been excellent for a number of years now, and we're quite proud of the work. And I think the fact that it comes at the same time that our level of guest satisfaction goes up as it's important feature for us because I think it's actually relatively easy to cut cost if you don't care about the products that you deliver to your guests. But we have been raising guest satisfaction while we've been cutting cost. And as you say, this level of cost discipline is actually quite good. There are couple of things. One, we'll take credit for which is that we -- I think the management team has done a really very good job of looking for new ways of doing things, new efficiencies, et cetera. The other is -- and we did telegraph this when we're doing it, which is that we spent money which we thought would result in savings later on. And so -- and we talked about some of those things. We talked about the IT spending. We talked about some of the other stuff that we were doing. And so I think that also helps us a little bit by comparison. So -- but we're not resting on our laurels on that. We think there is more to be done, continual efficiencies because even the guidance we've given, which now is for 2016 up marginally, obviously, the inflation in the areas that we're looking at is higher than that. The answer to your second question, was the compensation, yes. Our compensation is all the management team's compensation has in a number of factors. One of which is, specifically, net cruise costs, excluding fuel, but on the other hand, another one of which is net revenue yields, another one is safety and environment. So we're trying to make sure that we're meeting our cost goals, our revenue goals, but also not doing things that put us at risk. This is a long-term business, and we've worked hard to put Royal Caribbean in a position, where it is solid on, if you will, the triple [ph] bottom line as well as just the earnings per share. I'm going to let Jason handle the last of those questions."

It's a pleasure to have the chance to provide more color on the quarter and to talk about our direction going forward.Internally, we start almost meeting talking about the Double-Double and I'm going to follow",1077,"Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everybody. It's a pleasure to have the chance to provide more color on the quarter and to talk about our direction going forward.
Internally, we start almost meeting talking about the Double-Double and I'm going to follow that practice here as well. Obviously, it's gratifying to report results that is so much higher than we have ever enjoyed in any one [ph] quarter in our history and it actually strengthens our confidence in our ability to reach these targets. As a reminder, our Double-Double Program established targets to double our 2014 earnings per share and to reach double-digit ROIC by 2017, that means earnings per share next year in excess of $6.78 and ROIC of 10% or better. The results that we are reporting today not only bring us closer to those goals, but they also demonstrate how powerful our brands are and how well they're doing. 
As gratifying as today's results are, I should also reiterate that we manage our business and we asses our performance on an annual basis, not on a quarterly one. We always have pluses and minuses affecting different seasons and different itineraries. In today's case, we're in a happy position that just everything in the quarter that could have gone right did. Ticket revenue was stellar, onboard revenue was terrific, costs were well controlled and even below the line items helped. While it's impossible to isolate out some things, it's interesting to note that strong last-minute demand helped our bookings, at the same time where we were simultaneously enforcing our price integrity program. It's very validating to me that we saw such strong close-in demand for products like the Caribbean, despite our program designed to eliminate last-minute discounts. A key driver of our future success continues to be the success of our executional efforts.
Execution is everything and it's going very well indeed. Our brands are firing on all cylinders, costs are well controlled and our new ships are getting rave reviews. As a result, our guests are coming back in ever-increasing numbers and we're raising the demand from those who have never cruised before. I'd like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the men and women at Royal Caribbean, at sea and on land, who are working so hard and so well every single day. The key to the Double-Double and the key to our success beyond Double-Double is our ability to execute at the highest level. We are indebted to all of them for doing so. 
Of course, as always is the case, some markets do better than others. This year, we've seen particularly good results in the U.S. markets. We've seen some weakness in the Mediterranean sailings but strength in the Caribbean, Baltic and Alaska. China continues to be one of our great success stories and now represents 9% of our capacity. The market there has received the Royal Caribbean International brand exceptionally well and that market continues to grow at extraordinary rates. Brand image is particularly important in China, and we've been very pleased with the exceptional position Royal Caribbean has earned there.
Total industry capacity in China over just the last 2 years has more than quadrupled, that's an extraordinary amount for any market to absorb. Against that background, the fact that our yields have held up there as well as they have is powerful evidence of the scale of the opportunity. 
Now in 2017 and '18, industry capacity growth drops to only about 50% per year and that gives us further comfort about the future there. 
Most importantly, I believe our unique strategy in China is working very well. Firstly, we have brought to the market the best ships, the biggest, the baddest and the newest. The Chinese appreciate that we have acted so positively towards their country and that has enabled us to establish an unusually strong first-mover advantage. 
Secondly, we worked hard to educate and assist the distribution system there. We haven't just taken advantage of existing channels, but we've actively work to make them more successful. We have the largest team in China dedicated to training and supporting the distribution system. That helps the travel agents be successful and help them sell our products. 
Lastly, we have aggressively invested in ways to link us more directly with the end consumer and help establish a deeper connection with our guests. All of these has enabled us to communicate successfully what makes Royal Caribbean better, different and special.
A few weeks ago, we took delivery of Ovation of the Seas and in 2 weeks, we will take delivery of Harmony of the Seas. Extraordinary. Ovation is simply magnificent. The reaction has been overwhelming to numerous innovation, such as ripcore [ph] by iFly [ph]; VOOM, the fastest Internet at sea; the amazing lounge 270; and 18 restaurants, which our guests can choose amongst. The Chinese public appreciate that Royal Caribbean took the lead in bringing new hardware to China. Innovation will be the first to ship -- cruise ship to be named there by a very famous singer, actress, Fam Bing Bing [ph].
Delivery of Harmony of the Seas in 2 weeks should be just as exacting, albeit on this side of the world. She builds on the incredible success of our Oasis series of ships and she's one of the most anticipated new ships of the year.
Lastly, in June, we are very excited to be taking delivery of TUI Cruises' newest ship, Line Ship 5 TUI Cruises continues to perform exceptionally well in the German market and this vessel will add to its success.
Before I turn the call back to Jason, there's one last I wish to cover. For a company to be successful in today's world, it's important that we not only do it right, but we also do the right thing. At Royal Caribbean, ethical leadership is an important part of our worldview. It is something that matters to our people, but it is a different metric to measure. Fortunately, this organization called the sphere Institute [ph] and it was organized specifically for the purpose of encouraging good corporate stewardship. I am, therefore, extremely pleased that [indiscernible] recognized Royal Caribbean in 2016 as one of the world's most ethical companies. We value this honor and we continue -- we intend to continue following our mantra of continuous improvement. 
With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call back to Jason. Jason?"
325643,331645302,967328,"Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Richard. I'll begin by talking about our results for the first quarter. Unless I state differently, all metrics will be on a constant currency basis. Our first quarter results are summarized on Slide 2. Adjusted earnings were $0.57 per share,",1390,"Thank you, Richard. I'll begin by talking about our results for the first quarter. Unless I state differently, all metrics will be on a constant currency basis. 
Our first quarter results are summarized on Slide 2. Adjusted earnings were $0.57 per share, nearly double our guidance of $0.30 and almost triple Q1 of 2015's results. Net revenue yields were up 7% for the quarter, approximately 300 basis points higher than our guidance. 
This past quarter's results were exceptionally good, driven by continued strength in both ticket and onboard revenue as well as a weaker dollar and better fuel prices. 
On the ticket side, strength in North America resulted in significantly better-than-expected close-in demand and pricing for the Caribbean. Onboard revenue was up 8.7% for the quarter. While we saw year-over-year improvements in most key onboard revenue areas, beverage and Internet, led the majority of the out-performance. 
Cost for the quarter were in line with guidance. As we discussed on our last earnings call, costs metrics for the first quarter were expected to be higher year-over-year, driven by investments in China, timing of marketing and additional dry dock days. 
Below the line we saw continued out-performance from our equity investments. During the quarter, lower fuel prices and a weaker dollar contributed approximately $0.08 to the improvement. 
As previously discussed, we eliminated the Pullmantur's 2-month accounting lag during the first quarter of 2016. The negative impact to earnings of $0.10 per share was in line with the guidance provided on our last earnings call. This represents the results from November and December of 2015 and has been adjusted out of the company's key metrics.
Now, I will turn to the demand environment for the balance of 2016. During our last call, we shared that WAVE was off to a good start. This trend continued throughout the first quarter and certainly contributed to our strong yield performance in Q1. We are now approximately 80% booked for the year with both load factor and pricing at a similar level to same time last year. 
When adjusting for China, which is a much closer-in booking environment, we are ahead in both volume and rate for the balance of 2016. Additionally, our guest continue to plan their vacations further out. Over the past quarter, our booking window has extended even further and is at its highest levels yet.
Our product mix in the back half of the year is weighted more towards the Caribbean and high-yielding China itineraries than it was last year, and we also have less exposure to the weaker Latin America market. 
Q3 and Q4 include the full benefit of 2 newbuild entering the fleet. In May, Ovation of the Seas will begin her 53-day repositioning sailing to her new home in Tianjin, China. Harmony of the Seas will be in the Mediterranean this summer before repositioning to the Caribbean in early Q4.
The China market is highly anticipating the arrival of Ovation of the Seas in Tianjin at the end of June. Overall, trends for China are within our expected range, albeit at the lower end of sailings from Shanghai. That said, we've sold a higher percentage of China inventory over the past 3 months than we sold during the same period last year. As a whole, the portfolio is still expected to deliver yields significantly above the average and continues to command a significant premium in the China market. 
Our Winter 2016, 2017 Australia sailings have seen a strong early demand at rates that are similar to last year, despite continued capacity growth in the market. 
Moving to Europe. Demand for Mediterranean sailings hasn't been strong, particularly from European point-of-sale and load factor is ahead of last year. However, recent geopolitical events did have an impact on booking volumes in the United States. While bookings have now returned to typical levels, we had to lower pricing in shift sourcing to recover the volume loss during the initial low in demand. 
Our global presence enable us to quickly adjust our sourcing activities but our rate has been impacted since North American consumers typically pay more for our European cruises than guests source more locally. As a result, we have lowered our yield expectations for these itineraries. 
Outside of the Mediterranean, the European business is far more encouraging with volumes and rate both in a good position for the Baltics. 
North American-based products account for just over half of our 2016 capacity and are proving to be another bright spot this year. As I mentioned, we did see a softening in demand for Europe cruises following the events in Brussels. However, overall demand for cruising for North American consumer remains extremely strong and our Caribbean, Alaska and Bermuda itineraries are each poised to have a strong year and generate a nice yield improvements. 
The Caribbean performed extraordinarily well in Q1 and the balance of the year is also in a strong book position. There's particularly strong interest in Harmony of the Seas, which begins her sailings in the Caribbean during the fourth quarter. Alaska and Bermuda are booked nicely ahead of same time last year in both occupancy and pricing.
Anthem of the Seas will sail to Bermuda from Cape Liberty through the summer and is receiving strong demand at superior phrases. And we are also trending toward a record yielding Alaska season.
If you turn to Slide 3, you will see our updated guidance for full year 2016. Net revenue yields are expected to grow 2.5% to 4%, an increase relative to previous expectations. This guidance incorporates the robust Q1 performance, partially offset by a reduction in expectations for the Mediterranean. As is always the case, performance will vary a bit across products and by quarter but on the whole, the balance of the portfolio is relatively on par with previous expectation. 
From a cost perspective, we are anticipating net cruise cost, excluding fuel, to be up approximately 1%, which is slightly higher than previous expectations driven mainly by the delay in the start date of Empress of the Seas. 
We anticipate fuel expense of $734 million for the year and we are 65% hedged. Since our last earnings call, fuel prices have modestly increased, while the dollar has weakened relative to our basket of currencies. The combination of these 2 factors is contributing approximately $0.15 to our full year earnings, of which $0.08 was realized in Q1. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $6.15 to $6.35, $0.25 higher than the previous guidance. The $6.25 midpoint represents a 33% improvement in earnings per share, further strengthening our position to reach Double-Double next year. 
Before we discuss second quarter guidance, I would like to give you an update on our $500 million share repurchase program. As of this call, we have repurchased $450 million in shares under the current authorization, leaving $50 million which will be spent opportunistically this year. We remain focused on improving shareholder returns and we will remain balanced between those efforts on our target to attain an investment-grade rating. 
Now we can turn to our guidance for the second quarter, which is on Slide 4. We expect net revenue yields to be up approximately 1% for the second quarter. There are several factors limiting yield growth for the quarter. While bookings volumes for the Mediterranean have recovered since the attack in Brussels, promotional activities were necessary to stimulate demand for close-in sailings. These weaker trends to the Mediterranean is having a disproportionate impact, especially in the second quarter. 
From a structural standpoint, there's a drag on Q2 yields from the high-yielding Holy Week sailings, which took place in March this year versus April last year. Also, we are introducing 2 new ships during the quarter, which involve a ramp-up of occupancy and a lower yielding long positioning sailing. As a result, we expect yield growth to be smaller in Q2 than in the back half of the year.
Net cruise cost, excluding fuel, are expected to be up approximately 2%. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter are expected to be approximately $1. 
With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session."

A good question I think it's difficult to pinpoint one of these different elements, so I think it's a combination of several factors. Certainly, some of the softness that we see in Europe, I think, the Caribbean is the beneficiary of that, a lot of the Americas that previously were planning on going to Europe are now going to the Caribbean, so that's great, they're also going to Alaska. We've got great hardware in the Caribbean and the American market this year, so we've moved some of those ships around with Anthem in New York and Harmony in Port Canaveral in the fourth quarter with a lower in Port Canaveral, Oasis in Port Canaveral, Liberty that we've just revitalized sailing out of Galveston. So I think the combination of the quality of the brand, the hardware, some of the softness in Europe has really buoyed up the demand from the American market for the products in the Caribbean."

On the Internet side, they'll be more and more Royal ships that will have VOOM as we go into Q2 and beyond. And also, in the first quarter, Celebrity introduced Xlerate, that's with x, which is not to the same level as the VOOM but is far superior to the Internet capabilities relative to the competitive set.

So we've done a lot of a work in building the brand. I think there's this question about supply and demand and then, of course, distribution. When you look at supply, obviously, we tend to get anxious because more capacity is coming into the market but I think really the question is how much demand is in the marketplace. What we see, if you look at just of the sheer size of outbound market in China, it's the largest outbound market in the world and it's been  growing at an incredible rate, cruise is part of that outbound market is really quite tiny, it's relatively small. We believe that the opportunity for cruise is quite significant in terms of the long-term development, and that's why we've been in the market for 9 years. So we're quite optimistic about the future of China as a marketplace. And I think we've been quite careful and strategic about the decisions that we've made. I think when we introduced Quantum last year, that was really proved to be a successful decision, customers come into the travel agents request Quantum, request Ovation and request Royal Caribbean.

And so it's hard to predict when any involvement in Cuba would have become part of our business. And as we've tried to express on previous dialogues, Cuba's infrastructure is very, very limited in terms of the overall amount of capacity that it can take.

It's a pleasure to have the chance to provide more color on the quarter and to talk about our direction going forward.
Internally, we start almost meeting talking about the Double-Double, and I'm going to follow that practice here as well. Obviously, it's gratifying to report results that is so much higher than we have ever enjoyed in any winter quarter in our history, and it actually strengthens our confidence in our ability to reach these targets. As a reminder, our Double-Double Program established targets to double our 2014 earnings per share and to reach double-digit ROIC by 2017, that means earnings per share next year in excess of $6.78 and ROIC of 10% or better. The results that we are reporting today not only bring us closer to those goals, but they also demonstrate how powerful our brands are and how well they're doing.
As gratifying as today's results are, I should also reiterate that we manage our business and we asses our performance on an annual basis, not on a quarterly one. We always have pluses and minuses affecting different seasons and different itineraries. In today's case, we're in a happy position that just about everything in the quarter that could have gone right did. Ticket revenue was stellar, onboard revenue was terrific, costs were well controlled and even below the line items helped.
While it's impossible to isolate out some things, it's interesting to note that strong last-minute demand helped our bookings, at the same time where we were simultaneously enforcing our price integrity program. It's very validating to me that we saw such strong close-in demand for products like the Caribbean despite our program designed to eliminate last-minute discounts. A key driver of our future success continues to be the success of our executional efforts.
Execution is everything and it's going very well indeed. Our brands are firing on all cylinders, costs are well controlled and our new ships are getting rave reviews. As a result, our guests are coming back in ever-increasing numbers, and we're raising the demand from those who have never cruised before. I'd like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the men and women at Royal Caribbean, at sea and on land, who are working so hard and so well every single day. The key to the Double-Double and the key to our success beyond Double-Double is our ability to execute at the highest level. We are indebted to all of them for doing so.
Of course, as always is the case, some markets do better than others. This year, we've seen particularly good results in the U.S. markets. We've seen some weakness in the Mediterranean sailings but strength in the Caribbean, Baltic and Alaska. China continues to be one of our great success stories and now represents 9% of our capacity. The market there has received the Royal Caribbean International brand exceptionally well and that market continues to grow at extraordinary rates.
Brand image is particularly important in China, and we have been very pleased with the exceptional position Royal Caribbean has earned there. Total industry capacity in China over just the last 2 years has more than quadrupled, that's an extraordinary amount for any market to absorb. Against that background, the fact that our yields have held up there as well as they have is powerful evidence of the scale of the opportunity. Now in 2017 and '18, industry capacity growth drops to only about 50% per year and that gives us further comfort about the future there.
Most importantly, I believe our unique strategy in China is working very well. Firstly, we have brought to the market the best ships, the biggest, the baddest and the newest. The Chinese appreciate that we have acted so positively towards their country, and that has enabled us to establish an unusually strong first-mover advantage.
Secondly, we worked hard to educate and assist the distribution system there. We haven't just taken advantage of existing channels, but we've actively worked to make them more successful. We have the largest team in China dedicated to training and supporting the distribution system. That helps the travel agents be successful and help them sell our product.
Lastly, we have aggressively invested in ways to link us more directly with the end consumer and help establish a deeper connection with our guests. All of this has enabled us to communicate successfully what makes Royal Caribbean better, different and special.
A few weeks ago, we took delivery of Ovation of the Seas and in 2 weeks, we will take delivery of Harmony of the Seas. Extraordinary. Ovation is simply magnificent. The reaction has been overwhelming to her numerous innovation, such as RipCord by iFly; VOOM, the fastest Internet at sea; the amazing Lounge Two70°; and 18 restaurants, which our guests can choose amongst. The Chinese public appreciate that Royal Caribbean took the lead in bringing new hardware to China. And Ovation will be the first to ship -- cruise ship to be named there by the very famous singer-actress, Fan Bingbing.
Delivery of Harmony of the Seas in 2 weeks should be just as exciting, albeit on this side of the world. She builds on the incredible success of our Oasis series of ships, and she's one of the most anticipated new ships of the year.
Lastly, in June, we are very excited to be taking delivery of TUI Cruises' newest ship, Mein Schiff 5. TUI Cruises continue to perform exceptionally well in the German market and this vessel will add to its success.
Before I turn the call back to Jason, there's one last item I wish to cover. For a company to be successful in today's world, it's important that we not only do it right, but we also do the right thing. At Royal Caribbean, ethical leadership is an important part of our worldview. It is something that matters to our people, but it is a different metric to measure. Fortunately, this organization called the Ethisphere Institute and it was organized specifically for the purpose of encouraging good corporate stewardship. I am, therefore, extremely pleased that Ethisphere recognized Royal Caribbean in 2016 as one of the world's most ethical companies. We value this honor and we continue -- we intend to continue following our mantra of continuous improvement.
With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call back to Jason. Jason?"
325643,331645302,967896,"Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Richard. I will begin by talking about our results for the first quarter. Unless I state differently, all metrics will be on a constant currency basis.Our first quarter results are summarized on Slide 2. Adjusted earnings were $0.57 per share",1389,"Thank you, Richard. I will begin by talking about our results for the first quarter. Unless I state differently, all metrics will be on a constant currency basis.
Our first quarter results are summarized on Slide 2. Adjusted earnings were $0.57 per share, nearly double our guidance of $0.30 and almost triple Q1 of 2015's results. Net revenue yields were up 7% for the quarter, approximately 300 basis points higher than our guidance. This past quarter's results were exceptionally good, driven by continued strength in both ticket and onboard revenue as well as a weaker dollar and better fuel prices.
On the ticket side, strength in North America resulted in significantly better-than-expected close-in demand and pricing for the Caribbean. Onboard revenue was up 8.7% for the quarter. While we saw year-over-year improvements in most key onboard revenue areas, beverage and Internet led the majority of the outperformance.
Costs for the quarter were in line with guidance. As we discussed on our last earnings call, cost metrics for the first quarter were expected to be higher year-over-year, driven by investments in China, timing of marketing and additional dry dock days. Below the line, we saw continued outperformance from our equity investments. During the quarter, lower fuel prices and a weaker dollar contributed approximately $0.08 to the improvement. 
As previously discussed, we eliminated Pullmantur's 2-month accounting lag during the first quarter of 2016. The negative impact to earnings of $0.10 per share was in line with the guidance provided on our last earnings call. This represents the results from November and December of 2015 and has been adjusted out of the company's key metrics.
Now I will turn to the demand environment for the balance of 2016. During our last call, we shared that WAVE was off to a good start. This trend continued throughout the first quarter and certainly contributed to our strong yield performance in Q1. We are now approximately 80% booked for the year with both load factor and pricing at a similar level to the same time last year.
When adjusting for China, which is a much closer-in booking environment, we are ahead in both volume and rate for the balance of 2016. Additionally, our guests continue to plan their vacations further out. Over the past quarter, our booking window has extended even further and is at its highest levels yet.
Our product mix in the back half of the year is weighted more towards the Caribbean and high-yielding China itineraries than it was last year, and we also have less exposure to the weaker Latin America market.
Q3 and Q4 include the full benefit of 2 newbuilds entering the fleet. In May, Ovation of the Seas will begin her 53-day repositioning, sailing to her new home in Tianjin, China. Harmony of the Seas will be in the Mediterranean this summer before repositioning to the Caribbean in early Q4.
The China market is highly anticipating the arrival of Ovation of the Seas in Tianjin at the end of June. Overall, trends for China are within our expected range, albeit at the lower end of sailings from Shanghai. That said, we've sold a higher percentage of China inventory over the past 3 months than we sold during the same period last year. As a whole, the portfolio is still expected to deliver yields significantly above the average and continues to command a significant premium in the China market. Our winter 2016/2017 Australia sailings have seen strong early demand at rates that are similar to last year despite continued capacity growth in the market.
Moving to Europe. Demand for Mediterranean sailings has been strong, particularly from European point-of-sale and load factors ahead of last year. However, recent geopolitical events did have an impact on booking volumes in the United States. While bookings have now returned to typical levels, we had to lower pricing and shift sourcing to recover the volume lost during the initial lull in demand.
Our global presence enabled us to quickly adjust our sourcing activities, but our rate has been impacted since North American consumers typically pay more for our European cruises than guests sourced more locally. As a result, we have lowered our yield expectations for these itineraries. Outside of the Mediterranean, the European business is far more encouraging with volumes and rate both in a good position for the Baltics.
North American based products account for just over half of our 2016 capacity and are proving to be another bright spot this year. As I mentioned, we did see a softening in demand for Europe cruises following the events in Brussels. However, overall demand for cruising for North American consumers remains extremely strong and our Caribbean, Alaska and Bermuda itineraries are each poised to have a strong year and generate a nice yield improvements.
The Caribbean performed extraordinarily well in Q1 and the balance of the year is also in a strong book position. There's particularly strong interest in Harmony of the Seas, which begins her sailings in the Caribbean during the fourth quarter. Alaska and Bermuda are booked nicely ahead of same time last year in both occupancy and pricing. Anthem of the Seas will sail to Bermuda from Cape Liberty throughout the summer and is receiving strong demand at superior prices. And we are also trending toward a record-yielding Alaska season.
If you turn to Slide 3, you will see our updated guidance for full year 2016. Net revenue yields are expected to grow 2.5% to 4%, an increase relative to previous expectations. This guidance incorporates the robust Q1 performance, partially offset by a reduction in expectations for the Mediterranean. As is always the case, performance will vary a bit across products and by quarter. But on the whole, the balance of the portfolio is relatively on par with the previous expectation.
From a cost perspective, we are anticipating net cruise cost, excluding fuel, to be up approximately 1%, which is slightly higher than previous expectations driven mainly by the delay in the start date of Empress of the Seas. We anticipate fuel expense of $734 million for the year and we are 65% hedged. Since our last earnings call, fuel prices have modestly increased, while the dollar has weakened relative to our basket of currencies. The combination of these 2 factors is contributing approximately $0.15 to our full year earnings, of which $0.08 was realized in Q1.
Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $6.15 to $6.35, $0.25 higher than the previous guidance. The $6.25 midpoint represents a 33% improvement in earnings per share, further strengthening our position to reach Double-Double next year.
Before we discuss second quarter guidance, I would like to give you an update on our $500 million share repurchase program. As of this call, we have repurchased $450 million in shares under the current authorization, leaving $50 million which will be spent opportunistically this year. We remain focused on improving shareholder returns, and we will remain balanced between those efforts on our target to attain an investment-grade rating.
Now we can turn to our guidance for the second quarter, which is on Slide 4. We expect net revenue yields to be up approximately 1% for the second quarter. There are several factors limiting yield growth for the quarter. While booking volumes for the Mediterranean have recovered since the attacks in Brussels, promotional activities were necessary to stimulate demand for closer-in sailings. These weaker trends to the Mediterranean are having a disproportionate impact, especially in the second quarter.
From a structural standpoint, there's a drag on Q2 yields from the high-yielding Holy Week sailings, which took place in March this year versus April last year. Also, we are introducing 2 new ships during the quarter, which involve a ramp-up of occupancy and a lower yielding long positioning sailing. As a result, we expect yield growth to be smaller in Q2 than in the back half of the year. Net cruise cost, excluding fuel, are expected to be up approximately 2%. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter are expected to be approximately $1.
With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session."

A lot of the Americans that previously were planning on going to Europe are now going to the Caribbean, so that's great, they're also going to Alaska. We've got great hardware in the Caribbean and the American market this year, so we've moved some of our ships around with Anthem in New York and Harmony in Port Canaveral in the fourth quarter with Allure in Port Canaveral, Oasis in Port Canaveral, Liberty that we've just revitalized sailing out of Galveston. So I think the combination of the quality of the brand, the hardware, some of the softness in Europe has really buoyed up the demand from the American market for the products in the Caribbean."

On the Internet side, there'll be more and more Royal ships that will have VOOM as we go into Q2 and beyond. And also, in the first quarter, Celebrity introduced Xcelerate, that's with an X, which is not to the same level as VOOM but is far superior to the Internet capabilities relative to the competitive set.

But I think almost every investor meeting I have, I get asked this question, so I think it's worth addressing. I was just wondering if for a moment you could talk about the company's commitment to region and the industry's commitment to the region because there is a lot of investor concern that if pricing doesn't remain its premiums [ph] or if pricing comes down, we all know that [ph] there's supply coming on, will the cruise lines back off in their commitment to the region? And ultimately, could it affect the supply-demand balance of the industry facing the rest -- today elsewhere? So I was just wondering if you could talk about how you're thinking about the China investment. And is there a realistic scenario where that commitment changes?"

I think it's a great question. We've been in the China market now for nearly 9 years, and we've been investing in the market, building distribution, building our sales presence, building our relationships and more importantly, building the brand and building a good customer base. And I think as we said previously, we've done very well in the market in terms of being the recipient of the Best Cruise Line for 8 years in a row, the recipient of the Best Premium Cruise Line. So we've done a lot of work in building the brand. I think there's this question about supply and demand and then, of course, distribution. When you look at supply, obviously, we tend to get at times anxious because more capacity is coming into the market. But I think really the question is how much demand is in the marketplace. What we see, if you look at just the sheer size of the outbound market in China, it's the largest outbound market in the world and it's been growing at an incredible rate. Cruise as part of that outbound market is really quite tiny, it's relatively small. We believe that the opportunity for cruise is quite significant in terms of the long-term development, and that's why we've been in the market for 9 years. So we're quite optimistic about the future of China as a marketplace. And I think we've been quite careful and strategic about the decisions that we've made. I think when we introduced Quantum last year, that was really -- proved to be a successful decision. Customers come into the travel agents and request Quantum, request Ovation and request Royal Caribbean. So our commitment is quite strong to the development of China in the future as a marketplace."

SkySea, the name of the cruise line that is our venture with Ctrip, will be coming up on its first anniversary in about 3 weeks. And so she's a very, very young cruise line with one ship and doesn't have the kind of presence yet on the Chinese market that would even compare to Royal Caribbean International, as Michael has been discussing. So we hope to build a different profile of clients, a client that understands that this is a primarily Chinese-owned venture and will offer certain opportunities, whether it's through technology or in the guest experience that will be differentiating in the marketplace but it's very early days still. We'll have to see how the second season goes and we hope to be able to grow SkySea in the future."

And so in that is -- are more quality bookings and some of that is because of the reconditioning of the consumer, knowing that we're not going to be discounting close-in.

And so it's hard to predict when any involvement in Cuba would have become part of our business. And as we tried to express on previous dialogues, Cuba's infrastructure is very, very limited in terms of the overall amount of capacity that it can take. If it develops well over the years coming, eventually, it probably can become one of the mainstay marquee Caribbean regions, but that's a long way off.

Certainly, the China business is very positive for our overall business.

So when we look into '17, for example, I think Richard had mentioned that growth for the industry in '17 is closer to 50% versus the close to 100% over the past few years. So capacity is slightly -- overall growth is slowing a little bit in '17. For Royal Caribbean International, we've already announced our deployment for '17.

During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which have been posted on our investor website, www.rclinvestor.com.
Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filing and other disclosures. Also, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined and a reconciliation of these items can be found on our website.
Richard will begin by providing a strategic overview of the business. I will follow with a recap of our first quarter results, provide an update on the booking environment and then provide an update on our full year and second quarter guidance for 2016. We will then open the call for your questions. Richard?"

It's a pleasure to have the chance to provide more color on the quarter and to talk about our direction going forward.Internally, we start almost every meeting talking about the Double-Double, and I'm going to",1076,"Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everybody. It's a pleasure to have the chance to provide more color on the quarter and to talk about our direction going forward.
Internally, we start almost every meeting talking about the Double-Double, and I'm going to follow that practice here as well. Obviously, it's gratifying to report results that are so much higher than we have ever enjoyed in any winter quarter in our history, and it naturally strengthens our confidence in our ability to reach these targets. As a reminder, our Double-Double Program established targets to double our 2014 earnings per share and to reach double-digit ROIC by 2017, that means earnings per share next year in excess of $6.78 and ROIC of 10% or better. The results that we are reporting today not only bring us closer to those goals, but they also demonstrate how powerful our brands are and how well they're doing.
As gratifying as today's results are, I should also reiterate that we manage our business and we assess our performance on an annual basis, not on a quarterly one. We always have pluses and minuses affecting different seasons and different itineraries. In today's case, we're in the happy position that just about everything in the quarter that could have gone right, did. Ticket revenue was stellar, onboard revenue was terrific, costs were well controlled and even below-the-line items helped.
While it's impossible to isolate out some things, it's interesting to note that strong last-minute demand helped our bookings, at the same time where we were simultaneously enforcing our price integrity program. It's very validating to me that we saw such strong close-in demand for products like the Caribbean despite our program designed to eliminate last-minute discounts. A key driver of our future success continues to be the success of our executional efforts.
Execution is everything and it's going very well indeed. Our brands are firing on all cylinders, costs are well controlled and our new ships are getting rave reviews. As a result, our guests are coming back in ever-increasing numbers, and we're raising the demand from those who have never cruised before. I'd like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to the men and women at Royal Caribbean, at sea and on land, who are working so hard and so well every single day. The key to the Double-Double and the key to our success beyond Double-Double is our ability to execute at the highest level. We are indebted to all of them for doing so.
Of course, as always is the case, some markets do better than others. This year, we've seen particularly good results in the U.S. markets. We've seen some weakness in the Mediterranean sailings but strength in the Caribbean, Baltic and Alaska. China continues to be one of our great success stories and now represents 9% of our capacity. The market there has received the Royal Caribbean International brand exceptionally well and that market continues to grow at extraordinary rates.
Brand image is particularly important in China, and we have been very pleased with the exceptional position Royal Caribbean has earned there. Total industry capacity in China over just the last 2 years has more than quadrupled, that's an extraordinary amount for any market to absorb. Against that background, the fact that our yields have held up there as well as they have is powerful evidence of the scale of the opportunity. Now in 2017 and '18, industry capacity growth drops to only about 50% per year and that gives us further comfort about the future there.
Most importantly, I believe our unique strategy in China is working very well. Firstly, we have brought to the market the best ships, the biggest, the baddest and the newest. The Chinese appreciate that we have acted so positively towards their country, and that has enabled us to establish an unusually strong first-mover advantage.
Secondly, we have worked hard to educate and assist the distribution system there. We haven't just taken advantage of existing channels, but we've actively worked to make them more successful. We have the largest team in China dedicated to training and supporting the distribution system. That helps the travel agents be successful and helps them sell our product.
Lastly, we have aggressively invested in ways to link us more directly with the end consumer and help establish a deeper connection with our guests. All of this has enabled us to communicate successfully what makes Royal Caribbean better, different and special.
A few weeks ago, we took delivery of Ovation of the Seas and in 2 weeks, we will take delivery of Harmony of the Seas. Extraordinary. Ovation is simply magnificent. The reaction has been overwhelming to her numerous innovation, such as RipCord by iFly; VOOM, the fastest Internet at sea; the amazing Lounge Two70°; and 18 restaurants, which our guests can choose amongst. The Chinese public appreciate that Royal Caribbean took the lead in bringing new hardware to China. And Ovation will be the first to ship -- cruise ship to be named there by the very famous singer-actress, Fan Bingbing.
Delivery of Harmony of the Seas in 2 weeks should be just as exciting, albeit on this side of the world. She builds on the incredible success of our Oasis series of ships, and she's one of the most anticipated new ships of the year.
Lastly, in June, we are very excited to be taking delivery of TUI Cruises' newest ship, Mein Schiff 5. TUI Cruises continue to perform exceptionally well in the German market and this vessel will add to its success.
Before I turn the call back to Jason, there's one last item I wish to cover. For a company to be successful in today's world, it's important that we not only do it right, but we also do the right thing. At Royal Caribbean, ethical leadership is an important part of our worldview. It is something that matters to our people, but it is a different metric to measure. Fortunately, there's an organization called the Ethisphere Institute and it was organized specifically for the purpose of encouraging good corporate stewardship. I am, therefore, extremely pleased that Ethisphere recognized Royal Caribbean in 2016 as one of the world's most ethical companies. We value this honor and we continue -- we intend to continue following our mantra of continuous improvement.
With that, it is my pleasure to turn the call back to Jason. Jason?"
325643,331645302,968196,"Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Richard. I will begin by talking about our results for the first quarter. Unless I state differently, all metrics will be on a constant currency basis.Our first quarter results are summarized on Slide 2. Adjusted earnings were $0.57 per share",1388,"Thank you, Richard. I will begin by talking about our results for the first quarter. Unless I state differently, all metrics will be on a constant currency basis.
Our first quarter results are summarized on Slide 2. Adjusted earnings were $0.57 per share, nearly double our guidance of $0.30 and almost triple Q1 of 2015's results. Net revenue yields were up 7% for the quarter, approximately 300 basis points higher than our guidance. This past quarter's results were exceptionally good, driven by continued strength in both ticket and onboard revenue as well as a weaker dollar and better fuel prices.
On the ticket side, strength in North America resulted in significantly better-than-expected close-in demand and pricing for the Caribbean. Onboard revenue was up 8.7% for the quarter. While we saw year-over-year improvements in most key onboard revenue areas, beverage and Internet led the majority of the outperformance.
Costs for the quarter were in line with guidance. As we discussed on our last earnings call, cost metrics for the first quarter were expected to be higher year-over-year, driven by investments in China, timing of marketing and additional dry dock days. Below the line, we saw continued outperformance from our equity investments. During the quarter, lower fuel prices and a weaker dollar contributed approximately $0.08 to the improvement. 
As previously discussed, we eliminated Pullmantur's 2-month accounting lag during the first quarter of 2016. The negative impact to earnings of $0.10 per share was in line with the guidance provided on our last earnings call. This represents the results from November and December of 2015 and has been adjusted out of the company's key metrics.
Now I will turn to the demand environment for the balance of 2016. During our last call, we shared that WAVE was off to a good start. This trend continued throughout the first quarter and certainly contributed to our strong yield performance in Q1. We are now approximately 80% booked for the year with both load factor and pricing at a similar level to the same time last year.
When adjusting for China, which is a much closer-in booking environment, we are ahead in both volume and rate for the balance of 2016. Additionally, our guests continue to plan their vacations further out. Over the past quarter, our booking window has extended even further and is at its highest levels yet.
Our product mix in the back half of the year is weighted more towards the Caribbean and high-yielding China itineraries than it was last year, and we also have less exposure to the weaker Latin America market.
Q3 and Q4 include the full benefit of 2 newbuilds entering the fleet. In May, Ovation of the Seas will begin her 53-day repositioning, sailing to her new home in Tianjin, China. Harmony of the Seas will be in the Mediterranean this summer before repositioning to the Caribbean in early Q4.
The China market is highly anticipating the arrival of Ovation of the Seas in Tianjin at the end of June. Overall, trends for China are within our expected range, albeit at the lower end for sailings from Shanghai. That said, we've sold a higher percentage of China inventory over the past 3 months than we sold during the same period last year. As a whole, the portfolio is still expected to deliver yields significantly above the average and continues to command a significant premium in the China market. Our winter 2016/2017 Australia sailings have seen strong early demand at rates that are similar to last year despite continued capacity growth in the market.
Moving to Europe. Demand for Mediterranean sailings has been strong, particularly from European points-of-sale [ph] and load factors ahead of last year. However, recent geopolitical events did have an impact on booking volumes in the United States. While bookings have now returned to typical levels, we had to lower pricing and shift sourcing to recover the volume lost during the initial lull in demand.
Our global presence enabled us to quickly adjust our sourcing activities, but our rate has been impacted since North American consumers typically pay more for our European cruises than guests sourced more locally. As a result, we have lowered our yield expectations for these itineraries. Outside of the Mediterranean, the European business is far more encouraging with volumes and rate both in a good position for the Baltics.
North American based products account for just over half of our 2016 capacity and are proving to be another bright spot this year. As I mentioned, we did see a softening in demand for Europe cruises following the events in Brussels. However, overall demand for cruising for North American consumers remains extremely strong and our Caribbean, Alaska and Bermuda itineraries are each poised to have a strong year and generate nice yield improvements.
The Caribbean performed extraordinarily well in Q1 and the balance of the year is also in a strong book position. There's particularly strong interest in Harmony of the Seas, which begins her sailings in the Caribbean during the fourth quarter. Alaska and Bermuda are booked nicely ahead of same time last year in both occupancy and pricing. Anthem of the Seas will sail to Bermuda from Cape Liberty throughout the summer and is receiving strong demand at superior prices. And we are also trending towards a record-yielding Alaska season.
If you turn to Slide 3, you will see our updated guidance for full year 2016. Net revenue yields are expected to grow 2.5% to 4%, an increase relative to previous expectations. This guidance incorporates the robust Q1 performance, partially offset by a reduction in expectations for the Mediterranean. As is always the case, performance will vary a bit across products and by quarter. But on the whole, the balance of the portfolio is relatively on par with previous expectations.
From a cost perspective, we are anticipating net cruise costs, excluding fuel, to be up approximately 1%, which is slightly higher than previous expectations driven mainly by the delay in the start date of Empress of the Seas. We anticipate fuel expense of $734 million for the year and we are 65% hedged. Since our last earnings call, fuel prices have modestly increased, while the dollar has weakened relative to our basket of currencies. The combination of these 2 factors is contributing approximately $0.15 to our full year earnings, of which $0.08 was realized in Q1.
Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $6.15 to $6.35, $0.25 higher than the previous guidance. The $6.25 midpoint represents a 33% improvement in earnings per share, further strengthening our position to reach Double-Double next year.
Before we discuss second quarter guidance, I would like to give you an update on our $500 million share repurchase program. As of this call, we have repurchased $450 million in shares under the current authorization, leaving $50 million which will be spent opportunistically this year. We remain focused on improving shareholder returns, and we will remain balanced between those efforts on our target to attain an investment-grade rating.
Now we can turn to our guidance for the second quarter, which is on Slide 4. We expect net revenue yields to be up approximately 1% for the second quarter. There are several factors limiting yield growth for the quarter. While booking volumes for the Mediterranean have recovered since the attacks in Brussels, promotional activities were necessary to stimulate demand for closer-in sailings. These weaker trends to the Mediterranean are having a disproportionate impact, especially in the second quarter.
From a structural standpoint, there's a drag on Q2 yields from the high-yielding Holy Week sailings, which took place in March this year versus April last year. Also, we are introducing 2 new ships during the quarter, which involve a ramp-up of occupancy and a lower yielding long positioning sailing. As a result, we expect yield growth to be smaller in Q2 than in the back half of the year. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be up approximately 2%. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter are expected to be approximately $1.
With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session."

A lot of the Americans that previously were planning on going to Europe are now going to the Caribbean, so that's great, they're also going to Alaska. We've got great hardware in the Caribbean and the American market this year, so we've moved some of our ships around with Anthem in New York and Harmony in Port Canaveral in the fourth quarter with Allure in Port Canaveral, Oasis in Port Canaveral, Liberty that we've just revitalized sailing out of Galveston.

On the Internet side, there'll be more and more Royal ships that will have VOOM as we go into Q2 and beyond. And also, in the first quarter, Celebrity introduced Xcelerate, that's with an X, which is not to the same level as VOOM but is far superior to the Internet capabilities relative to the competitive set.

As it relates to the core, I would say the majority of the yield growth what -- I would say majority meaning greater than 50% of the yield growth -- is coming from a new hardware that's coming online in the back half of the year. And I do want to stress the back half of the year because, though Ovation is now in our environment and Harmony will be in a couple of weeks, those ships do take some time to ramp up and also reposition."

I think it's a great question. We've been in the China market now for nearly 9 years, and we've been investing in the market, building distribution, building our sales presence, building our relationships and more importantly, building the brand and building a good customer base. And I think as we've said previously, we've done very well in the market in terms of being the recipient of the Best Cruise Line for 8 years in a row, the recipient of the Best Premium Cruise Line. So we've done a lot of work in building the brand. I think there's this question about supply and demand and then, of course, distribution. When you look at supply, obviously, we tend to get at times anxious because more capacity is coming into the market. But I think really the question is how much demand is in the marketplace. What we see, if you look at just the sheer size of the outbound market in China, it's the largest outbound market in the world and it's been growing at an incredible rate. Cruise as part of that outbound market is really quite tiny, it's relatively small. We believe that the opportunity for cruise is quite significant in terms of the long-term development, and that's why we've been in the market for 9 years. So we're quite optimistic about the future of China as a marketplace. And I think we've been quite careful and strategic about the decisions that we've made. I think when we introduced Quantum last year, that was really -- proved to be a successful decision. Customers come into the travel agents and request Quantum, request Ovation and request Royal Caribbean. So our commitment is quite strong to the development of China in the future as a marketplace."

So when we look into '17, for example, I think Richard had mentioned that growth for the industry in '17 is closer to 50% versus the close to 100% over the past few years. So capacity is slightly -- overall growth is slowing a little bit in '17. For Royal Caribbean International, we've already announced our deployment for '17. And overall, I think we're up about 8% or 9% in the market in '17."

As always, it's a pleasure to speak with you all this morning, give you a little color on our business, and I would like to say thank you for participating. 
As you know, it's been an exciting quarter for us with the delivery of not 1, but 3 new ships: Ovation of the Seas, Harmony of the Seas, and Mein Schiff 5 for our new joint venture -- for our joint venture, TUI Cruises. All 3 ships were very well received, and it's interesting to note that by chance, all these 3 ships each entered vastly different markets. That's an interesting reminder of the role that market segmentation and diversification plays in our overall strategy.  
I'd like to revert to that topic in a moment, but first, I want to comment on the quarter itself and beyond. I'll start by commenting on the fact that we exceeded guidance for the quarter by $0.09 a share, and our business looks set to do better for the year than we expected. Foreign exchange and fuel costs are eating away at some of the operational improvements this year, particularly as the affirmative vote for Brexit caused such a dramatic fall in sterling. But overall, we would rate this year as another one for the plus column, with business consistent with expectations, including the usual swings and roundabouts in individual markets. 
Commercially, the Eastern Med and China have experienced softness, while the Baltic, western Mediterranean, Caribbean and Alaska have been strong. This is particularly important because these latter products represent over 60% of our business, and having strength in your biggest market is what every commercial person prays for. 
Part of that strength has been driven by our price integrity program, which gives guests and travel partners more confidence in the integrity of our pricing and which also encourages earlier booking. This longer booking window also helps us make better and more effective pricing decisions. 
We're also mindful that next year, the markets have performed the very best this year, such as the Caribbean for example, are only seeing modest capacity increases, while Eastern Med capacity, for example, is dropping by double digits. 
China's capacity next year is slated to grow, but that growth is at only half of this year's exceptional level. 
Now shifting focus to the Double-Double, I hope and I assume that everyone on this call knows that this is our internal program to double our 2014 earnings per share and to achieving double-digit ROIC by 2017. Our program will accomplish that continues to focus on the same 3 pillars: Yield improvement, effective cost control and modest capacity growth. 
The Double-Double Program is working for us and, as we approach the final year of the program, our confidence in these targets remains firm. 
Personally, I like to focus on the numbers. There, of course, needs to be good qualitative reasons for the numbers, but in the end, it's the numbers that speak for themselves. The story behind the numbers is important but the figures remain our beacon. And the figures are encouraging. Capacity growth is pretty much fixed, and our brands are satisfying our customers and attracting new ones at the best rate in our history. In order to meet our Double-Double objective next year, what we need is low, single-digit yield improvement and moderate spending. That's the formula we have been delivering, and that's the formula we believe we can continue to deliver. 
One other factor that comes into play recently is our sale of 51% of the Pullmantur Group. Jason will take through more details in a moment, so I will simply say that this move is a step in a more profitable direction, and we are optimistic about the future for this new venture. 
Now given the enormous attention that's been focused on China, I think it's worth spending a little time on the development of this market and comparing it to some other markets. As it happens, I have the history of having been personally involved with the development of so many of the cruise markets around the world, and I'd like to comment on how the historical evolution of those markets compares with how China has developed so far and how it appears that China will be developing for the foreseeable future. 
First of all, it is striking how many parallels there are in China's evolution today compared to other places and other times where we have developed a market for cruising. For example, today, we view North America as a developed marketplace of cruises with a strong awareness level and a well-established sales and marketing network. However, when I first got involved with cruising, none of that was true, rather it looked a lot like what China looks like today. It was poorly known to the population at large, distribution was to a small number of specialist agencies, there was little choice of itineraries, and growth was episodic and dictated by the arrival of new ships. An observer today would say virtually the same thing about the China market as it is now. The percent of Chinese, even the percent of middle-class Chinese, who have cruised remains infinitesimal. And just like the States, the main way we attract new customers is by thrilling the old customers. In the States, the reputation of cruising grew because people came back from their holiday and raved about their experience. We advertise, of course, but most people tried it for the first time because their neighbor pushed them to do so, or their coworker did, or maybe it was their brother-in-law. The point is when somebody cruise, he or she became an advocate for cruising, and the market grew the same way as a snowball grows. That snowballing effect is also key to developing new markets. New markets like Britain and then Italy and then Germany. That same phenomena is occurring today in China. It may be happening more quickly in China but the process is remarkably similar. 
The second key dynamic is the role of a travel agent. In the States, Europe, et cetera, cruises were initially sold through niche travel agents who knew the business and were able to provide knowledge and assurance to a cautious public. It took a while for cruising to become a mainstream activity for travel agents but when it did, the industry really took off. 
These travel agents were the people who could inform and guide a nervous customer on what cruising was all about, and they could help the customer make the myriad important decisions that would be critical to their valuable vacation. 
That crucial travel agent link, that important part of cruise industry success, is still embryonic in China. But it, too, is growing, and I believe it will be key to our success there as it always has been here. 
And then, there was the issue of where to go. Originally, cruises had a very limited selection of routes and destinations. When Royal Caribbean was contemplating its fourth vessel, I recall that the board engaged in a great deal of handwringing about whether there would be enough itinerary and source markets in the U.S. for the addition of that fourth ship. We were worried that the interest in cruising would not grow beyond the established group of then-popular destinations. Eventually, we decided there would be enough destinations but it wasn't without trepidation. Today, we all look back on that concern and find it laughable, but then it was a real concern. 
Similarly in China, our catchment today for customers is small, and our itineraries are limited, but a quick look at a map shows just how enormous the potential really is. 
But the biggest question in the Western markets then, just like the biggest question in the China market today, is how quickly it can grow. The market growth rate in North America and Europe overall exceeded our expectations but it certainly, wasn't linear and we frequently experience periods of higher or lower demand growth, matched, or in some cases, not matched, by higher or lower periods of supply growth. These periods of matching or nonmatching growth naturally led to better or worse periods of revenue generations. 
In China, we've also seen such periods and I expect we will continue to do so. But like the early days in the United States, the periods of oversupply or under demand quickly got eliminated by the inexorable development of knowledge of the industry and the strong growth of the distribution system. 
But China is not the same as the U.S. and it's not the same as Europe. For one thing, everything that happens in China happens at China's speed. So where it took many years for Western travel agents to develop the infrastructure, the expertise and the breath that we enjoy today we're already seeing that process happening in China at a faster speed. 
For example, today, we work with 3x as many core operator partners as we did just 3 years ago. And in the same 3-year period, we had quadrupled the number of independent agencies we work with, from 200 to 800. That's nearly 1/4 of all the travel agents in China with a license to sell outbound travel. 
And the scale in China is different. In the West, we found that the market can grow quickly, but when we tried to introduce new capacity well into double digits, the market had trouble keeping up. In China, we've been growing at 40% and 50% growth rates without any difficulty. Those are pretty extraordinary levels, but this year, we, as an industry, have pushed those figures into triple digits. Even China has trouble growing at that pace. Fortunately, the softness in China is being driven mainly by this huge capacity growth rather than by faltering demand. That should make it an easier correction to make, and we are optimistic about our future there. I view the ability of China to fill twice as many cruise berths this year as it did last year as a sign of great strength. The fact that it can do so with only modest softness should be seen as evidence of strength, not weakness. 
Everybody knows the pace of change of the world today is exceptional. We have never seen a pace like this in history, and I like to point out that we never will again. The pace of change today is slower than we will ever see it again. Let me repeat that: The pace of change today is slower than we will ever see again. This is true in many areas and it is nowhere as evident as it is in China. 
Overall, we're very pleased with the way our cruises have been received by the consumers in China. We're also very pleased by the recognition that the Chinese government has given to the value of the cruise economy to China's overall economic expansion. We're particularly pleased by the very powerful brand presence and preference that Royal Caribbean International has achieved there. We expect to see this market continue to grow, and we expect to continue to grow with it. 
Now before I turn it over to Jason, I'd like to touch on one last point related to capacity growth. As I've just discussed, much of the capacity industry is being allocated to the Asia Pacific region. It stands to reason the growth of the industry in the Atlantic theater is more modest next year. From our own standpoint, there are significant declines in the European market, driven by the deconsolidation of the Pullmantur Group, the Harmony of the Seas deployment back to the Caribbean year round, the sale of the Legend of the Seas and keeping celebrity equinox in the Caribbean year-round. We also take comfort knowing that in the past when our growth has been driven by the introduction of an Oasis class ship as it is this year -- this coming year, our yields have not disappointed. 
With that, it's a pleasure to turn it back over to Jason. Jason?"

I will begin by taking you through our results for the second quarter. Unless I state differently, all our metrics will be on a constant-currency basis.
Second quarter results are summarized on Slide 2. For the quarter, we generated adjusted earnings of $1.09, which is $0.09 higher than guidance and 25% higher than same time last year. The outperformance was driven primarily by favorable fuel expenses and outperformance by TUI Cruises. Lower fuel rates were a key factor, however, lower consumption also contributed to the overall favorability. Net revenue yields were up 1.1%, which were in line with guidance. Onboard revenue yields continue to increase with beverage package sales and the expansion of streaming Internet products, like VOOM and Xcelerate, driving an 8.7% year-over-year increase.  Net cruise cost, excluding fuel, were also in line with guidance at 1.9% for the quarter. 
As discussed previously, we sustain higher cost in the first half of the year related to newbuild launch initiatives, investments in China and more drydock activity. 
Now I would like to walk you through current booking trends. Overall, trends are consistent with those discussed during our last call. And in the aggregate, our portfolio products remains about the same. However, just like in any portfolio, there had been some puts and takes at the itinerary level. Demand for North American products, which make up half of our capacity for the year, is unwavering in its strength, contributing to better-than-expected performance in the Caribbean, Alaska and Bermuda. On the other hand, geopolitical events in Europe continue to stress Eastern Mediterranean yields and close-in demand trends in the Shanghai market are softer than anticipated. At this point, we are over 93% booked for the year, with book load factor and APD in a strong position. 
Beginning with Europe, yields have held up nicely for Northern Europe and Western Mediterranean sailings this year, partially driven by the consistent strength and demand that we have seen from European markets. The U.K. to date key sourcing market for our Europe sailings and we have been closely monitoring demand since the Brexit decision. To date, we have not seen any softening in demand from the U.K. since the vote, and in fact, the U.K. remains one of our strongest markets this summer. 
Eastern Mediterranean itineraries, however, have experienced further weakness stemming from the multiple geopolitical events that have occurred in Europe. Not only have these put a strain on closing demand and pricing, but they have also led us to make operational changes such as shifting embarkation out of Istanbul for several sailings. 
Turning to China, we introduced Ovation of the Seas to Tianjin just over a month ago, and she is generating superior yields even by China standards. Overall, the pace of bookings for the remainder of the China season has mostly been within the expected range and above last year. However, there had been some softness in close-in demand in Shanghai in recent weeks. Nevertheless, our China sailings, which represent 9% of our capacity, continue to generate yields that are above average, has occupancy levels that are in-line with the fleet average and a market that's accretive to our yields and return on invested capital. 
Moving on to North America. Our Caribbean, Alaska and Bermuda itineraries account for about 50% of our full-year capacity and continue to trend very well. We expect each of these products to generate nice yield [ph] improvements this year, and also expect to see record yields in Alaska. We are generally seeing solid trends for our entire Caribbean portfolio which ranges from 3-night Bahama sailings to 14-night southern Caribbean itineraries. With the summer season coming to a close in the next few weeks, the focus will shift to the winter season, which is currently in a very strong position. Harmony of the Seas continue to impress and has garnered strong demand at increasing prices throughout Q4 and well into 2017. 
It is still very early in the booking cycle for 2017 sailings, however, I will share that we are encouraged by recent booking trends in our current book position. We are booked ahead of same time last year with both load factor and APD for the next 12 months. 
Before I update you on our guidance for the year and the third quarter, I would like to touch on the recent sale of 51% of the Pullmantur Group to Springwater Capital. The Pullmantur Group operates a more value-based product, which delivers yield and cost that are lower than our fleet average. Consequently, the deconsolidation of Pullmantur has increased our yield-to-cost metrics, and has an immaterial impact on earnings for this year. 
Now we can turn to our updated guidance for full-year 2016 which is on Slide 4. Net revenue yields are expected to grow 4% to 4.5%, an increase versus prior guidance driven by the deconsolidation of the Pullmantur Group. Strong demand for North American products is helping to offset some slightly weaker trend in the Eastern Mediterranean and Shanghai. These product level trends are stressing Q3 yield growth but are providing strong tailwinds for Q4 where our mix of itineraries more closely resembles the first quarter. Net cruise cost, excluding fuel, are unchanged, and are expected to be up approximately 1%. Cost savings in the third and fourth quarters are offsetting the increase driven by the Pullmantur deconsolidation. 
During the first quarter, foreign currencies rose versus the dollar, but since then, have declined, and fuel prices have increased modestly. Since we last gave guidance, this has resulted in a $0.27 negative impact to earnings in the back half of the year. 
To put it in perspective, since the beginning of the year, FX and fuel movements have cost us $0.11. 
Since our last call, our basket of currencies have declined by 5.5%. The key driver of this decrease is the significant weakening of the British pound which represents approximately 30% of our foreign currency exposure. 
We anticipate fuel expense of $724.5 million, down $10 million, in part, due to the deconsolidation of Pullmantur. Excluding the deconsolidation, reduced consumption is offsetting higher fuel rates. We are currently 64% hedged for the remainder of the year at a price of $535 per metric ton. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share is in the range of $6 and $6.10 for the year. 
Before moving on to the third quarter guidance, I thought it might be useful if I put the movement of our guidance in perspective. Slide 5 shows how we got from our original guidance for the year to our revised guidance in April and to our current guidance. As you can see, we originally projected $6 for the year. Over the last 6 months, our operations, excluding FX and fuel, improved by about $0.16. FX and fuel got better during the first quarter by about $0.16 but reversed itself until now, and now it looks to be a net cost of about $0.11. All of that brings us to our current forecast of a midpoint of $6.05 for the year. 
Now we can turn to our guidance for the third quarter which is on Slide 6. We anticipate a net yield increase of approximately 2%. The year-over-year improvement is primarily driven by the deconsolidation of the Pullmantur Group. As I've previously mentioned, itinerary changes and weakness for Eastern Mediterranean cruises, combined with some softness in closing demand for our Shanghai sailings, is disproportionally impacting the third quarter and offsetting improvements driven by new hardware and North American products. Net cruise cost, excluding fuel, are expected to be down approximately 1.5% on a constant-currency basis, which includes an increase related to the deconsolidation of the Pullmantur Group. Taking all this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $3.10 per share. 
With that, I will ask our operator to open the call for a question-and-answer session."

I think what may be a bit of confusion is some people would assume that, that requires heroic performance in 2017. And I think part of what we tried to convey this morning is, no, heroic performance would result in really outstanding 2017, but to get to the Double-Double, all we need are moderate capacity growth which is locked in, nothing's really going to change that now; good cost control, which we think we have in good shape; and really quite modest yield improvement. And we think that all that is realistic and continues to be, and I think I feel, obviously, the closing get to it and the more information you have, the more you eliminate those kinds of variety -- those kinds of variations. So I think it is important to understand. To get to that, we would like to have heroic yield improvements, but we don't need heroic yield improvements."

I think the way you described it is not exactly as how we do see it, but this is of a digestion challenge as it relates to capacity and the growth of this market which has been quite extraordinary. We have planned for yield declines in '16, if you may recall, we were expecting to see some decline in that's just being the case. When you look at capacity, certainly, in the Shanghai region. When we think of China, we think of it as 1 market, but of course it's really 3 distinct markets: The north, Tianjin; the south, in Hong Kong and south China; and of course, the east, which is Shanghai, the main market. Most of the capacity is in Shanghai, it's about 65% of the total China business. This year, Shanghai was up around 100%. So I think your comment was spot on. So we did expect to see those yield declines and we are now dealing with the distribution opportunity. I think as we look into '17 in relation to capacity, the good news that we see at the moment in terms of '17 in Shanghai is that the growth rates are a lot more moderate and somewhere in the region of 15% to 20% as opposed to 100% this year.

One of the things, I think, Richard had commented on earlier is the journey of this market. Certainly, we're optimistic about the overall future in terms of the market potential, and we've been very actively engaged in the broadening of the opening of channels and the marketplace. So I think the comment that, I think, Tim had made earlier with regards to digestion problems, I think we're working quite actively. And we believe our competition is doing the same thing in kind of dealing with this in terms of opening up distribution. There is no issue with demand, but demand's there and the market's there. It's the building of the distribution quickly enough to handle the capacity. So at the moment, we're still working through what we think '17 would look like, and I'm sure we'll be able to talk more about that later on."

But with the European market, I think Richard had mentioned it or Jason had mentioned it earlier particularly after Brexit, we've seen no drop off at all in demand. And certainly, from the European markets, we've been pleased with demand that we've seen. And the European market seems to be particularly resilient.

Since the deconsolidated Pullmantur guidance is that sort of 60 [ph] basis point range and your previous guidance was 150 basis points.

And then, I just want to think about what that might mean to Q4 because I think sort of thing this implied your Q4 yields would be up in the 3% to 9%, but if you're narrowing the range, then it's really just more like 6% yield growth that you're looking for, which I guess, would be less than your Q1 yield.

And so we are in a very good book position, and especially when you focus on North America, which is very heavy in Q4, we're in a very strong position. So I think when you look at Q4 and you say, well, what's going to have yields drive to a high level, the first component you have to consider is about 300 basis points of that is Pullmantur's deconsolidation. The other thing which I think is important is our commentary about strength in North American products, strength in a mix of products that are very similar to what we had in Q1, which saw a very strong yield improvement for us. And also I think just a comments we've had around Harmony and the attraction to Harmony as well as a lot of strength for Ovation out of Australia, which is where will be in the wintertime. Those are the, I would say, are the underlying currents that support sizable yield growth in the fourth quarter."

As always, it's a pleasure to speak with you all this morning, give you a little color on our business. And I would like to say thank you for participating. As you know, it's been an exciting quarter for us wi",2021,"Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everybody. As always, it's a pleasure to speak with you all this morning, give you a little color on our business. And I would like to say thank you for participating. 
As you know, it's been an exciting quarter for us with the delivery of, not 1, but 3 new ships. Ovation of the Seas, Harmony of the Seas, and Mein Schiff 5 for our new joint -- for our joint venture, TUI Cruises. All 3 ships were very well received. And it's interesting to note that by chance, all these 3 ships each entered vastly different markets. That's an interesting reminder of the role that market segmentation and diversification plays in our overall strategy.  
I'd like to revert to that topic in a moment, but first, I want to comment on the quarter itself and beyond. I'll start by commenting on the fact that we exceeded guidance for the quarter by $0.09 a share, and our business looks set to do better for the year than we expected. Foreign exchange and fuel costs are eating away at some of the operational improvements this year, particularly as the affirmative vote for Brexit caused such a dramatic fall in sterling. But overall, we would rate this year as another one for the plus column, with business consistent with expectations, including the usual swings and roundabouts in individual markets. 
Commercially, the Eastern Med and China have experienced some softness, while the Baltic, Western Mediterranean, Caribbean and Alaska have been strong. This is particularly important, because these latter products represent over 60% of our business. And having strength in your biggest market is what every commercial person prays for. Part of that strength has been driven by our price integrity program, which gives guests and travel partners more confidence in the integrity of our pricing and which also encourages earlier booking. This longer booking window also helps us make better and more effective pricing decisions.
We're also mindful that next year, the markets that performed the very best this year, such as the Caribbean, for example, are only seeing modest capacity increases, while the Eastern Med capacity, for example, is dropping by double digits.  China's capacity next year is slated to grow, but that growth is at only half of this year's exceptional level. 
Now shifting focus to the Double-Double, I hope and I assume that everyone on this call knows that this is our internal program to double our 2014 earnings per share and to achieving double-digit ROIC by 2017. Our program to accomplish that continues to focus on the same 3 pillars: yield improvement, effective cost control and modest capacity growth. The Double-Double Program is working for us, and as we approach the final year of the program, our confidence in these targets remains firm. 
Personally, I like to focus on the numbers. There, of course, needs to be good qualitative reasons for the numbers. But in the end, it's the numbers that speak for themselves. The story behind the numbers is important, but the figures remain our beacon, and the figures are encouraging. Capacity growth is pretty much fixed, and our brands are satisfying our customers and attracting new ones at the best rate in our history. In order to meet our Double-Double objective next year, what we need is low, single-digit yield improvement and moderate spending. That's the formula we have been delivering, and that is a formula we believe we can continue to deliver. 
One other factor that comes into play recently is our sale of 51% of the Pullmantur Group. Jason will take you through more details in a moment, so I will simply say that this move is a step in a more profitable direction, and we're optimistic about the future for this new venture. 
Now given the enormous attention that's being focused on China, I think it's worth spending a little time on the development of this market and comparing it to some other markets. As it happens, I have the history of having been personally involved with the development of so many of the cruise markets around the world, and I'd like to comment on how the historical evolution of those markets compares with how China has developed so far and how it appears that China will be developing for the foreseeable future. 
First of all, it is striking how many parallels there are in China's evolution today compared to other places and other times where we have developed a market for cruising. For example, today, we view North America as a developed marketplace for cruises with a strong awareness level and a well-established sales and marketing network. However, when I first got involved with cruising, none of that was true. Rather, it looked a lot like what China looks like today. It was poorly known to the population at large. Distribution was to a small number of specialist agencies. There was little choice of itineraries. And growth was episodic and dictated by the arrival of new ships. An observer today would say virtually the same thing about the China market as it is now. The percent of Chinese, even the percent of middle-class Chinese who have cruised, remains infinitesimal. And just like the States, the main way we attract new customers is by thrilling the old customers. In the States, the reputation of cruising grew, because people came back from their holiday and raved about their experience. We advertised, of course, but most people tried it for the first time, because their neighbor pushed them to do so or their coworker did or maybe it was their brother-in-law. The point is that when somebody cruised, he or she became an advocate for cruising and the market grew the same way a snowball grows. That snowballing effect was also key to developing new markets, new markets like Britain and then Italy and then Germany. That same phenomena is occurring today in China. It may be happening more quickly in China, but the process is remarkably similar. 
The second key dynamic is the role of a travel agent. In the States, Europe, et cetera, cruises were initially sold through niche travel agents, who knew the business and were able to provide knowledge and assurance to a cautious public. It took a while for cruising to become a mainstream activity for travel agents, but when it did, the industry really took off.  
These travel agents were the people who could inform and guide a nervous customer on what cruising was all about, and they could help the customer make the myriad important decisions that would be critical to their valuable vacation. That crucial travel agent link, that important part of cruise industry success is still embryonic in China. But it too is growing, and I believe it will be key to our success there as it always has been here. 
And then there was the issue of where to go. Originally, cruises had a very limited selection of routes and destinations. When Royal Caribbean was contemplating its fourth vessel, I recall that the board engaged in a great deal of handwringing about whether there would be enough itinerary and source markets in the U.S. for the addition of that fourth ship. We were worried that the interest in cruising would not grow beyond the established group of then-popular destinations. Eventually, we decided there would be enough destinations, but it wasn't without trepidation. Today, we all look back on that concern and find it laughable, but then it was a real concern. 
Similarly in China, our catchment area today for customers is small and our itineraries are limited, but a quick look at a map shows just how enormous the potential really is.  
But the biggest question in the Western markets then, just like the biggest question in the China market today, is how quickly it can grow. The market growth rate in North America and Europe overall exceeded our expectations but it certainly wasn't linear and we frequently experienced periods of higher or lower demand growth matched, or in some cases not matched, by higher or lower periods of supply growth. These periods of matching or non-matching growth naturally led to better or worse periods of revenue generation. In China, we've also seen such periods, and I expect we will continue to do so. But like the early days in the United States, the periods of oversupply or under-demand quickly got eliminated by the inexorable development of knowledge of the industry and the strong growth of the distribution system. 
But China is not the same as the U.S. and it's not the same as Europe. For one thing, everything that happens in China happens at China's speed. So where it took many years for Western travel agents to develop the infrastructure, the expertise and the breadth that we enjoy today, we're already seeing that process happening in China at a faster speed. For example, today, we work with 3x as many core operator partners as we did just 3 years ago. And in the same 3-year period, we had quadrupled the number of independent agencies we work with, from 200 to 800. That's nearly 1/4 of all the travel agents in China with a license to sell outbound travel. 
And the scale in China is different. In the West, we found that the market could grow quickly. But when we tried to introduce new capacity well into double digits, the market had trouble keeping up. In China, we've been growing at 40% and 50% growth rates without any difficulty. Those are pretty extraordinary levels. But this year, we as an industry have pushed those figures into triple digits. Even China has trouble growing at that pace. Fortunately, the softness in China is being driven mainly by this huge capacity growth rather than by faltering demand. That should make it an easier correction to make, and we are optimistic about our future there. I view the ability of China to fill twice as many cruise berths this year as it did last year as a sign of great strength. The fact that it can do so with only modest softness should be seen as evidence of strength, not weakness. 
Everybody knows the pace of change of the world today is exceptional. We have never seen a pace like this in history, and I like to point out that we never will again. The pace of change today is slower than we will ever see it again. Let me repeat that. The pace of change today is slower than we will ever see again. This is true in many areas, and it is nowhere as evident as it is in China. 
Overall, we're very pleased with the way our cruises have been received by the consumers in China. We're also very pleased by the recognition that the Chinese government has given to the value of the cruise economy to China's overall economic expansion. We're particularly pleased by the very powerful brand presence and preference that Royal Caribbean International has achieved there. We expect to see this market continue to grow, and we expect to continue to grow with it. 
Now before I turn it over to Jason, I'd like to touch on one last point related to capacity growth. As I've just discussed, much of the capacity in the industry is being allocated to the Asia Pacific region. It stands to reason that growth of the industry in the Atlantic theater is more modest next year. From our own standpoint, there are significant declines in the European market, driven by the deconsolidation of the Pullmantur Group, the Harmony of the Seas deployment back to the Caribbean year round, the sale of the Legend of the Seas and keeping Celebrity Equinox in the Caribbean year round. We also take comfort knowing that in the past, when our growth has been driven by the introduction of an Oasis-class ship as it is this year -- this coming year, our yields have not disappointed. 
With that, it's a pleasure to turn it back over to Jason. Jason?"

I will begin by taking you through our results for the second quarter. Unless I state differently, all metrics will be on a constant currency basis.Second quarter results are summarized on Slide 2. For the quarter, we generated adjus",1326,"Thank you, Richard. I will begin by taking you through our results for the second quarter. Unless I state differently, all metrics will be on a constant currency basis.
Second quarter results are summarized on Slide 2. For the quarter, we generated adjusted earnings of $1.09, which is $0.09 higher than guidance and 25% higher than same time last year. The outperformance was driven primarily by favorable fuel expenses and outperformance by TUI Cruises. Lower fuel rates were a key factor; however, lower consumption also contributed to the overall favorability. Net revenue yields were up 1.1%, which were in line with guidance. Onboard revenue yields continue to increase, with beverage package sales and the expansion of streaming Internet products, like VOOM and Xcelerate, driving 8.7% year-over-year increase. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, were also in line with guidance at 1.9% for the quarter. As discussed previously, we sustained higher costs in the first half of the year related to new build launch initiatives, investments in China and more drydock activity. 
Now I would like to walk you through current booking trends. Overall, trends are consistent with those discussed during our last call. And in the aggregate, our portfolio of products remains about the same. However, just like in any portfolio, there had been some puts and takes at the itinerary level. Demand for North American products, which make up half of our capacity for the year, is unwavering in its strength, contributing to better-than-expected performance in the Caribbean, Alaska and Bermuda. On the other hand, geopolitical events in Europe continue to stress Eastern Mediterranean yields, and close-in demand trends in the Shanghai market are softer than anticipated. At this point, we are over 93% booked for the year with book load factor and APD in a strong position. 
Beginning with Europe, yields have held up nicely for Northern Europe and Western Mediterranean sailings this year, partially driven by the consistent strength in demand that we have seen from European markets. The U.K. is the key sourcing market for our Europe sailings, and we have been closely monitoring demand since the Brexit decision. To date, we have not seen any softening in demand from the U.K. since the vote. And in fact, the U.K. remains one of our strongest markets this summer. 
Eastern Mediterranean itineraries, however, have experienced further weakness stemming from the multiple geopolitical events that have occurred in Europe. Not only have these put a strain on close-in demand and pricing, but they've also led us to make operational changes such as shifting embarkation out of Istanbul for several sailings. 
Turning to China. We introduced Ovation of the Seas to Tianjin just over a month ago, and she is generating superior yields even by China standards. Overall, the pace of bookings for the remainder of the China season has mostly been within the expected range and above last year. However, there has been some softness in close-in demand in Shanghai in recent weeks. Nevertheless, our China sailings, which represent 9% of our capacity, continue to generate yields that are above average, has occupancy levels that are in line with the fleet average, and the market is accretive to our yields and return on invested capital. 
Moving on to North America. Our Caribbean, Alaska and Bermuda itineraries account for about 50% of our full year capacity and continue to trend very well. We expect each of these products to generate nice yield improvements this year and also expect to see record yields in Alaska. We are generally seeing solid trends for our entire Caribbean portfolio, which ranges from 3-night Bahama sailings to 14-night Southern Caribbean itineraries. With the summer season coming to a close in the next few weeks, the focus will shift to the winter season, which is currently in a very strong book position. Harmony of the Seas continues to impress and has garnered strong demand at increasing prices throughout Q4 and well into 2017. It is still very early in the booking cycle for 2017 sailings; however, I will share that we are encouraged by recent booking trends in our current book position. We are booked ahead of same time last year in both load factor and APD for the next 12 months. 
Before I update you on our guidance for the year and the third quarter, I would like to touch on the recent sale of 51% of the Pullmantur Group to Springwater Capital. The Pullmantur Group operates a more value-based product, which delivers yields and costs that are lower than our fleet average. Consequently, the deconsolidation of Pullmantur has increased our yield-to-cost metrics and has an immaterial impact on earnings for this year. 
Now we can turn to our updated guidance for full year 2016, which is on Slide 4. Net revenue yields are expected to grow 4% to 4.5%, an increase versus prior guidance, driven by the deconsolidation of the Pullmantur Group. Strong demand for North American products is helping to offset some slightly weaker trends in Eastern Mediterranean and Shanghai. These product level trends are stressing Q3 yield growth but are providing strong tailwinds for Q4, where our mix of itineraries more closely resembles the first quarter. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are unchanged and are expected to be up approximately 1%. Cost savings in the third and fourth quarters are offsetting the increase driven by the Pullmantur deconsolidation.  
During the first quarter, foreign currencies rose versus the dollar, but since then, have declined. And fuel prices have increased modestly. Since we last gave guidance, this has resulted in a $0.27 negative impact to earnings in the back half of the year. To put it in perspective, since the beginning of the year, FX and the fuel movements have cost us $0.11. 
Since our last call, our basket of currencies has declined by 5.5%. The key driver of this decrease is the significant weakening of the British pound, which represents approximately 30% of our foreign currency exposure. 
We anticipate fuel expense of $724.5 million, down $10 million in part, due to the deconsolidation of Pullmantur. Excluding the deconsolidation, reduced consumption is offsetting higher fuel rates. We are currently 64% hedged for the remainder of the year at a price of $535 per metric ton. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share is in the range of $6 and $6.10 for the year. 
Before moving on to third quarter guidance, I thought it might be useful if I put the movement of our guidance in perspective. Slide 5 shows how we got from our original guidance for the year to our revised guidance in April and to our current guidance. As you can see, we originally projected $6 for the year. Over the last 6 months, our operations, excluding FX and fuel, improved by about $0.16. FX and fuel got better during the first quarter by about $0.16 but reversed itself until now and now looks to be a net cost of about $0.11. All of that brings us to our current forecast of a midpoint of $6.05 for the year. 
Now we can turn to our guidance for the third quarter which is on Slide 6. We anticipate a net yield increase of approximately 2%. The year-over-year improvement is primarily driven by the deconsolidation of the Pullmantur Group. As I previously mentioned, itinerary changes and weakness for Eastern Mediterranean cruises, combined with some softness in close-in demand for our Shanghai sailings, is disproportionally impacting the third quarter and offsetting improvements driven by new hardware and North American products. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be down approximately 1.5% on a constant currency basis, which includes an increase related to the deconsolidation of the Pullmantur Group. Taking all of this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $3.10 per share. 
With that, I will ask our operator to open the call for a question-and-answer session."

Let me just respond to the question with regards to China yields. I think the way you described it is spot on, that is not exactly how we do see it, that this is kind of a digestion challenge as it relates to capacity and the growth of this market, which has been quite extraordinary. We had planned for yield declines in '16. If you may recall, we were expecting to see some decline, and that has been the case. When you look at capacity, certainly in the Shanghai region, when we think of China, we think of it as one market. But of course, it's really 3 distinct markets: The north, Tianjin; the south in Hong Kong and south China; and of course, the east, which is Shanghai, the main market. And most of the capacity is in Shanghai. It's about 65% of the total China business. This year, Shanghai was up around 100%. So I think your comments were spot on. So we did expect to see those yield declines, and we are now dealing with the distribution opportunity. I think as we look into '17 in relation to capacity, the good news that we see at the moment in terms of '17 in Shanghai is that the growth rates are a lot more moderate and somewhere in the region of 15% to 20% as opposed to 100% this year.

Is that having a continued impact on that passenger wanting to go to Europe? And when would you expect that passenger group, the North Americans going to Europe? When would you expect that group to start strengthening in terms of the demand to go into Europe?"

In terms of the North American-sourced markets for the European products, we kind of -- we reached a point around June actually, June into July, where the North America demand starts to naturally drop off to European products. So the latest issues have had not such a profound impact on the North Americans, because we see the drop-off coming. It's a decline over time. But with the European market, and I think Richard had mentioned it or Jason had mentioned it earlier, particularly after Brexit, we've seen no drop-off at all in the demand. And certainly, from the European markets, we've been pleased with the demand that we've seen, and the European market seems to be particularly resilient. Normally, after we see an incident, an event, a terrorist event, you get this drop-off of bookings from both European and American markets. And what we're beginning to see is the recovery is a lot more rapid in both markets and certainly in the European market."

Since the deconsolidated Pullmantur guidance is that sort of 50 basis point range and your previous guidance was 150 basis points, should we think about your guidance excluding the Pullmantur deconsolidation being sort of more than narrowing of the range, the 2.5% to 4% going to kind of 3% to 3.5%?

And then I just sort of think about what that might mean to Q4, because I think some of [indiscernible] implied your Q4 yields would be up the 3% to 9%.

The other thing which I think is important is our commentary about strength in North American products, strength in a mix of products that are very similar to what we had in Q1, which we saw very strong yield improvement for. And also I think just the comments we've had around Harmony and the attraction to Harmony as well as a lot of strength for Ovation out of Australia, which is where she'll be in the wintertime. Those are the -- I would say, are the underlying currents that support a sizable yield growth in the fourth quarter."

As always, it's a pleasure to speak with you all this morning, give you a little color on our business. And I would like to say thank you for participating. 
As you know, it's been an exciting quarter for us with the delivery of, not 1, but 3 new ships. Ovation of the Seas, Harmony of the Seas, and Mein Schiff 5 for our new joint -- for our joint venture, TUI Cruises. All 3 ships were very well received. And it's interesting to note that by chance, all these 3 ships each entered vastly different markets. That's an interesting reminder of the role that market segmentation and diversification plays in our overall strategy.  
I'd like to revert to that topic in a moment, but first, I want to comment on the quarter itself and beyond. I'll start by commenting on the fact that we exceeded guidance for the quarter by $0.09 a share, and our business looks set to do better for the year than we expected. Foreign exchange and fuel costs are eating away at some of the operational improvements this year, particularly as the affirmative vote for Brexit caused such a dramatic fall in sterling. But overall, we would rate this year as another one for the plus column, with business consistent with expectations, including the usual swings and roundabouts in individual markets. 
Commercially, the Eastern Med and China have experienced some softness, while the Baltic, Western Mediterranean, Caribbean and Alaska have been strong. This is particularly important, because these latter products represent over 60% of our business. And having strength in your biggest market is what every commercial person prays for. Part of that strength has been driven by our price integrity program, which gives guests and travel partners more confidence in the integrity of our pricing and which also encourages earlier booking. This longer booking window also helps us make better and more effective pricing decisions.
We're also mindful that next year, the markets that performed the very best this year, such as the Caribbean, for example, are only seeing modest capacity increases, while the Eastern Med capacity, for example, is dropping by double digits.  China's capacity next year is slated to grow, but that growth is at only half of this year's exceptional level. 
Now shifting focus to the Double-Double, I hope and I assume that everyone on this call knows that this is our internal program to double our 2014 earnings per share and to achieving double-digit ROIC by 2017. Our program to accomplish that continues to focus on the same 3 pillars: yield improvement, effective cost control and modest capacity growth. The Double-Double Program is working for us, and as we approach the final year of the program, our confidence in these targets remains firm. 
Personally, I like to focus on the numbers. There, of course, needs to be good qualitative reasons for the numbers. But in the end, it's the numbers that speak for themselves. The story behind the numbers is important, but the figures remain our beacon, and the figures are encouraging. Capacity growth is pretty much fixed, and our brands are satisfying our customers and attracting new ones at the best rate in our history. In order to meet our Double-Double objective next year, what we need is low, single-digit yield improvement and moderate spending. That's the formula we have been delivering, and that is a formula we believe we can continue to deliver. 
One other factor that comes into play recently is our sale of 51% of the Pullmantur Group. Jason will take you through more details in a moment, so I will simply say that this move is a step in a more profitable direction, and we're optimistic about the future for this new venture. 
Now given the enormous attention that's being focused on China, I think it's worth spending a little time on the development of this market and comparing it to some other markets. As it happens, I have the history of having been personally involved with the development of so many of the cruise markets around the world, and I'd like to comment on how the historical evolution of those markets compares with how China has developed so far and how it appears that China will be developing for the foreseeable future. 
First of all, it is striking how many parallels there are in China's evolution today compared to other places and other times where we have developed a market for cruising. For example, today, we view North America as a developed marketplace for cruises with a strong awareness level and a well-established sales and marketing network. However, when I first got involved with cruising, none of that was true. Rather, it looked a lot like what China looks like today. It was poorly known to the population at large. Distribution was through a small number of specialist agencies. There was little choice of itineraries. And growth was episodic and dictated by the arrival of new ships. An observer today would say virtually the same thing about the China market as it is now. The percent of Chinese, even the percent of middle-class Chinese who have cruised, remains infinitesimal. And just like the States, the main way we attract new customers is by thrilling the old customers. In the States, the reputation of cruising grew, because people came back from their holiday and raved about their experience. We advertised, of course, but most people tried it for the first time, because their neighbor pushed them to do so or their coworker did or maybe it was their brother-in-law. The point is that when somebody cruised, he or she became an advocate for cruising and the market grew the same way a snowball grows. That snowballing effect was also key to developing new markets, new markets like Britain and then Italy and then Germany. That same phenomena is occurring today in China. It may be happening more quickly in China, but the process is remarkably similar. 
The second key dynamic is the role of a travel agent. In the States, Europe, et cetera, cruises were initially sold through niche travel agents, who knew the business and were able to provide knowledge and assurance to a cautious public. It took a while for cruising to become a mainstream activity for travel agents, but when it did, the industry really took off.  
These travel agents were the people who could inform and guide a nervous customer on what cruising was all about, and they could help the customer make the myriad important decisions that would be critical to their valuable vacation. That crucial travel agent link, that important part of cruise industry success is still embryonic in China. But it too is growing, and I believe it will be key to our success there as it always has been here. 
And then there was the issue of where to go. Originally, cruises had a very limited selection of routes and destinations. When Royal Caribbean was contemplating its fourth vessel, I recall that the board engaged in a great deal of handwringing about whether there would be enough itinerary in source markets in the U.S. for the addition of that fourth ship. We were worried that the interest in cruising would not grow beyond the established group of then-popular destinations. Eventually, we decided there would be enough destinations, but it wasn't without trepidation. Today, we all look back on that concern and find it laughable, but then it was a real concern. 
Similarly in China, our catchment area today for customers is small and our itineraries are limited, but a quick look at a map shows just how enormous the potential really is.  
But the biggest question in the Western markets then, just like the biggest question in the China market today, is how quickly it can grow. The market growth rate in North America and Europe overall exceeded our expectations but it certainly wasn't linear and we frequently experienced periods of higher or lower demand growth matched, or in some cases not matched, by higher or lower periods of supply growth. These periods of matching or non-matching growth naturally led to better or worse periods of revenue generation. In China, we've also seen such periods, and I expect we will continue to do so. But like the early days in the United States, the periods of oversupply or under-demand quickly got eliminated by the inexorable development of knowledge of the industry and the strong growth of the distribution system. 
But China is not the same as the U.S. and it's not the same as Europe. For one thing, everything that happens in China happens at China's speed. So where it took many years for Western travel agents to develop the infrastructure, the expertise and the breadth that we enjoy today, we're already seeing that process happening in China at a faster speed. For example, today, we work with 3x as many core operator partners as we did just 3 years ago. And in the same 3-year period, we had quadrupled the number of independent agencies we work with, from 200 to 800. That's nearly 1/4 of all the travel agents in China with a license to sell outbound travel. 
And the scale in China is different. In the West, we found that the market could grow quickly. But when we tried to introduce new capacity well into double digits, the market had trouble keeping up. In China, we've been growing at 40% and 50% growth rates without any difficulty. Those are pretty extraordinary levels. But this year, we as an industry have pushed those figures into triple digits. Even China has trouble growing at that pace. Fortunately, the softness in China is being driven mainly by this huge capacity growth rather than by faltering demand. That should make it an easier correction to make, and we are optimistic about our future there. I view the ability of China to fill twice as many cruise berths this year as it did last year as a sign of great strength. The fact that it can do so with only modest softness should be seen as evidence of strength, not weakness. 
Everybody knows the pace of change of the world today is exceptional. We have never seen a pace like this in history, and I like to point out that we never will again. The pace of change today is slower than we will ever see it again. Let me repeat that. The pace of change today is slower than we will ever see again. This is true in many areas, and it is nowhere as evident as it is in China. 
Overall, we're very pleased with the way our cruises have been received by the consumers in China. We're also very pleased by the recognition that the Chinese government has given to the value of the cruise economy to China's overall economic expansion. We're particularly pleased by the very powerful brand presence and preference that Royal Caribbean International has achieved there. We expect to see this market continue to grow, and we expect to continue to grow with it. 
Now before I turn it over to Jason, I'd like to touch on one last point related to capacity growth. As I've just discussed, much of the capacity in the industry is being allocated to the Asia Pacific region. It stands to reason that growth of the industry in the Atlantic theater is more modest next year. From our own standpoint, there are significant declines in the European market, driven by the deconsolidation of the Pullmantur Group, the Harmony of the Seas deployment back to the Caribbean year round, the sale of the Legend of the Seas and keeping Celebrity Equinox in the Caribbean year round. We also take comfort knowing that in the past, when our growth has been driven by the introduction of an Oasis-class ship as it is this year -- this coming year, our yields have not disappointed. 
With that, it's a pleasure to turn it back over to Jason. Jason?"

Unless I state differently, all metrics will be on a constant currency basis.
Second quarter results are summarized on Slide 2. For the quarter, we generated adjusted earnings of $1.09, which is $0.09 higher than guidance and 25% higher than same time last year. The outperformance was driven primarily by favorable fuel expenses and outperformance by TUI Cruises. Lower fuel rates were a key factor; however, lower consumption also contributed to the overall favorability. Net revenue yields were up 1.1%, which were in line with guidance. Onboard revenue yields continue to increase, with beverage package sales and the expansion of streaming Internet products, like VOOM and Xcelerate, driving 8.7% year-over-year increase. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, were also in line with guidance at 1.9% for the quarter. As discussed previously, we sustained higher costs in the first half of the year related to new build launch initiatives, investments in China and more drydock activity. 
Now I would like to walk you through current booking trends. Overall, trends are consistent with those discussed during our last call. And in the aggregate, our portfolio of products remains about the same. However, just like in any portfolio, there have been some puts and takes at the itinerary level. Demand for North American products, which make up half of our capacity for the year, is unwavering in its strength, contributing to better-than-expected performance in the Caribbean, Alaska and Bermuda. On the other hand, geopolitical events in Europe continue to stress Eastern Mediterranean yields, and close-in demand trends in the Shanghai market are softer than anticipated. At this point, we are over 93% booked for the year with book load factor and APD in a strong position. 
Beginning with Europe, yields have held up nicely for Northern Europe and Western Mediterranean sailings this year, partially driven by the consistent strength in demand that we have seen from European markets. The U.K. is the key sourcing market for our Europe sailings, and we have been closely monitoring demand since the Brexit decision. To date, we have not seen any softening in demand from the U.K. since the vote. And in fact, the U.K. remains one of our strongest markets this summer. 
Eastern Mediterranean itineraries, however, have experienced further weakness stemming from the multiple geopolitical events that have occurred in Europe. Not only have these put a strain on close-in demand and pricing, but they've also led us to make operational changes such as shifting embarkation out of Istanbul for several sailings. 
Turning to China. We introduced Ovation of the Seas to Tianjin just over a month ago, and she is generating superior yields even by China standards. Overall, the pace of bookings for the remainder of the China season has mostly been within the expected range and above last year. However, there has been some softness in close-in demand in Shanghai in recent weeks. Nevertheless, our China sailings, which represent 9% of our capacity, continue to generate yields that are above average, has occupancy levels that are in line with the fleet average, and the market is accretive to our yields and return on invested capital. 
Moving on to North America. Our Caribbean, Alaska and Bermuda itineraries account for about 50% of our full year capacity and continue to trend very well. We expect each of these products to generate nice yield improvements this year and also expect to see record yields in Alaska. We are generally seeing solid trends for our entire Caribbean portfolio, which ranges from 3-night Bahama sailings to 14-night Southern Caribbean itineraries. With the summer season coming to a close in the next few weeks, the focus will shift to the winter season, which is currently in a very strong book position. Harmony of the Seas continues to impress and has garnered strong demand at increasing prices throughout Q4 and well into 2017. It is still very early in the booking cycle for 2017 sailings; however, I will share that we are encouraged by recent booking trends in our current book position. We are booked ahead of same time last year in both load factor and APD for the next 12 months. 
Before I update you on our guidance for the year and the third quarter, I would like to touch on the recent sale of 51% of the Pullmantur Group to Springwater Capital. The Pullmantur Group operates a more value-based product, which delivers yields and costs that are lower than our fleet average. Consequently, the deconsolidation of Pullmantur has increased our yield-to-cost metrics and has an immaterial impact on earnings for this year. 
Now we can turn to our updated guidance for full year 2016, which is on Slide 4. Net revenue yields are expected to grow 4% to 4.5%, an increase versus prior guidance, driven by the deconsolidation of the Pullmantur Group. Strong demand for North American products is helping to offset some slightly weaker trends in Eastern Mediterranean and Shanghai. These product level trends are stressing Q3 yield growth but are providing strong tailwinds for Q4, where our mix of itineraries more closely resembles the first quarter. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are unchanged and are expected to be up approximately 1%. Cost savings in the third and fourth quarters are offsetting the increase driven by the Pullmantur deconsolidation.  
During the first quarter, foreign currencies rose versus the dollar, but since then, have declined. And fuel prices have increased modestly. Since we last gave guidance, this has resulted in a $0.27 negative impact to earnings in the back half of the year. To put it in perspective, since the beginning of the year, FX and the fuel movements have cost us $0.11. 
Since our last call, our basket of currencies has declined by 5.5%. The key driver of this decrease is the significant weakening of the British pound, which represents approximately 30% of our foreign currency exposure. 
We anticipate fuel expense of $724.5 million, down $10 million in part, due to the deconsolidation of Pullmantur. Excluding the deconsolidation, reduced consumption is offsetting higher fuel rates. We are currently 64% hedged for the remainder of the year at a price of $535 per metric ton. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share is in the range of $6 and $6.10 for the year. 
Before moving on to third quarter guidance, I thought it might be useful if I put the movement of our guidance in perspective. Slide 5 shows how we got from our original guidance for the year to our revised guidance in April and to our current guidance. As you can see, we originally projected $6 for the year. Over the last 6 months, our operations, excluding FX and fuel, improved by about $0.16. FX and fuel got better during the first quarter by about $0.16 but reversed itself until now and now looks to be a net cost of about $0.11. All of that brings us to our current forecast of a midpoint of $6.05 for the year. 
Now we can turn to our guidance for the third quarter which is on Slide 6. We anticipate a net yield increase of approximately 2%. The year-over-year improvement is primarily driven by the deconsolidation of the Pullmantur Group. As I previously mentioned, itinerary changes and weakness for Eastern Mediterranean cruises, combined with some softness in close-in demand for our Shanghai sailings, is disproportionally impacting the third quarter and offsetting improvements driven by new hardware and North American products. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be down approximately 1.5% on a constant currency basis, which includes an increase related to the deconsolidation of the Pullmantur Group. Taking all of this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $3.10 per share. 
With that, I will ask our operator to open the call for a question-and-answer session."

Let me just respond to the question with regards to China yields. I think the way you described it is spot on, that is exactly how we do see it, that this is kind of a digestion challenge as it relates to capacity and the growth of this market, which has been quite extraordinary. We had planned for yield declines in '16. If you may recall, we were expecting to see some decline, and that has been the case. When you look at capacity, certainly in the Shanghai region, when we think of China, we think of it as one market. But of course, it's really 3 distinct markets: The north, Tianjin; the south in Hong Kong and south China; and of course, the east, which is Shanghai, the main market. And most of the capacity is in Shanghai. It's about 65% of the total China business. This year, Shanghai was up around 100%. So I think your comments were spot on. So we did expect to see those yield declines, and we are now dealing with the distribution opportunity. I think as we look into '17 in relation to capacity, the good news that we see at the moment in terms of '17 in Shanghai is that the growth rates are a lot more moderate and somewhere in the region of 15% to 20% as opposed to 100% this year.

And certainly, from the European markets, we've been pleased with the demand that we've seen, and the European market seems to be particularly resilient.

So I think when you look at Q4 and you say, well, what's going to have yields drive to the -- to a high level, the first component you have to consider is about 300 basis points of that is Pullmantur's deconsolidation. The other thing which I think is important is our commentary about strength in North American products, strength in a mix of products that are very similar to what we had in Q1, which we saw very strong yield improvement for. And also I think just the comments we've had around Harmony and the attraction to Harmony as well as a lot of strength for Ovation out of Australia, which is where she'll be in the wintertime.

As always, it's a pleasure to speak with you all this morning, give you a little color on our business. And I would like to say thank you for participating. 
As you know, it's been an exciting quarter for us with the delivery of, not 1, but 3 new ships. Ovation of the Seas, Harmony of the Seas, and Mein Schiff 5 for our new joint -- for our joint venture, TUI Cruises. All 3 ships were very well received. And it's interesting to note that by chance, all these 3 ships each entered vastly different markets. That's an interesting reminder of the role that market segmentation and diversification plays in our overall strategy.  
I'd like to revert to that topic in a moment, but first, I want to comment on the quarter itself and beyond. I'll start by commenting on the fact that we exceeded guidance for the quarter by $0.09 a share, and our business looks set to do better for the year than we expected. Foreign exchange and fuel costs are eating away at some of the operational improvements this year, particularly as the affirmative vote for Brexit caused such a dramatic fall in sterling. But overall, we would rate this year as another one for the plus column, with business consistent with expectations, including the usual swings and roundabouts in individual markets. 
Commercially, the Eastern Med and China have experienced some softness, while the Baltic, Western Mediterranean, Caribbean and Alaska have been strong. This is particularly important, because these latter products represent over 60% of our business. And having strength in your biggest market is what every commercial person prays for. Part of that strength has been driven by our price integrity program, which gives guests and travel partners more confidence in the integrity of our pricing and which also encourages earlier booking. This longer booking window also helps us make better and more effective pricing decisions.
We're also mindful that next year, the markets that performed the very best this year, such as the Caribbean, for example, are only seeing modest capacity increases, while the Eastern Med capacity, for example, is dropping by double digits.  China's capacity next year is slated to grow, but that growth is at only half of this year's exceptional level. 
Now shifting focus to the Double-Double, I hope and I assume that everyone on this call knows that this is our internal program to double our 2014 earnings per share and to achieving double-digit ROIC by 2017. Our program to accomplish that continues to focus on the same 3 pillars: yield improvement, effective cost control and modest capacity growth. The Double-Double Program is working for us, and as we approach the final year of the program, our confidence in these targets remains firm. 
Personally, I like to focus on the numbers. There, of course, needs to be good qualitative reasons for the numbers. But in the end, it's the numbers that speak for themselves. The story behind the numbers is important, but the figures remain our beacon, and the figures are encouraging. Capacity growth is pretty much fixed, and our brands are satisfying our customers and attracting new ones at the best rate in our history. In order to meet our Double-Double objective next year, what we need is low, single-digit yield improvement and moderate spending. That's the formula we have been delivering, and that is a formula we believe we can continue to deliver. 
One other factor that comes into play recently is our sale of 51% of the Pullmantur Group. Jason will take you through more details in a moment, so I will simply say that this move is a step in a more profitable direction, and we're optimistic about the future for this new venture. 
Now given the enormous attention that's being focused on China, I think it's worth spending a little time on the development of this market and comparing it to some other markets. As it happens, I have the history of having been personally involved with the development of so many of the cruise markets around the world, and I'd like to comment on how the historical evolution of those markets compares with how China has developed so far and how it appears that China will be developing for the foreseeable future. 
First of all, it is striking how many parallels there are in China's evolution today compared to other places and other times where we have developed a market for cruising. For example, today, we view North America as a developed marketplace for cruises with a strong awareness level and a well-established sales and marketing network. However, when I first got involved with cruising, none of that was true. Rather, it looked a lot like what China looks like today. It was poorly known to the population at large. Distribution was through a small number of specialist agencies. There was little choice of itineraries. And growth was episodic and dictated by the arrival of new ships. An observer today would say virtually the same thing about the China market as it is now. The percent of Chinese, even the percent of middle-class Chinese who have cruised, remains infinitesimal. And just like the States, the main way we attract new customers is by thrilling the old customers. In the States, the reputation of cruising grew, because people came back from their holiday and raved about their experience. We advertised, of course, but most people tried it for the first time, because their neighbor pushed them to do so or their coworker did or maybe it was their brother-in-law. The point is that when somebody cruised, he or she became an advocate for cruising and the market grew the same way a snowball grows. That snowballing effect was also key to developing new markets, new markets like Britain and then Italy and then Germany. That same phenomena is occurring today in China. It may be happening more quickly in China, but the process is remarkably similar. 
The second key dynamic is the role of a travel agent. In the States, Europe, et cetera, cruises were initially sold through niche travel agents, who knew the business and were able to provide knowledge and assurance to a cautious public. It took a while for cruising to become a mainstream activity for travel agents, but when it did, the industry really took off.  
These travel agents were the people who could inform and guide a nervous customer on what cruising was all about, and they could help the customer make the myriad important decisions that would be critical to their valuable vacation. That crucial travel agent link, that important part of cruise industry success is still embryonic in China. But it too is growing, and I believe it will be key to our success there as it always has been here. 
And then there was the issue of where to go. Originally, cruises had a very limited selection of routes and destinations. When Royal Caribbean was contemplating its fourth vessel, I recall that the board engaged in a great deal of handwringing about whether there would be enough itinerary in source markets in the U.S. for the addition of that fourth ship. We were worried that the interest in cruising would not grow beyond the established group of then-popular destinations. Eventually, we decided there would be enough destinations, but it wasn't without trepidation. Today, we all look back on that concern and find it laughable, but then it was a real concern. 
Similarly in China, our catchment area today for customers is small and our itineraries are limited, but a quick look at a map shows just how enormous the potential really is.  
But the biggest question in the Western markets then, just like the biggest question in the China market today, is how quickly it can grow. The market growth rate in North America and Europe overall exceeded our expectations but it certainly wasn't linear and we frequently experienced periods of higher or lower demand growth matched, or in some cases not matched, by higher or lower periods of supply growth. These periods of matching or non-matching growth naturally led to better or worse periods of revenue generation. In China, we've also seen such periods, and I expect we will continue to do so. But like the early days in the United States, the periods of oversupply or under-demand quickly got eliminated by the inexorable development of knowledge of the industry and the strong growth of the distribution system. 
But China is not the same as the U.S. and it's not the same as Europe. For one thing, everything that happens in China happens at China's speed. So where it took many years for Western travel agents to develop the infrastructure, the expertise and the breadth that we enjoy today, we're already seeing that process happening in China at a faster speed. For example, today, we work with 3x as many core operator partners as we did just 3 years ago. And in the same 3-year period, we had quadrupled the number of independent agencies we work with, from 200 to 800. That's nearly 1/4 of all the travel agents in China with a license to sell outbound travel. 
And the scale in China is different. In the West, we found that the market could grow quickly. But when we tried to introduce new capacity well into double digits, the market had trouble keeping up. In China, we've been growing at 40% and 50% growth rates without any difficulty. Those are pretty extraordinary levels. But this year, we as an industry have pushed those figures into triple digits. Even China has trouble growing at that pace. Fortunately, the softness in China is being driven mainly by this huge capacity growth rather than by faltering demand. That should make it an easier correction to make, and we are optimistic about our future there. I view the ability of China to fill twice as many cruise berths this year as it did last year as a sign of great strength. The fact that it can do so with only modest softness should be seen as evidence of strength, not weakness. 
Everybody knows the pace of change of the world today is exceptional. We have never seen a pace like this in history, and I like to point out that we never will again. The pace of change today is slower than we will ever see it again. Let me repeat that. The pace of change today is slower than we will ever see again. This is true in many areas, and it is nowhere as evident as it is in China. 
Overall, we're very pleased with the way our cruises have been received by the consumers in China. We're also very pleased by the recognition that the Chinese government has given to the value of the cruise economy to China's overall economic expansion. We're particularly pleased by the very powerful brand presence and preference that Royal Caribbean International has achieved there. We expect to see this market continue to grow, and we expect to continue to grow with it. 
Now before I turn it over to Jason, I'd like to touch on one last point related to capacity growth. As I've just discussed, much of the capacity in the industry is being allocated to the Asia Pacific region. It stands to reason that growth of the industry in the Atlantic theater is more modest next year. From our own standpoint, there are significant declines in the European market, driven by the deconsolidation of the Pullmantur Group, the Harmony of the Seas deployment back to the Caribbean year round, the sale of the Legend of the Seas and keeping Celebrity Equinox in the Caribbean year round. We also take comfort knowing that in the past, when our growth has been driven by the introduction of an Oasis-class ship as it is this year -- this coming year, our yields have not disappointed. 
With that, it's a pleasure to turn it back over to Jason. Jason?"

I will begin by taking you through our results for the second quarter. Unless I state differently, all metrics will be on a constant currency basis.Second quarter results are summarized on Slide 2. For the quarter, we generated adjus",1326,"Thank you, Richard. I will begin by taking you through our results for the second quarter. Unless I state differently, all metrics will be on a constant currency basis.
Second quarter results are summarized on Slide 2. For the quarter, we generated adjusted earnings of $1.09, which is $0.09 higher than guidance and 25% higher than same time last year. The outperformance was driven primarily by favorable fuel expenses and outperformance by TUI Cruises. Lower fuel rates were a key factor; however, lower consumption also contributed to the overall favorability. Net revenue yields were up 1.1%, which were in line with guidance. Onboard revenue yields continue to increase, with beverage package sales and the expansion of streaming Internet products, like VOOM and Xcelerate, driving 8.7% year-over-year increase. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, were also in line with guidance at 1.9% for the quarter. As discussed previously, we sustained higher costs in the first half of the year related to new build launch initiatives, investments in China and more drydock activity. 
Now I would like to walk you through current booking trends. Overall, trends are consistent with those discussed during our last call. And in the aggregate, our portfolio of products remains about the same. However, just like in any portfolio, there have been some puts and takes at the itinerary level. Demand for North American products, which make up half of our capacity for the year, is unwavering in its strength, contributing to better-than-expected performance in the Caribbean, Alaska and Bermuda. On the other hand, geopolitical events in Europe continue to stress Eastern Mediterranean yields, and close-in demand trends in the Shanghai market are softer than anticipated. At this point, we are over 93% booked for the year with book load factor and APD in a strong position. 
Beginning with Europe, yields have held up nicely for Northern Europe and Western Mediterranean sailings this year, partially driven by the consistent strength in demand that we have seen from European markets. The U.K. is the key sourcing market for our Europe sailings, and we have been closely monitoring demand since the Brexit decision. To date, we have not seen any softening in demand from the U.K. since the vote. And in fact, the U.K. remains one of our strongest markets this summer. 
Eastern Mediterranean itineraries, however, have experienced further weakness stemming from the multiple geopolitical events that have occurred in Europe. Not only have these put a strain on close-in demand and pricing, but they've also led us to make operational changes such as shifting embarkation out of Istanbul for several sailings. 
Turning to China. We introduced Ovation of the Seas to Tianjin just over a month ago, and she is generating superior yields even by China standards. Overall, the pace of bookings for the remainder of the China season has mostly been within the expected range and above last year. However, there has been some softness in close-in demand in Shanghai in recent weeks. Nevertheless, our China sailings, which represent 9% of our capacity, continue to generate yields that are above average, has occupancy levels that are in line with the fleet average, and the market is accretive to our yields and return on invested capital. 
Moving on to North America. Our Caribbean, Alaska and Bermuda itineraries account for about 50% of our full year capacity and continue to trend very well. We expect each of these products to generate nice yield improvements this year and also expect to see record yields in Alaska. We are generally seeing solid trends for our entire Caribbean portfolio, which ranges from 3-night Bahama sailings to 14-night Southern Caribbean itineraries. With the summer season coming to a close in the next few weeks, the focus will shift to the winter season, which is currently in a very strong book position. Harmony of the Seas continues to impress and has garnered strong demand at increasing prices throughout Q4 and well into 2017. It is still very early in the booking cycle for 2017 sailings; however, I will share that we are encouraged by recent booking trends in our current book position. We are booked ahead of same time last year in both load factor and APD for the next 12 months. 
Before I update you on our guidance for the year and the third quarter, I would like to touch on the recent sale of 51% of the Pullmantur Group to Springwater Capital. The Pullmantur Group operates a more value-based product, which delivers yields and costs that are lower than our fleet average. Consequently, the deconsolidation of Pullmantur has increased our yield-to-cost metrics and has an immaterial impact on earnings for this year. 
Now we can turn to our updated guidance for full year 2016, which is on Slide 4. Net revenue yields are expected to grow 4% to 4.5%, an increase versus prior guidance, driven by the deconsolidation of the Pullmantur Group. Strong demand for North American products is helping to offset some slightly weaker trends in Eastern Mediterranean and Shanghai. These product level trends are stressing Q3 yield growth but are providing strong tailwinds for Q4, where our mix of itineraries more closely resembles the first quarter. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are unchanged and are expected to be up approximately 1%. Cost savings in the third and fourth quarters are offsetting the increase driven by the Pullmantur deconsolidation.  
During the first quarter, foreign currencies rose versus the dollar, but since then, have declined. And fuel prices have increased modestly. Since we last gave guidance, this has resulted in a $0.27 negative impact to earnings in the back half of the year. To put it in perspective, since the beginning of the year, FX and the fuel movements have cost us $0.11. 
Since our last call, our basket of currencies has declined by 5.5%. The key driver of this decrease is the significant weakening of the British pound, which represents approximately 30% of our foreign currency exposure. 
We anticipate fuel expense of $724.5 million, down $10 million in part, due to the deconsolidation of Pullmantur. Excluding the deconsolidation, reduced consumption is offsetting higher fuel rates. We are currently 64% hedged for the remainder of the year at a price of $535 per metric ton. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share is in the range of $6 and $6.10 for the year. 
Before moving on to third quarter guidance, I thought it might be useful if I put the movement of our guidance in perspective. Slide 5 shows how we got from our original guidance for the year to our revised guidance in April and to our current guidance. As you can see, we originally projected $6 for the year. Over the last 6 months, our operations, excluding FX and fuel, improved by about $0.16. FX and fuel got better during the first quarter by about $0.16 but reversed itself until now and now looks to be a net cost of about $0.11. All of that brings us to our current forecast of a midpoint of $6.05 for the year. 
Now we can turn to our guidance for the third quarter which is on Slide 6. We anticipate a net yield increase of approximately 2%. The year-over-year improvement is primarily driven by the deconsolidation of the Pullmantur Group. As I previously mentioned, itinerary changes and weakness for Eastern Mediterranean cruises, combined with some softness in close-in demand for our Shanghai sailings, is disproportionally impacting the third quarter and offsetting improvements driven by new hardware and North American products. Net cruise costs, excluding fuel, are expected to be down approximately 1.5% on a constant currency basis, which includes an increase related to the deconsolidation of the Pullmantur Group. Taking all of this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $3.10 per share. 
With that, I will ask our operator to open the call for a question-and-answer session."

Also next year, we don't have new capacity in terms of new ships coming in, but we do benefit from 0.5 years of Ovation as well as Harmony coming in to the broader fleet. And then obviously, we're taking out some capacity as it relates to Pullmantur as we deconsolidate them, which is also a good tailwind for yield as well as for earnings next year."

Let me just respond to the question with regards to China yields. I think the way you described it is spot on, that is exactly how we do see it, that this is kind of a digestion challenge as it relates to capacity and the growth of this market, which has been quite extraordinary. We had planned for yield declines in '16. If you may recall, we were expecting to see some decline, and that has been the case. When you look at capacity, certainly in the Shanghai region, when we think of China, we think of it as one market. But of course, it's really 3 distinct markets: The north, Tianjin; the south in Hong Kong and south China; and of course, the east, which is Shanghai, the main market. And most of the capacity is in Shanghai. It's about 65% of the total China business. This year, Shanghai was up around 100%. So I think your comments were spot on. So we did expect to see those yield declines, and we are now dealing with the distribution opportunity. I think as we look into '17 in relation to capacity, the good news that we see at the moment in terms of '17 in Shanghai is that the growth rates are a lot more moderate and somewhere in the region of 15% to 20% as opposed to 100% this year.

But with the European market, and I think Richard had mentioned it or Jason had mentioned it earlier, particularly after Brexit, we've seen no drop-off at all in the demand. And certainly, from the European markets, we've been pleased with the demand that we've seen, and the European market seems to be particularly resilient. Normally, after we see an incident, an event, a terrorist event, you get this drop-off of bookings from both European and American markets.

Since the deconsolidated Pullmantur guidance is that sort of 50 basis point range and your previous guidance was 150 basis points, should we think about your guidance excluding the Pullmantur deconsolidation being sort of more than narrowing of the range, the 2.5% to 4% going to kind of 3% to 3.5%?

And especially when you focus on North America, which is very heavy in Q4, we're in a very strong position. So I think when you look at Q4 and you say, well, what's going to have yields drive to the -- to a high level, the first component you have to consider is about 300 basis points of that is Pullmantur's deconsolidation. The other thing which I think is important is our commentary about strength in North American products, strength in a mix of products that are very similar to what we had in Q1, which we saw very strong yield improvement for. And also I think just the comments we've had around Harmony and the attraction to Harmony as well as a lot of strength for Ovation out of Australia, which is where she'll be in the wintertime.

Joining me here in Miami are Richard Fain, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Goldstein, President and Chief Operating Officer; Michael Bayley, President and CEO of Royal Caribbean International; and Carol Cabezas, our Vice President of Investor Relations. 
During this call, we will be referring to a few slides, which have been posted on our investor website, www.rclinvestor.com. 
Before we get started, I would like to refer you to our notice about forward-looking statements, which is on our first slide. During this call, we will be making comments that are forward-looking. These statements do not guarantee future performance and do involve risks and uncertainties. Examples are described in our SEC filings and other disclosures. Additionally, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are adjusted as defined, and a reconciliation of these items can be found on our website. 
Richard will begin by providing an overview of the business. I will follow with a recap of our third quarter results, provide an update on the current booking environment and provide our early thoughts on 2017. I will close with guidance for the full year and fourth quarter. We will then open the call up for your questions.

We're quickly coming to the end of 2016, and we'll shortly be starting",1129,"Thanks, Jason and good morning, everybody. It's a pleasure to have the opportunity to share more about our business and our progress to the Double-Double, so let me get right to it. 
We're quickly coming to the end of 2016, and we'll shortly be starting the final year of our Double-Double Program. Reaching the Double-Double will be a significant accomplishment for the 65,000 women and men who collectively make Royal Caribbean cruises successful. However, I do want to emphasize that Double-Double is not an end in and of itself. Rather, it represents the completion of another step in our continuous journey of improving shareholder returns. 
The success of the Double-Double rests on 3 pillars: strengthening revenue yields, controlling costs and moderate growth. Our progress on this journey has been steady. Not only has the slope of the curve been very steep, but it's been remarkably strong and predictable. As you can see on Slide 2, both earnings and yields have consistently ended up right around the midpoint of the range that we stated at the beginning of each year. This track record comes despite some unexpected impact from things like foreign exchange and fuel. 
For example, our biggest nondollar market has been the U.K. but sterling has fallen 30% over the last 2 years, and that got a significant push from the recent Brexit end vote. This year is shaping up to deliver in a similar fashion. Our yield guidance today at 4% or better is about the same as it was at the beginning of the year when we adjusted the deconsolidation of Pullmantur. 
Earnings per share expectations on $6 to $6.10 are a little better than our original range despite the number of challenges that came our way this year. So the fact that our year is ending above our original guidance in spite of the challenges is a testament to the focused discipline and will of the team. For that, I express my appreciation. 
I'd also like to take a moment and sit back to discuss some of the developments to our core financial objectives, including achieving investment-grade metrics, improving shareholder returns and moderate capacity growth. I know that many of you model our performance outlook diligently, and you can see that we are now reaching the key financial metrics that are the threshold for investment grade. Getting to this point hasn't been easy but it is important. We are committed to achieving and maintaining a BBB credit status. In this regard, it was particularly satisfying when Moody's issued its upgrade of our improved outlook. It is rewarding to see progress on all our goals, and this is another big one. 
I also know that many of you are up-to-date on our announcements and have noticed our recent increase in dividends. Our dividend level is at an all-time high and is now 4x what it was just over 3 years ago. In the same period, we also executed significant buyback program. As our earnings continue to grow and as conditions warrant, and by that I include earnings and free cash flow, we will continue to engage in the mix of moderate dividend growth and share buyback programs. These steps are clear evidence of our commitment to improving shareholder returns. 
Now turning to the third pillar, moderate capacity growth. That's been a focal point of a lot of conversations. We said before that the pipeline in supply is known, [ph] and it's very much constrained by limited shipyard capacity. We said our target is 3% to 5% growth rate, and that's just what we've been doing. Through 2005, our 5 year actual capacity growth rate was just under 4% a year, and for the coming 5 years, it's also just under 4%. 
Now on the demand side, we've seen some markets contract such as the Eastern Mediterranean, but we've also seen new markets expand such as China and Australia. It's important to note that cruising is still under-penetrated in all of our markets including our core markets. We opened up new markets like China because they're growing at extraordinary rates, not because of inadequate demand elsewhere. For example, we're aware that some people have been arguing for years that the U.S. market is saturated. But we've been growing here strongly and consistently in both rate and volume and we expect to continue to do so for years to come. 
Our task is to continue to make people, especially non-cruisers, aware of all the cruising offers. That takes continued effort but it is working. This year alone, we've added more than 1.6 million new to cruise. That demonstrates our continued strength in this market and positions us for what we believe to be a bright future. 
Now before I hand the call back over to Jason, I want to touch on one more point related to environmental stewardship. Protecting the environment is a responsibility we take seriously at Royal Caribbean, both because of the impact on our environment and because it just makes good business sense. We focused heavily on reducing our carbon footprint, and we're proud to publish our energy consumption figures. They consistently show that our burning of fossil fuels shows the lowest figures reported by anyone in our industry. This success comes from a deep focus on finding new and better ways to do things. 
For example, our bubble technology, just more appropriately called our air lubrication system, reduces drag, thereby, reducing the need for burning fuel. But in keeping with our mantra of continuous improvement, we have gone 1 step further. Recently, we partnered with the World Wildlife Fund to take our sustainability performance to the next level. Together with WWF, we have announced publicly goals related to greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable food supply and destination stewardship. This partnership follows exciting progress on a number of other fronts, including our advanced wastewater purification systems and our zero landfill policy already implemented on 17 ships. 
We are also very pleased to be working with the EPA and have their support as we install advanced emissions purification or AEP systems on our ships. This is a massive and expensive task but a very impactful one. These AEP systems scrub more than 98% of the sulfur from our ships' exhaust. 
Lastly, we have recently announced a new class of ships dubbed Icon class. These ships will be powered by LNG and will also utilize the latest fuel cell technology. Fuel cells are the ultimate in smoke-free exhausts. The only emission from fuel cells is pure water. 
In conclusion, it's been a good quarter and the future looks very bright. Brexit and other factors have been unexpected blows but we have more than compensated in other ways. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jason. Jason?"

For the quarter, we generated adju",1441,"Thank you, Richard. I will begin by taking you through our results for the third quarter. Unless I state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant-currency basis. 
We have summarized our third quarter results on Slide 3. For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $3.20 per share, $0.10 better than the previous guidance. About half of the outperformance was driven by better revenue with the other half of the beef [ph] driven by a weaker dollar and lower fuel prices. Third quarter net revenue yield was better than expected, up 2.9% year-over-year. Strength in close-in demand for North American products was the primary driver of the outperformance. 
Onboard revenue yields for the quarter did not disappoint, with yields up 4.8% for the quarter. The growth was mainly driven by beverage packages and increasing demand for VOOM and Accelerate, our high-speed Internet offerings for World Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises, respectively. Costs were as expected for the quarter with net cruise costs excluding fuel, down 1.6%. 
Before I get into discussing booking trends, I would like to discuss deviations between the quarters. Our yield came in slightly better than expected in the third quarter and are expected to be slightly lower than our previous expectations in the fourth quarter. As a result, our yields for the full year are essentially unchanged. We often get asked whether these small aberrations between quarters signify a trend. The answer is no, and I would like to explain why. The reality is that we manage a large and diversified portfolio of brands, markets and products. This complex portfolio obviously has minor deviations especially in a period as short as a quarter. This year is a good example. Something as simple and insignificant as the delay in the deployment of the Empress of the Seas will drive yields to be lower for the fourth quarter than we originally expected. This delay has no long-term significance but it does affect quarterly figures. 
As Richard mentioned, our track record is pretty good, and Slide 2 shows that over the past several years, we have been able to deliver annual yield and earning results in line with the original guidance we set for the year. We don't see this immaterial aberration between Q3 and Q4 to be a trend, just a reflection of managing a global and diversified portfolio. This is further supported by the 2017 booking trend commentary I will be providing shortly. 
Now I will share trends in the demand environment for the balance of 2016 and provide early insights into 2017. Let me start off by discussing the fourth quarter where our mix of deployment shifts versus the summer. We have more capacity in the Caribbean and Australia and less in the Mediterranean. Our year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter Caribbean deployment is driven by the additions of both Harmony of the Sea and Empress of the Sea in South Florida. As a result, Caribbean itineraries will account for half of our Q4 capacity. We expect Caribbean yields to be up mid-single digits for the quarter, which as I previously mentioned, is softer than our previous expectations due to the delay in opening Empress of the Seas for sale. Expectations for the rest of the Caribbean products remain relatively unchanged. Asia Pacific and Europe itineraries are generally performing in line with our previous outlook. So in summary, we are 94% booked for the fourth quarter, and with the exception of Empress, yields are shaping up as expected. 
Moving on to 2017. I want to start by providing you an overview of some of the structural factors and deployment changes that play a part in the upcoming year. I will then discuss the early trends we are seeing in the business. We will see a benefit in the first half of the year from the addition of both Harmony of the Seas and Ovation of the Seas. We will have a tailwind to our yields related to the deconsolidation of Pullmantur, which is worth a little over 250 basis points for the first half of next year. As a reminder, our portion of Pullmantur's results will be reported as an equity pickup, and since we continue to own the vessels, we will continue to incur depreciation for the ships. Lastly, our joint venture with TUI Cruises will receive another new ship during the second quarter. 
As we announced earlier this year, Legend of the Seas will exit the fleet at the end of the first quarter. This sale is very much in line with our fleet strategy of opportunistically selling order capacity. We are making several changes to our itinerary mix in 2017 that will reduce exposure to the Eastern Mediterranean while bringing new hardware to the Caribbean and moderately growing the Asia Pacific region. 
Our Caribbean deployment will increase in 2017 and will represent just under half of our total capacity. This increase is largely due to the expanded season for both Harmony of the Seas and Celebrity Equinox. Both of these ships will remain in the Caribbean year-round versus sailing in Europe as they did during the summer of 2016. The change in deployment for these ships combined with the deconsolidation of Pullmantur are driving a reduction in Mediterranean capacity. As a result, Europe will represent 15% of our overall capacity in 2017 versus 20% in 2016. 
Asia Pacific itineraries will account for approximately 20% of our capacity, which is relatively consistent with 2016. Our capacity in China will decrease slightly as the longer season of Ovation of the Seas is only offsetting a portion of the reduction due to the sale of the Legend of the Seas. 
While it's still too early to provide guidance for next year, I will share some preliminary insights. Our booked position is stronger than last year as we are up in both pricing and load factors across all major markets for light deployment. This is particularly noteworthy when you consider that our book load factor has improved each year for the past several years, culminating in a record high for next year. Our Caribbean and Alaska products are trending well despite very difficult comparisons in 2016, and bookings for European sales are up nicely year-over-year, driven by strong demand from North America. We are also pleased with how the winter Asia Pacific season is shaping up, with both Australia and China sailings booked ahead of prior year load factors in the first quarter. Although it's still early in the booking window, these insights provide added confidence in our path towards the Double-Double, and we expect that 2017 will be our 8th conservative year of yield improvement. 
If you turn to Slide 4, you will see our guidance for the full year 2016. Net revenue yields are expected to be up 4% or better, essentially unchanged from last quarter's guidance. Our cost guidance is also unchanged with net cruise costs, excluding fuel, expected to be up approximately 1%. Our fuel costs for the year have decreased since our last call to $720 million driven by rate, and we are 68% hedge for the remainder of 2016 at a price of $535 per metric ton. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share guidance is expected to be in the range of $6 to $6.10 per share, unchanged from previous guidance. 
To summarize, the changes we have made since the last call, we exceeded the third quarter by $0.10 per share, approximately half of which was driven by the outperformance of our North American products. This beef [ph] is helping to offset the previously mentioned impact from the delay in the deployment of Empress of the Seas. A weaker U.S. dollar and lower fuel prices contributed the other half of the third quarter beef [ph]. However, this trend reverses itself in the fourth quarter. 
Now I would like to walk you through our fourth quarter guidance on Slide 5. Net yields are expected to be up approximately 6%. The year-over-year increase is being driven by the deconsolidation of Pullmantur and strong trend on our Caribbean and Australia itineraries. Harmony of the Seas in the Caribbean and Ovation of the Seas in Australia are doing particularly well. Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to be down approximately 1.5%, and we have included $189 million of fuel expense for the quarter. Taking all of this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $1.20 for the quarter, which represents nearly 30% growth year-over-year. 
With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session."

If you think you could see yield pressure again in China, and then also your confidence level of growing yields in the Caribbean?

The commentary on Asia Pac, which really, at this point in the year, we have pretty good visibility into the first quarter, it's been encouraging and hopefully those trends continue on as that product books further out here over time. And then when we talk about the Caribbean, and I would also include Europe in there, at this point in time in the year, a lot of that is driven by the North American consumer. And as I commented in my remarks that we have seen very positive trends in both the rate and volume basis for the Caribbean as well as for our European products. And then to answer your question on the currency side, certainly, the strength of the dollar relative to the pound has been challenging. If you want to say, well, what it has kind of been since the last call, it's probably hurt us by about $0.12 to $0.15.

Equinox in the Eastern Mediterranean and really kind of in the center of a lot of movements we have to make with some of the geopolitical events that were happening. And so we expect the Equinox to be yield accretive to the corporation next year. On the fuel side, in '17, we're hedge about 60%. The average hedge rate there is about $508 and '18, we're 45% hedged and we're about $452 on the average hedge. And we continue to focus on having a hedge program to minimize the volatility within our P&L and we also respect that there's typically an inverse relationship between fuel and currency. We also take in consideration the fuel curve and it has flattened out. And so there's -- earlier last year, we did take advantage and put a little bit more hedging on in '16 and in the outer years but you should expect us to continue to be pretty consistent to the past of that kind of 40% to 60% outside of things.

As we look into 2018, we do have a couple of things that are quite exciting. We do have the fourth of the Oasis class ships. Even more so, '18 will show Edge class and the Edge class is a new class of ships which I think in its own way will be as innovative and as transformational as Oasis has been. We're very excited about it. We'll probably be talking more about that early next year but Celebrity really has been on a role and I think we'll see that benefits of that if it continues going away. It's going, we'll see the benefits of that in '17 and '18. And then, when Edge comes, I think people are really going to be blown away. So I'm very excited about '18. But the importance of a program like Double-Double is to focus on a particular goal and one of the things that's been very successful for us is everybody's focused on achieving the Double-Double in 2017 and so that's our first one and I will be careful not to dwell too much on what comes after."

It's a pleasure to have the opportunity to share more about our business and our progress to the Double-Double, so let me get right to it. We're quickly coming to the end of 2016, and we'll shortly be starting",1128,"Thanks, Jason and good morning, everybody. It's a pleasure to have the opportunity to share more about our business and our progress to the Double-Double, so let me get right to it. 
We're quickly coming to the end of 2016, and we'll shortly be starting the final year of our Double-Double Program. Reaching the Double-Double will be a significant accomplishment for the 65,000 women and men who collectively make Royal Caribbean cruises successful. However, I do want to emphasize that Double-Double is not an end in and of itself. Rather, it represents the completion of another step in our continuous journey of improving shareholder returns. 
The success of the Double-Double rests on 3 pillars: strengthening revenue yields, controlling costs and moderate growth. Our progress on this journey has been steady. Not only has the slope of the curve been very steep, but it's been remarkably strong and predictable. As you can see on Slide 2, both earnings and yields have consistently ended up right around the midpoint of the range that we stated at the beginning of each year. This track record comes despite some unexpected impact from things like foreign exchange and fuel. 
For example, our biggest nondollar market has been the U.K. but sterling has fallen 30% over the last 2 years, and that got a significant push from the recent Brexit end vote. This year is shaping up to deliver in a similar fashion. Our yield guidance today at 4% or better is about the same as it was at the beginning of the year when we adjusted the deconsolidation of Pullmantur. 
Earnings per share expectations on $6 to $6.10 are a little better than our original range despite the number of challenges that came our way this year. So the fact that our year is ending above our original guidance in spite of the challenges is a testament to the focused discipline and will of the team. For that, I express my appreciation. 
I'd also like to take a moment and sit back to discuss some of the developments to our core financial objectives, including achieving investment-grade metrics, improving shareholder returns and moderate capacity growth. I know that many of you model our performance outlook diligently, and you can see that we are now reaching the key financial metrics that are the threshold for investment grade. Getting to this point hasn't been easy but it is important. We are committed to achieving and maintaining a BBB credit status. In this regard, it was particularly satisfying when Moody's issued its upgrade of our improved outlook. It is rewarding to see progress on all our goals, and this is another big one. 
I also know that many of you are up-to-date on our announcements and have noticed our recent increase in dividends. Our dividend level is at an all-time high and is now 4x what it was just over 3 years ago. In the same period, we also executed significant buyback program. As our earnings continue to grow and as conditions warrant, and by that I include earnings and free cash flow, we will continue to engage in the mix of moderate dividend growth and share buyback programs. These steps are clear evidence of our commitment to improving shareholder returns. 
Now turning to the third pillar, moderate capacity growth. That's been a focal point of a lot of conversations. We said before that the pipeline in supply is known, and it's very much constrained by limited shipyard capacity. We said our target is 3% to 5% growth rate, and that's just what we've been doing. Through 2005, our 5 year actual capacity growth rate was just under 4% a year, and for the coming 5 years, it's also just under 4%. 
Now on the demand side, we've seen some markets contract such as the Eastern Mediterranean, but we've also seen new markets expand such as China and Australia. It's important to note that cruising is still under-penetrated in all of our markets including our core markets. We opened up new markets like China because they're growing at extraordinary rates, not because of inadequate demand elsewhere. For example, we're aware that some people have been arguing for years that the U.S. market is saturated. But we've been growing here strongly and consistently in both rate and volume and we expect to continue to do so for years to come. 
Our task is to continue to make people, especially non-cruisers, aware of all the cruising offers. That takes continued effort but it is working. This year alone, we've added more than 1.6 million new to cruise. That demonstrates our continued strength in this market and positions us for what we believe to be a bright future. 
Now before I hand the call back over to Jason, I want to touch on one more point related to environmental stewardship. Protecting the environment is a responsibility we take seriously at Royal Caribbean, both because of the impact on our environment and because it just makes good business sense. We focused heavily on reducing our carbon footprint, and we're proud to publish our energy consumption figures. They consistently show that our burning of fossil fuels shows the lowest figures reported by anyone in our industry. This success comes from a deep focus on finding new and better ways to do things. 
For example, our bubble technology, just more appropriately called our air lubrication system, reduces drag, thereby, reducing the need for burning fuel. But in keeping with our mantra of continuous improvement, we have gone 1 step further. Recently, we partnered with the World Wildlife Fund to take our sustainability performance to the next level. Together with WWF, we have announced publicly goals related to greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable food supply and destination stewardship. This partnership follows exciting progress on a number of other fronts, including our advanced wastewater purification systems and our zero landfill policy already implemented on 17 ships. 
We are also very pleased to be working with the EPA and have their support as we install advanced emissions purification or AEP systems on our ships. This is a massive and expensive task but a very impactful one. These AEP systems scrub more than 98% of the sulfur from our ships' exhaust. 
Lastly, we have recently announced a new class of ships dubbed Icon class. These ships will be powered by LNG and will also utilize the latest fuel cell technology. Fuel cells are the ultimate in smoke-free exhausts. The only emission from fuel cells is pure water. 
In conclusion, it's been a good quarter and the future looks very bright. Brexit and other factors have been unexpected blows but we have more than compensated in other ways. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jason. Jason?"

I will begin by taking you through our results for the third quarter. Unless I state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant-currency basis. We have summarized our third quarter results on Slide 3. For the quarter, we generated adju",1438,"Thank you, Richard. I will begin by taking you through our results for the third quarter. Unless I state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant-currency basis. 
We have summarized our third quarter results on Slide 3. For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $3.20 per share, $0.10 better than the previous guidance. About half of the outperformance was driven by better revenue with the other half of the beat driven by a weaker dollar and lower fuel prices. Third quarter net revenue yield was better than expected, up 2.9% year-over-year. Strength in close-in demand for North American products was the primary driver of the outperformance. 
Onboard revenue yields for the quarter did not disappoint, with yields up 4.8% for the quarter. The growth was mainly driven by beverage packages and increasing demand for VOOM and Accelerate, our high-speed Internet offerings for World Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises, respectively. Costs were as expected for the quarter with net cruise costs excluding fuel, down 1.6%. 
Before I get into discussing booking trends, I would like to discuss deviations between the quarters. Our yield came in slightly better than expected in the third quarter and are expected to be slightly lower than our previous expectations in the fourth quarter. As a result, our yields for the full year are essentially unchanged. We often get asked whether these small aberrations between quarters signify a trend. The answer is no, and I would like to explain why. The reality is that we manage a large and diversified portfolio of brands, markets and products. This complex portfolio obviously has minor deviations especially in a period as short as a quarter. This year is a good example. Something as simple and insignificant as the delay in the deployment of the Empress of the Seas will drive yields to be lower for the fourth quarter than we originally expected. This delay has no long-term significance but it does affect quarterly figures. 
As Richard mentioned, our track record is pretty good, and Slide 2 shows that over the past several years, we have been able to deliver annual yield and earning results in line with the original guidance we set for the year. We don't see this immaterial aberration between Q3 and Q4 to be a trend, just a reflection of managing a global and diversified portfolio. This is further supported by the 2017 booking trend commentary I will be providing shortly. 
Now I will share trends in the demand environment for the balance of 2016 and provide early insights into 2017. Let me start off by discussing the fourth quarter where our mix of deployment shifts versus the summer. We have more capacity in the Caribbean and Australia and less in the Mediterranean. Our year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter Caribbean deployment is driven by the additions of both Harmony of the Sea and Empress of the Sea in South Florida. As a result, Caribbean itineraries will account for half of our Q4 capacity. We expect Caribbean yields to be up mid-single digits for the quarter, which as I previously mentioned, is softer than our previous expectations due to the delay in opening Empress of the Seas for sale. Expectations for the rest of the Caribbean products remain relatively unchanged. Asia Pacific and Europe itineraries are generally performing in line with our previous outlook. So in summary, we are 94% booked for the fourth quarter, and with the exception of Empress, yields are shaping up as expected. 
Moving on to 2017. I want to start by providing you an overview of some of the structural factors and deployment changes that play a part in the upcoming year. I will then discuss the early trends we are seeing in the business. We will see a benefit in the first half of the year from the addition of both Harmony of the Seas and Ovation of the Seas. We will have a tailwind to our yields related to the deconsolidation of Pullmantur, which is worth a little over 250 basis points for the first half of next year. As a reminder, our portion of Pullmantur's results will be reported as an equity pickup, and since we continue to own the vessels, we will continue to incur depreciation for the ships. Lastly, our joint venture with TUI Cruises will receive another new ship during the second quarter. 
As we announced earlier this year, Legend of the Seas will exit the fleet at the end of the first quarter. This sale is very much in line with our fleet strategy of opportunistically selling order capacity. We are making several changes to our itinerary mix in 2017 that will reduce exposure to the Eastern Mediterranean while bringing new hardware to the Caribbean and moderately growing the Asia Pacific region. 
Our Caribbean deployment will increase in 2017 and will represent just under half of our total capacity. This increase is largely due to the expanded season for both Harmony of the Seas and Celebrity Equinox. Both of these ships will remain in the Caribbean year-round versus sailing in Europe as they did during the summer of 2016. The change in deployment for these ships combined with the deconsolidation of Pullmantur are driving a reduction in Mediterranean capacity. As a result, Europe will represent 15% of our overall capacity in 2017 versus 20% in 2016. 
Asia Pacific itineraries will account for approximately 20% of our capacity, which is relatively consistent with 2016. Our capacity in China will decrease slightly as the longer season of Ovation of the Seas is only offsetting a portion of the reduction due to the sale of the Legend of the Seas. 
While it's still too early to provide guidance for next year, I will share some preliminary insights. Our booked position is stronger than last year as we are up in both pricing and load factors across all major markets for light deployment. This is particularly noteworthy when you consider that our book load factor has improved each year for the past several years, culminating in a record high for next year. Our Caribbean and Alaska products are trending well despite very difficult comparisons in 2016, and bookings for European sales are up nicely year-over-year, driven by strong demand from North America. We are also pleased with how the winter Asia Pacific season is shaping up, with both Australia and China sailings booked ahead of prior year load factors in the first quarter. Although it's still early in the booking window, these insights provide added confidence in our path towards the Double-Double, and we expect that 2017 will be our 8th conservative year of yield improvement. 
If you turn to Slide 4, you will see our guidance for the full year 2016. Net revenue yields are expected to be up 4% or better, essentially unchanged from last quarter's guidance. Our cost guidance is also unchanged with net cruise costs, excluding fuel, expected to be up approximately 1%. Our fuel costs for the year have decreased since our last call to $720 million driven by rate, and we are 68% hedged for the remainder of 2016 at a price of $535 per metric ton. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share guidance is expected to be in the range of $6 to $6.10 per share, unchanged from previous guidance. 
To summarize, the changes we have made since the last call, we exceeded the third quarter by $0.10 per share, approximately half of which was driven by the outperformance of our North American products. This beat is helping to offset the previously mentioned impact from the delay in the deployment of Empress of the Seas. A weaker U.S. dollar and lower fuel prices contributed the other half of the third quarter beat. However, this trend reverses itself in the fourth quarter. 
Now I would like to walk you through our fourth quarter guidance on Slide 5. Net yields are expected to be up approximately 6%. The year-over-year increase is being driven by the deconsolidation of Pullmantur and strong trend on our Caribbean and Australia itineraries. Harmony of the Seas in the Caribbean and Ovation of the Seas in Australia are doing particularly well. Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to be down approximately 1.5%, and we have included $189 million of fuel expense for the quarter. Taking all of this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $1.20 for the quarter, which represents nearly 30% growth year-over-year. 
With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session."

And then when we talk about the Caribbean, and I would also include Europe in there, at this point in time in the year, a lot of that is driven by the North American consumer. And as I commented in my remarks that we have seen very positive trends in both the rate and volume basis for the Caribbean as well as for our European products. And then to answer your question on the currency side, certainly, the strength of the dollar relative to the pound has been challenging. If you want to say, well, what it has kind of been since the last call, it's probably hurt us by about $0.12 to $0.15.

Equinox mainly was in the Eastern Mediterranean and really kind of in the center of a lot of movements we have to make with her with some of the geopolitical events that were happening. And so we do expect the Equinox to be yield accretive to the corporation next year. On the fuel side, in '17, we're hedged about 60%. The average hedge rate there is about $508 and in '18, we're 45% hedged and we're about $452, the average hedge. And we continue to focus in -- on having a hedge program to minimize the volatility within our P&L, and we also respect that there's typically an inverse relationship between fuel and currency. We also take into consideration the fuel curve, and it has flattened out. And so there's -- earlier last year, we did take advantage and put a little bit more hedging on -- in '16 and in the outer years, but you should I think expect us to continue to be pretty consistent to the past of that kind of 40% to 60% side of things and again, with a goal of minimizing volatility within the P&L."

We -- in terms of what comes after Double-Double, I don't know whether it'll be another program of that type or some other type. It was -- the Double-Double was really to focus on a particular phase in our history, and I think it served that role very well. As we look at 2018, we do have a couple of things that are quite exciting. We do have the fourth of the Oasis class ships. But I'd say, even more so, '18 will show Edge class. And the Edge class is a new class of ships which I think, in its own way, will be as innovative and as transformational as Oasis has been. We're very excited about it. We'll probably be talking more about that early next year. But Celebrity really has been on a role, and I think we'll see the benefits of that if it continues going away. It's going, we'll see the benefits of that in '17 and '18. And then when Edge comes, I think people are really going to be blown away. So I'm very excited about '18. But the importance of a program like Double-Double is to focus on a particular goal. And one of the things that's been very successful for us is everybody is focused on achieving the Double-Double in 2017. And so that's our first one, and I will be careful not to dwell too much on what comes after."

So I wouldn't necessarily say that -- it is obviously a tough comp because Q1 was strong, but there are some good tailwinds going into the first quarter."

I think in the Caribbean, a lot of investors have been spooked as of late as we look at some of the pricing analysis that's out there.

Maybe help us connect the dots there. Is it the same as normal that it's just not a whole lot of rooms being booked at those rates? What are your thoughts there?

It's a pleasure to have the opportunity to share more about our business and our progress to the Double-Double, so let me get right to it. We're quickly coming to the end of 2016, and we'll shortly be starting",1129,"Thanks, Jason and good morning, everybody. It's a pleasure to have the opportunity to share more about our business and our progress to the Double-Double, so let me get right to it. 
We're quickly coming to the end of 2016, and we'll shortly be starting the final year of our Double-Double Program. Reaching the Double-Double will be a significant accomplishment for the 65,000 women and men who collectively make Royal Caribbean cruises successful. However, I do want to emphasize that Double-Double is not an end in and of itself. Rather, it represents the completion of another step in our continuous journey of improving shareholder returns. 
The success of the Double-Double rests on 3 pillars: strengthening revenue yields, controlling costs and moderate growth. Our progress on this journey has been steady. Not only has the slope of the curve been very steep, but it's been remarkably strong and predictable. As you can see on Slide 2, both earnings and yields have consistently ended up right around the midpoint of the range that we stated at the beginning of each year. This track record comes despite some unexpected impact from things like foreign exchange and fuel. 
For example, our biggest nondollar market has been the U.K., but sterling has fallen 30% over the last 2 years, and that got a significant push from the recent Brexit end vote. This year is shaping up to deliver in a similar fashion. Our yield guidance today at 4% or better is about the same as it was at the beginning of the year when we adjusted the deconsolidation of Pullmantur. 
Earnings per share expectations of $6 to $6.10 are a little better than our original range despite a number of challenges that came our way this year. So the fact that our year is ending above our original guidance in spite of the challenges is a testament to the focused discipline and will of the team. For that, I express my appreciation. 
I'd also like to take a moment and sit back to discuss some of the developments to our core financial objectives, including achieving investment-grade metrics, improving shareholder returns and moderate capacity growth. I know that many of you model our performance outlook diligently, and you can see that we are now reaching the key financial metrics that are the threshold for investment grade. Getting to this point hasn't been easy but it is important. We are committed to achieving and maintaining a BBB credit status. In this regard, it was particularly satisfying when Moody's issued its upgrade of our improved outlook. It is rewarding to see progress on all our goals, and this is another big one. 
I also know that many of you are up-to-date on our announcements and have noticed our recent increase in dividends. Our dividend level is at an all-time high and is now 4x what it was just over 3 years ago. In the same period, we also executed significant buyback program. As our earnings continue to grow and as conditions warrant, and by that I include earnings and free cash flow, we will continue to engage in a mix of moderate dividend growth and share buyback programs. These steps are clear evidence of our commitment to improving shareholder returns. 
Now turning to the third pillar, moderate capacity growth. That's been a focal point of a lot of conversation. We said before that the pipeline in supply is known, and it's very much constrained by limited shipyard capacity. We said our target is 3% to 5% growth rate, and that's just what we've been doing. Through 2005, our 5 year actual capacity growth rate was just under 4% a year, and for the coming 5 years, it's also just under 4%. 
Now on the demand side, we've seen some markets contract such as the Eastern Mediterranean, but we've also seen new markets expand such as China and Australia. It's important to note that cruising is still under-penetrated in all of our markets including our core markets. We opened up new markets like China because they're growing at extraordinary rates, not because of inadequate demand elsewhere. For example, we're aware that some people have been arguing for years that the U.S. market is saturated. But we've been growing here strongly and consistently in both rate and volume and we expect to continue to do so for years to come. 
Our task is to continue to make people, especially non-cruisers, aware of all that cruising offers. That takes continued effort but it is working. This year alone, we've added more than 1.6 million new to cruise. That demonstrates our continued strength in this market and positions us for what we believe to be a bright future. 
Now before I hand the call back over to Jason, I want to touch on one more point related to environmental stewardship. Protecting the environment is a responsibility we take seriously at Royal Caribbean, both because of the impact on our environment and because it just makes good business sense. We focus heavily on reducing our carbon footprint, and we're proud to publish our energy consumption figures. They consistently show that our burning of fossil fuels shows the lowest figures reported by anyone in our industry. This success comes from a deep focus on finding new and better ways to do things. 
For example, our bubble technology, which is more properly called our air lubrication system, reduces drag, thereby, reducing the need for burning fuel. But in keeping with our mantra of continuous improvement, we have gone 1 step further. Recently, we partnered with the World Wildlife Fund to take our sustainability performance to the next level. Together with WWF, we have announced publicly goals related to greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable food supply and destination stewardship. This partnership follows exciting progress on a number of other fronts, including our advanced wastewater purification systems and our zero landfill policy already implemented on 17 ships. 
We are also very pleased to be working with the EPA and have their support as we install advanced emissions purification or AEP systems on our ships. This is a massive and expensive task but a very impactful one. These AEP systems scrub more than 98% of the sulfur from our ships' exhaust. 
Lastly, we have recently announced a new class of ships dubbed Icon class. These ships will be powered by LNG and will also utilize the latest fuel cell technology. Fuel cells are the ultimate in smoke-free exhausts. The only emission from fuel cells is pure water. 
In conclusion, it's been a good quarter and the future looks very bright. Brexit and other factors have been unexpected blows but we have more than compensated in other ways. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jason. Jason?"

I will begin by taking you through our results for the third quarter. Unless I state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant-currency basis. We have summarized our third quarter results on Slide 3. For the quarter, we generated adju",1438,"Thank you, Richard. I will begin by taking you through our results for the third quarter. Unless I state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant-currency basis. 
We have summarized our third quarter results on Slide 3. For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $3.20 per share, $0.10 better than the previous guidance. About half of the outperformance was driven by better revenue with the other half of the beat driven by a weaker dollar and lower fuel prices. Third quarter net revenue yield was better than expected, up 2.9% year-over-year. Strength in close-in demand for North American products was the primary driver of the outperformance. 
Onboard revenue yields for the quarter did not disappoint, with yields up 4.8% for the quarter. The growth was mainly driven by beverage packages and increasing demand for VOOM and Accelerate, our high-speed Internet offerings for World Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises, respectively. Costs were as expected for the quarter with net cruise costs excluding fuel, down 1.6%. 
Before I get into discussing booking trends, I would like to discuss deviations between the quarters. Our yield came in slightly better than expected in the third quarter and are expected to be slightly lower than our previous expectations in the fourth quarter. As a result, our yields for the full year are essentially unchanged. We often get asked whether these small aberrations between quarters signify a trend. The answer is no, and I would like to explain why. The reality is that we manage a large and diversified portfolio of brands, markets and products. This complex portfolio obviously has minor deviations especially in a period as short as a quarter. This year is a good example. Something as simple and insignificant as the delay in the deployment of the Empress of the Seas will drive yields to be lower for the fourth quarter than we originally expected. This delay has no long-term significance, but it does affect quarterly figures. 
As Richard mentioned, our track record is pretty good, and Slide 2 shows that over the past several years, we have been able to deliver annual yield and earning results in line with the original guidance we set for the year. We don't see this immaterial aberration between Q3 and Q4 to be a trend, just a reflection of managing a global and diversified portfolio. This is further supported by the 2017 booking trend commentary I will be providing shortly. 
Now I will share trends in the demand environment for the balance of 2016 and provide early insights into 2017. Let me start off by discussing the fourth quarter where our mix of deployment shifts versus the summer. We have more capacity in the Caribbean and Australia and less in the Mediterranean. Our year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter Caribbean deployment is driven by the additions of both Harmony of the Sea and Empress of the Sea in South Florida. As a result, Caribbean itineraries will account for half of our Q4 capacity. We expect Caribbean yields to be up mid-single digits for the quarter which, as I previously mentioned, is softer than our previous expectations due to the delay in opening Empress of the Seas for sale. Expectations for the rest of the Caribbean products remain relatively unchanged. Asia Pacific and Europe itineraries are generally performing in line with our previous outlook. So in summary, we are 94% booked for the fourth quarter, and with the exception of Empress, yields are shaping up as expected. 
Moving on to 2017. I want to start by providing you an overview of some of the structural factors and deployment changes that play a part in the upcoming year. I will then discuss the early trends we are seeing in the business. We will see a benefit in the first half of the year from the addition of both Harmony of the Seas and Ovation of the Seas. We will have a tailwind to our yields related to the deconsolidation of Pullmantur, which is worth a little over 250 basis points for the first half of next year. As a reminder, our portion of Pullmantur's results will be reported as an equity pickup, and since we continue to own the vessels, we will continue to incur depreciation for the ships. Lastly, our joint venture with TUI Cruises will receive another new ship during the second quarter. 
As we announced earlier this year, Legend of the Seas will exit the fleet at the end of the first quarter. This sale is very much in line with our fleet strategy of opportunistically selling order capacity. We are making several changes to our itinerary mix in 2017 that will reduce exposure to the Eastern Mediterranean while bringing new hardware to the Caribbean and moderately growing the Asia Pacific region. 
Our Caribbean deployment will increase in 2017 and will represent just under half of our total capacity. This increase is largely due to the expanded season for both Harmony of the Seas and Celebrity Equinox. Both of these ships will remain in the Caribbean year-round versus sailing in Europe as they did during the summer of 2016. The change in deployment for these ships combined with the deconsolidation of Pullmantur are driving a reduction in Mediterranean capacity. As a result, Europe will represent 15% of our overall capacity in 2017 versus 20% in 2016. 
Asia Pacific itineraries will account for approximately 20% of our capacity, which is relatively consistent with 2016. Our capacity in China will decrease slightly as the longer season of Ovation of the Seas is only offsetting a portion of the reduction due to the sale of the Legend of the Seas. 
While it's still too early to provide guidance for next year, I will share some preliminary insights. Our booked position is stronger than last year as we are up in both pricing and load factors across all major markets for light deployment. This is particularly noteworthy when you consider that our book load factor has improved each year for the past several years, culminating in a record high for next year. Our Caribbean and Alaska products are trending well despite very difficult comparisons in 2016, and bookings for European sailings are up nicely year-over-year, driven by strong demand from North America. We are also pleased with how the winter Asia Pacific season is shaping up, with both Australia and China sailings booked ahead of prior year load factors in the first quarter. Although it's still early in the booking window, these insights provide added confidence in our path towards the Double-Double, and we expect that 2017 will be our eighth consecutive year of yield improvement. 
If you turn to Slide 4, you will see our guidance for the full year 2016. Net revenue yields are expected to be up 4% or better, essentially unchanged from last quarter's guidance. Our cost guidance is also unchanged with net cruise costs, excluding fuel, expected to be up approximately 1%. Our fuel costs for the year have decreased since our last call to $720 million driven by rate, and we are 68% hedged for the remainder of 2016 at a price of $535 per metric ton. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share guidance is expected to be in the range of $6 to $6.10 per share, unchanged from previous guidance. 
To summarize, the changes we have made since the last call, we exceeded the third quarter by $0.10 per share, approximately half of which was driven by the outperformance of our North American products. This beat is helping to offset the previously mentioned impact from the delay in the deployment of Empress of the Seas. A weaker U.S. dollar and lower fuel prices contributed the other half of the third quarter beat. However, this trend reverses itself in the fourth quarter. 
Now I would like to walk you through our fourth quarter guidance on Slide 5. Net yields are expected to be up approximately 6%. The year-over-year increase is being driven by the deconsolidation of Pullmantur and strong trend on our Caribbean and Australia itineraries. Harmony of the Seas in the Caribbean and Ovation of the Seas in Australia are doing particularly well. Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to be down approximately 1.5%, and we have included $189 million of fuel expense for the quarter. Taking all of this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $1.20 for the quarter, which represents nearly 30% growth year-over-year. 
With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session."

The commentary on Asia Pac, which really, at this point in the year, we have pretty good visibility into the first quarter, it's been encouraging and hopefully those trends continue on as that product books further out here over time. And then when we talk about the Caribbean, and I would also include Europe in there, at this point in time in the year, a lot of that is driven by the North American consumer. And as I commented in my remarks that we have seen very positive trends in both the rate and volume basis for the Caribbean as well as for our European products. And then to answer your question on the currency side, certainly, the strength of the dollar relative to the pound has been challenging. If you want to say, well, what it has kind of been since the last call, it's probably hurt us by about $0.12 to $0.15. And so there's -- there are always headwinds in our business that we have to focus on and overcome, but that's kind of been the impact since the last time we spoke here in early August."

The average hedge rate there is about $508 and in '18, we're 45% hedged and we're about $452, is the average hedge. And we continue to focus in -- on having a hedge program to minimize the volatility within our P&L, and we also respect that there's typically an inverse relationship between fuel and currency. We also take into consideration the fuel curve, and it has flattened out.

We -- in terms of what comes after Double-Double, I don't know whether it'll be another program of that type or some other type. It was -- the Double-Double was really to focus on a particular phase in our history, and I think it served that role very well. As we look to 2018, we do have a couple of things that are quite exciting. We do have the fourth of the Oasis class ships. But I'd say, even more so, '18 will show Edge class. And the Edge class is a new class of ships which I think, in its own way, will be as innovative and as transformational as Oasis has been. We're very excited about it. We'll probably be talking more about that early next year. But Celebrity really has been on a roll, and I think we'll see the benefits of that. If it continues going the way it's going, we'll see the benefits of that in '17 and '18. And then when Edge comes, I think people are really going to be blown away. So I'm very excited about '18. But the importance of a program like Double-Double is to focus on a particular goal. And one of the things that's been very successful for us is everybody is focused on achieving the Double-Double in 2017. And so that's our first one, and I will be careful not to dwell too much on what comes after."

This year, we've turned that around, and we've seen a really positive increase in new to cruise. And of course, that's very much part of our focus is new to cruise, not only in emerging new and developing markets, but also in established markets like the U.S. So we feel quite encouraged about what we're seeing. And part of that is the campaign that we launched at the beginning of the year and also Celebrity's campaign. Both of those campaigns have components that are very much attractive to new to cruise.

And so they actually focused more of their marketing, focused more on their message, and they actually worked to build that.

It's a pleasure to have the opportunity to share more about our business and our progress to the Double-Double, so let me get right to it. 
We're quickly coming to the end of 2016, and we'll shortly be starting the final year of our Double-Double Program. Reaching the Double-Double will be a significant accomplishment for the 65,000 women and men who collectively make Royal Caribbean cruises successful. However, I do want to emphasize that Double-Double is not an end in and of itself. Rather, it represents the completion of another step in our continuous journey of improving shareholder returns. 
The success of the Double-Double rests on 3 pillars: strengthening revenue yields, controlling costs and moderate growth. Our progress on this journey has been steady. Not only has the slope of the curve been very steep, but it's been remarkably strong and predictable. As you can see on Slide 2, both earnings and yields have consistently ended up right around the midpoint of the range that we stated at the beginning of each year. This track record comes despite some unexpected impact from things like foreign exchange and fuel. 
For example, our biggest nondollar market has been the U.K., but sterling has fallen 30% over the last 2 years, and that got a significant push from the recent Brexit end vote. This year is shaping up to deliver in a similar fashion. Our yield guidance today at 4% or better is about the same as it was at the beginning of the year when we adjusted the deconsolidation of Pullmantur. 
Earnings per share expectations of $6 to $6.10 are a little better than our original range despite a number of challenges that came our way this year. So the fact that our year is ending above our original guidance in spite of the challenges is a testament to the focused discipline and will of the team. For that, I express my appreciation. 
I'd also like to take a moment and sit back to discuss some of the developments to our core financial objectives, including achieving investment-grade metrics, improving shareholder returns and moderate capacity growth. I know that many of you model our performance outlook diligently, and you can see that we are now reaching the key financial metrics that are the threshold for investment grade. Getting to this point hasn't been easy but it is important. We are committed to achieving and maintaining a BBB credit status. In this regard, it was particularly satisfying when Moody's issued its upgrade of our improved outlook. It is rewarding to see progress on all our goals, and this is another big one. 
I also know that many of you are up-to-date on our announcements and have noticed our recent increase in dividends. Our dividend level is at an all-time high and is now 4x what it was just over 3 years ago. In the same period, we also executed significant buyback program. As our earnings continue to grow and as conditions warrant, and by that I include earnings and free cash flow, we will continue to engage in a mix of moderate dividend growth and share buyback programs. These steps are clear evidence of our commitment to improving shareholder returns. 
Now turning to the third pillar, moderate capacity growth. That's been a focal point of a lot of conversation. We said before that the pipeline in supply is known, and it's very much constrained by limited shipyard capacity. We said our target is 3% to 5% growth rate, and that's just what we've been doing. Through 2005, our 5 year actual capacity growth rate was just under 4% a year, and for the coming 5 years, it's also just under 4%. 
Now on the demand side, we've seen some markets contract such as the Eastern Mediterranean, but we've also seen new markets expand such as China and Australia. It's important to note that cruising is still under-penetrated in all of our markets including our core markets. We opened up new markets like China because they're growing at extraordinary rates, not because of inadequate demand elsewhere. For example, we're aware that some people have been arguing for years that the U.S. market is saturated. But we've been growing here strongly and consistently in both rate and volume and we expect to continue to do so for years to come. 
Our task is to continue to make people, especially non-cruisers, aware of all that cruising offers. That takes continued effort but it is working. This year alone, we've added more than 1.6 million new to cruise. That demonstrates our continued strength in this market and positions us for what we believe to be a bright future. 
Now before I hand the call back over to Jason, I want to touch on one more point related to environmental stewardship. Protecting the environment is a responsibility we take seriously at Royal Caribbean, both because of the impact on our environment and because it just makes good business sense. We focus heavily on reducing our carbon footprint, and we're proud to publish our energy consumption figures. They consistently show that our burning of fossil fuels shows the lowest figures reported by anyone in our industry. This success comes from a deep focus on finding new and better ways to do things. 
For example, our bubble technology, which is more properly called our air lubrication system, reduces drag, thereby, reducing the need for burning fuel. But in keeping with our mantra of continuous improvement, we have gone 1 step further. Recently, we partnered with the World Wildlife Fund to take our sustainability performance to the next level. Together with WWF, we have announced publicly goals related to greenhouse gas emissions, sustainable food supply and destination stewardship. This partnership follows exciting progress on a number of other fronts, including our advanced wastewater purification systems and our zero landfill policy already implemented on 17 ships. 
We are also very pleased to be working with the EPA and have their support as we install advanced emissions purification or AEP systems on our ships. This is a massive and expensive task but a very impactful one. These AEP systems scrub more than 98% of the sulfur from our ships' exhaust. 
Lastly, we have recently announced a new class of ships dubbed Icon class. These ships will be powered by LNG and will also utilize the latest fuel cell technology. Fuel cells are the ultimate in smoke-free exhausts. The only emission from fuel cells is pure water. 
In conclusion, it's been a good quarter and the future looks very bright. Brexit and other factors have been unexpected blows but we have more than compensated in other ways. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jason. Jason?"
325643,406721353,1066685,"Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.","Executives","Thank you, Richard. I will begin by taking you through our results for the third quarter. Unless I state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant-currency basis. We have summarized our third quarter results on Slide 3. For the quarter, we generated adju",1438,"Thank you, Richard. I will begin by taking you through our results for the third quarter. Unless I state otherwise, all metrics are on a constant-currency basis. 
We have summarized our third quarter results on Slide 3. For the quarter, we generated adjusted net income of $3.20 per share, $0.10 better than the previous guidance. About half of the outperformance was driven by better revenue with the other half of the beat driven by a weaker dollar and lower fuel prices. Third quarter net revenue yield was better than expected, up 2.9% year-over-year. Strength in close-in demand for North American products was the primary driver of the outperformance. 
Onboard revenue yields for the quarter did not disappoint, with yields up 4.8% for the quarter. The growth was mainly driven by beverage packages and increasing demand for VOOM and Accelerate, our high-speed Internet offerings for World Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises, respectively. Costs were as expected for the quarter with net cruise costs excluding fuel, down 1.6%. 
Before I get into discussing booking trends, I would like to discuss deviations between the quarters. Our yield came in slightly better than expected in the third quarter and are expected to be slightly lower than our previous expectations in the fourth quarter. As a result, our yields for the full year are essentially unchanged. We often get asked whether these small aberrations between quarters signify a trend. The answer is no, and I would like to explain why. The reality is that we manage a large and diversified portfolio of brands, markets and products. This complex portfolio obviously has minor deviations especially in a period as short as a quarter. This year is a good example. Something as simple and insignificant as the delay in the deployment of the Empress of the Seas will drive yields to be lower for the fourth quarter than we originally expected. This delay has no long-term significance, but it does affect quarterly figures. 
As Richard mentioned, our track record is pretty good, and Slide 2 shows that over the past several years, we have been able to deliver annual yield and earning results in line with the original guidance we set for the year. We don't see this immaterial aberration between Q3 and Q4 to be a trend, just a reflection of managing a global and diversified portfolio. This is further supported by the 2017 booking trend commentary I will be providing shortly. 
Now I will share trends in the demand environment for the balance of 2016 and provide early insights into 2017. Let me start off by discussing the fourth quarter where our mix of deployment shifts versus the summer. We have more capacity in the Caribbean and Australia and less in the Mediterranean. Our year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter Caribbean deployment is driven by the additions of both Harmony of the Sea and Empress of the Sea in South Florida. As a result, Caribbean itineraries will account for half of our Q4 capacity. We expect Caribbean yields to be up mid-single digits for the quarter which, as I previously mentioned, is softer than our previous expectations due to the delay in opening Empress of the Seas for sale. Expectations for the rest of the Caribbean products remain relatively unchanged. Asia Pacific and Europe itineraries are generally performing in line with our previous outlook. So in summary, we are 94% booked for the fourth quarter, and with the exception of Empress, yields are shaping up as expected. 
Moving on to 2017. I want to start by providing you an overview of some of the structural factors and deployment changes that play a part in the upcoming year. I will then discuss the early trends we are seeing in the business. We will see a benefit in the first half of the year from the addition of both Harmony of the Seas and Ovation of the Seas. We will have a tailwind to our yields related to the deconsolidation of Pullmantur, which is worth a little over 250 basis points for the first half of next year. As a reminder, our portion of Pullmantur's results will be reported as an equity pickup, and since we continue to own the vessels, we will continue to incur depreciation for the ships. Lastly, our joint venture with TUI Cruises will receive another new ship during the second quarter. 
As we announced earlier this year, Legend of the Seas will exit the fleet at the end of the first quarter. This sale is very much in line with our fleet strategy of opportunistically selling order capacity. We are making several changes to our itinerary mix in 2017 that will reduce exposure to the Eastern Mediterranean while bringing new hardware to the Caribbean and moderately growing the Asia Pacific region. 
Our Caribbean deployment will increase in 2017 and will represent just under half of our total capacity. This increase is largely due to the expanded season for both Harmony of the Seas and Celebrity Equinox. Both of these ships will remain in the Caribbean year-round versus sailing in Europe as they did during the summer of 2016. The change in deployment for these ships combined with the deconsolidation of Pullmantur are driving a reduction in Mediterranean capacity. As a result, Europe will represent 15% of our overall capacity in 2017 versus 20% in 2016. 
Asia Pacific itineraries will account for approximately 20% of our capacity, which is relatively consistent with 2016. Our capacity in China will decrease slightly as the longer season of Ovation of the Seas is only offsetting a portion of the reduction due to the sale of the Legend of the Seas. 
While it's still too early to provide guidance for next year, I will share some preliminary insights. Our booked position is stronger than last year as we are up in both pricing and load factors across all major markets for light deployment. This is particularly noteworthy when you consider that our book load factor has improved each year for the past several years, culminating in a record high for next year. Our Caribbean and Alaska products are trending well despite very difficult comparisons in 2016, and bookings for European sailings are up nicely year-over-year, driven by strong demand from North America. We are also pleased with how the winter Asia Pacific season is shaping up, with both Australia and China sailings booked ahead of prior year load factors in the first quarter. Although it's still early in the booking window, these insights provide added confidence in our path towards the Double-Double, and we expect that 2017 will be our eighth consecutive year of yield improvement. 
If you turn to Slide 4, you will see our guidance for the full year 2016. Net revenue yields are expected to be up 4% or better, essentially unchanged from last quarter's guidance. Our cost guidance is also unchanged with net cruise costs, excluding fuel, expected to be up approximately 1%. Our fuel costs for the year have decreased since our last call to $720 million driven by rate, and we are 68% hedged for the remainder of 2016 at a price of $535 per metric ton. Based on current fuel prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates, our adjusted earnings per share guidance is expected to be in the range of $6 to $6.10 per share, unchanged from previous guidance. 
To summarize, the changes we have made since the last call, we exceeded the third quarter by $0.10 per share, approximately half of which was driven by the outperformance of our North American products. This beat is helping to offset the previously mentioned impact from the delay in the deployment of Empress of the Seas. A weaker U.S. dollar and lower fuel prices contributed the other half of the third quarter beat. However, this trend reverses itself in the fourth quarter. 
Now I would like to walk you through our fourth quarter guidance on Slide 5. Net yields are expected to be up approximately 6%. The year-over-year increase is being driven by the deconsolidation of Pullmantur and strong trend on our Caribbean and Australia itineraries. Harmony of the Seas in the Caribbean and Ovation of the Seas in Australia are doing particularly well. Net cruise costs excluding fuel are expected to be down approximately 1.5%, and we have included $189 million of fuel expense for the quarter. Taking all of this into account, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $1.20 for the quarter, which represents nearly 30% growth year-over-year. 
With that, I will ask our operator to open up the call for a question-and-answer session."

And then when we talk about the Caribbean, and I would also include Europe in there, at this point in time in the year, a lot of that is driven by the North American consumer. And as I commented in my remarks that we have seen very positive trends in both the rate and volume basis for the Caribbean as well as for our European products. And then to answer your question on the currency side, certainly, the strength of the dollar relative to the pound has been challenging. If you want to say, well, what it has kind of been since the last call, it's probably hurt us by about $0.12 to $0.15.

So, Tim, on the first question as it relates to Harmony and Equinox. First, trends or demand for Harmony has been exceptional, and we do expect that Harmony, being here next year, for it to be yield accretive and certainly helps us a lot in the first half of the year. Equinox mainly was in the Eastern Mediterranean and really kind of in the center of a lot of movements we had to make with her with some of the geopolitical events that were happening. And so we do expect the Equinox to be yield accretive to the corporation next year. On the fuel side, in '17, we're hedged about 60%. The average hedge rate there is about $508 and in '18, we're 45% hedged and we're about $452, is the average hedge. And we continue to focus in -- on having a hedge program to minimize the volatility within our P&L, and we also respect that there's typically an inverse relationship between fuel and currency. We also take into consideration the fuel curve, and it has flattened out. And so there's -- earlier last year, we did take advantage and put a little bit more hedging on -- in '16 and in the outer years, but you should I think expect us to continue to be pretty consistent to the past of that kind of 40% to 60% side of things and again, with a goal of minimizing volatility within the P&L."

It's a reasonable question, and it's in fact, something that we ask ourselves all the time. And I did actually, I think, I included in my comments something that the Double-Double is a step on the journey. We -- in terms of what comes after Double-Double, I don't know whether it'll be another program of that type or some other type. It was -- the Double-Double was really to focus on a particular phase in our history, and I think it served that role very well. As we look to 2018, we do have a couple of things that are quite exciting. We do have the fourth of the Oasis class ships. But I'd say, even more so, '18 will show Edge class. And the Edge class is a new class of ships which I think, in its own way, will be as innovative and as transformational as Oasis has been. We're very excited about it. We'll probably be talking more about that early next year. But Celebrity really has been on a roll, and I think we'll see the benefits of that. If it continues going the way it's going, we'll see the benefits of that in '17 and '18. And then when Edge comes, I think people are really going to be blown away. So I'm very excited about '18. But the importance of a program like Double-Double is to focus on a particular goal. And one of the things that's been very successful for us is everybody is focused on achieving the Double-Double in 2017. And so that's our first one, and I will be careful not to dwell too much on what comes after."

And it's clear the questions are geared to, is the world changing? Is this a trend in the exogenous variables affecting us? But as Michael pointed out, we actually work to change trends, so there are periods of time where we, for example, as both Royal -- as Michael said, both Royal and Celebrity made a conscious decision this year that there was a stronger opportunity, a good opportunity with first-time cruisers. And so they actually focused more of their marketing, focused more on their message, and they actually worked to build that. So when you look at a trend, it's not just, is the world changing, but to some extent, it's also what we're doing to shift our customer base. And then that sometimes messes up nice trend lines when you're trying to extrapolate from external behavior."

I'm wondering how big the impact to net yields is from the new revenue management technology implemented a while back? And I guess, I'm wondering what inning we're in with respect to its implementation. So just for some perspective, when airlines put in new revenue management, they tend to go slow. And I'm just kind of curious how you'd characterize where you are with respect to that to Royal?"

And we put in new yield management systems several years ago. And every day that goes by, the yield management systems get stronger because the information from the past and how we read information of what's happening in local markets and so forth gets better and better. So it's surely a tailwind. To quantify it is next to impossible to do, but it really -- I think one of the greatest benefits it gives us is the ability to manage demand globally. And that allows us to seek the highest yield for every cabin that's available from anywhere in the world. And that's obviously great -- on a revenue management standpoint, it's also great to be able to take advantage of that diversification."

On the evolution of distribution, that's something obviously that we've been focused on for quite some time. It's a journey that we're taking. I think what we're seeing is the beginnings of the development of distribution in terms of starting to mirror and look very much like the North American distribution model. In terms of -- our focus very much is engaged in opening all channels to market and optimizing each channel. That includes our wholesaler charterer model, which we believe has done exceptionally well up to this point and we're going to continue working with our charterers. But we're also developing direct. We're also developing retail, next cruise, and that's very much what we've been engaged in over some time now. So I think that's a journey we're taking, and over time, we'll see the mix balance out in a very similar way to the other markets -- more developed markets."
