Turning to our fourth quarter. The combination of a challenging economy and the dual impacts of a weak peso and lower-than-normal fuel surcharge revenues resulted in revenues declining 7% from fourth quarter 2014. The combination of foreign exchange and a lower U.S. fuel prices and a significant effect in our consolidated revenue. Excluding those factors, KCS's revenue for the fourth quarter 2014 were approximately flat with the prior year. The company responded very well to the difficult macro conditions, which was illustrated by our posting a 63.3 operating ratio for the quarter, an improvement of 3.4 points compared to fourth quarter 2014. Prime contributors to KCS's strong operating ratio were strict steadily improving system velocity and system dwell metrics, which have essentially returned to our 2013 levels. Making our performance more impressive is the fact that we have to contain with the hurricane that hit Mexico in late October and devastating floods in southern Missouri in late December. In both cases, we have work around washouts and weather-related service delays. Despite the challenges, we operated at a high-level efficiency and recorded service metrics that put KCS in the top tier amongst Class 1s.
Macroeconomic forces serve the constrained levels of business growth in certain commodity segments, which appears to be to case moving into 2016. We do not have a crystal ball that will help project how the investor economy will perform over the next 6 to 12 months. For that reason, we are unable to project definite growth and revenue numbers for the near future. Pat and Jeff will discuss some of the areas in which we believe KCS can show measurable productivity improvements in 2016 as well as cover some of the capital projects necessary to handle the business growth opportunities that Brian Hancock and his team will be bringing online in the second half of 2016 and into '17 and beyond. With that, I'll turn it over to Pat."

I will begin my comments on Slide 7. Before I get into the data on this slide, let me just pick up on dates opening comments by saying that we are not going to talk a lot this morning about the factors which affected our performance and our outlook that we do not control, such as commodity prices, currency values, energy markets. Those factors are pretty well understood in the sense that they've created a lot of volatility in our business and uncertainty of our general conditions going forward. We will spend more time this morning focusing on the things that we can and did manage to drive performance in an increasingly volatile and uncertain economic environment. Things like service, cost control, asset utilization and capital structure and liquidity.
Now going back to Slide 7. Here, we show you our velocity and dwell trends over the past 3 years and compare them to the average of all of the other Class 1 rails, excluding KCS. Over the course of 2015, we showed noticeable improvement in both of these key metrics, and we have returned to the strong performance levels that we were producing at the beginning of 2013. This service recovery is even more impressive when you consider that unlike most of our industry peers, we are handling more volume than we were at the beginning of this period in 2013. In addition, Dave mentioned the weather factors that we had to overcome last year as well. 
Taking a closer look at velocity, this graph shows that we did see some deterioration during the second half of 2014 and first half of 2015. However, we will still performing at a level that was better than the overall industry average. This was not the case for dwell. But we have improved overall terminal dwells by 9% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and feel that we are back where we need to be to run an efficient network and meet our customers expectations. 
In addition, our intermodal product has returned to highly reliable and consistent service, which is the key to regaining and securing some of the loss business that we talked about the last couple of quarters and eventually returning to the higher growth rates we believe are possible, given the size of the truck conversion opportunity here. In a few moments, Jeff Songer will talk about some of the specific things we did to manage these outcomes and why we believe this service performance is sustainable going forward. I would just say that we now have an excellent operating leadership team in place with substantial Class 1 really experience at multiple layers through the organization. Jeff will elaborate in a few minutes. Since becoming President last March, I have worked closely with Jeff and the entire operating team and can assure you that there is a very high sense of urgency in identifying and implementing key initiatives that are behind the improvement and improvements evidenced in this graph. This process will continue. Jeff is better aligned functional responsibilities with the correct experiences and leadership skills and clear accountabilities to improve the way we manage the railroad, and that is showing up in both our service and cost metrics.
Moving on to Slide 8. You can also see the impact of this improved management focus on this chart. We are very pleased to show this trend has continued quarter-to-quarter improvement in operating ratio over the course of a very difficult and volatile year, and in the absence of volume growth, and therefore, no benefit from incremental margins. Obviously, there are many gives and takes for items like fuel and currency. But even excluding those items, we delivered real productivity gains over the course of a very difficult year. This is another example of managing things that we can control by cost and asset utilization in an environment where there are significant negative factors that we do not. 
Finally, I'll wrap up with Slide 9. I'll give you all a heads up that other than CapEx, which will talk about in a couple of minutes, this is the only guidance that we're going to provide at this time. Given the uncertainty that we see in the near-term economic and business environment, the only guidance we can provide is that the long-term outlook continues to be positive, driven by growth in several key market areas; strong pricing trends, which Brian will touch on in a few minutes; and sustainable improvements in service cost control and asset utilization. And as we stayed in the center of the slide, we expect to show long-term continued improvement in operating ratio, earnings per share and return on invested capital. As you heard from all of the other rails that have reported so far, the short-term outlook is very uncertain. And as a result, we are just not in a position to provide more definitive guidance regarding volume, revenue or operating ratio. Many of you on the call this morning have as much better information regarding the economic outlook, commodity and currency markets than we do. I was in a rail industry conference last week, and I felt one railroad executive characterize out time at landscape quite well when he said and I'm paraphrasing here, ""We are  in an energy market depression, an industrial manufacturing recession. But somehow the consumers are doing okay"". We do know that the long-term outlook is strong. And for the near term, we will focus again on those things over which we have more control to drive long-term continued improvement in all of our key metrics. 
Mike Upchurch will talk to you in a few moments about a recently completed debt restructuring, which we believe improves our overall liquidity profile and strengthens our financial flexibility. Growth will return. The investments in chemical plants, auto production, port terminals and other facilities that is taking place in our service area is quite remarkable. In 2016, we are forecasting a reduction in overall capital spending. Jeff will touch -- give you more detail on that in a minute. But we will continue to spend on those key projects that support the industrial development activity and new business opportunities taking place on our network. When these new plants and terminals open, we will be ready to capitalize immediately on the opportunities that we know are coming over the longer-term horizon. 
In closing, I will restate once more that our near-term focus will be on those things over which we have more control such as service, cost control, asset utilization and capital structure. With that, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer."

As outlined on past calls, wide fluctuations on volume while aligning an appropriate resources had a negative impact on service levels. However, the team has worked through these challenges and in the year with positive trend. Organizationally, we continue to make changes necessary to ensure our continued performance improvements. When I stepped into the job over 1 year ago, one of our first organization moves was to appoint a new Vice President of Transportation in the U.S. This individual brings over 30 years of railroad experience from Pacific and CSX and position the operating team well into the future. Likewise in Mexico, we promoted a new Head of Transportation who has led the efforts in restoring our workforce and is now focused on retaining service levels. About that time, we announced a new Vice President of our Mechanical Organization. This individual brings 30 years of experience, notably with Amtrak and CSX. Last August, we added a Director of Intermodal and Operations and Automotive Operations in Mexico. This former CSX employee we had 8 years of experience, leading large terminals in Chicago and New York. Finally, in November, we promoted a new lead for our Network Operations Center to improve management function. This individual came to KCS in 2013 from the where he had successful worked in the operating departments in 1997. Additional realignment of our network operating center and field operating teams as well as restructuring of our crew management team should lead for greater synergy and coordination of the network. Touching on our workforce, the 2015 Mexico hiring initiative is complete and crews in Mexico are stable. In U.S., we're currently at 6% of the workforce and furlough status and will continue to manage our resources to meet volume demands.
Moving onto 2016. Well, we continue -- we will continue our focus on service and increasing productivity to reduce cost. Specific actions already in process include the implementation of interdivisional trains, which allowed a reduction in crude starts across the segment due to improved velocity. This operation started in January between Shreveport and Meridian, and we will implement a similar approach in Mexico between Nuevo Laredo and Monterey, where our capital improvements have allowed us to increase track speed to 70 miles an hour in this segment. 
Working in coordination with the UP, we located dispatch console from Kansas City to Spring, Texas, to dispatch this joint, KCS, UP, territory. All railroads are now working together in the same facility to ensure the most efficient operation. Sanchez Yard Phase I has completed schedule and Phase II is underway. The additional capacity will enable us to process trains at the border more fluidly. And in 2016, we'll allow from transition of some work from Laredo to Sanchez to reduce overall labor cost in this segment. Opportunities to streamline the departure process from the port of Lázaro will allow us to reduce carload handling and improved cycle times by an average by 6 hours per train. Additionally, we've allocated capital in 2016 to install locomotive fuel optimization technology for 20% of our road fleet, which will help to improve fuel efficiency and velocity of our traction. 
Regarding operating metrics. For the quarter, system velocity improved 1% to 27 miles per hour while dwell time in terminals improved 9% versus Q4 2014. Velocity and dwell metrics continue to be a focus as we regain our consistent service levels, and we'll also allow for improved asset utilization, driving down equipment cost.
Moving onto slide 12. Capital spending for 2016 is projected at $580 million to $590 million, which represents a 10% reduction for 2015. Reductions in overall maintenance spend in old plant locomotive purchases in 2016 were more than offset our continued investment in growth-related industries. We remain steadfast in our commitments to invest in projects such as Sasol, Sanchez Yard, to port of Lázaro as well as adding additional and intermodal equipment to meet the future projected growth in these areas. I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock."

Overall, we are pleased with the creativity and perseverance that the team is showing in working through these issues. To begin, as noted earlier, carloading for the quarter were down 2% year-over-year and revenue was flat after taking out the impact of currency in fuel while we continue to see solid pricing of 4.1% all-in for the quarter. Let me provide a little more detail by line of business using Page 14 as a reference. In our chemicals and petroleum business, we saw an increase of 8% in carloads with  a 4% increase in revenue, driven by increased volume and our petroleum and plastic shipments. Our Industrial & Consumer business unit was down 14% versus 2014, which continues to trend we've seen for most of 2015. The year-over-year decrease for the quarter was driven by continued weakness in our metals business, things slightly offset by an increase in our other carloads area. Our Ag & Minerals business delivered a 2% business in carloads in the fourth quarter, driven by strength in crude products and ores and minerals segment, offset by slightly lighter grain volumes. Revenue for Ag & Minerals was up 4% when you move the effects of fuel and foreign exchange. Our Energy segment continue to be impacted by mix and continued volatility in the commodity prices. Overall carloads in the quarter were up 11% while adjusted revenue was off 4%. 
For the quarter, our intermodal volume was down 6% with adjusted revenues off 5%, and our cross-border volume was off 8% and down 3% in revenue. 
As Jeff mentioned, given the improved service levels in the latter half of the year, our intermodal offering continues to compete well for the increased volume in the segment. 
For the fourth quarter, our Automotive business increased at year-over-year 1% with an adjusted revenue increase of 6%. Our Automotive group was able to take advantage of the improved fluidity in the network and provide additional capacity and speed on our finished vehicle shipments, providing a strong finish to the quarter. 
On Slide 15, we've provided a visual update to some of our largest investments, which will continue to increase capacity and fluidity across the network. On the top left-hand side, you can see a picture of the new silver cranes being delivered to the APMT terminal in Lázaro Cárdenas. As stated previously, this terminal will double the port capacity and open to the second half of 2016. In the bottom left-hand corner, you can see a picture taken last week of the construction of the new BMW Manufacturing Plant. This facility is another tangible example of a growing automotive manufacturing footprint in Mexico. 
On the top right-hand side, an updated view of the Sasol plant on the Gulf, which would provide an anchor for our growth in the plastics industry. In and about right, we show a long-term illustration of the Sanchez Yard in Nuevo Laredo, which will provide better capacity and fluidity in all of our cross-border moves. This capability provides our customers with better and more reliable solutions they can count on as they expand their cross-border supply chain. As what's mentioned earlier, we continue to stay focused on preparing for the opportunities in front of us, and we plan to take advantage of our enhanced capacity and fluidity as we execute our critical customer deliverables in 2016. With that, I'll now turn the presentation over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch."

The fourth quarter volumes declined 2% while revenues declined 7%. The peso depreciation had a $20 million negative impact on the revenue growth during the quarter while declining U.S. fuel prices had a $27 million unfavorable impact on revenue growth. Combined, this $47 million impact contributed to a 7 percentage point negative impact on revenues. Operating ratio improved 330 basis points to 63.4, new record for fourth quarter. A 12% reduction in expenses helped offset the negative impacts from lower volumes and revenues. And I'll cover more expense details in a couple of slides. Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the quarter was 32.4%, and further details are included in the appendix on Slide 35. I might offer one comment at the Congress enacted legislation in December, providing us an extension of the short-line tax credit, not only for 2015 but also 2016. And that 2015 benefit in the fourth quarter was about $2.5 million. While we expect about a $3.5 million benefit in 2016. 
Reported fourth quarter 2015 EPS was $1.28 share, flat year-over-year. And adjusting for that exchange cost and foreign exchange impact, adjusted EPS was $1.23, a 3% decline from fourth quarter of 2014. We've provided a reconciliation of our reported to adjusted EPS in the appendix on Slide 31. And have also included a full year results in the appendix and in our consolidated investor report on our website.
Turning to Slide 18. While the peso did experience significant depreciation quarter-over-quarter, you can see the impact was minimal on operating income in an estimated $200,000 due to our peso-based revenue and expenses, essentially offsetting each other.
Moving to Slide 19. As I mentioned on my first slide, we did experience a $47 million negative impact of revenues from foreign exchange and lower U.S. fuel prices. That is the trend that we expect to continue in 2016 as the peso is expected to continue to decline, particularly in the first and second quarters as projected exchange rates are 16% and 12%, respectively, lower than what we saw in 2015. Likewise, we are projected to experience significant declines in revenue from lower U.S. fuel surcharges more pronounced in first, second and third quarters in 26%, 20%, and 12% declines. These factors are based on readily available estimates, but I might note that the current exchange rate is significantly worse than the estimates, and we're currently at $18.50. While highway diesel prices are at $2.11 per gallon. Again, the take away here, we will have significant pressure in first quarter and second quarter at a minimum from foreign exchange and lower U.S. fuel prices.
Moving to Slide 20. Fourth quarter operating expenses declined $15 million year-over-year, most notably from peso depreciation, lower U.S. fuel prices and continued lower incentive compensation expense. Beyond those items, we managed expenses lower by $11 million through various cost reduction and expense control efforts while depreciation increased $7 million. And I'll cover more expense details in the next few slides. 
In Slide 21, compensation and benefits expense declined $19 million for the quarter, mainly from lower incentive compensation; impacts from the peso depreciation and year-over-year benefits, primarily from unfavorable actuarial in our fourth quarter of 2014 that relate to post-employment benefits. Offsetting those declines were $4 million in wage inflation. And while overall average FTEs increased 3% to support improving service levels in Mexico that Jeff previously covered, we experienced lower headcount in the U.S., resulting in no net expense increases as a result of wage differential. 
Moving to Slide 22. Fuel expense declined $25 million, largely due to declining U.S. fuel prices and the impact of the peso depreciation. Our average U.S. fuel price was $1.54 per gallon during fourth quarter 2015, a 37% decline from the previous year. On a constant currency basis, we saw Mexican fuel prices stayed flat year-over-year as a result of government price actions.
Moving to Slide 23. During the fourth quarter, equipment costs declined $1 million while depreciation increased $7 million. We continue to experience lower equipment costs as we customer strategy assets. And accordingly, we saw $2 million decline in equipment costs. Partially offsetting that $2 million in lower equipment costs due to lease conversion with higher depreciation of $1 million. Other increases in equipment costs were primarily incremental car hire expenses as we continue to experience hired cars on line. Depreciation also increased by $6 million from a larger asset base as a result of her capital expenditure programs. 
On Slide 24, through the fourth quarter, we saw purchase services declining $11 million due to maintenance contract restructuring, lower repair cost, foreign exchange benefit, reduced joint facility cost and lower legal fees. Materials & Other expense was flat year-over-year, benefiting from the peso depreciation, which was offset by higher material and supplies expense, resulting from in-sourcing of the previously mentioned maintenance contract.
Moving to Slide 25. I'd like to provide an update on our capital structure priorities. And we continue to be focused on investing in our business to maximize our growth opportunity. For 2015, we incurred $649 million in capital, slightly below our guidance of $650 million to $670 million. And for 2016, as Jeff already mentioned, acknowledging the uncertain volume environment we're operating under, we expect to further reduce our capital to somewhere between $580 million to $590 million. With respect to shareholder returns, we continue to repurchase our shares during the fourth quarter. And repurchase approximately 675,000 shares for $58 million with an average price of $85.69. Through the first 6 month of the program, we've repurchased approximately 194 million in stocks, which represents a reduction in our shares outstanding by 2.1 million shares. We've frontloaded the program by buying about authorized to $500 million 2-year repurchase program during the first 6 months. And finally, we continue to optimize our capital structure. As Pat mentioned in December, we completed a debt consolidation program by exchanging approximately $2 billion of our KCSR and KCSM subsidiary debt in the parent company debt, which provides us more financial flexibility, lower future borrowing costs, less administrative costs of maintaining 2 capital structures and enhanced cash flow flexibility. Additionally, we established a corporate-level revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, increasing our overall liquidity to $800 million. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

What we're going through right now reminds me a lot of what we were going through back in 2009. KCS, like the other rails, reacted to the recession with a host of service and productivity initiatives that partially mitigated the impact of the business downturn. We at KCS at the same time knew that we had an abundance of business growth opportunities on the near horizon. Sure enough, KCS came out of a recession, hitting on all cylinders with a new business growth and efficient operations, fueling strong earnings from 2010 to 2014. Now fast-forward to 2016. Reacting to the challenging economy, KCS has implemented and continues to implement service and productivity initiatives. The impact of which have already been shown to be positive. And just like 2009, we're looking at expensive, near-term business growth opportunities to name but a few on the horizon continue auto plants in Mexico will open in the second half of 2016. While at the same time, we'll also begin to see the benefits from the plant expansions after 3 of the auto facilities we served in Mexico. I might also add that in the near future, you will likely hear of on additional auto growth in our line. But that's a story for another day. Also during the second half, the APM  terminal at Lázaro Cárdenas is presently scheduled to open. 2017 Mexican energy reforms goes into effect and will provide us the opportunity to remove products in the Mexico, which promises to be a very good sign of business opportunity. And over the next couple of years, KCS expect to begin to gain a benefit of the growth of the plastics production that will be centered in the Gulf region. But let me be clear. KCS, like everybody else, is challenging economic issues, impacting some of our commodities. These issues will be with us for a while. But the growth opportunities we see coming online, coupled with stronger and other operations, makes us confidence confidently excited about our future. So with that, I'll open it up for questions."

So when we go into the customer call, we'll either capital plan and how we're going to be able to help them grow their business. So I don't really see the pressure point there. Where we're getting the pressure point is more on those businesses that are really suffering, like coal. That one it's still a wildcard. Were normal in coal, are we. I don't know. It depends a lot on whether it's going to be Republicans or Democrats running the show for the next 4 years. But right now, that's really the only rifle shot approach or flexibility,  if you will, that we've done in the past. It sounds like commodity. But it's been based on short-term capacity availability, no new locomotives. And did it makes sense to put it in our network, was it a very positive contribution? Absolutely. So those will still -- we're not going to get into the discount business. That's not what railroads do. So if that's your question, are we going to become a commodity-based pricing and are we going to get into the discount business, I don't think we don't to do that. The challenge is still going to be come over the coming years, is having the capacity to handle the demand."

And in the U.S., same story, without a way through the fluctuation of increases in the significant furloughs last year. I think we're just coming out of the year in a better place.

The other thing is and kind of ties in with a previous question is we still, as we said, we still feel confident based on all of the things that we're seeing being built in our network that growth will return. And give them the lead time and is business on things like crews, hiring and training crews and other assets that are to handle that growth. You kind of got a look little further down the line so to speak in order to fine-tune exactly what that balances between what do I need to handle this business volumes today versus what it why know that's coming in a relatively near future. And then of circumstances change and our outlook changes, then we have to move in and manage that. So there's no doubt that the environment we're in is causing this to be much more nimble. And I think we responded pretty well. Jeff team has done an outstanding job of kind of being entered phase those that were looking at ways and looking to respond. If you just look at 2015 as an example, I think we showed a slide like this in the previous earnings call. Started out strong. We were hiring and training in January and in the early part of the first quarter, a year ago. Then everything energy-related collapsed. And we were literally furloughs as they were coming off of training. And- then volume kind of her covered in the third quarter and we were scrambling to get them back. So we were kind of chasing a retail. Really, one of the things we focused on is looking little bit longer-term but being nimble and quick to respond as we get better information about the outlook to manage the resources appropriately."

Turning to our fourth quarter. The combination of a challenging economy and the dual impacts of a weak peso and lower-than-normal fuel surcharge revenues resulted in revenues declining 7% from fourth quarter 2014. The combination of foreign exchange and lower U.S. fuel prices had a significant effect on our consolidated revenue. Excluding those factors, KCS's revenue for the fourth quarter 2014 were approximately flat with the prior year. The company responded very well to the difficult macro conditions, which is illustrated by our posting of 63.3% operating ratio for the quarter, an improvement of 3.4 points compared to fourth quarter 2014. Prime contributors to KCS's strong operating ratio were a strict, steadily improving system velocity and system dwell metrics, which have essentially returned to our 2013 levels. Making our performance more impressive is the fact that we have to contend with a hurricane that hit Mexico in the late October and devastating floods in Southern Missouri in late December. In both cases, we had to work around washouts and weather-related service delays. Despite the challenges, we operated at a high-level efficiency and recorded service metrics that put KCS in the top tier amongst Class 1s.
Macroeconomic forces serve to constrain levels of business growth in certain commodity segments, which appears to be to case moving into 2016. We do not have a crystal ball to help project how the industrial economy will perform over the next 6 to 12 months. For that reason, we are unable to project definite growth and revenue numbers for the near future. 
Pat and Jeff will discuss some of the areas in which we believe KCS can show measurable productivity improvements in 2016 as well as cover some of the capital projects necessary to handle the business growth opportunities that Brian Hancock and his team will be bringing online in the second half of 2016 and into '17 and beyond. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Pat."

I will begin my comments on Slide 7. Before I get into the data on this slide, let me just pick up on Dave's opening comments by saying that we are not going to talk a lot this morning about the factors which affected our performance that -- and our outlook that we do not control, such as commodity prices, currency values, energy markets. Those factors are pretty well understood in the sense that they've created a lot of volatility in our business and uncertainty about general conditions going forward. We will spend more time this morning focusing on the things that we can and did manage to drive performance in an increasingly volatile and uncertain economic environment. Things like service, cost control, asset utilization and capital structure and liquidity.
Now going back to Slide 7. Here, we show you our velocity and dwell trends over the past 3 years and compare them to the average of all of the other Class 1 rails, excluding KCS. Over the course of 2015, we showed noticeable improvement in both of these key metrics, and we have returned to the strong performance levels that we were producing at the beginning of 2013. This service recovery is even more impressive when you consider that, unlike most of our industry peers, we are handling more volume than we were at the beginning of this period in 2013. In addition, Dave mentioned the weather factors that we had to overcome last year as well. 
Taking a closer look at velocity, this graph shows that we did see some deterioration during the second half of 2014 and first half of 2015. However, we were still performing at a level that was better than the overall industry average. This was not the case for dwell, but we have improved overall terminal dwells by 9% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and feel that we are back where we need to be to run an efficient network and meet our customers' expectations. 
In addition, our intermodal product has returned to a highly reliable and consistent service, which is the key to regaining and securing some of the lost business that we talked about the last couple of quarters and eventually returning to the higher growth rates we believe are possible, given the size of the truck conversion opportunity here. In a few moments, Jeff Songer will talk about some of the specific things we did to manage these outcomes and why we believe this service performance is sustainable going forward. I will just say that we now have an excellent operating leadership team in place with substantial Class 1 rail experience at multiple layers through the organization. Jeff will elaborate in a few minutes. 
Since becoming President last March, I have worked closely with Jeff and the entire operating team and can assure you that there is a very high sense of urgency in identifying and implementing key initiatives that are behind the improvement and improvements evidenced on these graphs. This process will continue. Jeff has better aligned functional responsibilities with the correct experiences and leadership skills and clear accountabilities to improve the way we manage the railroad, and that is showing up in both our service and cost metrics.
Moving on to Slide 8. You can also see the impact of this improved management focus on this chart. We are very pleased to show this trend has continued, quarter-to-quarter improvement in operating ratio over the course of a very difficult and volatile year and in the absence of volume growth, and therefore, no benefit from incremental margins. Obviously, there are many gives and takes from items like fuel and currency. But even excluding those items, we delivered real productivity gains over the course of a very difficult year. This is another example of managing things that we can control by cost and asset utilization in an environment where there are significant negative factors that we do not. 
Finally, I'll wrap up with Slide 9. I'll give you all a heads up that other than CapEx, which we'll talk about in a couple of minutes, this is the only guidance that we're going to provide at this time. Given the uncertainty that we see in the near-term economic and business environment, the only guidance we can provide is that the long-term outlook continues to be positive, driven by growth in several key market areas; strong pricing trends, which Brian will touch on in a few minutes; and sustainable improvement in service, cost control and asset utilization. And as we state in the center of the slide, we expect to show long-term continued improvement in operating ratio, earnings per share and return on invested capital. As you've heard from all of the other rails that have reported so far, the short-term outlook is very uncertain, and as a result, we are just not in a position to provide more definitive guidance regarding volume, revenue or operating ratio.
Many of you on the call this morning have as much or better information regarding the economic outlook, commodity and currency markets than we do. I was at a rail industry conference last week, and I felt one railroad executive characterized the current landscape quite well when he said, and I'm paraphrasing here, ""We are in an energy market depression, an industrial and manufacturing recession, but somehow, the consumer is doing okay"". We do know that the long-term outlook is strong. And for the near term, we will focus again on those things over which we have more control to drive long-term continued improvement in all of our key metrics. 
Mike Upchurch will talk to you in a few moments about a recently completed debt restructuring, which we believe improves our overall liquidity profile and strengthens our financial flexibility. Growth will return. The investments in chemical plants, auto production, port terminals and other facilities that is taking place in our service area is quite remarkable. In 2016, we are forecasting a reduction in overall capital spending. Jeff will touch -- give you more detail on that in a minute. But we will continue to spend on those key projects that support the industrial development activity and new business opportunities taking place on our network. When these new plants and terminals open, we will be ready to capitalize immediately on the opportunities that we know are coming over the longer-term horizon. 
In closing, I will restate once more that our near-term focus will be on those things over which we have more control, such as service, cost control, asset utilization and capital structure. With that, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer."

2015 was a challenging year for the operating team. As outlined on past calls, wide fluctuations in volume, while aligning an appropriate resources, had a negative impact on service levels. However, the team has worked through these challenges and has ended the year with a positive trend. Organizationally, we continue to make changes necessary to ensure our continued performance improvements. When I stepped into the job over a year ago, one of our first organizational moves was to appoint a new vice president of transportation in the U.S. This individual brings over 30 years of railroad experience from Union Pacific and CSX and positions the operating team well on to the future. 
Likewise in Mexico, we promoted a new head of transportation who has led the efforts in restoring our workforce and is now focused on regaining service levels. About that time, we announced a new vice president of our mechanical organization. This individual brings 30 years of experience, notably with Amtrak and CSX. Last August, we added a director of intermodal and automotive operations in Mexico. This former CSX employee brings 8 years of experience, leading large intermodal terminals in Chicago and New York. 
Finally, in November, we promoted a new lead for our Network Operations Center and crew management function. This individual came to KCS in 2013 from the BNSF, where he had successful worked in the operating departments since 1997. Additional realignment of our Network Operating Center and field operating teams as well as restructuring of our crew management team should lead for greater synergy and coordination of the network. 
Touching on our workforce, the 2015 Mexico hiring initiative is complete, and crews in Mexico are stable. In the U.S., we are currently at 6% of the T&E workforce on furlough status, and we will continue to manage our resources to meet volume demands.
Moving into 2016. Well, we continue -- we will continue our focus on service and increasing productivity to reduce cost. Specific actions already in process include the implementation of interdivisional trains, which allow for the reduction in crew starts across the segment due to improved velocity. This operation started in January between Shreveport and Meridian. And we will implement a similar approach in Mexico between Nuevo Laredo and Monterrey, where our capital improvements have allowed us to increase track speed to 70 miles an hour in this segment. 
Working in coordination with the UP, we have relocated a dispatch console from Kansas City to Spring, Texas, to dispatch this joint KCS/UP/BNSF territory. All railroads are now working together in the same facility to ensure the most efficient operation. 
Sanchez Yard Phase I has completed schedule and Phase II is underway. The additional capacity will enable us to process trains at the border more fluidly; and in 2016, will allow from transition of some work from Laredo to Sanchez to reduce overall labor cost in this segment. Opportunities to streamline the departure process from the port of Lázaro will allow us to reduce car handling and improve cycle times by an average by 6 hours per train. Additionally, we've allocated capital in 2016 to install locomotive fuel optimization technology for 20% of our road fleet, which will help to improve fuel efficiency and velocity of our trains. 
Regarding operating metrics for the quarter, system velocity improved 1% to 27 miles per hour, while dwell time in terminals improved 9% versus Q4 2014. Velocity and dwell metrics continue to be a focus as we regain our consistent service levels and will also allow for improved asset utilization, driving down equipment cost.
Moving on to Slide 12. Capital spending for 2016 is projected at $580 million to $590 million, which represents a 10% reduction from 2015. Reductions in overall maintenance spend and [indiscernible] locomotive purchases in 2016 will more than offset our continued investment in growth-related industries. 
We remain steadfast in our commitment to invest in projects such as Sasol, Sanchez Yard, the Port of Lázaro as well as adding additional automotive and intermodal equipment to meet the future projected growth in these areas. 
I will now turn the presentation over to Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock."

2015 was a year in which the organization faced continued volatility in commodity prices and general business conditions. Overall, we're pleased with the creativity and perseverance that the team is shown in working through these issues. To begin, as noted earlier, carloadings for the quarter were down 2% year-over-year and revenue was flat after taking out the impact of currency in fuel, while we continued to see solid pricing of 4.1% all-in for the quarter. Let me provide a little more detail by line of business using Page 14 as a reference. 
In our Chemicals & Petroleum business, we saw an increase of 8% in carloads with a 4% increase in revenue, driven by increased volume in our petroleum and plastic shipments. Our Industrial & Consumer business unit was down 14% versus 2014, which continues the trend we've seen for most of 2015. The year-over-year decrease for the quarter was driven by continued weakness in our metals business, being slightly offset by an increase in our other carloads area. Our Ag & Mineral business delivered a 2% increase in carloads in the fourth quarter, driven by strength in the food products and ores and minerals segments, offset by slightly lighter grain volumes. Revenue for Ag & Mineral was up 4% when you remove the effects of fuel and foreign exchange. Our Energy segment continues to be impacted by mix and continued volatility in the commodity prices. Overall carloads in the quarter were up 11%, while adjusted revenue was off 4%. 
For the quarter, our Intermodal volume was down 6%, with adjusted revenues off 5%. And our cross-border volume was off 8%, and down 3% in revenue. As Jeff mentioned, given the improved service levels in the latter half of the year, our Intermodal offering continues to compete well for the increased volume in this segment. 
For the fourth quarter, our Automotive business increased year-over-year 1%, with an adjusted revenue increase of 6%. Our Automotive group was able to take advantage of the improved fluidity in the network and provide additional capacity and speed on our finished vehicle shipments, providing a strong finish to the quarter. 
On Slide 15, we provided visual update to some of our largest investments, which will continue to increase capacity and fluidity across the network. On the top left-hand side, you can see a picture of the new super Panamax cranes being delivered to the APM Terminal in Lázaro Cárdenas. As stated previously, this terminal will double the port capacity when it opens in the second half of 2016. 
In the bottom left-hand corner, you can see a picture taken last week of the construction at the new BMW manufacturing plant. This facility is another tangible example of a growing automotive manufacturing footprint in Mexico. 
On the top right-hand side, an updated view of the Sasol plant on the Gulf, which will provide an anchor for our growth in the plastics industry. 
And in the bottom right, we show a long-term illustration of the Sanchez Yard in Nuevo Laredo, which will provide better capacity and fluidity on all of our cross-border moves. This capability provides our customers with better and more reliable solutions they can count on as they expand their cross-border supply chain. 
As we've mentioned earlier, we continue to stay focused on preparing for the opportunities in front of us, and we plan to take advantage of our enhanced capacity and fluidity as we execute our critical customer deliverables in 2016. 
With that, I'll now turn the presentation over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch."
30472,318875551,920360,"Kansas City Southern, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2016",2016-01-22,"Earnings Calls","Kansas City Southern","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start my comments on Slide 17. Our fourth quarter volumes declined 2%, while revenues declined 7%.

I'm going to start my comments on Slide 17. Our fourth quarter volumes declined 2%, while revenues declined 7%. The peso depreciation had a $20 million negative impact on revenue growth during the quarter, while declining U.S. fuel prices had a $27 million unfavorable impact on revenue growth. Combined, this $47 million impact contributed to a 7 percentage point negative impact on the revenues. Operating ratio improved 330 basis points to 63.4%, a new record for fourth quarter. A 12% reduction in expenses helped offset the negative impacts from lower volumes and revenues. And I'll cover more expense details in a couple of slides. 
Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the quarter was 32.4%, and further details are included in the appendix on Slide 35. I might offer one comment that the Congress enacted legislation in December, providing us an extension of the short-line tax credit, not only for 2015 but also 2016. And the 2015 benefit in the fourth quarter was about $2.5 million, while we expect about a $3.5 million benefit in 2016. 
Reported fourth quarter 2015 EPS was $1.28 a share, flat year-over-year. And adjusting for debt exchange cost and foreign exchange impact, adjusted EPS was $1.23, a 3% decline from fourth quarter of 2014. We've provided a reconciliation of our reported to adjusted EPS in the appendix on Slide 31 and have also included full year results in the appendix and in our consolidated investor report on our website.
Turning to Slide 18. While the peso did experience significant depreciation quarter-over-quarter, you can see the impact was minimal on the operating income at an estimated $200,000 due to our peso-based revenues and expenses essentially offsetting each other.
Moving to Slide 19. As I mentioned on my first slide, we did experience a $47 million negative impact of revenues from foreign exchange and lower U.S. fuel prices. That is the trend that we expect to continue in 2016 as the peso is expected to continue to decline, particularly in the first and second quarters as projected exchange rates are 16% and 12%, respectively, lower than what we saw in 2015. Likewise, we are projected to experience significant declines in revenue from lower U.S. fuel surcharges more pronounced in first, second and third quarters at 26%, 20%, and 12% declines. These factors are based on readily available estimates, but I might note that the current exchange rate is significantly worse than the estimates, and we're currently at $18.50, while highway diesel prices are at $2.11 per gallon. Again, the take away here, we will have significant pressure in first quarter and second quarter at a minimum from foreign exchange and lower U.S. fuel prices.
Moving to Slide 20. Fourth quarter operating expenses declined $50 million year-over-year, most notably from peso depreciation, lower U.S. fuel prices and continued lower incentive compensation expense. Beyond those items, we managed expenses lower by $11 million through various cost reduction and expense control effort while depreciation increased $7 million. And I'll cover more expense details in the next few slides. 
In Slide 21, compensation and benefits expense declined $19 million for the quarter, mainly from lower incentive compensation, impacts from the peso depreciation and year-over-year benefits, primarily from unfavorable actuarial true-ups in our fourth quarter of 2014 that relate to post-employment benefits. Offsetting those declines were $4 million in wage inflation. And while overall average FTEs increased 3% to support improving service levels in Mexico that Jeff previously covered, we experienced lower headcount in the U.S., resulting in no net expense increases as a result of wage differential. 
Moving to Slide 22. Fuel expense declined $25 million, largely due to declining U.S. fuel prices and the impact of the peso depreciation. Our average U.S. fuel price was $1.54 per gallon during fourth quarter 2015, a 37% decline from the previous year. On a constant currency basis, we saw Mexican fuel prices stay flat year-over-year as a result of government price actions.
Moving to Slide 23. During the fourth quarter, equipment cost declined $1 million, while depreciation increased $7 million. We've continued to experience lower equipment cost as most of our strategies are on leased assets, and accordingly, we saw a $2 million decline in equipment costs. Partially offsetting that $2 million in lower equipment costs due to leased conversion with higher depreciation of $1 million. Other increases in equipment cost were primarily incremental car hire expenses as we continue to experience hire cars on line. Depreciation also increased by $6 million from a larger asset base as a result of our capital expenditure programs. 
On Slide 24, during the fourth quarter, we saw purchased services decline $11 million due to maintenance contract restructuring, lower repair cost, foreign exchange benefits, reduced joint facility cost and lower legal fees. Materials & Other expense was flat year-over-year, benefiting from the peso depreciation, which was offset by higher materials and supplies expense, resulting from the in-sourcing of a previously mentioned maintenance contract.
Moving to Slide 25. I'd like to provide an update on our capital structure priorities. And we continue to be focused on investing in our business to maximize our growth opportunities. For 2015, we incurred $649 million in capital, slightly below our guidance of $650 million to $670 million. And for 2016, as Jeff already mentioned, acknowledging the uncertain volume environment we're operating under, we expect to further reduce our capital to somewhere between $580 million to $590 million. 
With respect to shareholder returns, we continue to repurchase our shares during the fourth quarter and repurchased approximately 675,000 shares for $58 million or an average price of $85.69. Through the first 6 month of the program, we've repurchased approximately 194 million in stock, which represents a reduction in our shares outstanding by 2.1 million shares. We front-loaded the program by buying about 40% of the authorized $500 million 2-year repurchase program during the first 6 months. 
And finally, we continue to optimize our capital structure. As Pat mentioned in December, we completed a debt consolidation program by exchanging approximately $2 billion of our KCSR and KCSM subsidiary debt into parent company debt, which provides us more financial flexibility, lower future borrowing costs, less administrative costs of maintaining 2 capital structures and enhanced cash flow flexibility. Additionally, we established a corporate-level revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, increasing our overall liquidity to $800 million. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

Before opening up the call for questions, I'd like to end with just a few glass-half-full comments. What we're going through right now reminds me a lot of what we were going through back in 2009. KCS, like the other rails, reacted to the recession with a host of service and productivity initiatives that partially mitigated the impact of the business downturn. We at KCS, at the same time, knew that we had an abundance of business growth opportunities on the near horizon. Sure enough, KCS came out of the recession, hitting on all cylinders with a new business growth and efficient operations fueling strong earnings from 2010 to 2014. 
Now fast-forward to 2016. Reacting to the challenging economy, KCS has implemented and continues to implement service and productivity initiatives. The impact of which have already been shown to be positive. And just like 2009, we're looking at expansive, near-term business growth opportunities. To name but a few on the horizon, 2 new auto plants in Mexico will open in the second half of 2016. While at the same time, we will also begin to see the benefits from the plant expansions at the 3 of the auto facilities we serve in Mexico. I might also add that in the near future, you will likely hear of an additional auto growth in our line, but that's a story for another day. 
Also during the second half, the APM Maersk Terminal at Lázaro Cárdenas is presently scheduled to open. 2017 Mexican Energy Reform goes into effect and will provide us the opportunity to remove buying products into Mexico, which promises to be a very good-sized business opportunity. And over the next couple of years, KCS expect to begin to gain the benefit of the growth of a plastics production that will be centered in the Gulf region. 
But let me be clear. KCS, like everybody else, is confronted with some challenging economic issues impacting some of our commodities. These issues will be with us for a while. But the growth opportunities we see coming online, coupled with stronger and ever operations, makes us confident and excited about our future. 
So with that, I'll open it up for questions."

If we look at market share trends in our Lázaro Cárdenas intermodal businesses, where we probably would see the biggest impact or the impact of the weak peso taking market share, we just haven't seen a deterioration in market share over the past year. So we watched it closely. But the ocean carriers want to use rail. They like the service. They like the security aspect of it. So -- and the fact is we just haven't seen it in the numbers. Back on the cross-border, the strongest indicator that we have for regaining market share is dialogue with customers. They have seen and they have been pleased with the improvement that we've demonstrated in the reliability and consistency of our product.

I'm just trying to put it into context how you view it and whether it's a net positive or negative in terms of the long-term allocation for the franchise."

Everybody is opining on what the canal is going to do and whether it's going to increase the all-water. Some of us think that DCs and everything that was going to get done has already been done and that the effect of the West Coast port strikes has already caused a movement of cargo. People want a lot of options now. The shippers we talked to are not going to be satisfied with just the West Coast. They want the West Coast, they want the East Coast, they want the Gulf and they want Lázaro. Right now, Lázaro is primarily the Mexican market, but we don't see any shift there. Although APM Terminals has been very open about looking at their port facility as being something that they definitely want to promote the cross-border into the U.S. traffic. And that's what we're talking a lot to them about and we're talking to customers about. So we still think we're going to become that next option, and that overall, as the volume grows, that the canal is not going to have a negative effect on Lázaro Cárdenas cross-bordering with the U.S."

I know that in the past, you've talked about maybe being a little bit more aggressive on your coal business, reducing yields for certain customers. But how do you manage through an environment like this, where you have a big capital budget, a lot of growth plans in the future and obviously resources that you want to keep productive? Is there incentive here to take this lower or better margin that you have today and maybe keep a little bit more growth on the network in the next few months?

We certainly look at everything from a long-term horizon. We've taken some heat in the past over our capital spend. But when we -- the growth numbers that we see over the next few years, again we've got to support that growth, and overall, just the rail growth in our industry for the next years. I'm pleased that all of the railroads are continuing to spend on capital because we are a network. And if one railroad has service problems, it reflects -- it affects all of us. So I think we're all continuing to do the right thing. We're franchises that can't be duplicated. You're not going to build another railroad. So we've got to be aware -- or we've got to be committed to our business. And I think we are. So when shareholders come to our office and ask me how are we going to spend their money, the first thing is for growth. And I think that's what they want to hear. Then it's dividend, then it's a stock buyback. But growth tops everything. And that's what we're continuing to do. So what I talk more about on feeling the 2009 with 2016 is more of that feeling that we were working through cost issues. We were taking a lot of low-hanging fruit off. But Jeff now is -- he's taking it to a different level. He's going after things that we never had an opportunity to. He's got a great team. So we're were focusing on what we can control in today's environment. So when we come out of this recession into the back half of '16 hopefully, '17, '18, we're going to be poised to get back to those margins, those outsized margins we had back in that 4-year period. That's our goal. That's what we're working on."

The customers that we have today, they want to make sure that we're spending enough capital so they can grow their business. So when we go in on a customer call, we lead with a capital plan and how we're going to be able to help them grow their business. So I don't really see the pressure point there. Where we're getting the pressure point is more on those businesses that are really suffering, like coal. And that one, it's still a wildcard. I mean, we're at the new normal on coal. Are we? I don't know. It maybe -- depends a lot on whether it's going to be Republicans or Democrats running this show for the next 4 years. But right now, that's really the only rifle shot approach or flexibility, if you will, that we've done in the past, that it sounds like commodities. But it's been based on short-term capacity availability, no new locomotives. And did it makes sense to put it in our network? And was it a very positive contribution? Absolutely. So those will still -- but we're not going to get into the discount business. That's not what railroads do. So if that's your question, are we going to become a commodity-based pricing and we're going to get into the discount business? I don't think we need to do that. The challenge is still going to be for the coming years is having the capacity to handle the demand."

Some of the changes that Jeff talked about in his comments are allowing us to do, as Dave said, more with less, to use crews and assets more efficiently. And so it's not just a function of looking at headcount, it's really the efficiency of the network. The other thing and kind of ties in with the previous question is, as we said, we still feel confident based on all of the things that we're seeing being built on our network, that growth will return. And given the lead time in this business on things like crews and hiring and training crews and other assets that are needed to handle that growth. You've kind of got to look a little bit further down the line, so to speak, in order to fine-tune exactly what that balance is between, ""What do I need to handle business volumes today versus what do I know is coming in the relatively near future."" And if circumstances change and our outlook changes, then we have to move in and manage that. So there's no doubt that the environment we're in is causing us to be much more nimble. And I think we've responded pretty well. Jeff's team has done an outstanding job of kind of being on their toes and really looking at ways that we can respond. If you just look at 2015 as an example, I think we showed a slide like this in the previous earnings call, started out strong. We were hiring and training in January and in the early part of the first quarter a year ago. Then everything energy-related collapsed. And we were literally furloughing crews as they were coming out of training. And then volume kind of recovered in the third quarter, and we were scrambling to get them back. So we were kind of chasing our tail. So we really -- one of the things we focused on is looking a little bit longer term but being nimble and quick to respond as we get better information about the outlook to manage the resources appropriately."

Presenting with me this morning are President, Pat Ottensmeyer; Chief Transportation Officer, Jeff Songer; Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock; Chief Financial Officer, Mike Upchurch; and on the phone from Mexico will be José Zozaya, our President and Executive Representative for the answer session of the call.
Turning to our fourth quarter. The combination of a challenging economy and the dual impacts of a weak peso and lower-than-normal fuel surcharge revenues resulted in revenues declining 7% from fourth quarter 2014. The combination of foreign exchange and lower U.S. fuel prices had a significant effect on our consolidated revenue. Excluding those factors, KCS's revenue for the fourth quarter 2014 were approximately flat for the prior year. The company responded very well to the difficult macro conditions, which is illustrated by our posting of 63.3% operating ratio for the quarter, an improvement of 3.4 points compared to fourth quarter 2014. Prime contributors to KCS's strong operating ratio were a strict, steadily improving system velocity and system dwell metrics, which have essentially returned to our 2013 levels. Making our performance even more impressive is the fact that we have to contend with a hurricane that hit Mexico in the late October and devastating floods in Southern Missouri in late December. In both cases, we had to work around washouts and weather-related service delays. Despite the challenges, we operated at a high-level efficiency and recorded service metrics that put KCS in the top tier amongst Class 1s.
Macroeconomic forces served to constrain levels of business growth in certain commodity segments, which appears to be the case moving into 2016. We do not have a crystal ball to help project how the industrial economy will perform over the next 6 to 12 months. For that reason, we are unable to project definite growth and revenue numbers for the near future. 
Pat and Jeff will discuss some of the areas in which we believe KCS can show measurable productivity improvements in 2016 as well as cover some of the capital projects necessary to handle the business growth opportunities that Brian Hancock and his team will be bringing online in the second half of 2016 and into '17 and beyond. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Pat."

I will begin my comments on Slide 7. Before I get into the data on this slide, let me just pick up on Dave's opening comments by saying that we are not going to talk a lot this morning about the factors which affected our performance that -- and our outlook that we do not control, such as commodity prices, currency values, energy markets. Those factors are pretty well understood in the sense that they've created a lot of volatility in our business and uncertainty about general conditions going forward. We will spend more time this morning focusing on the things that we can and did manage to drive performance in an increasingly volatile and uncertain economic environment. Things like service, cost control, asset utilization and capital structure and liquidity.
Now going back to Slide 7. Here, we show you our velocity and dwell trends over the past 3 years and compare them to the average of all of the other Class 1 rails, excluding KCS. Over the course of 2015, we showed noticeable improvement in both of these key metrics, and we have returned to the strong performance levels that we were producing at the beginning of 2013. This service recovery is even more impressive when you consider that, unlike most of our industry peers, we are handling more volume than we were at the beginning of this period in 2013. In addition, Dave mentioned the weather factors that we had to overcome last year as well. 
Taking a closer look at velocity, this graph shows that we did see some deterioration during the second half of 2014 and first half of 2015. However, we were still performing at a level that was better than the overall industry average. This was not the case for dwell, but we have improved overall terminal dwells by 9% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and feel that we are back where we need to be to run an efficient network and meet our customers' expectations. 
In addition, our intermodal product has returned to a highly reliable and consistent service, which is the key to regaining and securing some of the lost business that we talked about the last couple of quarters and eventually returning to the higher growth rates we believe are possible, given the size of the truck conversion opportunity here. In a few moments, Jeff Songer will talk about some of the specific things we did to manage these outcomes and why we believe this service performance is sustainable going forward. I will just say that we now have an excellent operating leadership team in place with substantial Class 1 rail experience at multiple layers through the organization. Jeff will elaborate in a few minutes. 
Since becoming President last March, I have worked closely with Jeff and the entire operating team and can assure you that there is a very high sense of urgency in identifying and implementing key initiatives that are behind the improvement and improvements evidenced on these graphs. This process will continue. Jeff has better aligned functional responsibilities with the correct experiences and leadership skills and clear accountabilities to improve the way we manage the railroad, and that is showing up in both our service and cost metrics.
Moving on to Slide 8. You can also see the impact of this improved management focus on this chart. We are very pleased to show this trend has continued, quarter-to-quarter improvement in operating ratio over the course of a very difficult and volatile year and in the absence of volume growth, and therefore, no benefit from incremental margins. Obviously, there are many gives and takes from items like fuel and currency. But even excluding those items, we delivered real productivity gains over the course of a very difficult year. This is another example of managing things that we can control by cost and asset utilization in an environment where there are significant negative factors that we do not. 
Finally, I'll wrap up with Slide 9. I'll give you all a heads up that other than CapEx, which we'll talk about in a couple of minutes, this is the only guidance that we're going to provide at this time. Given the uncertainty that we see in the near-term economic and business environment, the only guidance we can provide is that the long-term outlook continues to be positive, driven by growth in several key market areas; strong pricing trends, which Brian will touch on in a few minutes; and sustainable improvement in service, cost control and asset utilization. And as we state in the center of the slide, we expect to show long-term continued improvement in operating ratio, earnings per share and return on invested capital. As you've heard from all of the other rails that have reported so far, the short-term outlook is very uncertain, and as a result, we are just not in a position to provide more definitive guidance regarding volume, revenue or operating ratio.
Many of you on the call this morning have as much or better information regarding the economic outlook, commodity and currency markets than we do. I was at a rail industry conference last week, and I thought one railroad executive characterized the current landscape quite well when he said, and I'm paraphrasing here, ""We are in an energy market depression, an industrial and manufacturing recession, but somehow, the consumer is doing okay."" We do know that the long-term outlook is strong. And for the near term, we will focus again on those things over which we have more control to drive long-term continued improvement in all of our key metrics. 
Mike Upchurch will talk to you in a few moments about a recently completed debt restructuring, which we believe improves our overall liquidity profile and strengthens our financial flexibility. Growth will return. The investments in chemical plants, auto production, port terminals and other facilities that is taking place in our service area is quite remarkable. In 2016, we are forecasting a reduction in overall capital spending. Jeff will touch -- give you more detail on that in a minute. But we will continue to spend on those key projects that support the industrial development activity and new business opportunities taking place on our network. When these new plants and terminals open, we will be ready to capitalize immediately on the opportunities that we know are coming over the longer-term horizon. 
In closing, I will restate once more that our near-term focus will be on those things over which we have more control, such as service, cost control, asset utilization and capital structure. With that, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer."

2015 was a challenging year for the operating team. As outlined on past calls, wide fluctuations in volume, while aligning an appropriate resources, had a negative impact on service levels. However, the team has worked through these challenges and has ended the year with a positive trend. Organizationally, we continue to make changes necessary to ensure our continued performance improvements. When I stepped into the job over a year ago, one of our first organizational moves was to appoint a new vice president of transportation in the U.S. This individual brings over 30 years of railroad experience from Union Pacific and CSX and positions the operating team well into the future. 
Likewise in Mexico, we promoted a new head of transportation who has led the efforts in restoring our workforce and is now focused on regaining service levels. About that time, we announced a new vice president of our mechanical organization. This individual brings 30 years of experience, notably with Amtrak and CSX. Last August, we added a director of intermodal and automotive operations in Mexico. This former CSX employee brings 8 years of experience, leading large intermodal terminals in Chicago and New York. 
Finally, in November, we promoted a new lead for our Network Operations Center and crew management function. This individual came to KCS in 2013 from the BNSF, where he had successfully worked in the operating departments since 1997. Additional realignment of our Network Operating Center and field operating teams as well as restructuring our crew management team should lead for greater synergy and coordination of the network. 
Touching on our workforce, the 2015 Mexico hiring initiative is complete, and crews in Mexico are stable. In the U.S., we are currently at 6% of the T&E workforce on furlough status, and we will continue to manage our resources to meet volume demands.
Moving into 2016. Well, we continue -- we will continue our focus on service and increasing productivity to reduce cost. Specific actions already in process include the implementation of interdivisional trains, which allow for the reduction in crew starts across the segment due to improved velocity. This operation started in January between Shreveport and Meridian. And we will implement a similar approach in Mexico between Nuevo Laredo and Monterrey, where our capital improvements have allowed us to increase track speed to 70 miles an hour in this segment. 
Working in coordination with the UP, we have relocated a dispatch console from Kansas City to Spring, Texas, to dispatch this joint KCS/UP/BNSF territory. All railroads are now working together in the same facility to ensure the most efficient operation. 
Sanchez Yard Phase I has completed schedule and Phase II is underway. The additional capacity will enable us to process trains at the border more fluidly; and in 2016, will allow for transition of some work from Laredo to Sanchez to reduce overall labor cost in this segment. Opportunities to streamline the departure process from the port of Lázaro will allow us to reduce car handling and improve cycle times by an average by 6 hours per train. Additionally, we've allocated capital in 2016 to install locomotive fuel optimization technology for 20% of our road fleet, which will help to improve fuel efficiency and velocity of our trains. 
Regarding operating metrics for the quarter, system velocity improved 1% to 27 miles per hour, while dwell time in terminals improved 9% versus Q4 2014. Velocity and dwell metrics continue to be a focus as we regain our consistent service levels and will also allow for improved asset utilization, driving down equipment cost.
Moving on to Slide 12. Capital spending for 2016 is projected at $580 million to $590 million, which represents a 10% reduction from 2015. Reductions in overall maintenance spend and no planned locomotive purchases in 2016 will more than offset our continued investment in growth-related industries. 
We remain steadfast in our commitment to invest in projects such as Sasol, Sanchez Yard, the Port of Lázaro as well as adding additional automotive and intermodal equipment to meet the future projected growth in these areas. 
I will now turn the presentation over to Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock."

2015 was a year in which the organization faced continued volatility in commodity prices and general business conditions. Overall, we're pleased with the creativity and perseverance that the team is shown in working through these issues. To begin, as noted earlier, carloadings for the quarter were down 2% year-over-year and revenue was flat after taking out the impact of currency in fuel, while we continued to see solid pricing of 4.1% all-in for the quarter. Let me provide a little more detail by line of business using Page 14 as a reference. 
In our Chemicals & Petroleum business, we saw an increase of 8% in carloads with a 4% increase in revenue, driven by increased volume in our petroleum and plastic shipments. Our Industrial & Consumer business unit was down 14% versus 2014, which continues the trend we've seen for most of 2015. The year-over-year decrease for the quarter was driven by continued weakness in our metals business, being slightly offset by an increase in our other carloads area. Our Ag & Mineral business delivered a 2% increase in carloads in the fourth quarter, driven by strength in the food products and ores and minerals segments, offset by slightly lighter grain volumes. Revenue for Ag & Mineral was up 4% when you remove the effects of fuel and foreign exchange. Our Energy segment continues to be impacted by mix and continued volatility in the commodity prices. Overall carloads in the quarter were up 11%, while adjusted revenue was off 4%. 
For the quarter, our Intermodal volume was down 6%, with adjusted revenues off 5%. And our cross-border volume was off 8%, and down 3% in revenue. As Jeff mentioned, given the improved service levels in the latter half of the year, our Intermodal offering continues to compete well for the increased volume in this segment. 
For the fourth quarter, our Automotive business increased year-over-year 1%, with an adjusted revenue increase of 6%. Our Automotive group was able to take advantage of the improved fluidity in the network and provide additional capacity and speed on our finished vehicle shipments, providing a strong finish to the quarter. 
On Slide 15, we provided visual update to some of our largest investments, which will continue to increase capacity and fluidity across the network. On the top left-hand side, you can see a picture of the new super Panamax cranes being delivered to the APM Terminal in Lázaro Cárdenas. As stated previously, this terminal will double the port capacity when it opens in the second half of 2016. 
In the bottom left-hand corner, you can see a picture taken last week of the construction at the new BMW manufacturing plant. This facility is another tangible example of the growing automotive manufacturing footprint in Mexico. 
On the top right-hand side, an updated view of the Sasol plant on the Gulf, which will provide an anchor for our growth in the plastics industry. 
And in the bottom right, we show a long-term illustration of the Sanchez Yard in Nuevo Laredo, which will provide better capacity and fluidity on all of our cross-border moves. This capability provides our customers with better and more reliable solutions they can count on as they expand their cross-border supply chain. 
As we've mentioned earlier, we continue to stay focused on preparing for the opportunities in front of us, and we plan to take advantage of our enhanced capacity and fluidity as we execute our critical customer deliverables in 2016. 
With that, I'll now turn the presentation over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch."
30472,318875551,920407,"Kansas City Southern, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2016",2016-01-22,"Earnings Calls","Kansas City Southern","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start my comments on Slide 17. Our fourth quarter volumes declined 2%, while revenues declined 7%.

I'm going to start my comments on Slide 17. Our fourth quarter volumes declined 2%, while revenues declined 7%. The peso depreciation had a $20 million negative impact on revenue growth during the quarter, while declining U.S. fuel prices had a $27 million unfavorable impact on revenue growth. Combined, this $47 million impact contributed to a 7 percentage point negative impact on the revenues. Operating ratio improved 330 basis points to 63.4%, a new record for fourth quarter. A 12% reduction in expenses helped offset the negative impacts from lower volumes and revenues. And I'll cover more expense details in a couple of slides. 
Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the quarter was 32.4%, and further details are included in the appendix on Slide 35. I might offer one comment that the Congress enacted legislation in December, providing us an extension of the short-line tax credit, not only for 2015 but also 2016. And the 2015 benefit in the fourth quarter was about $2.5 million, while we expect about a $3.5 million benefit in 2016. 
Reported fourth quarter 2015 EPS was $1.28 a share, flat year-over-year. And adjusting for debt exchange cost and foreign exchange impact, adjusted EPS was $1.23, a 3% decline from fourth quarter of 2014. We've provided a reconciliation of our reported to adjusted EPS in the appendix on Slide 31 and have also included full year results in the appendix and in our consolidated investor report on our website.
Turning to Slide 18. While the peso did experience significant depreciation quarter-over-quarter, you can see the impact was minimal on the operating income at an estimated $200,000 due to our peso-based revenues and expenses essentially offsetting each other.
Moving to Slide 19. As I mentioned on my first slide, we did experience a $47 million negative impact of revenues from foreign exchange and lower U.S. fuel prices. That is the trend that we expect to continue in 2016 as the peso is expected to continue to decline, particularly in the first and second quarters as projected exchange rates are 16% and 12%, respectively, lower than what we saw in 2015. Likewise, we are projected to experience significant declines in revenue from lower U.S. fuel surcharges more pronounced in first, second and third quarters at 26%, 20%, and 12% declines. These factors are based on readily available estimates, but I might note that the current exchange rate is significantly worse than the estimates, and we're currently at $18.50, while highway diesel prices are at $2.11 per gallon. Again, the take away here, we will have significant pressure in first quarter and second quarter at a minimum from foreign exchange and lower U.S. fuel prices.
Moving to Slide 20. Fourth quarter operating expenses declined $50 million year-over-year, most notably from peso depreciation, lower U.S. fuel prices and continued lower incentive compensation expense. Beyond those items, we managed expenses lower by $11 million through various cost reduction and expense control effort while depreciation increased $7 million. And I'll cover more expense details in the next few slides. 
In Slide 21, compensation and benefits expense declined $19 million for the quarter, mainly from lower incentive compensation, impacts from the peso depreciation and year-over-year benefits, primarily from unfavorable actuarial true-ups in our fourth quarter of 2014 that relate to post-employment benefits. Offsetting those declines were $4 million in wage inflation. And while overall average FTEs increased 3% to support improving service levels in Mexico that Jeff previously covered, we experienced lower headcount in the U.S., resulting in no net expense increases as a result of wage differential. 
Moving to Slide 22. Fuel expense declined $25 million, largely due to declining U.S. fuel prices and the impact of the peso depreciation. Our average U.S. fuel price was $1.54 per gallon during fourth quarter 2015, a 37% decline from the previous year. On a constant currency basis, we saw Mexican fuel prices stay flat year-over-year as a result of government price actions.
Moving to Slide 23. During the fourth quarter, equipment cost declined $1 million, while depreciation increased $7 million. We've continued to experience lower equipment cost as a result of our strategies [indiscernible]  leased assets, and accordingly, we saw a $2 million decline in equipment costs. Partially offsetting that $2 million in lower equipment costs due to leased conversion with higher depreciation of $1 million. Other increases in equipment cost were primarily incremental car hire expenses as we continue to experience hire cars on line. Depreciation also increased by $6 million from a larger asset base as a result of our capital expenditure programs. 
On Slide 24, during the fourth quarter, we saw purchased services decline $11 million due to maintenance contract restructuring, lower repair cost, foreign exchange benefits, reduced joint facility cost and lower legal fees. Materials & Other expense was flat year-over-year, benefiting from the peso depreciation, which was offset by higher materials and supplies expense, resulting from the in-sourcing of a previously mentioned maintenance contract.
Moving to Slide 25. I'd like to provide an update on our capital structure priorities. And we continue to be focused on investing in our business to maximize our growth opportunities. For 2015, we incurred $649 million in capital, slightly below our guidance of $650 million to $670 million. And for 2016, as Jeff already mentioned, acknowledging the uncertain volume environment we're operating under, we expect to further reduce our capital to somewhere between $580 million and $590 million. 
With respect to shareholder returns, we continue to repurchase our shares during the fourth quarter and repurchased approximately 675,000 shares for $58 million or an average price of $85.69. Through the first 6 month of the program, we've repurchased approximately 194 million in stock, which represents a reduction in our shares outstanding by 2.1 million shares. We front-loaded the program by buying about 40% of the authorized $500 million 2-year repurchase program during the first 6 months. 
And finally, we continue to optimize our capital structure. As Pat mentioned in December, we completed a debt consolidation program by exchanging approximately $2 billion of our KCSR and KCSM subsidiary debt into parent company debt, which provides us more financial flexibility, lower future borrowing costs, less administrative costs of maintaining 2 capital structures and enhanced cash flow flexibility. Additionally, we established a corporate-level revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, increasing our overall liquidity to $800 million. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

Before opening up the call for questions, I'd like to end with just a few glass-half-full comments. What we're going through right now reminds me a lot of what we were going through back in 2009. KCS, like the other rails, reacted to the recession with a host of service and productivity initiatives that partially mitigated the impact of the business downturn. We at KCS, at the same time, knew that we had an abundance of business growth opportunities on the near horizon. Sure enough, KCS came out of the recession, hitting on all cylinders with a new business growth and efficient operations fueling strong earnings from 2010 to 2014. 
Now fast-forward to 2016. Reacting to the challenging economy, KCS has implemented and continues to implement service and productivity initiatives. The impact of which have already been shown to be positive. And just like 2009, we're looking at expansive, near-term business growth opportunities. To name but a few on the horizon, 2 new auto plants in Mexico will open in the second half of 2016. While at the same time, we will also begin to see the benefits from the plant expansions at the 3 of the auto facilities we serve in Mexico. I might also add that in the near future, you will likely hear of an additional auto growth on our line, but that's a story for another day. 
Also during the second half, the APM Maersk Terminal at Lázaro Cárdenas is presently scheduled to open. 2017 Mexican Energy Reform goes into effect and will provide us the opportunity to remove buying products into Mexico, which promises to be a very good-sized business opportunity. And over the next couple of years, KCS expects to begin to gain the benefit of the growth of a plastics production that will be centered in the Gulf region. 
But let me be clear. KCS, like everybody else, is confronted with some challenging economic issues impacting some of our commodities. These issues will be with us for a while. But the growth opportunities we see coming online, coupled with stronger than ever operations, makes us confident and excited about our future. 
So with that, I'll open it up for questions."

We certainly look at everything from a long-term horizon. We've taken some heat in the past over our capital spend. But when we -- the growth numbers that we see over the next few years, again we've got to support that growth, and overall, just the rail growth in our industry for the next years. I'm pleased that all of the railroads are continuing to spend on capital because we are a network. And if one railroad has service problems, it reflects -- it affects all of us. So I think we're all continuing to do the right thing. We're franchises that can't be duplicated. You're not going to build another railroad. So we've got to be aware -- or we've got to be committed to our business. And I think we are. So when shareholders come to our office and ask me how are we going to spend their money, the first thing is for growth. And I think that's what they want to hear. Then it's dividend, then it's a stock buyback. But growth tops everything. And that's what we're continuing to do. So what I talk more about on feeling the 2009 with 2016 is more of that feeling that we were working through cost issues. We were taking a lot of low-hanging fruit off. But Jeff now is -- he's taking it to a different level. He's going after things that we never had an opportunity to. He's got a great team. So we're focusing on what we can control in today's environment. So when we come out of this recession into the back half of '16 hopefully, '17, '18, we're going to be poised to get back to those margins, those outsized margins we had back in that 4-year period.

Where we're getting the pressure point is more on those businesses that are really suffering, like coal. And that one, it's still a wildcard. I mean, we're at the new normal on coal. Are we? I don't know. It maybe -- depends a lot on whether it's going to be Republicans or Democrats running this show for the next 4 years. But right now, that's really the only rifle shot approach or flexibility, if you will, that we've done in the past, that and some of the commodities. But it's been based on short-term capacity availability, no new locomotives. And did it makes sense to put it in our network? And was it a very positive contribution? Absolutely. So those will still -- but we're not going to get into the discount business. That's not what railroads do. So if that's your question, are we going to become a commodity-based pricing and we're going to get into the discount business? I don't think we need to do that.

Some of the changes that Jeff talked about in his comments are allowing us to do, as Dave said, more with less, to use crews and assets more efficiently. And so it's not just a function of looking at headcount, it's really the efficiency of the network. The other thing and kind of ties in with the previous question is, as we said, we still feel confident based on all of the things that we're seeing being built on our network, that growth will return. And given the lead time in this business on things like crews and hiring and training crews and other assets that are needed to handle that growth. You've kind of got to look a little bit further down the line, so to speak, in order to fine-tune exactly what that balance is between, ""What do I need to handle business volumes today versus what do I know is coming in the relatively near future."" And if circumstances change and our outlook changes, then we have to move in and manage that. So there's no doubt that the environment we're in is causing us to be much more nimble. And I think we've responded pretty well. Jeff's team has done an outstanding job of kind of being on their toes and really looking at ways that we can respond. If you just look at 2015 as an example, I think we showed a slide like this in the previous earnings call, started out strong. We were hiring and training in January and in the early part of the first quarter a year ago. Then everything energy-related collapsed. And we were literally furloughing crews as they were coming out of training. And then volume kind of recovered in the third quarter, and we were scrambling to get them back. So we were kind of chasing our tail. So we really -- one of the things we focused on is looking a little bit longer term but being nimble and quick to respond as we get better information about the outlook to manage the resources appropriately."

Quick look at our overview of first quarter. KCS revenues declined by 7% from a year ago. Of course, a weak peso and lower U.S. fuel prices had significant impacts on the top line. When you exclude those factors, our revenues were down 1% from the first quarter of 2015. In addition to these factors, we were hit with serious flooding on parts of our network in Texas and Louisiana beginning in mid-March, which had a noticeable negative impact on revenues for the quarter. Despite all of these challenges, as well as the 5% reduction in carloads, KCS posted an adjusted operating ratio for the quarter of 66.6, a 2.3-point improvement over the prior year. 
A few comments on the flood and impact of the 3 critical quarters where our railroad being out of service for over 3 weeks. We were very pleased with our ability to keep a lot of them moving those 3 weeks and get our system up and running as quickly as it did. A testament to Jeff Songer and his operating team, and to the exceptional coordination between operations, marketing and sales personnel, keeping our customers impacted on their cargo movement. It also speaks to a high degree of cooperation between KCS and other railroads, particularly the Union Pacific and BNSF, who are battling their own flood-related problems as well. We our trains in our own respective networks to minimize the effects of our customers. We were also assisted by Canadian National. We may be pierced competitors those days but when hit financial disasters, werewolves work together to keep the freight moving to the greatest extent possible. It was a great effort. My final thought is how to be able to improve the operating ratio by over 2 points while losing an important part of your rail system for nearly 1 month. And without the benefits and incremental volume growth, it's a real noteworthy achievement and should give you all confidence in KCS's organization, and particularly, our operating team going forward. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat Ottensmeyer."

And Jeff, Brian, Mike will get a lot more detail on the following slides. What I would like to do is next few slides is provide more of an assessment or evaluation of our performance during the quarter and talk briefly about our longer-term outlook. Speaking with the general theme from our fourth quarter earnings presentation, we will focus our comments this morning more on those factors that we can manage to drive performance in an uncertain and volatile economic environment. Things like service, cost control, asset utilization and capital structure. Overall, we feel that our performance in the first quarter was very good in spite of its continued headwinds from energy markets as we recall in crude oil, fuel prices and foreign exchange. As Dave mentioned, all of which had a negative impact on volumes and/or revenues during the quarter. 
In addition, KCS revenues and volumes were negatively impacted by heavy rains, flooding and service interruptions that essentially shut down parts of our southern region and our cross-border route in March. Jeff will have more to say about that in a few minutes. Return into the first quarter assessment. Until about March 9, we were all feeling pretty good about the pace of business at this year. Although I would say to phrase reason to describe all the first quarter at that point was ""worse than last year but better-than-expected"". Since the rain started, we experienced severe, and some reasons, record-breaking flooding in Louisiana and Texas. As you will see on the following slides, our year-to-date volumes had actually crossed over into positive territory on March 9, where they were up 1% versus last year, then we went under water. The reduction in volumes during the last 22 days of the quarter took our volumes for the full quarter from a 1% increase at March 9 to a 5% decline by the end of the quarter. Not all of that decline was due to the flooding. There were other factors, including the timing of the Eastern holiday, which contributed to a weak 2016 comps. In spite of that dramatic flood impact, our operations team demonstrated excellent performance on things we did control such as service, costs and asset utilization, to drive  a 230 basis point improvement in operating ratio from last year. Again, as Dave mentioned, the other positive factor that allowed us to manage our network and keep customer service and asset utilization at reasonable levels was a degree of cooperation we saw from our railroad partners, many of whom were also affected by flooding on their network. I don't think it would be an overstatement to say that the level of coordination and cooperation we saw from our rail partners in Texas and Louisiana was better than at any time we can remember in the last 10 years. All this where in the same situation, and we used each other's networks in a way that was purely focused on taking care of customers and keeping our collective networks running in the most efficient manner possible. Before I leave this slide, I want to acknowledge the announcement we made on March 10, appointing Jeff Songer to Chief Operating Officer. I feel this organizational change whereby we align all of the key operation functions, transportation, engineering and mechanical, under a single functional unit to allow KCS to drive further improvements in customer service, cost control and asset utilization, and ultimately, help us achieve our long-term operating ratio and ROIC targets. I'll come back to this theme of organizational development in a couple of minutes.
Slide 8 demonstrate the point I made earlier that our volumes of actually crossed over into positive territory on March 9. This chart further illustrates the significant impact with the flood and service interruptions, among other factors, had on our quarterly volumes, which finished 5% lower than last year. I'm happy to report that this business recovery has continued. Volumes for the second quarter has returned to positive territories. You can see here, as of last Friday, we were up about 3% versus last year. 
I'll wrap up with Slide 9. You may remember this graphic from our fourth quarter 2015 earnings presentation in January. At that time, which was the first time we introduced this slide, we told you that this would be our primary guidance statement going forward. Given the uncertainty that we continue to see in the near-term economic and business environment, the only guidance we can provide is that the long-term outlook continues to be positive, driven by growth in several key market areas, positive pricing trends and sustainable improvement in service, cost control and asset utilization. And as we state in the center of this slide, we expect to show long-term continued improvement in operating ratio, earnings per share and return on invested capital. The short-term outlook continues to be very uncertain. And as a result, we're just not in a position to provide more definitive or specific guidance regarding volume, revenues or operating ratio. Growth will return. Investments in chemical plant, auto production, port terminals, and now, refined products facilities, has taken place in our service areas is quite remarkable. Brian will highlight some recent announcements and new business opportunities and if you minutes. 
In 2016, we continue to forecast a reduction in overall capital spending. But we will spend on those key projects to support investor development activity and new business opportunities taking place on our network. When those new plants and terminals open, we will be ready to capitalize immediately on the opportunities, but we know are coming over the longer-term horizon. 
Earlier, I said I would come back to the organizational development theme. In addition to the personnel and organizational changes that we have made publicly, there have been several other internal organizational changes involving lead or department head positions in PTC, purchasing, network design, internal audits, financial planning and tax. I'm extremely pleased to report that each of these positions involving Vice President or Assistant Vice President level jobs was made with individuals who are already at KCS. This is a phenomenon that hasn't always been the case here in the past, as many of you followed us for some time are aware. It is a testament not only to the quality of our people that our management commitment to develop and promote high performers to become the leaders for the next generation. Our people at all levels of the organization match up very well with our larger industry peers. And most importantly, their talented and dedicated group and that is the critical ingredient to delivering high-performance expectations to which our customers and shareholders hold us. And with that, I'll turn it over to presentation over to Jeff Songer."

Strong operating performance in the quarter allowed for improvements and key operating metrics. Velocity for the quarter was 28 miles per hour, a 3.2% improvement over prior year and a 3.5% improvement over Q4 2015. Overall dwell for the quarter of 21.1 hours was a 7.8% improvement over prior year. Despite significant impacts during the flood in March, we were able to achieve substantial improvement in both operating metrics and cost control as we will discuss. The organizational changes discussed last quarter of fully in place and we are seeing the results. Moving to Slide 12. Efforts and resource management and cost control are showing results. In Mexico, our workforce is stable and operating metrics have largely returned to expected levels. Furthermore, improved cycle times have led to reduce car hours spent. In the U.S., we continued to focus our resource management. Currently, 12% of the U.S. workforce is in status and 12% of our locomotives are in storage. 
Highlighting other cost initiatives, we have started the fuel optimization technology program and have accelerated capital funding to allow us to install this technology in approximately 20% of our road fleet by the end of 2016. We continue to improve Mexico work roles allowing for crude efficiencies. Ongoing projects, such as reducing crew change points in areas such as which will improve run times between Monterey and the border and modifying operations Andy Escobedo area with ease congestion and fluidity in this area. In the U.S., management efforts such as eliminating the Jackson, Mississippi crew change and initiatives allowed us to reduce our you don't number of recruits by 37% across the network. Additionally, we continue to improve our mechanical maintenance agreements. It was it a financial benefits of our work-to-date in the next portion of the presentation, were working on additional opportunities, notably, when our Mexico car shop operations that we look to benefit from the latter part of the year.
Looking at our major capital projects. All are progressing to plan. Our work at Sanchez continues and will complement the work completed in 2015 by adding classification tracks and more efficient maintenance facilities. The support yard project is on schedule. We had finalized the bid process, our contract has been selected and construction is underway. Construction of additional receiving and departing in Lázaro will support improved departures, runtimes and length of trains originating from the yard. This additional capacity will also support the APMT terminal opening later this year. has become an additional area of focus, driven by new commercial opportunities. We ran the design process for capacity improvements in this area to support recently announced facilities, which Brian will discuss. 
Turning to Slide 13. I won't close my commas by providing a quick overview of the flood event in March. As you can see from the map, we incurred multiple days of outages across our major east-west and north-south routes in between Shreveport and New Orleans, essentially, the lower half of our you assistant, including cross-border operations. I would like to recognize the coordination efforts during the flood between KCS and our connecting carriers, most notably, the Union Pacific, but also NBS and CSX. I'm proud of the industry response to this event. We're able to route other carriers traffic on our network as we routed their trains across our networks. All in efforts mentioning the most efficient operation for our customers. Finally, I want to thank our operating team for the extra effort working multiple days and nights on end to restore network after this event, and for delivering strong operating performance for the quarter. I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock."
30472,326304037,959352,"Kansas City Southern, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Kansas City Southern","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. To begin, and as noted earlier, the March flood in Texas and the South East in the U.S., primarily impacted our intermodal, Industrial & Consumer and Chemical & Petroleum business segments. In spite of this disruption, our",809,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. To begin, and as noted earlier, the March flood in Texas and the South East in the U.S., primarily impacted our intermodal, Industrial & Consumer and Chemical & Petroleum business segments. In spite of this disruption, our year-over-year revenue was down 1%, excluding currency and fuel while our carloads for the quarter were down 5%. In Q1, we also continued to turn a solid performance with our core present results coming in at 3.8%. The commercial team also wants to express permission for the extraordinary efforts of our operating and service organizations for providing real-time options for our customers and closely working with our other rail partners during this extraordinary weather event. 
I'll now provide a little more detail my line of business using Slide 15 as a reference. Our Chemicals & Petroleum business continues to show steady growth with a 3% volume increase and 2% revenue increase, driven by strength in the petroleum and plastics business, partially offset by the impact of the flood. 
Industrial & Consumer, while also negatively impacted by flooding, still showed a 1% increase in volume but had a 3% decline in revenue, primarily due to the impact of currency and fuel. Softness in both our metals and paper segments had a significant impact in Q1, but we're seeing some improvement as our customers are finding new markets for their products. Additionally, we saw strength in our other carloads segments. 
During Q1, our ag and mineral business saw increase of 4% in both volume and revenue might, driven by strength in grain, particularly in cross-border business. Our energy line of business continue to be negatively impacted by volatility in coal and crude. Overall carloads were down 16% and revenue down 37% versus first quarter of 2015, with coal making up about 52% of the mix. Intermodal volumes were down 7%, with revenue decreasing 10% in the quarter. While our intermodal trains are now running at expected service levels, the volume has been slow and ramping back up. As expected, intermodal was negatively impacted by the retooling and shutdowns at a number of the automotive assembly plants. And as Pat mentioned, we were also impacted by more competitive pricing in several markets as well as the flooding in the South East. These items, combined with differences in holiday timing and China and North America, also impacted our Q1 intermodal results. While the Automotive segment had a number of positive early in the quarter due to specific customer needs and unplanned movements, the plant temporary planned shutdowns were primary drivers of declines of 12% in volume and 11% in adjusted revenue, respectively. We continue to be on track with our expectations with the downtime at our automotive plants and both of these projects are proceeding to plan. We expect that all of our customers facilities will be back online in May. I want to reiterate that these outages have impacted both our intermodal and Automotive business segments. I would retooling business is complete, there will be a gradual ramp up period before all of the quality and new model issues are resolved, but we continue to be optimistic about our Automotive business. 
On Slide 16, we provided details on several announcements that we made during the first quarter. As we previously discussed, the 2013 Mexico Energy Reform legislation allows companies to import refined products into Mexico beginning in 2017 under private brands other than [indiscernible]. KCS, along with several of our partners and industry, have been working towards those implementation dates. On February 22, 2016, the President of Mexico announced the acceleration of these reforms, which would allow importing to begin on April 1, 2016. As a result of this announcement, WCC Industrial and Watco Companies and unzip it will be liquid fuels terminal in San Luis, Potosi on the KCS line. Shipments to this terminal are expected to begin in 2017. Just a few weeks later, range and energy developing hydrocarbon logistics facility to store and ship LPG gases into Mexico. This facility will also begin shipping in 2017. Finally, as a follow-up to our last call, Ford announced that it will be investing $1.6 billion in a new assembly plant in San Luis Pitocin, just across the BMW facility. Ford has announced that this plant will primarily focus on the North America small vehicle market and is expected to open in 2018. We also continue our plans and investments for the opening of the new ATM terminal in Lázaro Cárdenas later in 2016. As you can see, the business development pipeline continues to provide numerous opportunities for growth in several of our key industry segments. We will continue to work with our customers and other organizations to provide quality supply chain solutions in the markets that they serve. And I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch."
30472,326304037,959352,"Kansas City Southern, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Kansas City Southern","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning. I'm going to begin my comments on Slide 18. First quarter volumes declined 5% and revenue declined by 7%. Revenue was negatively impacted by both foreign exchange and U.S. fuel prices.

Revenue was negatively impacted by both foreign exchange and U.S. fuel prices. Excluding those impacts, revenue was down less than 1% in the quarter. The significant peso depreciation had a $20 million negative impact on revenues during the quarter. Declining U.S. fuel prices contributed an additional $17 million decline in revenue. These declines were partially offset by positive pricing impacts. 
Moving to adjusted operating ratio, we saw a decline by 230 basis points to 66.6%. Despite the revenue decline, adjusted operating income was flat, reflecting foreign exchange benefits, lower fuel costs and good expense controls during the quarter, particularly in our operating group. 
Reported EPS was $0.99 per share and adjusting for FX benefits -- or impacts, adjusted EPS was $1.03, flat through 2015. We've provided more P&L details in the appendix, including foreign exchange, income taxes, interest expense and share count.
Moving to Slide 19. To provide some insight into future revenue trends, which we expect will continue to be pressured as a result of year-over-year peso depreciation and lower fuel prices, Slide 19 shows first quarter actual and 2Q through 4Q forecast for peso depreciation and U.S. fuel price. With respect to the peso, projections for the year would indicate an average exchange rate of approximately 17.5, which would represent a 15%, 7% and 5%, respectively, decline in the peso for the remaining quarters of the year. 
As shown in the appendix on Slide 29, approximately 16% of our first quarter revenues were denominated in pesos, and therefore, subject to revaluation, resulting in a 3 percentage point revenue decline. 
Also, as depicted on Slide 29, I would remind everyone that peso-denominated expenses, largely offset peso-denominated revenues, and therefore, impact to operating income was insignificant. With respect to U.S. fuel prices, based on the Energy Information Administration projections, we would expect additional of revenues throughout the year as their forecast calls for highway diesel prices to be down 26%, 20% and 12% during the remaining 3 quarters.
Moving to Slide 20. Adjusted operating expenses declined $40 million or 10% in the quarter. Key drivers of the declines included the impacts of the peso depreciation, which contributed to $18 million of declining expense, and fuel prices, which contributed another $12 million to declining expenses. Other business drivers behind our expense trends are lower U.S. headcount; fuel efficiency, savings from maintenance contract restructuring; legal settlements and other cost-saving initiatives, including lower employee expenses, lower car hire due to improved cycle times in Mexico and a temporary freeze on management salary increases. Offsetting those declines were higher depreciation expenses and washout expenses from the flooding that Jeff discussed earlier. Our estimated washout expense for the quarter is $3.9 million, but we did see offsetting favorability in other casualties during the quarter.
Moving to Slide 21. Compensation expense declined $8 million. Foreign exchange contributed $6 million to that decline while the lower U.S. headcount contributed $4 million, resulting from furlough in 12% of our U.S. workforce as Jeff discussed earlier. Wage inflation continued into a $3 million increase in compensation expense, and while our headcount is up 1% year-over-year, we did reduce headcount 1.4% from the fourth quarter to right size our staffing to be in line with the volume environment we're faced with.
Moving to Slide 22. Fuel expense declined $24 million, primarily due to $12 million in fuel price and an $8 million impact from foreign exchange. We also saw savings in fuel efficiency and lower consumption of $2 million each. And finally, moving to Slide 23, I'd like to cover our cash flow and capital structure progress. We continue to focus first and foremost, as we begin investing operating cash flows back in the capital projects to capitalize on our growth opportunities. Our CapEx guidance continues to be between $580 million and $590 million for the year, about 10% below levels in 2015. However, we continue to acknowledge the importance of balancing investing in our business with returning capital to shareholders. Accordingly, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, paid on April 6. Additionally, we continue to execute the board-approved share repurchase program and repurchased 646,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of about $79 per share. Communicatively, we have completed 50% of our program and have repurchased $245 million of stock, representing approximately 2.8 million shares at an average price of $88 per share. And finally, we'll continue to purchase leased equipment and now own approximately 65% of our total equipment approximating industry averages. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Dave for closing comments."

We would have revenue and commercial agreements in place that would assure us some level of return on those investments. Looking at our time horizons and return thresholds.

Joining me today are KCS President, Pat Ottensmeyer; Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Songer; Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock; Chief Financial Officer, Mike Upchurch; and joining us by phone, President and Executive Representative of KCM, José Zozaya.
A quick look at our overview of first quarter. KCS revenues declined by 7% from a year ago. Of course, a weak peso and lower U.S. fuel prices had significant impacts on the top line. When you exclude those factors, our revenues were down 1% from the first quarter of 2015. In addition to these factors, we were hit with serious flooding on parts of our network in Texas and Louisiana beginning in mid-March, which had a noticeable negative impact on revenues for the quarter. Despite all of these challenges as well as the 5% reduction in carloads, KCS posted an adjusted operating ratio for the quarter of 66.6%, a 2.3-point improvement over the prior year. 
A few comments on the floods and impact of 3 critical quarters was of our railroad being out of service for over 3 weeks. We were very pleased with our ability to keep a lot of the trains moving during those 3 weeks and get our system up and running as quickly as it did. It's a testament to Jeff Songer and his operating team and to the exceptional coordination between operations, marketing and sales personnel, keeping our customers impacted on their cargo movement. It also speaks to a high degree of cooperation between KCS and other railroads, particularly the Union Pacific and BNSF, who were battling their own flood-related problems as well. We defer trains on our own respective networks to minimize the effects to our customers. We were also assisted by Canadian National. 
We may be fierce competitors on most days, but when hit financial disasters, railroads work together to keep the freight moving to the greatest extent possible. It was a great effort. 
My final thought is that to be able to improve your operating ratio by over 2 points while losing an important part of your rail system for nearly a month, and without the benefits of incremental volume growth, is a real noteworthy achievement and should give you all confidence in the KCS organization, and particularly, our operating team going forward. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat Ottensmeyer."

Jeff, Brian and Mike will get into a lot more detail on the following slides. What I would like to do in the next few slides is provide more of an assessment or evaluation of our performance during the quarter and talk briefly about our longer-term outlook. 
Sticking with the general theme from our fourth quarter earnings presentation, we will focus our comments this morning more on those factors that we can manage to drive performance in an uncertain and volatile economic environment, things like service, cost control, asset utilization and capital structure. Overall, we feel that our performance in the first quarter was very good in spite of continued headwinds from energy markets, specifically coal and crude oil, fuel prices and foreign exchange. As Dave mentioned, all of which had a negative impact on volumes and/or revenues during the quarter. 
In addition, KCS revenues and volumes were negatively impacted by heavy rains, flooding and service interruptions that essentially shut down parts of our Southern region and our cross-border route in March. Jeff will have more to say about that in a few minutes. 
Returning to the first quarter assessment. Until about March 9, we were all feeling pretty good about the pace of business this year. Although I would say the phrase we were using to describe our first quarter at that point was ""worse than last year but better-than-expected"". Then the rain started and we experienced severe, and in some reasons, record-breaking flooding in Louisiana and Texas. As you will see on the following slide, our year-to-date volumes had actually crossed over into positive territory on March 9, where they were up 1% versus last year, then we went under water. The reduction in volumes during the last 22 days of the quarter took our volumes for the full quarter from a 1% increase at March 9 to a 5% decline by the end of the quarter. Not all of that decline was due to the flooding. There were other factors, including the timing of the Easter holiday, which contributed to a -- the weak 2016 comps. 
In spite of that dramatic flood impact, our operations team demonstrated excellent performance on things we did control, such as service, costs and asset utilization, to drive a 230 basis point improvement in operating ratio from last year. Again, as Dave mentioned, the other positive factor that allowed us to manage our network and keep customer service and asset utilization at reasonable levels was the degree of cooperation we saw from our railroad partners, many of whom were also affected by flooding on their network. 
I don't think it would be an overstatement to say that the level of coordination and cooperation we saw from our rail partners in Texas and Louisiana was better than at any time we can remember in the last 10 years. All of us were in the same situation, and we used each other's networks in a way that was purely focused on taking care of customers and keeping our collective networks running in the most efficient manner possible. 
Before I leave this slide, I want to acknowledge the announcement we made on March 10, appointing Jeff Songer to Chief Operating Officer. I feel this organizational change whereby we aligned all of the key operation's functions, transportation, engineering and mechanical, under a single functional unit will allow KCS to drive further improvements in customer service, cost control and asset utilization, and ultimately, help us achieve our long-term operating ratio and ROIC targets. I'll come back to this theme of organizational development in a couple of minutes.
Slide 8 illustrates the point I made earlier that our volumes had actually crossed over into positive territory on March 9. This chart further illustrates the significant impact of the flood and service interruptions, among other factors, had on our quarterly volumes, which finished 5% lower than last year. I'm happy to report that this business recovery has continued. Volumes for the second quarter have returned to positive territories. You can see here, as of last Friday, we were up about 3% versus last year. 
I'll wrap up with Slide 9. You may remember this graphic from our fourth quarter 2015 earnings presentation in January. At that time, which was the first time we introduced this slide, we told you that this was going to be our primary guidance statement going forward. Given the uncertainty that we continue to see in the near-term economic and business environment, the only guidance we can provide is that the long-term outlook continues to be positive, driven by growth in several key market areas, positive pricing trends and sustainable improvement in service, cost control and asset utilization. And as we state in the center of this slide, we expect to show long-term continued improvement in operating ratio, earnings per share and return on invested capital. 
The short-term outlook continues to be very uncertain. And as a result, we're just not in a position to provide more definitive or specific guidance regarding volume, revenues or operating ratio. 
Growth will return. Investments in chemical plants, auto production, port terminals, and now, refined products facilities that has taken place in our service area is quite remarkable. Brian will highlight some very recent announcements, new business opportunities in a few minutes. 
In 2016, we continue to forecast a reduction in overall capital spending, but we will spend on those key projects to support the industrial development activity and new business opportunities taking place on our network. When those new plants and terminals open, we will be ready to capitalize immediately on the opportunities that we know are coming over the longer-term horizon. 
Earlier, I said I would come back to the organizational development theme. In addition to the personnel and organizational changes that we have made publicly, there have been several other internal organizational changes involving lead or department head positions in PTC, purchasing, network design, internal audit, financial planning and tax. I'm extremely pleased to report that each of these positions involving vice president or assistant vice president level jobs was made with individuals who were already at KCS. This is a phenomenon that hasn't always been the case here in the past, as many of you who followed us for some time are aware, and is a testament not only to the quality of our people but our management commitment to develop and promote high performers to become the leaders for the next generations. Our people at all levels of the organization match up very well with our larger industry peers. And most importantly, they're a talented and dedicated group, and that is the critical ingredient to delivering the high-performance expectations to which our customers and shareowners hold us. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to -- turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer."

Strong operating performance in the quarter allowed for improvements in key operating metrics. Velocity for the quarter was 28 miles per hour, a 3.2% improvement over prior year and a 3.5% improvement over Q4 2015. Overall dwell for the quarter of 21.1 hours was a 7.8% improvement over prior year. Despite significant impacts during the flood in March, we were able to achieve substantial improvements in both the operating metrics and cost control, as we will discuss. The organizational changes discussed last quarter are fully in place, and we are seeing the results. 
Moving to Slide 12. Efforts in resource management and cost control are showing results. In Mexico, our workforce is stable and operating metrics have largely returned to expected levels. Furthermore, improved cycle times have led to reduced car hire expense. In the U.S., we continue our focus on resource management. Currently, 12% of the U.S. T&E workforce is in furlough status and 12% of our locomotives are in storage. 
Highlighting other cost initiatives, we have started the fuel optimization technology program and have accelerated capital funding to allow us to install this technology in approximately 20% of our road fleet by the end of 2016. We continue to improve Mexico work rules, allowing for crew efficiencies. Ongoing projects, such as reducing crew change points in areas, such as Leal, which will improve run times between Monterrey and the border, and modifying operations in the Escobedo area will ease congestion and crew fluidity in this area. 
In the U.S., crew management efforts, such as eliminating the Jackson, Mississippi crew change and other ongoing initiatives, have allowed us to reduce our year-over-year number of recrews by 37% across the network. 
Additionally, we continue to improve our mechanical maintenance agreements. You will see the financial benefit of our work-to-date in Mike's portion of the presentation, and we are working on additional opportunities, notably with our Mexico car shop operations that we look to benefit from toward the latter part of the year.
Looking at our major capital projects, all are progressing to plan. Our work at, Sanchez continues and will complement the work completed in 2015 by adding classification tracks and more efficient maintenance facilities. The Sasol support yard project is on schedule. We have finalized the bid process. Our contract has been selected, and construction is underway. Construction of additional receiving and departing tracks in Lázaro will support improved departures, run times and length of trains originating from the yard. This additional capacity will also support the APMT terminal opening later this year. San Luis Potosi has become an additional area of focus, driven by new commercial opportunities. We are on the design process for capacity improvements in this area to support recently announced facilities, which Brian will discuss. 
Turning to Slide 13. I will close out my comments by providing a quick overview of the flood event in March. As you can see from the map, we incurred multiple days of outages across our major east-west and north-south routes in between Shreveport and New Orleans, essentially the lower half of our U.S. system, including cross-border operations. I would like to recognize the coordination efforts during the flood between KCS and our connecting carriers, most notably, the Union Pacific and BNSF, but also CN and CSX. I'm proud of the industry response to this event. We're able to route other carriers' traffic on our network as we routed their trains across their networks, all in efforts of maintaining the most efficient operation for our customers. 
Finally, I want to thank our operating team for the extra effort, working multiple days and nights on end to restore network after this event and for delivering strong operating performance for the quarter. 
I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock."
30472,326304037,959518,"Kansas City Southern, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Kansas City Southern","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. To begin, and as noted earlier, the March flood in Texas and the Southeastern U.S. primarily impacted our Intermodal, Industrial & Consumer and Chemical & Petroleum business segments. In spite of this disruption, our year",822,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. 
To begin, and as noted earlier, the March flood in Texas and the Southeastern U.S. primarily impacted our Intermodal, Industrial & Consumer and Chemical & Petroleum business segments. In spite of this disruption, our year-over-year revenue was down 1%, excluding currency and fuel, while our carloads for the quarter were down 5%. In Q1, we also continued the trend of solid performance with our core pricing results coming in at 3.8%. The commercial team wants to express our appreciation for the extraordinary efforts of our operating and customer service organizations for providing real-time options for our customers and closely working with our other rail partners during these extraordinary weather events. 
I'll now provide a little more detail by line of business using Slide 15 as a reference. Our Chemicals & Petroleum business continues to show steady growth with a 3% volume increase and 2% revenue increase, driven by strength in the petroleum and plastics business, partially offset by the impact of the flood. 
Industrial & Consumer, while also negatively impacted by flooding, still showed a 1% increase in volume but had a 3% decline in revenue, primarily due to the impact of currency and fuel. Softness in both our metals and paper segments had a significant impact in Q1, but we're seeing some improvements as our customers are finding new markets for their products. Additionally, we saw strength in our other carload segment. 
During Q1, our Ag & Mineral business saw an increase of 4% in both volume and revenue might, driven by strength in grain, particularly in the cross-border business. Our energy line of business continued to be negatively impacted by volatility in coal and crude. Overall carloads were down 16% and revenue down 37% versus the first quarter of 2015, with coal making up about 52% of the miss. 
Intermodal volumes were down 7%, with revenue decreasing 10% in the quarter. While our Intermodal trains are now running at expected service levels, the volume has been slow and ramping back up. As expected, Intermodal was negatively impacted by the retooling and shutdowns at a number of the automotive assembly plants. And as Pat mentioned, we were also impacted by more competitive truck pricing in several markets as well as the flooding in the Southeast. These items, combined with differences in holiday timing in China and North America, also impacted our Q1 Intermodal results. 
While the Automotive segment had a number of positive events early in the quarter due to specific customer needs and unplanned movements, the planned temporary plant shutdowns were primary drivers of declines of 12% in volume and 11% in adjusted revenue, respectively. We continue to be on track with our expectations for the downtime at our Automotive plants, and both of these projects are proceeding as planned. We expect that all of our customers' facilities will be back online in May. I want to reiterate that these outages have impacted both our Intermodal and Automotive business segments. After the retooling is complete, there will be a gradual ramp up period before all of the quality and new model issues are resolved, but we continue to be optimistic about our Automotive business. 
On Slide 16, we provided details on several announcements that were made during the first quarter. As we previously discussed, the 2013 Mexico Energy Reform legislation allows companies to import refined products into Mexico beginning in 2017 under private brands other than PEMEX. KCS, along with several of our partners in the industry, had been working towards those implementation dates. On February 22, 2016, the President of Mexico announced the acceleration of these reforms, which would allow importing to begin on April 1, 2016. As a result of this announcement, WTC Industrial and Watco Companies announced that they will be building a liquid fuels terminal in San Luis Potosi on the KCS line. Shipments to this terminal are expected to begin in 2017. 
Just a few weeks later, Rangeland Energy announced that it is developing an integrated hydrocarbon logistics facility to store and ship LPG gases into Mexico. This facility will also begin shipping in 2017. 
Finally, as a follow-up to our last call, Ford announced that it will be investing $1.6 billion in a new assembly plant in San Luis Potoci just across from the new BMW facility. Ford has announced that this plant will primarily focus on the North American small vehicle market and is expected to open in 2018. 
We also continue our plans and investments for the opening of the new ATM terminal in Lázaro Cárdenas later in year in 2016. 
As you can see, the business development pipeline continues to provide numerous opportunities for growth in several of our key industry segments. We will continue to work with our customers and other organizations to provide quality supply chain solutions in the markets that they serve. 
Now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch."
30472,326304037,959518,"Kansas City Southern, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Kansas City Southern","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning. I'm going to begin my comments on Slide 18. First quarter volumes declined 5% and revenue declined by 7%. Revenue was negatively impacted by both foreign exchange and U.S. fuel prices. Excluding those impacts, revenue wa",783,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning. 
I'm going to begin my comments on Slide 18. First quarter volumes declined 5% and revenue declined by 7%. Revenue was negatively impacted by both foreign exchange and U.S. fuel prices. Excluding those impacts, revenue was down less than 1% in the quarter. The significant peso depreciation had a $20 million negative impact on revenues during the quarter. Declining U.S. fuel prices contributed an additional $17 million decline in revenue. These declines were partially offset by positive pricing impacts. 
Moving to adjusted operating ratio. We saw a decline by 230 basis points to 66.6%. Despite the revenue decline, adjusted operating income was flat, reflecting foreign exchange benefits, lower fuel costs and good expense controls during the quarter, particularly in our operating group. 
Reported EPS was $0.99 per share, and adjusting for FX benefits or impacts, adjusted EPS was $1.03, flat to 2015. Well, we've provided more P&L details in the appendix, including foreign exchange, income taxes, interest expense and share counts.
Moving to Slide 19. To provide some insight into future revenue trends, which we expect will continue to be pressured as a result of year-over-year peso depreciation and lower fuel prices, Slide 19 shows first quarter actual and 2Q through 4Q forecasts for peso depreciation and U.S. fuel price. With respect to the peso, projections for the year would indicate an average exchange rate of approximately $17.5, which would represent a 15%, 7% and 5%, respectively, decline in the peso for the remaining quarters of the year. 
As shown in the appendix on Slide 29, approximately 16% of our first quarter revenues were denominated in pesos, and therefore, subject to revaluation, resulting in a 3 percentage point revenue decline. Also, as depicted on Slide 29, I would remind everyone that peso-denominated expenses largely offset peso-denominated revenues, and therefore, our impact to operating income was insignificant. 
With respect to U.S. fuel prices, based on the Energy Information Administration projections, we would expect additional pressure on revenues throughout the year as their forecast calls for highway diesel prices to be down 26%, 20% and 12% during the remaining 3 quarters.
Moving to Slide 20. Adjusted operating expenses declined $40 million or 10% in the quarter. Key drivers of the declines included the impacts of the peso depreciation, which contributed to $18 million of declining expense, and fuel prices, which contributed another $12 million to declining expenses. Other business drivers behind our expense trends are lower U.S. headcount; fuel efficiency; savings from maintenance contract restructuring; legal settlements and other cost-saving initiatives, including lower employee expenses, lower car hire due to improved cycle times in Mexico and a temporary freeze on management's salary increases. Offsetting those declines were higher depreciation expenses and washout expenses from the flooding that Jeff discussed earlier. Our estimated washout expense for the quarter is $3.9 million, but we did see offsetting favorability in other casualties during the quarter.
Moving to Slide 21. Compensation expense declined $8 million. Foreign exchange contributed $6 million to that decline, while lower U.S. headcount contributed $4 million, resulting from furloughing 12% of our U.S. workforce, as Jeff discussed earlier. Wage inflation contributed to a $3 million increase in compensation expense, and while headcount is up 1% year-over-year, we did reduce headcount 1.4% from the fourth quarter to rightsize our staffing to align with the volume environment we're faced with.
Moving to Slide 22. Fuel expense declined $24 million, primarily due to $12 million in fuel price and an $8 million impact from foreign exchange. We also saw savings in fuel efficiency and lower consumption of $2 million each. 
And finally, moving to Slide 23. I'd like to cover our cash flow and capital structure progress. We continue to focus, first and foremost, on reinvesting operating cash flows back into capital projects to capitalize on our growth opportunities. Our CapEx guidance continues to be between $580 million and $590 million for the year, about 10% below levels in 2015. 
However, we continue to acknowledge the importance of balancing investing in our business with returning capital to shareholders. Accordingly, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, paid on April 6. Additionally, we continue to execute the board-approved share repurchase program and repurchased 646,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of about $79 per share. Communicatively, we have completed 50% of our program and have repurchased $245 million of stock, representing approximately 2.8 million shares at an average price of $88 per share. 
And finally, we will continue to purchase leased equipment and now own approximately 65% of our total equipment, approximating industry averages. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Dave for closing comments."

But again, we also had Easter holiday occurring in first quarter this year. It was second quarter last year. So there were other factors that contributed to the decline at the end of March. And we're going to be steadfast in our position of staying away from volume and revenue guidance just because there are a lot of unknowns out there. The timing and magnitude and potential difficulties that might occur when the auto plants ramp up. Some of these other factors that we just are going to stick to our position of saying volume and revenues are going to be wherever they are and the impact to the economy and foreign exchange. Other factors are going to weigh in there and we're going to focus on things that we can control and will manage to respond to those changing circumstances as they occur.

And it's right on our mainline, right across from our Intermodal facility. So we're there to build the lead in. So it's all going to be about permitting and getting the customer. So this one, when the opportunity is there, it should move faster than if we were just going out to some greenfield site with an idea of what we would like to do.

We've done in other cases and the other rails have done it as well. Things like the refined products -- projects that we've talked about, we would be very interested in supporting those investments where we can with our own support yards. We see that as really an opportunity to help ourselves in the long run by investing in projects or co-investing that are going to drive linehaul revenue growth for years to come. What we generally have done in the past and preferred to do is, we were making substantial capital investments like those. We would have revenue and commercial agreements in place that would assure us of some level of return on those investments, looking at our time horizons and return thresholds. So we haven't done a lot of those types of projects on spec in the past. We're looking for some degree of comfort and commitment that we're going to be able to get a return. And I think we'll continue to look at those. And the things like Sanchez, things like the San Luis Potosi complex projects that we talked about, those aren't necessarily tied to a single commercial or business opportunity, but in those cases, we'll look at operational improvements and just growth in general to support the returns."

But in general, on the return on invested capital, we target high teens to make sure we're continuing to make incremental progress. Obviously in a down volume environment, that's been a bit more challenging. The longer-term nature of our assets tend to get you to 8, 9, 10 years on undiscounted cash flow break evens. But I think all of that said, if you look over the last 10 years, we've roughly doubled our return on invested capital and this entire team on the call here is incented on return on invested capital at 75% of our performance-based stock awards. So we're pretty laser focused on making sure we continue to improve that, and just over the last 18 months obviously been a very difficult volume environment to get those incremental revenues and margins."

That was overwhelmingly the right decision versus share repurchase and stock buyback. They wanted us to reinvest in our own company, which was very encouraging. So a lot of good stuff came out of it.

Joining me today are KCS President, Pat Ottensmeyer; Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Songer; Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock; Chief Financial Officer, Mike Upchurch; and joining us by phone, President and Executive Representative of KCM, José Zozaya.
A quick look at our overview of first quarter. KCS revenues declined by 7% from a year ago. Of course, a weak peso and lower U.S. fuel prices had significant impacts on the top line. When you exclude those factors, our revenues were down 1% from first quarter of 2015. In addition to these factors, we were hit with serious flooding on parts of our network in Texas and Louisiana beginning in mid-March, which had a noticeable negative impact on revenues for the quarter. Despite all of these challenges as well as the 5% reduction in carloads, KCS posted an adjusted operating ratio for the quarter of 66.6%, a 2.3-point improvement over the prior year. 
A few comments on the floods and impact of 3 critical corridors of our railroad being out of service for over 3 weeks. We were very pleased with our ability to keep a lot of the trains moving during those 3 weeks and get our system up and running as quickly as it did. It's a testament to Jeff Songer and his operating team and to the exceptional coordination between operations, marketing and sales personnel, keeping our customers impacted on their cargo movement. It also speaks to a high degree of cooperation between KCS and other railroads, particularly the Union Pacific and BNSF, who were battling their own flood-related problems as well. We deferred trains on our own respective networks to minimize the effect to our customers. We were also assisted by Canadian National. 
We may be fierce competitors on most days, but when hit by natural disasters, railroads work together to keep the freight moving to the greatest extent possible. It was a great effort. 
My final thought is that to be able to improve your operating ratio by over 2 points while losing an important part of your rail system for nearly a month, and without the benefits of incremental volume growth, is a real noteworthy achievement and should give you all confidence in the KCS organization, and particularly, our operating team going forward. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat Ottensmeyer."

What I would like to do in the next few slides i",1165,"Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. I will begin my comments on Slide 7. Dave gave you a summary of our first quarter results. Jeff, Brian and Mike will get into a lot more detail on the following slides. What I would like to do in the next few slides is provide more of an assessment or evaluation of our performance during the quarter and talk briefly about our longer-term outlook. 
Sticking with the general theme from our fourth quarter earnings presentation, we will focus our comments this morning more on those factors that we can manage to drive performance in an uncertain and volatile economic environment, things like service, cost control, asset utilization and capital structure. Overall, we feel that our performance in the first quarter was very good in spite of continued headwinds from energy markets, specifically coal and crude oil, fuel prices and foreign exchange. As Dave mentioned, all of which had a negative impact on volumes and/or revenues during the quarter. 
In addition, KCS revenues and volumes were negatively impacted by heavy rains, flooding and service interruptions that, essentially, shut down parts of our Southern region and our cross-border route in March. Jeff will have more to say about that in a few minutes. 
Returning to the first quarter assessment. Until about March 9, we were all feeling pretty good about the pace of business this year. Although I would say the phrase we were using to describe our first quarter at that point was ""worse than last year but better than expected"". Then the rain started and we experienced severe, and in some reasons, record-breaking flooding in Louisiana and Texas. As you will see on the following slide, our year-to-date volumes had actually crossed over into positive territory on March 9, where they were up 1% versus last year, then we went under water. The reduction in volumes during the last 22 days of the quarter took our volumes for the full quarter from a 1% increase at March 9 to a 5% decline by the end of the quarter. Not all of that decline was due to the flooding. There were other factors, including the timing of the Easter holiday, which contributed to a -- the weak 2016 comps. 
In spite of that dramatic flood impact, our operations team demonstrated excellent performance on things we did control, such as service, costs and asset utilization, to drive a 230 basis point improvement in operating ratio from last year. Again, as Dave mentioned, the other positive factor that allowed us to manage our network and keep customer service and asset utilization at reasonable levels was the degree of cooperation we saw from our railroad partners, many of whom were also affected by flooding on their network. 
I don't think it would be an overstatement to say that the level of coordination and cooperation we saw from our rail partners in Texas and Louisiana was better than at any time we can remember in the last 10 years. All of us were in the same situation, and we used each other's networks in a way that was purely focused on taking care of customers and keeping our collective networks running in the most efficient manner possible. 
Before I leave this slide, I want to acknowledge the announcement we made on March 10, appointing Jeff Songer to Chief Operating Officer. I feel this organizational change whereby we aligned all of the key operation functions, transportation, engineering and mechanical, under a single functional unit will allow KCS to drive further improvements in customer service, cost control and asset utilization, and ultimately, help us achieve our long-term operating ratio and ROIC targets. I'll come back to this theme of organizational development in a couple of minutes.
Slide 8 illustrates the point I made earlier that our volumes had actually crossed over into positive territory on March 9. This chart further illustrates the significant impact that the flood and service interruptions, among other factors, had on our quarterly volumes, which finished 5% lower than last year. I'm happy to report that this business recovery has continued. Volumes for the second quarter have returned to positive territory. As you can see here, as of last Friday, we were up about 3% versus last year. 
I'll wrap up with Slide 9. You may remember this graphic from our fourth quarter 2015 earnings presentation in January. At that time, which was the first time we introduced this slide, we told you that this was going to be our primary guidance statement going forward. Given the uncertainty that we continue to see in the near-term economic and business environment, the only guidance we can provide is that the long-term outlook continues to be positive, driven by growth in several key market areas, positive pricing trends and sustainable improvement in service, cost control and asset utilization. And as we state in the center of this slide, we expect to show long-term continued improvement in operating ratio, earnings per share and return on invested capital. 
The short-term outlook continues to be very uncertain. And as a result, we're just not in a position to provide more definitive or specific guidance regarding volume, revenues or operating ratio. 
Growth will return. Investments in chemical plants, auto production, port terminals, and now, refined products facilities that has taken place in our service area is quite remarkable. Brian will highlight some very recent announcements, new business opportunities in a few minutes. 
In 2016, we continue to forecast a reduction in overall capital spending, but we will spend on those key projects to support the industrial development activity and new business opportunities taking place on our network. When those new plants and terminals open, we will be ready to capitalize immediately on the opportunities that we know are coming over the longer-term horizon. 
Earlier, I said I would come back to the organizational development theme. In addition to the personnel and organizational changes that we have made publicly, there have been several other internal organizational changes involving lead or department head positions in PTC, purchasing, network design, internal audit, financial planning and tax. I'm extremely pleased to report that each of these positions involving vice president or assistant vice president level jobs was made with individuals who were already at KCS. This is a phenomenon that hasn't always been the case here in the past, as many of you who followed us for some time are aware, and is a testament not only to the quality of our people but our management commitment to develop and promote high performers to become the leaders for the next generations. Our people at all levels of the organization match up very well with our larger industry peers. And most importantly, they're a talented and dedicated group, and that is the critical ingredient to delivering the high-performance expectations to which our customers and shareowners hold us. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to -- turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer."

Overall dwell for the quarter of 21.1 hours was a 7.8% improvement over prior year. Despite significant impacts during the flood in March, we were able to achieve substantial improvements in both operating metrics and cost control, as we will discuss. The organizational changes discussed last quarter are fully in place, and we are seeing the results. 
Moving to Slide 12. Efforts in resource management and cost control are showing results. In Mexico, our workforce is stable and operating metrics have largely returned to expected levels. Furthermore, improved cycle times have led to reduced car hire expense. In the U.S., we continue our focus on resource management. Currently, 12% of the U.S. T&E workforce is in furlough status and 12% of our locomotives are in storage. 
Highlighting other cost initiatives, we have started the fuel optimization technology program and have accelerated capital funding to allow us to install this technology in approximately 20% of our road fleet by the end of 2016. We continue to improve Mexico work rules, allowing for crew efficiencies. Ongoing projects, such as reducing crew change points in areas such as Leal, which will improve run times between Monterrey and the border, and modifying operations in the Escobedo area will ease congestion and crew fluidity in this area. 
In the U.S., crew management efforts, such as eliminating the Jackson, Mississippi crew change and other ongoing initiatives, have allowed us to reduce our year-over-year number of recrews by 37% across the network. 
Additionally, we continue to improve our mechanical maintenance agreements. You will see the financial benefit of our work-to-date in Mike's portion of the presentation, and we are working on additional opportunities, notably with our Mexico car shop operations that we look to benefit from toward the latter part of the year.
Looking at our major capital projects, all are progressing to plan. Our work at Sanchez continues, and we'll complement the work completed in 2015 by adding classification tracks and more efficient maintenance facilities. The Sasol support yard project is on schedule. We have finalized the bid process. Our contractor has been selected, and construction is underway. Construction of additional receiving and departing tracks in Lázaro will support improved departures, run times and length of trains originating from the yard. This additional capacity will also support the APMT terminal opening later this year. San Luis Potosi has become an additional area of focus, driven by new commercial opportunities. We are on the design process for capacity improvements in this area to support recently announced facilities, which Brian will discuss. 
Turning to Slide 13. I will close out my comments by providing a quick overview of the flood event in March. As you can see from the map, we incurred multiple days of outages across our major east-west and north-south routes in between Shreveport and New Orleans, essentially the lower half of our U.S. system, including cross-border operations. I would like to recognize the coordination efforts during the flood between KCS and our connecting carriers, most notably, the Union Pacific and BNSF, but also CN and CSX. I'm proud of the industry response to this event. We were able to route other carriers' traffic on our network as we routed our trains across their networks, all an effort to maintain the most efficient operation for our customers. 
Finally, I want to thank our operating team for the extra effort, working multiple days and nights on end to restore our network after this event and for delivering strong operating performance for the quarter. 
I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock."

To begin, and as noted earlier, the March flood in Texas and the Southeastern U.S. primarily impacted our Intermodal, Industrial & Consumer and Chemical & Petroleum business segments. In spite of this disruption, our year",819,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. 
To begin, and as noted earlier, the March flood in Texas and the Southeastern U.S. primarily impacted our Intermodal, Industrial & Consumer and Chemical & Petroleum business segments. In spite of this disruption, our year-over-year revenue was down 1%, excluding currency and fuel, while our carloads for the quarter were down 5%. In Q1, we also continued the trend of solid performance with our core pricing results coming in at 3.8%. The commercial team wants to express our appreciation for the extraordinary efforts of our operating and customer service organizations for providing real-time options for our customers and closely working with our other rail partners during these extraordinary weather events. 
I'll now provide a little more detail by line of business using Slide 15 as a reference. Our Chemicals & Petroleum business continues to show steady growth with a 3% volume increase and 2% revenue increase, driven by strength in the petroleum and plastics business, partially offset by the impact of the flood. 
Industrial & Consumer, while also negatively impacted by flooding, still showed a 1% increase in volume but had a 3% decline in revenue, primarily due to the impact of currency and fuel. Softness in both our metals and paper segments had a significant impact in Q1, but we're seeing some improvements as our customers are finding new markets for their products. Additionally, we saw strength in our other carload segment. 
During Q1, our Ag & Mineral business saw an increase of 4% in both volume and revenue driven by strength in grain, particularly in the cross-border business. Our energy line of business continued to be negatively impacted by volatility in coal and crude. Overall carloads were down 16% and revenue down 37% versus first quarter of 2015, with coal making up about 52% of the miss. 
Intermodal volumes were down 7%, with revenue decreasing 10% in the quarter. While our Intermodal trains are now running at expected service levels, the volume has been slow in ramping back up. As expected, Intermodal was negatively impacted by the retooling and shutdowns at a number of the automotive assembly plants. And as Pat mentioned, we were also impacted by more competitive truck pricing in several markets as well as the flooding in the Southeast. These items, combined with differences in holiday timing in China and North America, also impacted our Q1 Intermodal results. 
While the Automotive segment had a number of positive events early in the quarter due to specific customer needs and unplanned movements, the planned temporary plant shutdowns were primary drivers of declines of 12% in volume and 11% in adjusted revenue, respectively. We continue to be on track with our expectations for the downtime at the automotive plants, and both of these projects are proceeding as planned. We expect that all of our customers' facilities will be back online in May. I want to reiterate that these outages have impacted both our Intermodal and Automotive business segments. After the retooling is complete, there will be a gradual ramp up period before all of the quality and new model issues are resolved, but we continue to be optimistic about our Automotive business. 
On Slide 16, we provided details on several announcements that were made during the first quarter. As we previously discussed, the 2013 Mexico Energy Reform legislation allows companies to import refined products into Mexico beginning in 2017 under private brands other than PEMEX. KCS, along with several of our partners in the industry, have been working towards those implementation dates. On February 22, 2016, the President of Mexico announced the acceleration of these reforms, which would allow importing to begin on April 1, 2016. As a result of this announcement, WTC Industrial and Watco Companies announced that they will be building a liquid fuels terminal in San Luis Potosi on the KCS line. Shipments to this terminal are expected to begin in 2017. 
Just a few weeks later, Rangeland Energy announced it is developing an integrated hydrocarbon logistics facility to store and ship LPG gases into Mexico. This facility will also begin shipping in 2017. 
Finally, as a follow-up to our last call, Ford announced that it will be investing $1.6 billion in a new assembly plant in San Luis Potosi just across from the new BMW facility. Ford has announced that this plant will primarily focus on the North American small vehicle market and is expected to open in 2018. 
We also continue our plans and investments for the opening of the new APM terminal in Lázaro Cárdenas later in year in 2016. 
As you can see, the business development pipeline continues to provide numerous opportunities for growth in several of our key industry segments. We will continue to work with our customers and other organizations to provide quality supply chain solutions in the markets that they serve. 
Now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch."
30472,326304037,959607,"Kansas City Southern, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Kansas City Southern","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning. I'm going to begin my comments on Slide 18. First quarter volumes declined 5% and revenue declined by 7%. Revenue was negatively impacted by both foreign exchange and U.S. fuel prices. Excluding those impacts, revenue wa",784,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning. 
I'm going to begin my comments on Slide 18. First quarter volumes declined 5% and revenue declined by 7%. Revenue was negatively impacted by both foreign exchange and U.S. fuel prices. Excluding those impacts, revenue was down less than 1% in the quarter. The significant peso depreciation had a $20 million negative impact on revenues during the quarter. Declining U.S. fuel prices contributed an additional $17 million decline in revenue. These declines were partially offset by positive pricing impacts. 
Moving to adjusted operating ratio. We saw a decline by 230 basis points to 66.6%. Despite the revenue decline, adjusted operating income was flat, reflecting foreign exchange benefits, lower fuel costs and good expense controls during the quarter, particularly in our operating group. 
Reported EPS was $0.99 per share, and adjusting for FX benefits -- or impacts, adjusted EPS was $1.03, flat to 2015. Well, we've provided more P&L details in the appendix, including foreign exchange, income taxes, interest expense and share counts.
Moving to Slide 19. To provide some insight into future revenue trends, which we expect will continue to be pressured as a result of year-over-year peso depreciation and lower fuel prices, Slide 19 shows first quarter actual and 2Q through 4Q forecasts for peso depreciation and U.S. fuel price. With respect to the peso, projections for the year would indicate an average exchange rate of approximately $17.5, which would represent a 15%, 7% and 5%, respectively, decline in the peso for the remaining quarters of the year. 
As shown in the appendix on Slide 29, approximately 16% of our first quarter revenues were denominated in pesos, and therefore, subject to revaluation, resulting in a 3 percentage point revenue decline. Also, as depicted on Slide 29, I would remind everyone that peso-denominated expenses largely offset peso-denominated revenues, and therefore, our impact to operating income was insignificant. 
With respect to U.S. fuel prices, based on the Energy Information Administration projections, we would expect additional pressure on revenues throughout the year as their forecast calls for highway diesel prices to be down 26%, 20% and 12% during the remaining 3 quarters.
Moving to Slide 20. Adjusted operating expenses declined $40 million or 10% in the quarter. Key drivers of the declines included the impacts of the peso depreciation, which contributed to $18 million of declining expense, and fuel prices, which contributed another $12 million to declining expenses. Other business drivers behind our expense trends are lower U.S. headcount; fuel efficiency; savings from maintenance contract restructuring; legal settlements and other cost-saving initiatives, including lower employee expenses, lower car hire due to improved cycle times in Mexico and a temporary freeze on management salary increases. Offsetting those declines were higher depreciation expenses and washout expenses from the flooding that Jeff discussed earlier. Our estimated washout expense for the quarter is $3.9 million, but we did see offsetting favorability in other casualties during the quarter.
Moving to Slide 21. Compensation expense declined $8 million. Foreign exchange contributed $6 million to that decline, while lower U.S. headcount contributed $4 million, resulting from furloughing 12% of our U.S. workforce, as Jeff discussed earlier. Wage inflation contributed to a $3 million increase in compensation expense, and while headcount is up 1% year-over-year, we did reduce headcount 1.4% from the fourth quarter to rightsize our staffing to align with the volume environment we're faced with.
Moving to Slide 22. Fuel expense declined $24 million, primarily due to $12 million in fuel price and an $8 million impact from foreign exchange. We also saw savings in fuel efficiency and lower consumption of $2 million each. 
And finally, moving to Slide 23. I'd like to cover our cash flow and capital structure progress. We continue to focus, first and foremost, on reinvesting operating cash flows back into capital projects to capitalize on our growth opportunities. Our CapEx guidance continues to be between $580 million and $590 million for the year, about 10% below levels in 2015. 
However, we continue to acknowledge the importance of balancing investing in our business with returning capital to shareholders. Accordingly, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, paid on April 6. Additionally, we continue to execute the board-approved share repurchase program and repurchased 646,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of about $79 per share. Cumulatively, we have completed 50% of our program and have repurchased $245 million of stock, representing approximately 2.8 million shares at an average price of $88 per share. 
And finally, we will continue to purchase leased equipment and now own approximately 65% of our total equipment, approximating industry averages. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Dave for closing comments."

But again, we also had Easter holiday occurring in first quarter this year. It was second quarter last year. So there were other factors that contributed to the decline at the end of March. And we're going to be steadfast in our position of staying away from volume and revenue guidance just because there are a lot of unknowns out there. The timing and magnitude and potential difficulties that might occur when the auto plants ramp up, some of these other factors. So that we just are going to stick to our position of saying volume and revenues are going to be whatever they are, and the impact to the economy and foreign exchange, other factors are going to weigh in there.

This project is a little unique in that the landowner is the same partner that we had on the Intermodal facility at San Luis Potosi. So generally, one of our issues in Mexico is getting all the land together because you've got a lot of the ejidos that you have to buy a lot of individual parcels and then put them all together. In this particular case, the Rangel [ph] family owns his property. They've already done drawings. We've already met with Watco, so we've already got track layouts. And you've got Watco involved, who operates these kinds of terminals in the U.S. So the land's secured, Watco is there with the expertise to run it. And it's right on our mainline, right across from our Intermodal facility. So we're there to build the lead in. So it's all going to be about permitting and getting the customer. So this one, when the opportunity is there, it should move faster than if we were just going out to some greenfield site with an idea of what we would like to do. And, I think, he, in Mexico, who builds this terminal first will -- should be a big winner because the demand is there. And right now, you just don't have the receiving facilities in Mexico to make it happen. So again, we don't want to throw any dates out there because we don't have them yet.

I mean some investors are concerned about potential peaking in the cycle there given the last couple of SAAR data points haven't been great? What are you hearing from the auto OEMs on that front?"

So we really don't see a delay in that production. From an order perspective, I'm going to let the automotive companies speak for themselves on that, but we continue to see strong volumes from the companies that we support in Mexico and in the U.S., and that automotive volume continues to be a key part of the process moving forward.

On your question around benefiting from refined products moving into Mexico for our own fuel. As you probably remember, we do try to take advantage of cross-border operations by, essentially, fueling up in Laredo full on southbound moves and on northbound moves trying to wait until we get across the border. So I think we've done a pretty effective job of taking advantage of that. As the markets are opening up, we have filed for permits to bring our own fuel down into Mexico. We do expect to get approval for that fairly quickly.

We've done it in other cases and the other rails have done it as well. Things like the refined product projects that we've talked about, we would be very interested in supporting those investments where we can with our own support yards. We see that as, really, an opportunity to help ourselves in the long run by investing in projects or co-investing that are going to drive linehaul revenue growth for years to come. What we generally have done in the past and prefer to do is where we're making substantial capital investments like those, we would have revenue and commercial agreements in place that would assure us of some level of return on those investments, looking at our time horizons and return thresholds. So we haven't done a lot of those types of projects on spec in the past. So we're looking for some degree of comfort and commitment that we're going to be able to get a return, and I think we'll continue to look at those. And now things like Sanchez, things like the San Luis Potosi complex projects that we talked about, those aren't necessarily tied to a single commercial or business opportunity. But in those cases, we would look at operational improvements and just growth in general to support the returns."

The service problems that we had in 2015 in Mexico, there was certainly some displeasure with that not only externally, but also internally. So we think that we have addressed that head-on and we've got the organization in place that, that would not happen again. In fact, you'll see us turn that survey out, probably, pretty quickly to see the reaction again, but I think it was healthy. I think it was good for us. The one thing that we really heard from the shareholders where they have a lot of faith in our growth potential. They want us to invest in our network. That was overwhelmingly the right decision versus share repurchase and stock buyback. They wanted us to reinvest in our own company, which was very encouraging. So a lot of good stuff came out of it. But the 2 big takeaways for us was: don't have another service interruption like you did in Mexico; and make sure that you're being cautious on the guidance that you're giving and don't wear rose-colored glasses, tell it like it is."

Joining me today are KCS President, Pat Ottensmeyer; Chief Operating Officer, Jeff Songer; Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock; Chief Financial Officer, Mike Upchurch; and joining us by phone, President and Executive Representative of KCM, José Zozaya.
A quick look at our overview of first quarter. KCS revenues declined by 7% from a year ago. Of course, a weak peso and lower U.S. fuel prices had significant impacts on the top line. When you exclude those factors, our revenues were down 1% from first quarter of 2015. In addition to these factors, we were hit with serious flooding on parts of our network in Texas and Louisiana beginning in mid-March, which had a noticeable negative impact on revenues for the quarter. Despite all of these challenges as well as the 5% reduction in carloads, KCS posted an adjusted operating ratio for the quarter of 66.6%, a 2.3-point improvement over the prior year. 
A few comments on the floods and impact of 3 critical corridors of our railroad being out of service for over 3 weeks. We were very pleased with our ability to keep a lot of the trains moving during those 3 weeks and get our system up and running as quickly as it did. It's a testament to Jeff Songer and his operating team and to the exceptional coordination between operations, marketing and sales personnel, keeping our customers impacted on their cargo movement. It also speaks to a high degree of cooperation between KCS and other railroads, particularly the Union Pacific and BNSF, who were battling their own flood-related problems as well. We deferred trains on our own respective networks to minimize the effect to our customers. We were also assisted by Canadian National. 
We may be fierce competitors on most days, but when hit by natural disasters, railroads work together to keep the freight moving to the greatest extent possible. It was a great effort. 
My final thought is that to be able to improve your operating ratio by over 2 points while losing an important part of your rail system for nearly a month, and without the benefits of incremental volume growth, is a real noteworthy achievement and should give you all confidence in the KCS organization, and particularly, our operating team going forward. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Pat Ottensmeyer."

What I would like to do in the next few slides i",1165,"Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. I will begin my comments on Slide 7. Dave gave you a summary of our first quarter results. Jeff, Brian and Mike will get into a lot more detail on the following slides. What I would like to do in the next few slides is provide more of an assessment or evaluation of our performance during the quarter and talk briefly about our longer-term outlook. 
Sticking with the general theme from our fourth quarter earnings presentation, we will focus our comments this morning more on those factors that we can manage to drive performance in an uncertain and volatile economic environment, things like service, cost control, asset utilization and capital structure. Overall, we feel that our performance in the first quarter was very good in spite of continued headwinds from energy markets, specifically coal and crude oil, fuel prices and foreign exchange. As Dave mentioned, all of which had a negative impact on volumes and/or revenues during the quarter. 
In addition, KCS revenues and volumes were negatively impacted by heavy rains, flooding and service interruptions that, essentially, shut down parts of our Southern region and our cross-border route in March. Jeff will have more to say about that in a few minutes. 
Returning to the first quarter assessment. Until about March 9, we were all feeling pretty good about the pace of business this year. Although I would say the phrase we were using to describe our first quarter at that point was ""worse than last year but better than expected"". Then the rain started and we experienced severe, and in some reasons, record-breaking flooding in Louisiana and Texas. As you will see on the following slide, our year-to-date volumes had actually crossed over into positive territory on March 9, where they were up 1% versus last year, then we went under water. The reduction in volumes during the last 22 days of the quarter took our volumes for the full quarter from a 1% increase at March 9 to a 5% decline by the end of the quarter. Not all of that decline was due to the flooding. There were other factors, including the timing of the Easter holiday, which contributed to a -- the weak 2016 comps. 
In spite of that dramatic flood impact, our operations team demonstrated excellent performance on things we did control, such as service, costs and asset utilization, to drive a 230 basis point improvement in operating ratio from last year. Again, as Dave mentioned, the other positive factor that allowed us to manage our network and keep customer service and asset utilization at reasonable levels was the degree of cooperation we saw from our railroad partners, many of whom were also affected by flooding on their network. 
I don't think it would be an overstatement to say that the level of coordination and cooperation we saw from our rail partners in Texas and Louisiana was better than at any time we can remember in the last 10 years. All of us were in the same situation, and we used each other's networks in a way that was purely focused on taking care of customers and keeping our collective networks running in the most efficient manner possible. 
Before I leave this slide, I want to acknowledge the announcement we made on March 10, appointing Jeff Songer to Chief Operating Officer. I feel this organizational change whereby we aligned all of the key operation functions, transportation, engineering and mechanical, under a single functional unit will allow KCS to drive further improvements in customer service, cost control and asset utilization, and ultimately, help us achieve our long-term operating ratio and ROIC targets. I'll come back to this theme of organizational development in a couple of minutes.
Slide 8 illustrates the point I made earlier that our volumes had actually crossed over into positive territory on March 9. This chart further illustrates the significant impact that the flood and service interruptions, among other factors, had on our quarterly volumes, which finished 5% lower than last year. I'm happy to report that this business recovery has continued. Volumes for the second quarter have returned to positive territory. As you can see here, as of last Friday, we were up about 3% versus last year. 
I'll wrap up with Slide 9. You may remember this graphic from our fourth quarter 2015 earnings presentation in January. At that time, which was the first time we introduced this slide, we told you that this was going to be our primary guidance statement going forward. Given the uncertainty that we continue to see in the near-term economic and business environment, the only guidance we can provide is that the long-term outlook continues to be positive, driven by growth in several key market areas, positive pricing trends and sustainable improvement in service, cost control and asset utilization. And as we state in the center of this slide, we expect to show long-term continued improvement in operating ratio, earnings per share and return on invested capital. 
The short-term outlook continues to be very uncertain. And as a result, we're just not in a position to provide more definitive or specific guidance regarding volume, revenues or operating ratio. 
Growth will return. Investments in chemical plants, auto production, port terminals, and now, refined products facilities that has taken place in our service area is quite remarkable. Brian will highlight some very recent announcements, new business opportunities in a few minutes. 
In 2016, we continue to forecast a reduction in overall capital spending, but we will spend on those key projects to support the industrial development activity and new business opportunities taking place on our network. When those new plants and terminals open, we will be ready to capitalize immediately on the opportunities that we know are coming over the longer-term horizon. 
Earlier, I said I would come back to the organizational development theme. In addition to the personnel and organizational changes that we have made publicly, there have been several other internal organizational changes involving lead or department head positions in PTC, purchasing, network design, internal audit, financial planning and tax. I'm extremely pleased to report that each of these positions involving vice president or assistant vice president level jobs was made with individuals who were already at KCS. This is a phenomenon that hasn't always been the case here in the past, as many of you who followed us for some time are aware, and is a testament not only to the quality of our people but our management commitment to develop and promote high performers to become the leaders for the next generations. Our people at all levels of the organization match up very well with our larger industry peers. And most importantly, they're a talented and dedicated group, and that is the critical ingredient to delivering the high-performance expectations to which our customers and shareowners hold us. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to -- turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer."

Strong operating performance in the quarter allowed for improvements in key operating metrics. Velocity for the quarter was 28 miles per hour, a 3.2% improvement over prior year and a 3.5% improvement over Q4 2015. Overall dwell for the quarter of 21.1 hours was a 7.8% improvement over prior year. Despite significant impacts during the flood in March, we were able to achieve substantial improvements in both operating metrics and cost control, as we will discuss. The organizational changes discussed last quarter are fully in place, and we are seeing the results. 
Moving to Slide 12. Efforts in resource management and cost control are showing results. In Mexico, our workforce is stable and operating metrics have largely returned to expected levels. Furthermore, improved cycle times have led to reduced car hire expense. In the U.S., we continue our focus on resource management. Currently, 12% of the U.S. T&E workforce is in furlough status and 12% of our locomotives are in storage. 
Highlighting other cost initiatives, we have started the fuel optimization technology program and have accelerated capital funding to allow us to install this technology in approximately 20% of our road fleet by the end of 2016. We continue to improve Mexico work rules, allowing for crew efficiencies. Ongoing projects, such as reducing crew change points in areas such as Leal, which will improve run times between Monterrey and the border, and modifying operations in the Escobedo area will ease congestion and crew fluidity in this area. 
In the U.S., crew management efforts, such as eliminating the Jackson, Mississippi crew change and other ongoing initiatives, have allowed us to reduce our year-over-year number of recrews by 37% across the network. 
Additionally, we continue to improve our mechanical maintenance agreements. You will see the financial benefit of our work-to-date in Mike's portion of the presentation, and we are working on additional opportunities, notably with our Mexico car shop operations that we look to benefit from toward the latter part of the year.
Looking at our major capital projects, all are progressing to plan. Our work at Sanchez continues, and we'll complement the work completed in 2015 by adding classification tracks and more efficient maintenance facilities. The Sasol support yard project is on schedule. We have finalized the bid process. Our contractor has been selected, and construction is underway. Construction of additional receiving and departing tracks in Lázaro will support improved departures, run times and length of trains originating from the yard. This additional capacity will also support the APMT terminal opening later this year. San Luis Potosi has become an additional area of focus, driven by new commercial opportunities. We are on the design process for capacity improvements in this area to support recently announced facilities, which Brian will discuss. 
Turning to Slide 13. I will close out my comments by providing a quick overview of the flood event in March. As you can see from the map, we incurred multiple days of outages across our major east-west and north-south routes in between Shreveport and New Orleans, essentially the lower half of our U.S. system, including cross-border operations. I would like to recognize the coordination efforts during the flood between KCS and our connecting carriers, most notably, the Union Pacific and BNSF, but also CN and CSX. I'm proud of the industry response to this event. We were able to route other carriers' traffic on our network as we routed our trains across their networks, all an effort to maintain the most efficient operation for our customers. 
Finally, I want to thank our operating team for the extra effort, working multiple days and nights on end to restore our network after this event and for delivering strong operating performance for the quarter. 
I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock."

To begin, and as noted earlier, the March flood in Texas and the Southeastern U.S. primarily impacted our Intermodal, Industrial & Consumer and Chemical & Petroleum business segments. In spite of this disruption, our year",819,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. 
To begin, and as noted earlier, the March flood in Texas and the Southeastern U.S. primarily impacted our Intermodal, Industrial & Consumer and Chemical & Petroleum business segments. In spite of this disruption, our year-over-year revenue was down 1%, excluding currency and fuel, while our carloads for the quarter were down 5%. In Q1, we also continued the trend of solid performance with our core pricing results coming in at 3.8%. The commercial team wants to express our appreciation for the extraordinary efforts of our operating and customer service organizations for providing real-time options for our customers and closely working with our other rail partners during these extraordinary weather events. 
I'll now provide a little more detail by line of business using Slide 15 as a reference. Our Chemicals & Petroleum business continues to show steady growth with a 3% volume increase and 2% revenue increase, driven by strength in the petroleum and plastics business, partially offset by the impact of the flood. 
Industrial & Consumer, while also negatively impacted by flooding, still showed a 1% increase in volume but had a 3% decline in revenue, primarily due to the impact of currency and fuel. Softness in both our metals and paper segments had a significant impact in Q1, but we're seeing some improvements as our customers are finding new markets for their products. Additionally, we saw strength in our other carload segment. 
During Q1, our Ag & Mineral business saw an increase of 4% in both volume and revenue driven by strength in grain, particularly in the cross-border business. Our energy line of business continued to be negatively impacted by volatility in coal and crude. Overall carloads were down 16% and revenue down 37% versus first quarter of 2015, with coal making up about 52% of the miss. 
Intermodal volumes were down 7%, with revenue decreasing 10% in the quarter. While our Intermodal trains are now running at expected service levels, the volume has been slow in ramping back up. As expected, Intermodal was negatively impacted by the retooling and shutdowns at a number of the automotive assembly plants. And as Pat mentioned, we were also impacted by more competitive truck pricing in several markets as well as the flooding in the Southeast. These items, combined with differences in holiday timing in China and North America, also impacted our Q1 Intermodal results. 
While the Automotive segment had a number of positive events early in the quarter due to specific customer needs and unplanned movements, the planned temporary plant shutdowns were primary drivers of declines of 12% in volume and 11% in adjusted revenue, respectively. We continue to be on track with our expectations for the downtime at the automotive plants, and both of these projects are proceeding as planned. We expect that all of our customers' facilities will be back online in May. I want to reiterate that these outages have impacted both our Intermodal and Automotive business segments. After the retooling is complete, there will be a gradual ramp up period before all of the quality and new model issues are resolved, but we continue to be optimistic about our Automotive business. 
On Slide 16, we provided details on several announcements that were made during the first quarter. As we previously discussed, the 2013 Mexico Energy Reform legislation allows companies to import refined products into Mexico beginning in 2017 under private brands other than PEMEX. KCS, along with several of our partners in the industry, have been working towards those implementation dates. On February 22, 2016, the President of Mexico announced the acceleration of these reforms, which would allow importing to begin on April 1, 2016. As a result of this announcement, WTC Industrial and Watco Companies announced that they will be building a liquid fuels terminal in San Luis Potosi on the KCS line. Shipments to this terminal are expected to begin in 2017. 
Just a few weeks later, Rangeland Energy announced it is developing an integrated hydrocarbon logistics facility to store and ship LPG gases into Mexico. This facility will also begin shipping in 2017. 
Finally, as a follow-up to our last call, Ford announced that it will be investing $1.6 billion in a new assembly plant in San Luis Potosi just across from the new BMW facility. Ford has announced that this plant will primarily focus on the North American small vehicle market and is expected to open in 2018. 
We also continue our plans and investments for the opening of the new APM terminal in Lázaro Cárdenas later in year in 2016. 
As you can see, the business development pipeline continues to provide numerous opportunities for growth in several of our key industry segments. We will continue to work with our customers and other organizations to provide quality supply chain solutions in the markets that they serve. 
Now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch."
30472,326304037,959802,"Kansas City Southern, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Kansas City Southern","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning. I'm going to begin my comments on Slide 18. First quarter volumes declined 5% and revenue declined by 7%. Revenue was negatively impacted by both foreign exchange and U.S. fuel prices. Excluding those impacts, revenue wa",784,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning. 
I'm going to begin my comments on Slide 18. First quarter volumes declined 5% and revenue declined by 7%. Revenue was negatively impacted by both foreign exchange and U.S. fuel prices. Excluding those impacts, revenue was down less than 1% in the quarter. The significant peso depreciation had a $20 million negative impact on revenues during the quarter. Declining U.S. fuel prices contributed an additional $17 million decline in revenue. These declines were partially offset by positive pricing impacts. 
Moving to adjusted operating ratio. We saw a decline by 230 basis points to 66.6%. Despite the revenue decline, adjusted operating income was flat, reflecting foreign exchange benefits, lower fuel costs and good expense controls during the quarter, particularly in our operating group. 
Reported EPS was $0.99 per share, and adjusting for FX benefits -- or impacts, adjusted EPS was $1.03, flat to 2015. Well, we've provided more P&L details in the appendix, including foreign exchange, income taxes, interest expense and share counts.
Moving to Slide 19. To provide some insight into future revenue trends, which we expect will continue to be pressured as a result of year-over-year peso depreciation and lower fuel prices, Slide 19 shows first quarter actual and 2Q through 4Q forecasts for peso depreciation and U.S. fuel price. With respect to the peso, projections for the year would indicate an average exchange rate of approximately $17.5, which would represent a 15%, 7% and 5%, respectively, decline in the peso for the remaining quarters of the year. 
As shown in the appendix on Slide 29, approximately 16% of our first quarter revenues were denominated in pesos, and therefore, subject to revaluation, resulting in a 3 percentage point revenue decline. Also, as depicted on Slide 29, I would remind everyone that peso-denominated expenses largely offset peso-denominated revenues, and therefore, our impact to operating income was insignificant. 
With respect to U.S. fuel prices, based on the Energy Information Administration projections, we would expect additional pressure on revenues throughout the year as their forecast calls for highway diesel prices to be down 26%, 20% and 12% during the remaining 3 quarters.
Moving to Slide 20. Adjusted operating expenses declined $40 million or 10% in the quarter. Key drivers of the declines included the impacts of the peso depreciation, which contributed to $18 million of declining expense, and fuel prices, which contributed another $12 million to declining expenses. Other business drivers behind our expense trends are lower U.S. headcount; fuel efficiency; savings from maintenance contract restructuring; legal settlements and other cost-saving initiatives, including lower employee expenses, lower car hire due to improved cycle times in Mexico and a temporary freeze on management salary increases. Offsetting those declines were higher depreciation expenses and washout expenses from the flooding that Jeff discussed earlier. Our estimated washout expense for the quarter is $3.9 million, but we did see offsetting favorability in other casualties during the quarter.
Moving to Slide 21. Compensation expense declined $8 million. Foreign exchange contributed $6 million to that decline, while lower U.S. headcount contributed $4 million, resulting from furloughing 12% of our U.S. workforce, as Jeff discussed earlier. Wage inflation contributed to a $3 million increase in compensation expense, and while headcount is up 1% year-over-year, we did reduce headcount 1.4% from the fourth quarter to rightsize our staffing to align with the volume environment we're faced with.
Moving to Slide 22. Fuel expense declined $24 million, primarily due to $12 million in fuel price and an $8 million impact from foreign exchange. We also saw savings in fuel efficiency and lower consumption of $2 million each. 
And finally, moving to Slide 23. I'd like to cover our cash flow and capital structure progress. We continue to focus, first and foremost, on reinvesting operating cash flows back into capital projects to capitalize on our growth opportunities. Our CapEx guidance continues to be between $580 million and $590 million for the year, about 10% below levels in 2015. 
However, we continue to acknowledge the importance of balancing investing in our business with returning capital to shareholders. Accordingly, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.33 per share, paid on April 6. Additionally, we continue to execute the board-approved share repurchase program and repurchased 646,000 shares during the quarter at an average price of about $79 per share. Cumulatively, we have completed 50% of our program and have repurchased $245 million of stock, representing approximately 2.8 million shares at an average price of $88 per share. 
And finally, we will continue to purchase leased equipment and now own approximately 65% of our total equipment, approximating industry averages. 
And now I'll turn the call back over to Dave for closing comments."

But again, we also had Easter holiday occurring in first quarter this year. It was second quarter last year. So there were other factors that contributed to the decline at the end of March. And we're going to be steadfast in our position of staying away from volume and revenue guidance just because there are a lot of unknowns out there. The timing and magnitude and potential difficulties that might occur when the auto plants ramp up, some of these other factors. So that we just are going to stick to our position of saying volume and revenues are going to be whatever they are, and the impact to the economy and foreign exchange, other factors are going to weigh in there.

This project is a little unique in that the landowner is the same partner that we had on the Intermodal facility at San Luis Potosi. So generally, one of our issues in Mexico is getting all the land together because you've got a lot of the ejidos that you have to buy a lot of individual parcels and then put them all together. In this particular case, the Rangel [ph] family owns his property. They've already done drawings. We've already met with Watco, so we've already got track layouts. And you've got Watco involved, who operates these kinds of terminals in the U.S. So the land's secured, Watco is there with the expertise to run it. And it's right on our mainline, right across from our Intermodal facility. So we're there to build the lead in. So it's all going to be about permitting and getting the customer. So this one, when the opportunity is there, it should move faster than if we were just going out to some greenfield site with an idea of what we would like to do. And I think, he, in Mexico, who builds this terminal first will -- should be a big winner because the demand is there. And right now, you just don't have the receiving facilities in Mexico to make it happen. So again, we don't want to throw any dates out there because we don't have them yet.

On your question around benefiting from refined products moving into Mexico for our own fuel. As you probably remember, we do try to take advantage of cross-border operations by, essentially, fueling up in Laredo full on southbound moves and on northbound moves trying to wait until we get across the border. So I think we've done a pretty effective job of taking advantage of that. As the markets are opening up, we have filed for permits to bring our own fuel down into Mexico. We do expect to get approval for that fairly quickly. But I also would just caution that while there might be the appearance of significantly cheaper fuel in the U.S., there are taxes being assessed by the government that, effectively, eliminate lot of that arbitrage.

We've done it in other cases and the other rails have done it as well. Things like the refined product projects that we've talked about, we would be very interested in supporting those investments where we can with our own support yards. We see that as, really, an opportunity to help ourselves in the long run by investing in projects or co-investing that are going to drive linehaul revenue growth for years to come. What we generally have done in the past and prefer to do is where we're making substantial capital investments like those, we would have revenue and commercial agreements in place that would assure us of some level of return on those investments, looking at our time horizons and return thresholds. So we haven't done a lot of those types of projects on spec in the past. So we're looking for some degree of comfort and commitment that we're going to be able to get a return, and I think we'll continue to look at those. And now things like Sanchez, things like the San Luis Potosi complex projects that we talked about, those aren't necessarily tied to a single commercial or business opportunity.

The service problems that we had in 2015 in Mexico, there was certainly some displeasure with that not only externally, but also internally. So we think that we have addressed that head-on and we've got the organization in place that, that would not happen again. In fact, you'll see us turn that survey out, probably, pretty quickly to see the reaction again, but I think it was healthy. I think it was good for us. The one thing that we really heard from the shareholders where they have a lot of faith in our growth potential. They want us to invest in our network. That was overwhelmingly the right decision versus share repurchase and stock buyback. They wanted us to reinvest in our own company, which was very encouraging. So a lot of good stuff came out of it. But the 2 big takeaways for us was: don't have another service interruption like you did in Mexico; and make sure that you're being cautious on the guidance that you're giving and don't wear rose-colored glasses, tell it like it is."

And José as you know, is President and Executive Representative of Kansas City's Southern to Mexico.
Please move to Slide 4 for a quick overview of the second quarter results. As you saw in our press release earlier this morning, our revenues for the quarter declined 3% versus last year, excluding foreign exchange and lower U.S. fuel prices, we would have seen an increase in revenue of approximately 2%.
Volumes were unchanged compared to last year. Second quarter operating ratio was 61.3% [ph] , which included the impact of the Mexican fuel excise tax credit of $34 million, recognized in the second quarter. And this reflects the benefit for both the first and second quarter impact of the fuel excise tax credit.
Service continued to be impacted by flooding in Texas during the quarter, or I shouldn't say continued, but we did have flooding disruptions in the first quarter as you will recall, and severe weather and flooding during the second quarter, south of Houston, affected our network and our cost as well. Jeff Songer will have more to say about that in his portion of the presentation.
I would to circle back and make a couple of quick comments about the operating ratio for the quarter. And this Mexican fuel excise tax, which I realize is probably not well understood out in the analyst community. Mike will cover this in much greater detail in a few minutes, but before anyone jumps to an incorrect conclusion about a new normal for our operating ratio, I do want to emphasize that the $34 million credit is retroactive to January 1, 2016. So it covers both the first and second quarter. 
While our recorded operating ratio was 61.3%, adjusting out the 6% [ph] improvement over prior year, for those quarter impact would have resulted in an operating ratio that would have been approximately 300 basis points higher than we reported, but still more than 350 basis point improvement from last year.
We expect this benefit to continue through 2016. Looking beyond 2016, the ongoing impact of this excise tax credit, coupled with a longer term impact of Mexican energy market the regulation, is difficult to quantify, because it will be influenced by many factors, most importantly, the market price of diesel fuel and the level [indiscernible] of Mexican excise tax.
Again, Mike will have much more detailed explanation in a few minutes, and we'll be happy to undertake questions on this point of the end of the presentation.
With that, I'll will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer."

Dwells for the quarter of 21 8 hours was a 7.2% improvement over prior year. Solid operating performance in the quarter, despite continued weather-related operations, which I will discuss, enabled improvements in our key operating metrics, and we have stabilized our operation well over the past 3 quarters.
Moving to the operations overview on Slide 8, we continue to aggressively manage resources. Primarily, 7% of the U.S. T&E workforce is in furlough status and 15% of our local motors across the system are in storage. 
Providing an update on other cost initiatives, our fuel management programs have provided approximately $3 million in reduced cost year-to-date to improved fuel efficiencies. 
As presented in the first quarter, our fuel optimization program is well underway. We're approximately 1/3 complete with the plane [ph] installation for 2016, where we are installing on approximately 20% of the U.S. road fleet. Expanding upon this initiative in the second half of the year, we will begin similar work in Mexico related to fuel optimization technologies. We plan to deploy this technology across the similar number of our Mexico road fleet through 2017.
Automatic engine start stop or AESS technology is another area of focus in our fuel management efforts. While we employ this technology today, future work in this area, including expanding use in the locomotives, upgrading to newer technologies and work rules related to engine start stop procedures will aid in our fuel efficiency management.
With respect to labor management, recruits [ph] are another key metric we have been focused on. In the second quarter, we achieved a 49% reduction in recruits [ph] and here to date, we have reduced overall U.S. and Mexico recruits by 42%.
Our capital projects highlights for the quarter focus on our expansion of San Luis Potosi, in support of the announcements you have seen regarding the new BMW and Ford automotive plants as well as the WTC and Watco fluids terminal.
We are currently in the design phase of further capacity expansions in the San Luis Potosi area including multiple new and support tracks built at our interparts [ph] facility as well as support tracks to directly serve the new auto plant. This will ensure that we have adequate capacity through 2018 and 2019 as these facilities come online.
Other major projects at Lazaro and Sasso and mainline siting [ph] capacity projects continue on schedule.
Regarding equipment, our capital for 2016 is focused on multilevel auto equipment and by the end of Q3, we will have received 300 new auto reps. We're also adding a new Grain & Intermodal equipments to support those segments.
Turning to Slide 9, I will provide a quick overview of the weather-related service interruption in Rosenburg Texas. 
Similar to the first quarter, we were impacted again this quarter by severe flooding in Texas, which resulted in the outage of a bridge on this trackage rights segment in early June. This line was out of service for 3 weeks in June, and was removed from service again on July 4th, due to additional work required to ensure the safe operation of the bridge. We anticipate the bridge being returned to service later this week.
Our cross-border and grain segments have been impacted by this outage, and we will see some residual impact in Q3 due to the additional work being performed on the bridge.
I would like to recognize once again the Union Pacific and BNSF for their cooperation as we again help each other to maintain the fluidity through the use of reroutes and detours.
I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock."

I will start on Page 11, where you can see our year-over-year revenue was down 3% for the quarter, but up 2% excluding currency and fuel. Our carloads for the quarter were unchanged for the last year. Our chemicals and petroleum business continues to show steady growth, with an 8% volume and 6% revenue increase driven by strength in the petroleum and plastics business. We continue to see this as an area of growth as the plastic manufacturers in the Gulf region continue to ship over domestically and globally.
Industrial and consumer growth was slowing with year-over-year decreases of 4% volume and 6% revenue, respectively. Well the revenue decline primarily driven by softness in our metals and paper segments. These segments continue to experience stiff competition impacted by currency fluctuations and low truck pricing, which we believe to be unsustainable in the long-term. These weakness was somewhat offset by continued strength in our carloads segment.
During Q2, our Ag and Mineral business saw an increase of 9% in carloads and 10% of revenues driven by strength in grain and food products, particularly in the cross-border business. We're definitely seeing the benefit of the additional cars that Jeff spoke of and we have been serving this important business units all year with those additional cars. 
Our overall cross-border business continues to show strong growth of 9% for the quarter, being led by Ag and Mineral business as well as good growth in the Chemical & Petroleum business. More details on our cross-border franchise are included in the appendix on Pages 29 and 30.
Our energy business continues to be negatively impacted by a low coal shipment and volatility in crude. We also continue to see declines in frac sand and tech coal [ph] segments as well. Overall carloads were down 5% and revenue down 16% versus prior year.
Intermodal volumes were down 2%, with revenue decreasing 7% in the quarter, primarily driven by weakness in the overall market and continued competition from trucking and industrial operators. We did see some times this may be starting to abate as several key customers have begun returning portions of their intermodal shipments to KCS. 
As we've mentioned over the last few quarters, our automotive business has been impacted by retooling in several of the plants we service. However, in Q2 we saw an increase in import and export volume in Mexico. This volume increase allow us to shipment volume flat, while several facilities were offline for retooling.
With the mix, our adjusted revenue was off [ph] 7%, but this new import and export volumes are a good sign of the health of the automotive market in Mexico. 
As of June 30, all plants are back online with normal production and we are very pleased with the ramp up volumes we're seeing from new manufacturing sites. KCS is well-positioned to service our automotive customers as they grow their business in this important segment.
From a pricing perspective, we continue to see renewals close positively before pricing come in at mid-single digit level. Intermodal continues to be the market most impacted by truck competition, but we are confident and the value we are providing and this value of manifesting itself volume returns in the railroad from some of our key.
As we've done in previous years, we've included Slide 12 which provides a sequential look for each industry segment. 
As you can see, we have a favorable or unchanged volume projection for about 80% of the business. This includes normal seasonal shipping in intermodal as well as a return on some of our automotive parts business. Given the warm temperatures in the Southwest and Texas, we are also seeing higher coal shipments being planned for the second half of the year.
During Q2, we moved our first import shipments with LPG and refined products in the Mexico. As we discussed previously, we expect to continue to ramp up at the shipments result of the Mexico Energy Reform.
We're also seeing increased exports of fuel for Mexico as well as plastics and soda ash to support these 2 growing industrial segments.
The automotive business continues to grow in Mexico and our customers continue to ask us to do more in creating solutions to support their global manufacturing footprint. By 2020, Mexico will produce over 5.3 million vehicles and import another 900,000. Over 60% of this production will then add since 2010 [ph] .
We will continue to invest in the fluidity and capacity that will allow us to effectively service this important segment.
The Ag and Mineral business will continue to be strong but we'll ship according to its normal seasonality and we believe our industrial and consumer segment will continue to see various competition in both paper and steel business over the next 6 months. 
Overall, we are upbeat about the opportunities in front of us. As Jeff mentioned, we made strategic investments that will prepare us to support the customers' growth strategy as we continue to see the benefit of these investments that we made in capacity and fluidity.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch."

Second quarter carload volume was flat year-over-year and up 5% sequentially.  While reported revenue declined 3%, excluding foreign exchange and fuel price impact from the depreciation of the peso, revenue has actually increased 2% over second quarter 2015. 
Operating ratio improved 680 basis points to 61.3%, has [ph] declined $50 million or 13% as a result of benefits from fuel excise tax credits of $34 million, the favorable impact of foreign exchange and lower fuel prices. I'll cover expense declines in the fuel excise tax credit more fully on the next few slides.
Reported diluted EPS of $1.11, was up 10% over second quarter of 2015 as we benefited from the improved operating ratio, offset by higher interest expense, larger net FX losses from the peso depreciation and lower equity in earnings from Panama Canal Railway. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.22, up 18% from second quarter of 2015.
Moving to Slide 15. During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $34 million fuel excise tax credit for the first half of 2016. Approximately half relating to the first quarter of 2016 and the other half, the second quarter. This credit relates to legislation passed in Mexico, which extends excise tax credit available to transportation companies beyond what has been available for the trucking industry to include the operation of locomotives and other work equipment.
Our fuel prices in Mexico have been nearly doubled what we pay in the U.S. as a result of the excise tax being approximately 40% of the total price paid per gallon in Mexico.
While legislation enacted only includes credits for 2016, the government has publicly stated this intent to migrate to market pricing for fuel by 2018. And accordingly, the company believes it is likely that the government will continue to extend this credit to the railroad industry.
For the full year 2016, we expect fuel excise tax credits to approximate $60 million-plus and $40 million-plus after-tax, depending on fuel usage, the level of excise tax per gallon imposed by the government and foreign exchange.
Finally, the credit is available against both withholding and income taxes, and we currently expect to fully utilize the credit for 2016, but utilization is dependent on various factors that do influence our level of taxable income.
There are no carryforward provisions to realize this excise tax credit in future years, and thus, it must be realized during the calendar year 2016.
Moving to the next slide, Slide 16 reflects estimates of the future foreign-exchange in U.S. fuel rates for the remainder of the year. As you can see, we continue to expect significant downward pressure on revenues as a result of peso depreciation, currently expected to be 14% and 11%, respectively in the third and fourth quarters of 2016.
While third quarter of 2016 is expected to have some downward pressure on revenues as a result of lower year-over-year U.S. fuel prices, based on EIA estimates, we would expect a significant negative impact from lower fuel prices to begin easing in the fourth quarter. As you can see from our second quarter results, the negative impact on revenue of the peso and lower U.S. fuel prices was $28 million and we would expect that to continue in the third quarter. Specifically, for the third quarter 2016, we are now projecting mid-single-digit sequential revenue growth.
Moving to Slide 17, operating expenses declined 13% driven by the $34 million fuel excise tax credit previously mentioned, along with the declines from lower fuel prices and foreign exchange rates.
Incentive compensation was $6 million higher than second quarter of 2015; while depreciation, excluding the lease conversions, was $4 million higher.
During the quarter, we also recorded a receivable for a probable insurance recovery of the incremental flooding-related expenses recognized in March and April, resulting in a $5 million net benefit in the quarter.
Recognition of remaining insurance recoveries would represent a contingent gain and will be recorded when the claim is finally settled, likely during the second half of 2016.
Offsetting that benefit were additional detour costs of $3 million recorded in the second quarter that Jeff discussed earlier, and we would expect those costs to continue in July, as certain routes on the partner railroad are still out of service.
Additionally, we incurred $2 million more in other casualty costs in the second quarter of 2016. For the year, we would expect continued headwinds relative to depreciation, wage inflation, incentive comp, fuel and the detour costs that will be limited to the month of July.
Moving to Slide 18. Compensation and benefits expense increased to $1 million year-over-year. Incentive compensation increased $6 million, and wage inflation contributed to a $3 million increase.  Offsetting those increases were benefits from the depreciating peso and lower U.S. headcount. 
As you can see in the bar charts on the left side of the slide, headcount was flat year-over-year and declined 1% from the first quarter of 2016, despite a 5% sequential increase in our carload volumes.
On Slide 19, fuel expenses declined $16 million or 21% from second quarter 2015 due to lower fuel prices and the depreciating peso. Increases in tonnage contributed to a $2 million increase in fuel, while efficiency provided a $1 million benefit to fuel expense. 
And finally, on Slide 20, our capital structure priorities, continue to focus on investing in the business to generate the best growth in the rail sector.
In fact, despite the downturn in the industrial economy in the last 18 months, we have grown our volumes 17% since 2007, while the rest of the class loan [ph] industry has declined 10% on an aggregate basis.
We will continue to focus on reinvesting our cash flow back into growing our business in the long run.
Projected capital expenditures for the year continued to be in the range of $580 million to $590 million.
In May of 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a $500-million share repurchase program and about halfway through the life of the program, we have repurchased 51% of our outstanding shares in an average of $88.46. We will continue to monitor economic and business conditions to determine future levels of share repurchases.
And finally, during the quarter, we pre-funded our $250 million of floating rate note due on October, 2016 at 3.125% for a 10-year term. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Pat."

And second, I want to make a few comments about the man",685,"Thanks, Mike. Before I open the call up for questions, I'd like to do a few things in my closing comments. 
First, I'd like to offer a quick overall assessment of the quarter in the current outlook. And second, I want to make a few comments about the management transition that is underway here at KCS in the last years or so. 
Regarding the second quarter performance assessment, we feel very good about our performance for the quarter. And more importantly, we feel good about the overall outlook for the rest of the year. As Brian discussed, our business volumes have showed sequential growth over the last 3 months, and the short term outlook for the vast majority of our business is either neutral or positive.
We are also very pleased to have demonstrated solid cost control despite unusually high detour expenses and demonstrate operating ratio improvements even excluding the excise tax credit in the absence of volume growth.
Regarding the management transition. I'm sure that you've all noticed that Dave Starling is not on the call with us today. And you may also recall that I became President and CEO effective July 1, 2016. Dave will continue on as an adviser to me until the end of this year, and then, will continue on as a member of our Board of Directors until May of next year.
It would be hard for me to overstate the remarkable accomplishments and progress that KCS made under Dave's 8 years as President, and 6 years as CEO. And I'm very grateful that Dave has agreed to continue on in this advisory capacity and intend to use his counsel to assure that this transition continues to be as smooth as it possibly can.
I'm very fortunate to have become CEO at a time when this company has never been in better physical and financial condition than it is right now. Over the last 8 years, KCS operating ratio has improved by more than 12 full points. Since 2010, our earnings per share has more than doubled and our market value has almost doubled. As a result of debt repayment and refinancings undertaken since becoming investment grade in 2013, are combined with our overall low leve of interest rates, KCS today has the lowest average interest cost on our debt than any other Class 1 railroad. In spite of recent pressures on business volumes and weak outlook for the overall economy, we continue to focus on cost control, and that has resulted in an improvement in cash flow and profitability.
As for the future and longer term trends. I am doubly fortunate to not only be the CEO of a financially and physically strong company, but one which I truly believe is at the threshold of an exciting growth opportunities.
There's a tremendous amount of new industrial development activity taking place in our network at this moment and these investments should drive our growth in the years ahead. 
All across our network, we are seeing new investments in auto plants, intermodal terminals, ethylene refineries, green elevators, just to name a few. Our relationship with the other railroads in North America are very strong. This an important factor, because our ability to achieve our full growth depends in our ability to offer customer service options into markets that we don't serve directly.
By virtue of our relationships and effective interchange with all of the other carriers, we are in the position to do that. As you've seen in the last 2 quarters as well, the relationship we had with other rail carriers is also very important in our ability to provide continue service options when we are hit by weather and other factors on our own line.
And finally, we have a great team of talented and dedicated employees at all levels of the organization. From a talent perspective, I feel we are very well against our larger railroad counterparts and have great confidence in this team's ability to lead KCS to even higher performance levels in the years ahead.
With that, we'll be happy to take a few questions."

And after the credit, it effectively gets you back to a price per gallon that's roughly the same as what we are paying in the U.S. And while the legislation was only enacted for 2016, we believe sitting here today, that this practice would continue as the country moves to its stated goal of getting to market pricing. And so we can't say that for certain for 2017, but we believe that will be the case and therefore, kind of resets the bar in terms of what our cost per gallon is in Mexico."

So it's a bit difficult to predict. And with respect to your fuel surcharge question. I mean, this program has really kind of put us on equal footing with the trucking industry, and we're already pricing at market in Mexico. So we'll see how all that plays out. But we don't think there's going to be any significant impact. One last comment, this credit also applies to work equipment on our railroad, which really has nothing to do with holding those freight for customers. It is subject to generating enough taxable income to get the offset. It's dependent on a variety of other factors that they could move that credit up or down a little bit. So -- but that's general way -- were would net out on this kind of a resetting of our price per gallon that we're paying."

There are other projects similar to the Watco WTC that we've mentioned before. The Rangeland announcement, some of the LPG work this team done. I would say there are probably right now about 6 or 7 major projects, primarily around storage and distribution, that's kind of the key. And making sure that you're tied into the appropriate type of source from a refinery perspective. And so when you think about what that will mean in the future, will all depend on winning those projects or able to be ticked off. Several of them, the Howard Energy project is already moving forward. So there are a number of projects already moving forward, but I would say based on that timing, it's probably the best way to look at. And right now much of that is uncertain. But again, this last quarter, we moved our first loads into Mexico for both refined products and LPG, and we think that, that will continue from a ramp up perspective through the end of 2016 and to 2017, preparing for the open market pricing of 2018.

So those exports can go both North America and then as I mentioned, we're seeing significant growth out of Lazaro and Veracruz.

Jeff mentioned, we're building significant infrastructure from a capacity perspective for Ford and BMW. Those dates have already been announced in 2018 and 2019.

The situation that exists today is that Mexico fuel prices are artificially high compared to world market prices.

It is the intermodal segment that everybody has talked about for the last 2 years. We continue to believe that, that capacity, at some point, will start to wane based on pricing, what typically happens as price gets too low for those smaller pieces of capacity to stay in the market. And then people return back also, there's a service component that a lot of people prefer that sometimes they don't get in that cheaper capacity. So we believe that's going to continue to be a market -- we have to stay very close to in intermodal, it's a critical part of our business, but it's still going to see significant competition. The second piece would be in our industrial consumer business, which is primarily that paper and steel. Now when you have a currency fluctuation, paper from Mexico becomes cheaper than paper in the U.S. Of those facilities would use that local paper. It would be hauled potentially by a trucking company versus because of the shorter haul. So that's the competition you see. It's not only the cheaper paper, but then, the cheaper capacity. We don't think that's sustainable. In the past, you've seen companies go through this cyclicality,  if you will, of this type of market. But again, we are going to continue to see it in those 2 segments. Otherwise, we feel very comfortable that we're more than competitive and creating a value to our customers where, again, I think in the auto parts and some other where that volume is returning, on where is it last year and we spoke about that in our comments then. We see that now coming back to the rail because of the consistency of the service that Jeff talked about."

But as you know, going back to 2014 or maybe before that, the then new Penanato [ph] administration embarked on a very broad-based energy market reform agenda. And that included production, generation, consumption. It was pretty much across all sectors of the energy market. And prior to that and prior to this clarification on the excise tax, the price of the diesel fuel, gasoline, other consumer products in Mexico was set by the government and by PEMEX. It wasn't a world market price. So we are migrating toward, and that was a very clear path, the detailed kind of longer term, 3 to 4-year path, to get to full market energy reform. So this is a bit of a tack on, if you would, it's probably not the best way to use to that energy market deregulation that has been in motion for a couple of years now. We think that's why we're confident that while it's unclear that this excise tax credit will be available in 2017, when we put it in the overall context of the broader market deregulation, energy market deregulation, it would be a bit illogical to think that they would repeal this or remove this in 2018 or 2017. And then once we get to 2018, the energy market, the prices we pay for diesel, the fuel surcharge, all of that is basically potentially identical to what we have in the United States.

With me for today's presentation are Jeff Songer, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Brian Hancock, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Upchurch, Chief Financial Officer. José Zozaya is on the phone to help us with questions. And José,  as you know, is President and Executive Representative of Kansas City's Southern to Mexico.
Please move to Slide 4 for a quick overview of the second quarter results. As you saw on our press release earlier this morning, our revenues for the quarter declined 3% versus last year. Excluding foreign exchange and lower U.S. fuel prices, we would have seen an increase in revenue of approximately 2%. Volumes were unchanged compared to last year. Second quarter operating ratio was 61.3%, which included the impact of the Mexican fuel excise tax credit of $34 million recognized in the second quarter. And this reflects the benefit for both the first and second quarter impact of the fuel excise tax credit. Service continued to be impacted by flooding in Texas during the quarter, or I shouldn't say continued, but we did have flooding disruptions in the first quarter as you will recall. And severe weather and flooding during the second quarter, south of Houston, affected our network and our cost as well. Jeff Songer will have more to say about that in his portion of the presentation.
I want to circle back and make a couple of quick comments about the operating ratio for the quarter, and this Mexican fuel excise tax, which, I realize, is probably not well understood out in the analyst community. Mike will cover this in much greater detail in a few minutes. But before anyone jumps to an incorrect conclusion about a new normal for our operating ratio, I do want to emphasize that the $34 million credit is retroactive to January 1, 2016, so it covers both the first and second quarter. 
While our recorded operating ratio was 61.3%, adjusting out the first quarter impact would have resulted in an operating ratio that would have been approximately 300 basis points higher than we reported, but still more than a 350 basis point improvement from last year. We expect this benefit to continue through 2016. 
Looking beyond 2016, the ongoing impact of this excise tax credit, coupled with the longer-term impact of Mexican energy market deregulation, is difficult to quantify because it will be influenced by many factors, most importantly, the market price of diesel fuel and the level of Mexican excise tax. Again, Mike will have much more detailed explanation in a few minutes, and we'll be happy to entertain questions on this point of the end of the presentation.
With that, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer."

Dwell for the quarter of 21.8 hours was a 7.2% improvement over prior year. Solid operating performance in the quarter despite continued weather-related interruptions, which I will discuss, enabled improvements in our key operating metrics. And we have stabilized our operation well over the past 3 quarters.
Moving to the operations overview on Slide 8. We continue to aggressively manage resources. Currently, 7% of the U.S. T&E workforce is in furlough status and 15% of our locomotives across the system are in storage. 
Providing an update on other cost initiatives, our fuel management programs have provided approximately $3 million in reduced cost year-to-date to improved fuel efficiencies. As presented in the first quarter, our fuel optimization program is well underway. We are approximately 1/3 complete with the planned installation for 2016, where we are installing on approximately 20% of the U.S. road fleet. Expanding upon this initiative in the second half of the year, we will begin similar work in Mexico related to fuel optimization technologies. We plan to deploy this technology across the similar number of our Mexico road fleet through 2017.
Automatic engine start stop, or AESS technology is another area of focus in our fuel management efforts. While we employ this technology today, future work in this area, including the expanding use in yard locomotives, upgrading to newer technologies and signing up the work rules related to engine start stop procedures will aid in our fuel efficiency management.
With respect to labor management, recrews are another key metric we have been focused on. In the second quarter, we achieved a 49% reduction in recrews. And year-to-date, we have reduced overall U.S. and Mexico recrews by 42%.
Our capital projects highlights for the quarter focus on our expansion of San Luis Potosi in support of the announcements you have seen regarding the new BMW and Ford automotive plants as well as the WTC and Watco fluids terminal. We're currently in the design phase of further capacity expansions in the San Luis Potosi area, including multiple new support tracks built at our Interpuerto facility as well as support tracks to directly serve the new auto plants. This will ensure we have adequate capacity through 2018 and 2019 as these facilities come online.
Other major projects at Lazaro and Sasol, and mainline siding capacity projects continue on schedule.
Regarding equipment, our capital for 2016 is focused on multilevel auto equipment and by the end of Q3, we will have received 300 new auto racks. We are also adding new Grain & Intermodal equipment to support those segments.
Turning to Slide 9, I will provide a quick overview of the weather-related service interruption in Rosenberg Texas. Similar to the first quarter, we were impacted again this quarter by severe flooding in Texas, which resulted in the outage of a bridge on this trackage rights segment in early June. This line was out of service for 3 weeks in June and was removed from service again on July 4 due to additional work required to ensure the safe operation of the bridge. We anticipate the bridge being returned to service later this week. Our cross-border and grain segments have been impacted by this outage, and we will see some residual impact in Q3 due to the additional work being performed on the bridge.
I would like to recognize once again the Union Pacific and BNSF for their cooperation as we again help each other to maintain fluidity through the use of reroutes and detours.
I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock."

Our Chemic",866,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I will start on Page 11, where you can see our year-over-year revenue was down 3% for the quarter, but up 2% excluding currency and fuel. Our carloads for the quarter were unchanged versus last year. Our Chemical & Petroleum business continues to show steady growth with an 8% volume and 6% revenue increase driven by strength in the petroleum and plastics business. We continue to see this as an area of growth as the plastics manufacturers in the Gulf region continue to ship, both domestically and globally.
Industrial & Consumer growth is slowing with year-over-year decreases of 4% volume and 6% revenue, respectively with the revenue decline primarily driven by softness in our metals and paper segments. These segments continue to experience stiff competition impacted by currency fluctuations and low truck pricing, which we believe to be unsustainable in the long term. This weakness was somewhat offset by continued strength in our other carloads segment.
During Q2, our Ag and Mineral business saw an increase of 9% in carloads and 10% of revenue driven by strength in grain and food products, particularly in the cross-border business. We're definitely seeing the benefit of the additional cars that Jeff spoke of, and we have been serving this important business unit all year with those additional cars. 
Our overall cross-border business continues to show strong growth of 9% for the quarter, being led by Ag and Mineral business as well as good growth in the Chemical & Petroleum business. More details on our cross-border franchise are included in the appendix on Pages 29 and 30.
Our Energy business continues to be negatively impacted by low coal shipments and volatility in crude. We also continue to see declines in frac sand and pet coke segments as well. Overall carloads were down 5% and revenue down 16% versus prior year.
Intermodal volumes were down 2% with revenue decreasing 7% in the quarter, primarily driven by weakness in the overall market and continued competition from trucking and new vessel operators. We did see some time, this might be starting to abate as several key customers have begun returning portions of their intermodal shipments to KCS. 
As we've mentioned over the last few quarters, our Automotive business has been impacted by retooling at several of the plants we service. However, in Q2, we saw an increase in import and export volume in Mexico. This volume increase allowed us to hold shipment volume flat, while several facilities were offline for retooling.
Due to the mix, our adjusted revenue was off 7%, but these new import and export volumes are good sign of the health of the automotive market in Mexico. As of June 30, all plants are back online with normal production and we are very pleased with the ramp-up volumes we're seeing from new manufacturing sites. KCS is well positioned to service our automotive customers as they grow their business in this important segment.
From a pricing perspective, we continue to see renewals close as positively before pricing come in at mid-single-digit level. Intermodal continues to be the market segment most impacted by truck competition, but we're confident in the value we're providing, and this value is manifesting itself as volume returns to the railroad from some of our key constituents.
As we have done in previous years, we've included Slide 12, which provides a sequential look for each industry segment. As you can see, we have a favorable or unchanged volume projection for about 86% of the business. This includes normal seasonal shipping in intermodal as well as a return of some of our automotive parts business. Given the warm temperatures in the Southwest and Texas, we're also seeing higher coal shipments being planned for the second half of the year.
During Q2, we moved our first import shipments of LPG and refined products in Mexico. As we discussed previously, we expect to continue the ramp-up of these shipments as a result of the Mexico Energy Reform. We're also seeing increased exports of fuel oil for Mexico as well as increase in plastics and soda ash to support these 2 growing industrial segments.
The Automotive business continues to grow in Mexico and our customers continue to ask us to do more in creating solutions to support their global manufacturing footprint. By 2020, Mexico will produce over 5.3 million vehicles and import another 900,000. Over 60% of this production will then add through 2010. We will continue to invest in the fluidity and capacity that will allow us to effectively service this important segment.
The Ag and Minerals business will continue to be strong, but we'll ship according to its normal seasonality. And we believe our Industrial & Consumer segment will continue to see various competition in both paper and steel business over the next 6 months. 
Overall, we're upbeat about the opportunities in front of us. As Jeff mentioned, we're making strategic investments, which will prepare us to support the customers' growth strategies as we continue to see the benefits of these investments that we made in capacity and fluidity.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch."

I'm going to start my commentary on Slide 14. Second quarter carload volume was flat year-over-year and up 5% sequentially.

Second quarter carload volume was flat year-over-year and up 5% sequentially.  While reported revenue declined 3%, excluding foreign exchange and fuel price impacts from the depreciation of the peso, revenue has actually increased 2% over second quarter 2015. 
Operating ratio improved 680 basis points to 61.3%. Cost declined $50 million or 13% as a result of benefits from fuel excise tax credits of $34 million, the favorable impact of foreign exchange and lower fuel prices. I'll cover expense declines in the fuel excise tax credit more fully on the next few slides.
Reported diluted EPS of $1.11 was up 10% over second quarter of 2015 as we benefited from the improved operating ratio offset by higher interest expense, larger net FX losses from the peso depreciation and lower equity in earnings from Panama Canal Railway. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.22, up 18% from second quarter of 2015.
Moving to Slide 15. During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $34 million fuel excise tax credit for the first half of 2016, approximately half relating to the first quarter of 2016 and the other half, the second quarter. This credit relates to legislation passed in Mexico, which extends excise tax credits available to transportation companies beyond what has been available for the trucking industry to include the operation of locomotives and other work equipment.
Our fuel prices in Mexico have been nearly double what we pay in the U.S. as a result of the excise tax being approximately 40% of the total price paid per gallon in Mexico. While legislation enacted only includes credits for 2016, the government has publicly stated its intent to migrate to market pricing for fuel by 2018. And accordingly, the company believes it is likely that the government will continue to extend this credit to the railroad industry.
For the full year 2016, we expect fuel excise tax credits to approximate $60 million-plus and $40 million-plus after-tax, depending on fuel usage, the level of excise tax per gallon imposed by the government and foreign exchange.
Finally, the credit is available against both withholding and income taxes. And we currently expect to fully utilize the credit for 2016, but utilization is dependent on various factors that do influence our level of taxable income. There are no carryforward provisions to realize this excise tax credit in future years. And thus, it must be realized during the calendar year 2016.
Moving to the next slide. Slide 16 reflects estimates of the future foreign exchange in U.S. fuel rates for the remainder of the year. As you can see, we continue to expect significant downward pressure on revenues as a result of peso depreciation, currently expected to be 14% and 11%, respectively, in the third and fourth quarters of 2016.
While third quarter of 2016 is expected to have some downward pressure on revenues as a result of lower year-over-year U.S. fuel prices, based on EIA estimates, we would expect a significant negative impact from lower fuel prices to begin easing in the fourth quarter. As you can see from our second quarter results, the negative impact on revenue of the peso and lower U.S. fuel prices was $28 million, and we would expect that to continue in the third quarter. Specifically, for the third quarter 2016, we're now projecting mid-single-digit sequential revenue growth.
Moving to Slide 17. Operating expenses declined 13% driven by the $34 million fuel excise tax credit previously mentioned, along with the declines from lower fuel prices and foreign exchange rates. Incentive compensation was $6 million higher than second quarter of 2015, while depreciation, excluding the lease conversions, was $4 million higher.
During the quarter, we also recorded a receivable for a probable insurance recovery of the incremental flooding-related expenses recognized in March and April, resulting in a $5 million net benefit in the quarter. Recognition of remaining insurance recoveries would represent a contingent gain and will be recorded when the claim is finally settled, likely during the second half of 2016.
Offsetting that benefit were additional detour cost of $3 million recorded in the second quarter that Jeff discussed earlier, and we would expect those costs to continue in July, as certain routes on a partner railroad are still out of service. Additionally, we incurred $2 million more in other casualty cost in the second quarter of 2016. 
For the year, we would expect continued headwinds relative to depreciation, wage inflation, incentive comp, fuel and the detour costs that will be limited to the month of July.
Moving to Slide 18. Compensation and benefits expense increased $1 million year-over-year, incentive compensation increased $6 million and wage inflation contributed to a $3 million increase.  Offsetting those increases were benefits from the depreciating peso and lower U.S. headcount. As you can see in the bar charts on the left side of the slide, headcount was flat year-over-year and declined 1% from the first quarter of 2016 despite a 5% sequential increase in our carload volumes.
On Slide 19, fuel expenses declined $16 million or 21% from second quarter 2015 due to lower fuel prices and the depreciating peso. Increases in tonnage contributed to a $2 million increase in fuel, while efficiency provided a $1 million benefit to fuel expense. 
And finally, on Slide 20, our capital structure priorities continue to focus on investing in the business to generate the best growth in the rail sector. In fact, despite the downturn in the industrial economy in the last 18 months, we have grown our volumes 17% since 2007, while the rest of the Class I industry has declined 10% on an aggregate basis. We will continue to focus on reinvesting our cash flow back into growing our business for the long run. Projected capital expenditures for the year continue to be in the range of $580 million to $590 million.
In May of 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program and about halfway through the life of the program, we have repurchased 51% of our outstanding shares in an average of $88.46. We will continue to monitor economic and business conditions to determine future levels of share repurchases.
And finally, during the quarter, we prefunded our $250 million of floating rate note due in October of 2016 at 3.125% for a 10-year term. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Pat."

First, I'd like to offer a quick overall assessment of the quarter in the current outlook. And second, I want to make a few comments about the management transition that is done underway here at KCS for the last year or so. 
Regarding the second quarter performance assessment, we feel very good about our performance for the quarter. And more importantly, we feel good about the overall outlook for the rest of the year. As Brian discussed, our business volumes have shown sequential growth for the last 3 months. And the short-term outlook for the vast majority of our business is either neutral or positive.
We're also very pleased to have demonstrated solid cost control despite unusually high detour expenses and demonstrate operating ratio improvements even excluding the excise tax credit in the absence of volume growth.
Regarding the management transition, I'm sure that you've all noticed that Dave Starling is not on the call with us today. And you may also recall that I became President and CEO effective July 1, 2016. Dave will continue on as an adviser to me until the end of this year and then will continue on as a member of our Board of Directors until May of next year.
It would be hard for me to overstate the remarkable accomplishments and progress that KCS made under Dave's 8 years as President and 6 years as CEO. I'm very grateful that Dave has agreed to continue on in this advisory capacity. I intend to use his counsel to assure that this transition continues to be as smooth as it possibly can.
I'm very fortunate to have become CEO at a time when this company has never been in better physical and financial condition than it is right now. Over the last 8 years, KCS operating ratio has improved by more than 12 full points. Since 2010, our earnings per share have more than doubled and our market value has almost doubled. As a result of debt repayments and refinancings undertaken since becoming investment grade in 2013, our -- combined with the overall low level of interest rates, KCS today has the lowest average interest cost on our debt than any other Class 1 railroad. In spite of recent pressures on business volumes and weak outlook for the overall economy, we continue to focus on cost control, and that has resulted in improvement in cash flow and profitability.
As for the future and longer-term trends, I am doubly fortunate to not only be CEO of a financially and physically strong company, but one which I truly believe is at the threshold of exciting growth opportunities.
There's a tremendous amount of new industrial development activity taking place on our network at this moment, and these investments should drive our growth in the years ahead. All across our network, we're seeing new investments in auto plants, intermodal terminals, ethylene refineries, grain elevators, just to name a few. Our relationship with the other railroads in North America are very strong. This an important factor because our ability to achieve our full growth depends on our ability to offer customer service options into markets that we don't serve directly. By virtue of our relationships and effective interchange with all of the other carriers, we're in a position to do that. As you've seen in the last 2 quarters as well, the relationship we have with the other rail carriers is also very important in our ability to provide continuous service options when we are hit by weather and other factors on our own line.
And finally, we have a great team of talented and dedicated employees at all levels of the organization. From a talent perspective, I feel we stack up very well against our larger railroad counterparts and have great confidence in this team's ability to lead KCS to even higher performance levels in the years ahead.
With that, we'll be happy to take a few questions."

And after the credit, it effectively gets you back to a price per gallon that's roughly the same as what we're paying in the U.S. And while the legislation was only enacted for 2016, we believe, sitting here today, that this practice would continue as the country moves to its stated goal of getting to market pricing. And so we can't say that for certain for 2017, but we believe that, that will be the case and therefore, kind of resets the bar in terms of what our cost per gallon is in Mexico."

And we're already pricing at market in Mexico, so we'll see how all that plays out. But we don't think there's going to be any significant impact. One last comment, this credit also applies to work equipment on our railroad, which really has nothing to do with holding of freight for customers. It is subject to generating enough taxable income to get the offset. It's dependent on a variety of other factors. They could move that credit up or down a little bit.

What I would tell you is Mexico Energy Reform is really -- there's a number of different pieces where we can play. There's obviously -- just from a base perspective, people are going to put pipelines into Mexico, so we will be hauling pipe. There are other projects similar to the Watco WTC that we've mentioned before, the Rangeland announcement, some of the LPG work that's being done. I would tell you there are probably, right now, about 6 or 7 major projects, primarily around storage and distribution. That's kind of the key and making sure that you're tied into the appropriate type of source from a refinery perspective. And so when you think about what that will mean in the future, it will all depend on winning those projects or able to be kicked off. Several of them, the Howard Energy project is already moving forward, and so there are a number of projects already moving forward. But I tell you, based on that timing, it's probably the best way to look at. And right now, much of that is uncertain. But again, this last quarter, we moved our first loads into Mexico for both refined products and LPG. And we think that, that will continue from a ramp-up perspective through the end of 2016 and to 2017, preparing for the open market pricing of 2018. And so as to when, what month, what quarter, that's going to be very, very difficult to look at. But there are at least 6 to 7 projects that are significant on our line."

What I would tell you is, I think we feel very, very comfortable that we've come through the retooling in conjunction with our partners, and everyone did exactly what they were supposed to do. We feel, like I said in my prepared comments, very comfortable that both the export and import volumes are going to be higher than what we thought they would be when we began the year. We're keeping a close watch on consumption, especially in North America. So U.S. and Canada, about 86% of the vehicles are exported, 14% of them are for Mexico consumption. So those exports can go both North America. And then as I mentioned, we're seeing significant growth out of Lazaro and Veracruz. So from a specific brand, specific customer, what I would tell you is I think we continue to be asked to do more, develop different kinds of solutions and we continue to believe that will go on probably into the next 3 or 4 years as some of these plants come on. As Jeff mentioned, we're building significant infrastructure from a capacity perspective for Ford and BMW. Those dates have already been announced in 2018 and 2019. But we continue to believe that manufacturing of automobiles in Mexico is going to be strong simply because of the export market that they support. And so we believe we have great models that our customers have put down into Mexico. The quality is good, and so we don't see a significant downturn. And that will continue as far as we can go forward. Basically, if you're talking about specific brands though, we really can't provide that based on each one of their consumption and the way they think about their manufacturing footprint as to what will drive that.

So we've got a little bit of time to react, and I think we've done a good job with that. On the crew side in Mexico, again, getting back to the 2015 hiring we did, we believe that puts us in good shape and continues. That's probably why you haven't seen the year-over-year numbers decrease to fully recognize what we've done on the U.S. side with reductions. But you are in place, and we've done a good job of staying in front of the hiring this year in Mexico to provide that additional capacity. So right now, no concerns right now.

It is the Intermodal segment that everybody has talked about for the last 2 years. We continue to believe that, that capacity at some point will start to wane based on pricing. What typically happens is if the price gets too low for those smaller pieces of capacity to stay in the market, and then people return back. Also, there's a service component that a lot of people prefer that sometimes they don't get in that cheaper capacity. So we believe that's going to continue to be a market. We have to stay very close to Intermodal. It's a critical part of our business. But it's still going to see significant competition.
The second piece would be in our Industrial Consumer business, which is primarily that paper and steel. Now, when you have a currency fluctuation, paper from Mexico becomes cheaper than paper in the U.S. Those facilities down there would use that local paper. It would be hauled potentially by a trucking company versus rail because of the shorter haul. So that's the competition you see. It's not only the cheaper paper, but then the cheaper capacity. We don't think that's sustainable. In the past, you've seen companies go through this cyclicality,  if you will, of this type of market. But, again, we're going to continue to see it in those 2 segments.
Otherwise, we feel very comfortable that we're more than competitive in creating a value for our customers where, again, I think in the auto parts and some other where that volume is returning on where it left last year, and we spoke about that in our comments then.

And then, I might ask José Zozaya to provide some commentary here as well.
But as you know, going back to 2014 or maybe before that, the then new Peña Nieto administration embarked on a very broad-based energy market reform agenda and that included production, generation, consumption. It was pretty much across all sectors of the energy market. And prior to that and prior to this clarification on the excise tax, the price of diesel fuel, gasoline and other consumer products in Mexico was set by the government and by PEMEX. It wasn't a world market price. So we are migrating toward. And there was a very clear path, a detailed kind of longer term, 3- to 4-year path to get to full market energy reform. So this is a bit of a tack on, if you would. It's probably not the best way to use to that energy market deregulation that has been in motion for a couple of years now. We think that's why we're confident that while it's unclear that this excise tax credit will be available in 2017, when we put it in the overall context of the broader market deregulation, energy market deregulation, it would be a bit illogical to think that they would repeal this or remove this in 2018 or 2017. And then, once we get to 2018, the energy market, the price that we pay for diesel, the fuel surcharge, all of that is basically going to be potentially identical to what we have in the United States.
José, I don't know if you want to provide any more color commentary about the government's agenda here."

Intermodal, obviously, in the retail and carload business, the appliance business, they are very heavily-weighted sometimes towards the back end of the year as consumers start to spend money for the holidays and things like that.

I would say I think from a neutral outlook, it means that we believe what we thought was going to happen is going to happen. And so we feel very comfortable in that space from an Intermodal perspective.
The change that was made out of Lazaro and into -- from a vessel perspective, I think, was more driven by a change in the way that, that particular organization is thinking about their cost structure and the recuperation of their fixed cost. I think it's -- you can see that it's a market where variable pricing has come into account. And so it's a great piece of business that is moving. But we also believe, based on the factors that we're seeing at least in the market, it's not going to have an impact on us to the point where it's a very significant phase. And if we're correct in the way they're looking at pricing, then we're pretty sure that volume will return as economic changes occur and the customers need that freight where it's been coming for the last few years.
So we feel like there is absolutely a significant change going on in the vessel environment. There's also a significant change in the trucking environment. But we're starting to get through that and see how this thing is going to play out over time, and we're comfortable that we're positioned well. And like I said, we're not going to chase the lowest cost methodology of the day because there's a lot of people trying to make up for things, and we're not just going to chase that volume. We have a very specific value set."

With me for today's presentation are Jeff Songer, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Brian Hancock, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Upchurch, Chief Financial Officer. José Zozaya is on the phone to help us with questions. And José,  as you know, is President and Executive Representative of Kansas City Southern de Mexico.
Please move to Slide 4 for a quick overview of the second quarter results. As you saw on our press release earlier this morning, our revenues for the quarter declined 3% versus last year. Excluding foreign exchange and lower U.S. fuel prices, we would have seen an increase in revenue of approximately 2%. Volumes were unchanged compared to last year. Second quarter operating ratio was 61.3%, which included the impact of the Mexican fuel excise tax credit of $34 million recognized in the second quarter. And this reflects the benefit for both the first and second quarter impact of the fuel excise tax credit. Service continued to be impacted by flooding in Texas during the quarter, or I shouldn't say continued, but we did have flooding disruptions in the first quarter as you will recall. And severe weather and flooding during the second quarter, south of Houston, affected our network and our cost as well. Jeff Songer will have more to say about that in his portion of the presentation.
I want to circle back and make a couple of quick comments about the operating ratio for the quarter, and this Mexican fuel excise tax, which, I realize, is probably not well understood out in the analyst community. Mike will cover this in much greater detail in a few minutes. But before anyone jumps to an incorrect conclusion about a new normal for our operating ratio, I do want to emphasize that the $34 million credit is retroactive to January 1, 2016, so it covers both the first and second quarter. 
While our reported operating ratio was 61.3%, adjusting out the first quarter impact would have resulted in an operating ratio that would have been approximately 300 basis points higher than we reported, but still more than a 350 basis point improvement from last year. We expect this benefit to continue through 2016. 
Looking beyond 2016, the ongoing impact of this excise tax credit, coupled with the longer-term impact of Mexican energy market deregulation, is difficult to quantify because it will be influenced by many factors, most importantly, the market price of diesel fuel and the level of the Mexican excise tax. Again, Mike will have much more detailed explanation in a few minutes, and we will be happy to entertain questions on this point at the end of the presentation.
With that, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer."

Dwell for the quarter of 21.8 hours was a 7.2% improvement over prior year. Solid operating performance in the quarter despite continued weather-related interruptions, which I will discuss, enabled improvements in our key operating metrics. And we have stabilized our operation well over the past 3 quarters.
Moving to the operations overview on Slide 8. We continue to aggressively manage resources. Currently, 7% of the U.S. T&E workforce is in furlough status and 15% of our locomotives across the system are in storage. 
Providing an update on other cost initiatives, our fuel management programs have provided approximately $3 million in reduced cost year-to-date through improved fuel efficiencies. As presented in the first quarter, our fuel optimization program is well underway. We are approximately 1/3 complete with the planned installation for 2016, where we are installing on approximately 20% of the U.S. road fleet. Expanding upon this initiative in the second half of the year, we will begin similar work in Mexico related to fuel optimization technologies. We plan to deploy this technology across the similar number of our Mexico road fleet through 2017.
Automatic engine start stop, or AESS technology is another area of focus in our fuel management efforts. While we employ this technology today, future work in this area, including the expanding use in yard locomotives, upgrading to newer technologies and tightening up the work rules related to engine start stop procedures will aid in our fuel efficiency management.
With respect to labor management, recrews are another key metric we have been focused on. In the second quarter, we achieved a 49% reduction in recrews. And year-to-date, we have reduced overall U.S. and Mexico recrews by 42%.
Our capital project highlights for the quarter focus on our expansion of San Luis Potosi in support of the announcements you have seen regarding the new BMW and Ford automotive plants as well as the WTC and Watco fluids terminal. We're currently in the design phase for further capacity expansions in the San Luis Potosi area, including multiple new support tracks built at our Interpuerto facility as well as support tracks to directly serve the new auto plants. This will ensure we have adequate capacity through 2018 and 2019 as these facilities come online.
Other major projects at Lazaro and Sasol, and mainline siding capacity projects continue on schedule.
Regarding equipment, our capital for 2016 is focused on multilevel auto equipment and by the end of Q3, we will have received 300 new auto racks. We are also adding new Grain & Intermodal equipment to support those segments.
Turning to Slide 9, I will provide a quick overview of the weather-related service interruption in Rosenberg Texas. Similar to the first quarter, we were impacted again this quarter by severe flooding in Texas, which resulted in the outage of a bridge on this trackage rights segment in early June. This line was out of service for 3 weeks in June and was removed from service again on July 4 due to additional work required to ensure the safe operation of the bridge. We anticipate the bridge being returned to service later this week. Our cross-border and grain segments have been impacted by this outage, and we will see some residual impact in Q3 due to the additional work being performed on the bridge.
I would like to recognize once again the Union Pacific and BNSF for their cooperation as we again help each other to maintain fluidity through the use of reroutes and detours.
I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock."

Our carloads for the quarter were unchanged versus last year. Our Chemical & Petroleum business continues to show steady growth with an 8% volume and 6% revenue increase driven by strength in the petroleum and plastics business. We continue to see this as an area of growth as the plastics manufacturers in the Gulf region continue to ship both domestically and globally.
Industrial & Consumer growth is slowing with year-over-year decreases of 4% volume and 6% revenue, respectively with the revenue decline primarily driven by softness in our metals and paper segments. These segments continue to experience stiff competition impacted by currency fluctuations and low truck pricing, which we believe to be unsustainable in the long term. This weakness was somewhat offset by continued strength in our other carloads segment.
During Q2, our Ag and Mineral business saw an increase of 9% in carloads and 10% of revenue driven by strength in grain and food products, particularly in the cross-border business. We're definitely seeing the benefit of the additional cars that Jeff spoke of, and we have been serving this important business unit all year with those additional cars. 
Our overall cross-border business continues to show strong growth of 9% for the quarter, being led by Ag and Mineral business as well as good growth in the Chemical & Petroleum business. More details on our cross-border franchise are included in the appendix on Pages 29 and 30.
Our Energy business continues to be negatively impacted by low coal shipments and volatility in crude. We also continue to see declines in frac sand and pet coke segments as well. Overall carloads were down 5% and revenue down 16% versus prior year.
Intermodal volumes were down 2% with revenue decreasing 7% in the quarter, primarily driven by weakness in the overall market and continued competition from trucking and new vessel operators. We did see some signs this might be starting to abate as several key customers have begun returning portions of their intermodal shipments to KCS. 
As we've mentioned over the last few quarters, our Automotive business has been impacted by retooling at several of the plants we service. However, in Q2, we saw an increase in import and export volume in Mexico. This volume increase allowed us to hold shipment volume flat, while several facilities were offline for retooling.
Due to the mix, our adjusted revenue was off 7%, but these new import and export volumes are a good sign of the health of the automotive market in Mexico. As of June 30, all plants are back online with normal production and we are very pleased with the ramp-up volumes we're seeing from new manufacturing sites. KCS is well positioned to service our automotive customers as they grow their business in this important segment.
From a pricing perspective, we continue to see renewals close as positive rates, with fuel [ph] pricing coming in at mid-single-digit levels. Intermodal continues to be the market segment most impacted by truck competition, but we're confident in the value we're providing, and this value is manifesting itself as volume returns to the railroad from some of our key constituents.
As we have done in previous years, we've included Slide 12, which provides a sequential look for each industry segment. As you can see, we have a favorable or unchanged volume projection for about 86% of the business. This includes normal seasonal shipping in intermodal as well as the return of some of our automotive parts business. Given the warm temperatures in the Southwest and Texas, we're also seeing higher coal shipments being planned for the second half of the year.
During Q2, we moved our first import shipments of LPG and refined products into Mexico. As we discussed previously, we expect to continue the ramp-up of these shipments as a result of the Mexico Energy Reform. We're also seeing increased exports of fuel oil for Mexico as well as increase in plastics and soda ash to support these 2 growing industrial segments.
The Automotive business continues to grow in Mexico and our customers continue to ask us to do more in creating solutions to support their global manufacturing footprint. By 2020, Mexico will produce over 5.3 million vehicles and import another 900,000. Over 60% of this production will have been added since 2010. We will continue to invest in the fluidity and capacity that will allow us to effectively service this important segment.
The Ag and Minerals business will continue to be strong, but we'll ship according to its normal seasonality. And we believe our Industrial & Consumer segment will continue to see fierce competition in both paper and steel business over the next 6 months. 
Overall, we're upbeat about the opportunities in front of us. As Jeff mentioned, we're making strategic investments, which will prepare us to support the customers' growth strategies as we continue to see the benefits of these investments that we made in capacity and fluidity.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch."
30472,335065777,1008055,"Kansas City Southern, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Kansas City Southern","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start my commentary on Slide 14. Second quarter carload volume was flat year-over-year and up 5% sequentially.  While reported revenue declined 3%, excluding foreign exchange and fuel price impacts f",1077,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start my commentary on Slide 14. Second quarter carload volume was flat year-over-year and up 5% sequentially.  While reported revenue declined 3%, excluding foreign exchange and fuel price impacts from the depreciation of the peso, revenue has actually increased 2% over second quarter 2015. 
Operating ratio improved 680 basis points to 61.3%. Cost declined $50 million or 13% as a result of benefits from fuel excise tax credits of $34 million, the favorable impact of foreign exchange and lower fuel prices. I'll cover expense declines and the fuel excise tax credit more fully on the next few slides.
Reported diluted EPS of $1.11 was up 10% over second quarter of 2015 as we benefited from the improved operating ratio offset by higher interest expense, larger net FX losses from the peso depreciation and lower equity in earnings from Panama Canal Railway. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.22, up 18% from second quarter of 2015.
Moving to Slide 15. During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $34 million fuel excise tax credit for the first half of 2016, approximately half relating to the first quarter of 2016 and the other half, the second quarter. This credit relates to legislation passed in Mexico, which extends excise tax credits available to transportation companies beyond what has been available for the trucking industry to include the operation of locomotives and other work equipment.
Our fuel prices in Mexico have been nearly double what we pay in the U.S. as a result of the excise tax being approximately 40% of the total price paid per gallon in Mexico. While legislation enacted only includes credits for 2016, the government has publicly stated its intent to migrate to market pricing for fuel by 2018. And accordingly, the company believes it is likely that the government will continue to extend this credit to the railroad industry.
For the full year 2016, we expect fuel excise tax credits to approximate $60 million-plus and $40 million-plus after-tax, depending on fuel usage, the level of excise tax per gallon imposed by the government and foreign exchange.
Finally, the credit is available against both withholding and income taxes. And we currently expect to fully utilize the credit for 2016, but utilization is dependent on various factors that do influence our level of taxable income. There are no carryforward provisions to realize this excise tax credit in future years. And thus, it must be realized during the calendar year 2016.
Moving to the next slide. Slide 16 reflects estimates of the future foreign exchange in U.S. fuel rates for the remainder of the year. As you can see, we continue to expect significant downward pressure on revenues as a result of peso depreciation, currently expected to be 14% and 11%, respectively, in the third and fourth quarters of 2016.
While third quarter of 2016 is expected to have some downward pressure on revenues as a result of lower year-over-year U.S. fuel prices, based on EIA estimates, we would expect the significant negative impact from lower fuel prices to begin easing in the fourth quarter. As you can see from our second quarter results, the negative impact on revenue of the peso and lower U.S. fuel prices was $28 million, and we would expect that to continue in the third quarter. Specifically, for the third quarter 2016, we're now projecting mid-single-digit sequential revenue growth.
Moving to Slide 17. Operating expenses declined 13% driven by the $34 million fuel excise tax credit previously mentioned, along with the declines from lower fuel prices and foreign exchange rates. Incentive compensation was $6 million higher than second quarter of 2015, while depreciation, excluding the lease conversions, was $4 million higher.
During the quarter, we also recorded a receivable for a probable insurance recovery of the incremental flooding-related expenses recognized in March and April, resulting in a $5 million net benefit in the quarter. Recognition of the remaining insurance recoveries would represent a contingent gain and will be recorded when the claim is finally settled, likely during the second half of 2016.
Offsetting that benefit were additional detour cost of $3 million recorded in the second quarter that Jeff discussed earlier, and we would expect those costs to continue in July, as certain routes on a partner railroad are still out of service. Additionally, we incurred $2 million more in other casualty cost in the second quarter of 2016. 
For the year, we would expect continued headwinds relative to depreciation, wage inflation, incentive comp, fuel and the detour costs that will be limited to the month of July.
Moving to Slide 18. Compensation and benefits expense increased $1 million year-over-year, incentive compensation increased $6 million and wage inflation contributed to a $3 million increase.  Offsetting those increases were benefits from the depreciating peso and lower U.S. headcount. As you can see in the bar charts on the left side of the slide, headcount was flat year-over-year and declined 1% from the first quarter of 2016 despite a 5% sequential increase in our carload volumes.
On Slide 19, fuel expenses declined $16 million or 21% from second quarter 2015 due to lower fuel prices and the depreciating peso. Increases in tonnage contributed to a $2 million increase in fuel, while efficiency provided a $1 million benefit to fuel expense. 
And finally, on Slide 20, our capital structure priorities continue to focus on investing in the business to generate the best growth in the rail sector. In fact, despite the downturn in the industrial economy in the last 18 months, we have grown our volumes 17% since 2007, while the rest of the Class I industry has declined 10% on an aggregate basis. We will continue to focus on reinvesting our cash flow back into growing our business for the long run. Projected capital expenditures for the year continue to be in the range of $580 million to $590 million.
In May of 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program and about halfway through the life of the program, we have repurchased 51% of our outstanding shares at an average of $88.46. We will continue to monitor economic and business conditions to determine future levels of share repurchases.
And finally, during the quarter, we prefunded our $250 million floating rate note due in October of 2016 at 3.125% for a 10-year term. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Pat."

First, I'd like to offer a quick overall assessment of the quarter and the current outlook. And second, I want to make a few comments about the management transition that has been underway here at KCS for the last year or so. 
Regarding the second quarter performance assessment, we feel very good about our performance for the quarter. And more importantly, we feel good about the overall outlook for the rest of the year. As Brian discussed, our business volumes have shown sequential growth for the last 3 months. And the short-term outlook for the vast majority of our business is either neutral or positive.
We're also very pleased to have demonstrated solid cost control despite unusually high detour expenses and demonstrate operating ratio improvements even excluding the excise tax credit in the absence of volume growth.
Regarding the management transition, I'm sure that you've all noticed that Dave Starling is not on the call with us today. And you may also recall that I became President and CEO effective July 1, 2016. Dave will continue on as an adviser to me until the end of this year and then will continue on as a member of our Board of Directors until May of next year.
It would be hard for me to overstate the remarkable accomplishments and progress that KCS made under Dave's 8 years as President and 6 years as CEO. I'm very grateful that Dave has agreed to continue on in this advisory capacity. I intend to use his counsel to assure that this transition continues to be as smooth as it possibly can.
I'm very fortunate to have become CEO at a time when this company has never been in better physical and financial condition than it is right now. Over the last 8 years, KCS operating ratio has improved by more than 12 full points. Since 2010, our earnings per share have more than doubled and our market value has almost doubled. As a result of debt repayments and refinancings undertaken since becoming investment grade in 2013, our -- combined with the overall low level of interest rates, KCS today has the lowest average interest cost on our debt than any other Class 1 railroad. In spite of recent pressures on business volumes and weak outlook for the overall economy, we continue to focus on cost control, and that has resulted in improvement in cash flow and profitability.
As for the future and longer-term trends, I am doubly fortunate to not only be CEO of a financially and physically strong company, but one which I truly believe is at the threshold of exciting growth opportunities.
There's a tremendous amount of new industrial development activity taking place on our network at this moment, and these investments should drive our growth in the years ahead. All across our network, we're seeing new investments in auto plants, intermodal terminals, ethylene refineries, grain elevators, just to name a few. Our relationship with the other railroads in North America are very strong. This an important factor because our ability to achieve our full growth depends on our ability to offer customer service options into markets that we don't serve directly. By virtue of our relationships and effective interchange with all of the other carriers, we're in a position to do that. As you've seen in the last 2 quarters as well, the relationship we have with the other rail carriers is also very important in our ability to provide continuous service options when we are hit by weather and other factors on our own line.
And finally, we have a great team of talented and dedicated employees at all levels of the organization. From a talent perspective, I feel we stack up very well against our larger railroad counterparts and have great confidence in this team's ability to lead KCS to even higher performance levels in the years ahead.
With that, we'll be happy to take a few questions."

And after the credit, it effectively gets you back to a price per gallon that's roughly the same as what we're paying in the U.S. And while the legislation was only enacted for 2016, we believe, sitting here today, that this practice would continue as the country moves to its stated goal of getting to market pricing. And so we can't say that for certain for 2017, but we believe that, that will be the case and therefore, kind of resets the bar in terms of what our cost per gallon is in Mexico."

And with respect to your fuel surcharge question, I mean, this program has really kind of put us on equal footing with the trucking industry. And we're already pricing at market in Mexico, so we'll see how all that plays out. But we don't think there's going to be any significant impact. One last comment, this credit also applies to work equipment on our railroad, which really has nothing to do with the holding of freight for customers. It is subject to generating enough taxable income to get the offset. It's dependent on a variety of other factors, that could move that credit up or down a little bit. So -- but that's generally where we would net out on this. It's kind of a resetting of our price per gallon that we're paying."

I would tell you there are probably, right now, about 6 or 7 major projects, primarily around storage and distribution. That's kind of the key and making sure that you're tied into the appropriate type of source from a refinery perspective. And so when you think about what that will mean in the future, it will all depend on when those projects or able to be kicked off. Several of them, the Howard Energy project is already moving forward, and so there are a number of projects already moving forward. But I would tell you, based on that timing, it's probably the best way to look at it. And right now, much of that is uncertain. But again, this last quarter, we moved our first loads into Mexico for both refined products and LPG. And we think that, that will continue from a ramp-up perspective through the end of 2016 into 2017, preparing for the open market pricing of 2018.

What I would tell you is, I think we feel very, very comfortable that we've come through the retooling in conjunction with our partners, and everyone did exactly what they were supposed to do. We feel, like I said in my prepared comments, very comfortable that both the export and import volumes are going to be higher than what we thought they would be when we began the year. We're keeping a close watch on consumption, especially in North America. So U.S. and Canada, about 86% of the vehicles are exported, 14% of them are for Mexico consumption. So those exports can go both North America. And then as I mentioned, we're seeing significant growth out of Lazaro and Veracruz. So from a specific brand, specific customer, what I would tell you is I think we continue to be asked to do more, develop different types of solutions and we continue to believe that will go on probably into the next 3 or 4 years as some of these plants come on. As Jeff mentioned, we're building significant infrastructure from a capacity perspective for Ford and BMW. Those dates have already been announced in 2018 and 2019. But we continue to believe that manufacturing of automobiles in Mexico is going to be strong simply because of the export market that they support. And so we believe we have great models that our customers have put down into Mexico. The quality is good, and so we don't see a significant downturn. And that will continue as far as we can go forward. Basically, if you're talking about specific brands though, we really can't provide that based on each one of their consumption and the way they think about their manufacturing footprint as to what will drive that. But we're very bullish on the way our automotive business looks right now."

On the crew side in Mexico, again, getting back to the 2015 hiring we did, we believe that puts us in good shape and continues. That's probably why you haven't seen the year-over-year numbers decrease to fully recognize what we've done on the U.S. side with reductions. But you are in place, and we've done a good job of staying in front of the hiring this year in Mexico to provide that additional capacity. So right now, no concerns right now.

It is the Intermodal segment that everybody has talked about for the last 2 years. We continue to believe that, that capacity at some point will start to wane based on pricing. What typically happens is if the price gets too low for those smaller pieces of capacity to stay in the market, and then people return back. Also, there's a service component that a lot of people prefer that sometimes they don't get in that cheaper capacity. So we believe that's going to continue to be a market. We have to stay very close to Intermodal. It's a critical part of our business. But it's still going to see significant competition.
The second piece would be in our Industrial Consumer business, which is primarily that paper and steel. Now, when you have a currency fluctuation, paper from Mexico becomes cheaper than paper in the U.S. Those facilities down there would use that local paper. It would be hauled potentially by a trucking company versus rail because of the shorter haul. So that's the competition you see. It's not only the cheaper paper, but then the cheaper capacity. We don't think that's sustainable. In the past, you've seen companies go through this cyclicality,  if you will, of this type of market. But, again, we're going to continue to see it in those 2 segments.
Otherwise, we feel very comfortable that we're more than competitive in creating a value for our customers where, again, I think in the auto parts and some other where that volume is returning, whereas it left last year, and we spoke about that in our comments then.

And then, I might ask José Zozaya to provide some commentary here as well.
But as you know, going back to 2014 or maybe even before that, the then new Peña Nieto administration embarked on a very broad-based energy market reform agenda and that included production, generation, consumption. It was pretty much across all sectors of the energy market. And prior to that and prior to this clarification on the excise tax, the price of diesel fuel, gasoline and other consumer products in Mexico was set by the government and by PEMEX. It wasn't a world market price. So we are migrating toward, and there was a very clear path, a detailed kind of longer term, 3- to 4-year path, to get to full market energy reform. So this is a bit of a tack on, if you would, though it's probably not the best phrase to use, to that energy market deregulation that has been in motion for a couple of years now. We think that's why we're confident that while it's unclear that this excise tax credit will be available in 2017, when we put it in the overall context of the broader market deregulation, energy market deregulation, it would be a bit illogical to think that they would repeal this or remove this in 2018 or 2017. And then, once we get to 2018, the energy market, the price that we pay for diesel, the fuel surcharge, all of that is basically going to be potentially identical to what we have in the United States.
José, I don't know if you want to provide any more color commentary about the government's agenda here."

We just -- again, most of our international Intermodal business is Mexico origins and destinations. We have cracked into the Houston market, but it's still fairly -- very small in terms of our cross-border mix at this point. We just don't feel like traffic going into or out of Mexico, particularly to South America and Asia, is going to transit the canal. So we don't think that's going to be a big impact.
Secondly, as far as Panama Canal Railway is concerned, we're the state's darling and we need it. I don't think it -- we haven't seen the impact there of -- necessarily to the opening of the canal, but just the overall sort of environment for transpacific and international cargo has probably been the most noticeable effect there."

And my second question is -- and Mike this is about your comments around the mid -- I guess, the 3Q revenue sequential outlook. Can you talk a little bit about just how the carload outlook looks to you as the second half progresses? I mean, you by far got more of your commodity type in the neutral to favorable category than, say, CSX that has all but 2 of the unfavorable categories. It looks to us like your carload comparison is, number one, easier as the quarter -- as the year progresses; two, you've got this new business development coming on line. So can you just marry that together with -- maybe only being in that -- that 3%, is that suggesting that those headwinds you've pointed out in terms of fuel and currency are -- have they worsened? Or I'm just trying to get that balance and understand that."

And we would expect to continue to see some of that impact occur during the third quarter here.
So I think we feel reasonably good about some of the carload volumes. I'll let Brian comment on that. But you've just got some of that pressure related to, particularly FX, going on in the third quarter here."

I think the key for us is when you think about the growth, you have the plastics industry that is continuing to grow and we continue to see more and more shipments as those crackers come on line and we're able to participate in that volume.
The automotive plants were down in Q1. And so they're going to be up in Q -- or in the first half. So in the second half, obviously they're going to be moving the number of vehicles that we thought they would, so there will be growth as well.
Ag and mineral, I mean, there are a number of different projects that we participate on our line, as Pat said. And so we'll continue to see that, our normal seasonality in the Ag business.
Intermodal, obviously, in the retail and carload business, the appliance business, they are very heavily weighted sometimes towards the back end of the year as consumers start to spend money for the holidays and things like that.
And in the energy space, coal shipments are typically higher in the second half because of the heat, the air-conditioning and things that are needed down in the Texas and Southwest areas.
So yes, there's pressure from a commodity perspective, but we see each one of the commodities that we primarily work for -- work with moving forward in the way that we think it's going to.
So is there going to be pressure in paper and steel? Absolutely. Is there going to be pressure in Intermodal? Absolutely. But overall, we are very comfortable that we're going to grow similarly to what we do each year."

And so we feel very comfortable in that space from an Intermodal perspective.
The change that was made out of Lazaro and into -- from a vessel perspective, I think, was more driven by a change in the way that, that particular organization is thinking about their cost structure and the recuperation of their fixed cost. I think it's -- you can see that it's a market where variable pricing has come into account. And so it's a great piece of business that is moving. But we also believe, based on the factors that we're seeing at least in the market, it's not going to have an impact on us to the point where it's a very significant space. And if we're correct in the way they're looking at pricing, then we're pretty sure that volume will return as economic changes occur and the customers need that freight where it's been coming for the last few years.
So we feel like there is absolutely a significant change going on in the vessel environment. There's also a significant change in the trucking environment. But we're starting to get through that and see how this thing is going to play out over time, and we're comfortable that we're positioned well.

So I wouldn't jump to conclusion that because we've seen such -- I wouldn't say partnership, but good cohesiveness on the detour between B and UP. There are multiple routes around the Texas area that, as we work well together, that we're able to utilize. And I think that's what you've seen, and certainly, in the first quarter, the flooding event, which is more expensive because that impacted multiple lines. This was a single route, while a very critical single route, I think the railroads kind of proved out that we can work around these temporary issues.
So right now, no long-standing issues. We're set -- we're assuming we're going to get this bridge back in service here this week, and so we ought to be back to normal."

So from a sequential perspective, we feel comfortable that we'll continue to help support them in their efforts. But also, as some of those inventories get burned here in the third quarter as you go through the end of the summer, they'll want to replenish that, which is a normal state for the industry.

With me for today's presentation are Jeff Songer, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Brian Hancock, Chief Marketing Officer; Mike Upchurch, Chief Financial Officer. José Zozaya is on the phone to help us with questions. And José, as you know, is President and Executive Representative of Kansas City Southern de Mexico.
Please move to Slide 4 for a quick overview of the second quarter results. As you saw on our press release earlier this morning, our revenues for the quarter declined 3% versus last year. Excluding foreign exchange and lower U.S. fuel prices, we would have seen an increase in revenue of approximately 2%. Volumes were unchanged compared to last year. Second quarter operating ratio was 61.3%, which included the impact of the Mexican fuel excise tax credit of $34 million recognized in the second quarter. And this reflects the benefit for both the first and second quarter impact of the fuel excise tax credit. Service continued to be impacted by flooding in Texas during the quarter, or I shouldn't say continued, but we did have flooding disruptions in the first quarter as you will recall. And severe weather and flooding during the second quarter, south of Houston, affected our network and our cost as well. Jeff Songer will have more to say about that in his portion of the presentation.
I want to circle back and make a couple of quick comments about the operating ratio for the quarter, and this Mexican fuel excise tax, which, I realize, is probably not well understood out in the analyst community. Mike will cover this in much greater detail in a few minutes. But before anyone jumps to an incorrect conclusion about a new normal for our operating ratio, I do want to emphasize that the $34 million credit is retroactive to January 1, 2016, so it covers both the first and second quarter. 
While our reported operating ratio was 61.3%, adjusting out the first quarter impact would have resulted in an operating ratio that would have been approximately 300 basis points higher than we reported, but still more than a 350 basis point improvement from last year. We expect this benefit to continue through 2016. 
Looking beyond 2016, the ongoing impact of this excise tax credit, coupled with the longer-term impact of Mexican energy market deregulation, is difficult to quantify because it will be influenced by many factors, most importantly, the market price of diesel fuel and the level of the Mexican excise tax. Again, Mike will have much more detailed explanation in a few minutes, and we will be happy to entertain questions on this point at the end of the presentation.
With that, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer."

Dwell for the quarter of 21.8 hours was a 7.2% improvement over prior year. Solid operating performance in the quarter despite continued weather-related interruptions, which I will discuss, enabled improvements in our key operating metrics. And we have stabilized our operation well over the past 3 quarters.
Moving to the operations overview on Slide 8. We continue to aggressively manage resources. Currently, 7% of the U.S. T&E workforce is in furlough status and 15% of our locomotives across the system are in storage. 
Providing an update on other cost initiatives, our fuel management programs have provided approximately $3 million in reduced cost year-to-date through improved fuel efficiencies. As presented in the first quarter, our fuel optimization program is well underway. We are approximately 1/3 complete with the planned installation for 2016, where we are installing on approximately 20% of the U.S. road fleet. Expanding upon this initiative in the second half of the year, we will begin similar work in Mexico related to fuel optimization technologies. We plan to deploy this technology across the similar number of our Mexico road fleet through 2017.
Automatic engine start stop, or AESS technology is another area of focus in our fuel management efforts. While we employ this technology today, future work in this area, including the expanding use in yard locomotives, upgrading to newer technologies and tightening up the work rules related to engine start stop procedures will aid in our fuel efficiency management.
With respect to labor management, recrews are another key metric we have been focused on. In the second quarter, we achieved a 49% reduction in recrews. And year-to-date, we have reduced overall U.S. and Mexico recrews by 42%.
Our capital project highlights for the quarter focus on our expansion of San Luis Potosi in support of the announcements you have seen regarding the new BMW and Ford automotive plants as well as the WTC and Watco fluids terminal. We're currently in the design phase for further capacity expansions in the San Luis Potosi area, including multiple new support tracks built at our Interpuerto facility as well as support tracks to directly serve the new auto plants. This will ensure we have adequate capacity through 2018 and 2019 as these facilities come online.
Other major projects at Lazaro and Sasol, and mainline siding capacity projects continue on schedule.
Regarding equipment, our capital for 2016 is focused on multilevel auto equipment and by the end of Q3, we will have received 300 new auto racks. We are also adding new Grain & Intermodal equipment to support those segments.
Turning to Slide 9. I will provide a quick overview of the weather-related service interruption in Rosenberg Texas. Similar to the first quarter, we were impacted again this quarter by severe flooding in Texas, which resulted in the outage of a bridge on this trackage rights segment in early June. This line was out of service for 3 weeks in June and was removed from service again on July 4 due to additional work required to ensure the safe operation of the bridge. We anticipate the bridge being returned to service later this week. Our cross-border and grain segments have been impacted by this outage, and we will see some residual impact in Q3 due to the additional work being performed on the bridge.
I would like to recognize once again the Union Pacific and BNSF for their cooperation as we again help each other to maintain fluidity through the use of reroutes and detours.
I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock."

Our Chemic",871,"Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I will start on Page 11, where you can see our year-over-year revenue was down 3% for the quarter, but up 2% excluding currency and fuel. Our carloads for the quarter were unchanged versus last year. Our Chemical & Petroleum business continues to show steady growth with an 8% volume and 6% revenue increase driven by strength in the petroleum and plastics business. We continue to see this as an area of growth as the plastics manufacturers in the Gulf region continue to ship both domestically and globally.
Industrial & Consumer growth is slowing with year-over-year decreases of 4% volume and 6% revenue, respectively with the revenue decline primarily driven by softness in our metals and paper segments. These segments continue to experience stiff competition impacted by currency fluctuations and low truck pricing, which we believe to be unsustainable in the long term. This weakness was somewhat offset by continued strength in our other carloads segment.
During Q2, our Ag and Mineral business saw an increase of 9% in carloads and 10% of revenue driven by strength in grain and food products, particularly in the cross-border business. We're definitely seeing the benefit of the additional cars that Jeff spoke of, and we have been serving this important business unit all year with those additional cars. 
Our overall cross-border business continues to show strong growth of 9% for the quarter, being led by Ag and Mineral business as well as good growth in the Chemical & Petroleum business. More details on our cross-border franchise are included in the appendix on Pages 29 and 30.
Our Energy business continues to be negatively impacted by low coal shipments and volatility in crude. We also continue to see declines in frac sand and pet coke segments as well. Overall carloads were down 5% and revenue down 16% versus prior year.
Intermodal volumes were down 2% with revenue decreasing 7% in the quarter, primarily driven by weakness in the overall market and continued competition from trucking and new vessel operators. We did see some signs this might be starting to abate as several key customers have begun returning portions of their intermodal shipments to KCS. 
As we've mentioned over the last few quarters, our Automotive business has been impacted by retooling at several of the plants we service. However, in Q2, we saw an increase in import and export volume in Mexico. This volume increase allowed us to hold shipment volume flat, while several facilities were offline for retooling.
Due to the mix, our adjusted revenue was off 7%, but these new import and export volumes are a good sign of the health of the automotive market in Mexico. As of June 30, all plants are back online with normal production and we are very pleased with the ramp-up volumes we're seeing from new manufacturing sites. KCS is well positioned to service our automotive customers as they grow their business in this important segment.
From a pricing perspective, we continue to see renewals close as positive rates, with fuel [ph] pricing coming in at mid-single-digit levels. Intermodal continues to be the market segment most impacted by truck competition, but we're confident in the value we're providing, and this value is manifesting itself as volume returns to the railroad from some of our key constituents.
As we have done in previous years, we've included Slide 12, which provides a sequential look for each industry segment. As you can see, we have a favorable or unchanged volume projection for about 86% of the business. This includes normal seasonal shipping in intermodal as well as the return of some of our automotive parts business. Given the warm temperatures in the Southwest and Texas, we're also seeing higher coal shipments being planned for the second half of the year.
During Q2, we moved our first import shipments of LPG and refined products into Mexico. As we discussed previously, we expect to continue the ramp-up of these shipments as a result of the Mexico Energy Reform. We're also seeing increased exports of fuel oil for Mexico as well as increase in plastics and soda ash to support these 2 growing industrial segments.
The Automotive business continues to grow in Mexico and our customers continue to ask us to do more in creating solutions to support their global manufacturing footprint. By 2020, Mexico will produce over 5.3 million vehicles and import another 900,000. Over 60% of this production will have been added since 2010. We will continue to invest in the fluidity and capacity that will allow us to effectively service this important segment.
The Ag and Minerals business will continue to be strong, but we'll ship according to its normal seasonality. And we believe our Industrial & Consumer segment will continue to see fierce competition in both paper and steel business over the next 6 months. 
Overall, we're upbeat about the opportunities in front of us. As Jeff mentioned, we're making strategic investments, which will prepare us to support the customers' growth strategies as we continue to see the benefits of these investments that we made in capacity and fluidity.
And with that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch."
30472,335065777,1008200,"Kansas City Southern, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Kansas City Southern","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start my commentary on Slide 14. Second quarter carload volume was flat year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. While reported revenue declined 3%, excluding foreign exchange and fuel price impacts fr",1077,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start my commentary on Slide 14. Second quarter carload volume was flat year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. While reported revenue declined 3%, excluding foreign exchange and fuel price impacts from the depreciation of the peso, revenue has actually increased 2% over second quarter 2015. 
Operating ratio improved 680 basis points to 61.3%. Cost declined $50 million or 13% as a result of benefits from fuel excise tax credits of $34 million, the favorable impact of foreign exchange and lower fuel prices. I'll cover expense declines and the fuel excise tax credit more fully on the next few slides.
Reported diluted EPS of $1.11 was up 10% over second quarter of 2015 as we benefited from the improved operating ratio offset by higher interest expense, larger net FX losses from the peso depreciation and lower equity in earnings from Panama Canal Railway. Adjusted diluted EPS was $1.22, up 18% from second quarter of 2015.
Moving to Slide 15. During the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a $34 million fuel excise tax credit for the first half of 2016, approximately half relating to the first quarter of 2016 and the other half, the second quarter. This credit relates to legislation passed in Mexico, which extends excise tax credits available to transportation companies beyond what has been available for the trucking industry to include the operation of locomotives and other work equipment.
Our fuel prices in Mexico have been nearly double what we pay in the U.S. as a result of the excise tax being approximately 40% of the total price paid per gallon in Mexico. While legislation enacted only includes credits for 2016, the government has publicly stated its intent to migrate to market pricing for fuel by 2018. And accordingly, the company believes it is likely that the government will continue to extend this credit to the railroad industry.
For the full year 2016, we expect fuel excise tax credits to approximate $60 million-plus and $40 million-plus after-tax, depending on fuel usage, the level of excise tax per gallon imposed by the government and foreign exchange.
Finally, the credit is available against both withholding and income taxes. And we currently expect to fully utilize the credit for 2016, but utilization is dependent on various factors that do influence our level of taxable income. There are no carryforward provisions to realize this excise tax credit in future years. And thus, it must be realized during the calendar year 2016.
Moving to the next slide. Slide 16 reflects estimates of the future foreign exchange in U.S. fuel rates for the remainder of the year. As you can see, we continue to expect significant downward pressure on revenues as a result of peso depreciation, currently expected to be 14% and 11%, respectively, in the third and fourth quarters of 2016.
While third quarter of 2016 is expected to have some downward pressure on revenues as a result of lower year-over-year U.S. fuel prices, based on EIA estimates, we would expect the significant negative impact from lower fuel prices to begin easing in the fourth quarter. As you can see from our second quarter results, the negative impact on revenue of the peso and lower U.S. fuel prices was $28 million, and we would expect that to continue in the third quarter. Specifically, for the third quarter 2016, we're now projecting mid-single-digit sequential revenue growth.
Moving to Slide 17. Operating expenses declined 13% driven by the $34 million fuel excise tax credit previously mentioned, along with the declines from lower fuel prices and foreign exchange rates. Incentive compensation was $6 million higher than second quarter of 2015, while depreciation, excluding the lease conversions, was $4 million higher.
During the quarter, we also recorded a receivable for a probable insurance recovery of the incremental flooding-related expenses recognized in March and April, resulting in a $5 million net benefit in the quarter. Recognition of the remaining insurance recoveries would represent a contingent gain and will be recorded when the claim is finally settled, likely during the second half of 2016.
Offsetting that benefit were additional detour cost of $3 million recorded in the second quarter that Jeff discussed earlier, and we would expect those costs to continue in July, as certain routes on a partner railroad are still out of service. Additionally, we incurred $2 million more in other casualty cost in the second quarter of 2016. 
For the year, we would expect continued headwinds relative to depreciation, wage inflation, incentive comp, fuel and the detour costs that will be limited to the month of July.
Moving to Slide 18. Compensation and benefits expense increased $1 million year-over-year, incentive compensation increased $6 million and wage inflation contributed to a $3 million increase. Offsetting those increases were benefits from the depreciating peso and lower U.S. headcount. As you can see in the bar charts on the left side of the slide, headcount was flat year-over-year and declined 1% from the first quarter of 2016 despite a 5% sequential increase in our carload volumes.
On Slide 19, fuel expenses declined $16 million or 21% from second quarter 2015 due to lower fuel prices and the depreciating peso. Increases in tonnage contributed to a $2 million increase in fuel, while efficiency provided a $1 million benefit to fuel expense. 
And finally, on Slide 20, our capital structure priorities continue to focus on investing in the business to generate the best growth in the rail sector. In fact, despite the downturn in the industrial economy in the last 18 months, we have grown our volumes 17% since 2007, while the rest of the Class I industry has declined 10% on an aggregate basis. We will continue to focus on reinvesting our cash flow back into growing our business for the long run. Projected capital expenditures for the year continue to be in the range of $580 million to $590 million.
In May of 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program and about halfway through the life of the program, we have repurchased 51% of our outstanding shares at an average of $88.46. We will continue to monitor economic and business conditions to determine future levels of share repurchases.
And finally, during the quarter, we prefunded our $250 million floating rate note due in October of 2016 at 3.125% for a 10-year term. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Pat."

First, I'd like to offer a quick overall assessment of the quarter and the current outlook. And second, I want to make a few comments about the management transition that has been underway here at KCS for the last year or so. 
Regarding the second quarter performance assessment, we feel very good about our performance for the quarter. And more importantly, we feel good about the overall outlook for the rest of the year. As Brian discussed, our business volumes have shown sequential growth for the last 3 months. And the short-term outlook for the vast majority of our business is either neutral or positive.
We're also very pleased to have demonstrated solid cost control despite unusually high detour expenses and demonstrate operating ratio improvements even excluding the excise tax credit in the absence of volume growth.
Regarding the management transition, I'm sure that you've all noticed that Dave Starling is not on the call with us today. And you may also recall that I became President and CEO effective July 1, 2016. Dave will continue on as an adviser to me until the end of this year and then will continue on as a member of our Board of Directors until May of next year.
It would be hard for me to overstate the remarkable accomplishments and progress that KCS made under Dave's 8 years as President and 6 years as CEO. I'm very grateful that Dave has agreed to continue on in this advisory capacity. I intend to use his counsel to assure that this transition continues to be as smooth as it possibly can.
I'm very fortunate to have become CEO at a time when this company has never been in better physical and financial condition than it is right now. Over the last 8 years, KCS operating ratio has improved by more than 12 full points. Since 2010, our earnings per share have more than doubled and our market value has almost doubled. As a result of debt repayments and refinancings undertaken since becoming investment grade in 2013, our -- combined with the overall low level of interest rates, KCS today has the lowest average interest cost on our debt than any other Class 1 railroad. In spite of recent pressures on business volumes and weak outlook for the overall economy, we continue to focus on cost control, and that has resulted in improvement in cash flow and profitability.
As for the future and longer-term trends, I am doubly fortunate to not only be CEO of a financially and physically strong company, but one which I truly believe is at the threshold of exciting growth opportunities.
There's a tremendous amount of new industrial development activity taking place on our network at this moment, and these investments should drive our growth in the years ahead. All across our network, we're seeing new investments in auto plants, intermodal terminals, ethylene refineries, grain elevators, just to name a few. Our relationship with the other railroads in North America are very strong. This an important factor because our ability to achieve our full growth depends on our ability to offer customer service options into markets that we don't serve directly. By virtue of our relationships and effective interchange with all of the other carriers, we're in a position to do that. As you've seen in the last 2 quarters as well, the relationship we have with the other rail carriers is also very important in our ability to provide continuous service options when we are hit by weather and other factors on our own line.
And finally, we have a great team of talented and dedicated employees at all levels of the organization. From a talent perspective, I feel we stack up very well against our larger railroad counterparts and have great confidence in this team's ability to lead KCS to even higher performance levels in the years ahead.
With that, we'll be happy to take a few questions."

And after the credit, it effectively gets you back to a price per gallon that's roughly the same as what we're paying in the U.S. And while the legislation was only enacted for 2016, we believe, sitting here today, that this practice would continue as the country moves to its stated goal of getting to market pricing.

And we're already pricing at market in Mexico, so we'll see how all that plays out. But we don't think there's going to be any significant impact. One last comment, this credit also applies to work equipment on our railroad, which really has nothing to do with the holding of freight for customers. It is subject to generating enough taxable income to get the offset. It's dependent on a variety of other factors, that could move that credit up or down a little bit.

There's obviously -- just from a base perspective, people are going to put pipelines into Mexico, so we will be hauling pipe. There are other projects similar to the Watco WTC that we've mentioned before, the Rangeland announcement, some of the LPG work that's being done. I would tell you there are probably, right now, about 6 or 7 major projects, primarily around storage and distribution. That's kind of the key and making sure that you're tied into the appropriate type of source from a refinery perspective. And so when you think about what that will mean in the future, it will all depend on when those projects or able to be kicked off. Several of them, the Howard Energy project is already moving forward, and so there are a number of projects already moving forward. But I would tell you, based on that timing, it's probably the best way to look at it. And right now, much of that is uncertain. But again, this last quarter, we moved our first loads into Mexico for both refined products and LPG. And we think that, that will continue from a ramp-up perspective through the end of 2016 into 2017, preparing for the open market pricing of 2018. And so as to when, what month, what quarter, that's going to be very, very difficult to look at. But there are at least 6 to 7 projects that are significant on our line."

We feel, like I said in my prepared comments, very comfortable that both the export and import volumes are going to be higher than what we thought they would be when we began the year. We're keeping a close watch on consumption, especially in North America. So U.S. and Canada, about 86% of the vehicles are exported, 14% of them are for Mexico consumption. So those exports can go both North America. And then as I mentioned, we're seeing significant growth out of Lazaro and Veracruz. So from a specific brand, specific customer, what I would tell you is I think we continue to be asked to do more, develop different types of solutions and we continue to believe that will go on probably into the next 3 or 4 years as some of these plants come on. As Jeff mentioned, we're building significant infrastructure from a capacity perspective for Ford and BMW. Those dates have already been announced in 2018 and 2019. But we continue to believe that manufacturing of automobiles in Mexico is going to be strong simply because of the export market that they support. And so we believe we have great models that our customers have put down into Mexico. The quality is good, and so we don't see a significant downturn. And that will continue as far as we can go forward.

But as that converges toward complete market deregulation in 2018, the market will dictate what the prices are."

It is the Intermodal segment that everybody has talked about for the last 2 years. We continue to believe that, that capacity at some point will start to wane based on pricing. What typically happens is if the price gets too low for those smaller pieces of capacity to stay in the market, and then people return back. Also, there's a service component that a lot of people prefer that sometimes they don't get in that cheaper capacity. So we believe that's going to continue to be a market. We have to stay very close to Intermodal. It's a critical part of our business. But it's still going to see significant competition. The second piece would be in our Industrial Consumer business, which is primarily that paper and steel. Now when you have a currency fluctuation, paper from Mexico becomes cheaper than paper in the U.S. Those facilities down there would use that local paper. It would be hauled potentially by a trucking company versus rail because of the shorter haul. So that's the competition you see. It's not only the cheaper paper, but then the cheaper capacity. We don't think that's sustainable. In the past, you've seen companies go through this cyclicality, if you will, of this type of market. But again, we're going to continue to see it in those 2 segments. Otherwise, we feel very comfortable that we're more than competitive in creating a value for our customers where, again, I think in the auto parts and some other where that volume is returning, whereas it left last year, and we spoke about that in our comments then. We see that now coming back to the rail because of the consistency of the service that Jeff talked about."

And then, I might ask José Zozaya to provide some commentary here as well. But as you know, going back to 2014 or maybe even before that, the then new Peña Nieto administration embarked on a very broad-based energy market reform agenda and that included production, generation, consumption. It was pretty much across all sectors of the energy market. And prior to that and prior to this clarification on the excise tax, the price of diesel fuel, gasoline and other consumer products in Mexico was set by the government and by PEMEX. It wasn't a world market price. So we are migrating toward, and there was a very clear path, a detailed kind of longer term, 3- to 4-year path, to get to full market energy reform. So this is a bit of a tack on, if you would, though it's probably not the best phrase to use, to that energy market deregulation that has been in motion for a couple of years now. We think that's why we're confident that while it's unclear that this excise tax credit will be available in 2017, when we put it in the overall context of the broader market deregulation, energy market deregulation, it would be a bit illogical to think that they would repeal this or remove this in 2018 or 2017. And then, once we get to 2018, the energy market, the price that we pay for diesel, the fuel surcharge, all of that is basically going to be potentially identical to what we have in the United States.

We'll be, through the end of this year, did just simply installing all that technology in the U.S. We still have a training component for engineers, conductors to utilize that. As I mentioned we've installed about 1/3 of that already. So you're starting to see some benefit. I think you'll continue to see more benefit out of that as the year goes on and then through '17 as we expand that technology to Mexico. So without putting any hard numbers around it, I think one of the things we're marching towards on both the fuel and labor side is kind of some consistent regular steady improvement in both of those areas. And I think we still have room to go."

I would say I think from a neutral outlook, it means that we believe what we thought was going to happen is going to happen. And so we feel very comfortable in that space from an Intermodal perspective. The change that was made out of Lazaro and into -- from a vessel perspective, I think, was more driven by a change in the way that, that particular organization is thinking about their cost structure and the recuperation of their fixed cost. I think it's -- you can see that it's a market where variable pricing has come into account. And so it's a great piece of business that is moving. But we also believe, based on the factors that we're seeing at least in the market, it's not going to have an impact on us to the point where it's a very significant space. And if we're correct in the way they're looking at pricing, then we're pretty sure that volume will return as economic changes occur and the customers need that freight where it's been coming for the last few years. So we feel like there is absolutely a significant change going on in the vessel environment. There's also a significant change in the trucking environment. But we're starting to get through that and see how this thing is going to play out over time, and we're comfortable that we're positioned well. And like I said, we're not going to chase the lowest cost methodology of the day because there's a lot of people trying to make up for things, and we're not just going to chase that volume.

Welcome to our Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. If you look at Page 4, you'll see the lineup which I think is familiar to everyone: Jeff Songer, Brian Hancock, Mike Upchurch. And José Zozaya is on the phone as well",512,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. If you look at Page 4, you'll see the lineup which I think is familiar to everyone: Jeff Songer, Brian Hancock, Mike Upchurch. And José Zozaya is on the phone as well this morning.
Let me begin my comments with Slide 5. As you saw in our press release from earlier this morning, we reported diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $1.12, which compares to $1.20 per share last year, which represents a 7% decline from 2015. 
Revenues were $604.5 million, a 4% decline from last year.
Excluding the impact of lower U.S. fuel prices on fuel surcharge revenue and a further weakening of the Mexican peso, our revenues for the quarter would have been about 1% lower than last year. Volumes were down by 4% from last year.
Our reported operating ratio for the quarter was 66.9%, which is 170 basis points higher than last year. However, this include the impacts of some onetime cost events, including higher detour expenses due to flooding in South Texas and service disruptions in Mexico, which, as we stated in our press release, had an adverse impact on revenues. In addition, those disruptions had a negative impact on cost performance during the quarter as well.
In spite of this deterioration in quarterly operating ratio, we feel very good about our overall cost performance during the quarter. Later in the presentation, Jeff Songer will talk about some of the efficiency initiatives that are underway, and Mike Upchurch will get into more detail about what we'll refer to as our normalized cost performance. Just to give you a bit of a preview, this normalized cost performance is demonstrated by looking at our year-to-date operating ratio, which as you can see from the last point on Slide 5, improved by 230 basis points from the adjusted or comparable operating ratio last year to 65%. 
Among other things, this year-to-date view shows our operating ratio performance on a basis which smooths out the impact of timing or events that would have a more pronounced impact on the results in any given quarter. Again, Mike will walk you through this in greater detail in a few moments.
Moving on to Slide 6, I wanted to briefly remind you of the recent guidance which we previously provided and show you that we are on track with that guidance. Last quarter, we told you that we were -- we expected to see sequential revenue growth from the first half to the second half of 2016, and we are confirming that view at this point, and that we expected to see mid-single-digit sequential revenue growth in the third quarter of 2016. As you saw on the previous slide, we generated sequential volume growth of 5%, which led to revenues growing by 6.4% sequentially. We are also confirming our previous guidance regarding second half 2016 automotive volume growth and our overall capital spending targets for 2016.

Beginning with Slide 8, velocity for the quarter of 27.8 miles per hour improved 10% over prior year, while dwell for the quarter of 24.1 increased 6% versus prior year.
Factors impacting dwell were the July bridge outage in Rosenberg, Texas, which restricted cross-border traffic flow. The border terminals of Sanchez and Nuevo Laredo and Laredo were impacted by this event. Compounding this outage were service disruptions in Mexico during the month of July which caused multiple days of outages across the network. All major terminals in Mexico were impacted, while terminals in Sanchez, Nuevo Laredo and Laredo, already congested by the earlier Texas bridge outage, were affected further.
Our current dwell has shown improvement from the elevated levels we saw between late July to mid-September, and we look for this metric to return to more normal levels through Q4.
Moving to the operations overview on Slide 9. Focus continues on our biggest cost drivers of labor and fuel. Currently, 5% of the U.S. T&E workforce is in furlough status. Overall headcount for the quarter was down 1% versus prior year, as Mike will review in later slides. 12% of our locomotives across this system are in storage. Fuel management programs, as outlined in prior earnings discussions, continued, and we have gained another $1 million in pure fuel efficiency during Q3. 
Year-to-date, we are about 75% complete with the technology installations in the U.S., with Mexico installation work slated for 2017. 
Effective recruit management continues, with year-to-date reductions of 49%, while overtime management provided an additional $2.4 million in savings for the quarter versus prior year.
One other item to note is the completion of a mechanical in-sourcing effort that was finalized during the quarter and went into effect October 1. This represents an approximate $5 million in ongoing annual cost savings. We will recognize these benefits starting in Q4.
Moving on to capital project highlights. I would like to provide a quick update on PTC. First, I would like to acknowledge the tremendous ongoing effort by all the groups involved in this project. We plan to have a first operating subdivision in PTC revenue service in Q4 and have an aggressive implementation schedule in 2017 and 2018. 2017 will be another heavy investment year for PTC and capital spend will begin to reduce thereafter.
Construction work at the previously announced WTC/Watco SLP fluids terminal broke ground during the quarter. Design work for support facilities for the Ford and BMW automotive plants at SLP is underway. Work at the Sasol support yard facility continues and is on schedule for a late 2017 completion. 
Finally, Sanchez Yard classification tracks are on schedule to complete by year-end. This will allow additional handling of trains at Sanchez and will ease some pressure on other terminals in the network while continuing to facilitate cross-border traffic. Additional classification tracks and mechanical facilities at Sanchez will be complete by the end of 2017.
I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock."

Our Chemical & Petroleum b",1002,"Thanks jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Page 11, where you can see our year-over-year revenue was down 4% and off 1%, excluding currency and fuel. Our carloads were also down 4% for the quarter versus last year. 
Our Chemical & Petroleum business had a record quarter with 1% year-over-year growth in revenue. Our carloads in this segment were off 4%, primarily due to shipments of fuel oil, as a customer in Mexico had a disruption in production which was partially offset by strong growth in our Plastics segment. We continue to see strength in this line of business as the plastics manufacturers in the Gulf region grow their shipments globally.
Our Industrial & Consumer business remained slow, with year-over-year decreases of 6% volume and 6% revenue, with half of the revenue decline driven by fuel and foreign exchange. This business segment continues to be negatively impacted by softness in our metals and paper segments. These businesses are experiencing stiff global completion, impacted by currency fluctuations and low truck pricing, which we believe to be unsustainable in the long term. This weakness was somewhat offset by strength in our other carload segment.
During Q3, our Ag & Mineral business saw a decrease of 1% in carloads and revenue growth of 3%, driven by strength in grain and food products, particularly in the cross-border business. We continue to see the benefit of the additional equipment serving this important business unit.
Our overall cross-border business showed strong growth of 7% for the quarter, being led by a record-breaking quarter in our automotive business and solid growth in cross-border Ag/Mineral and the Chemical & Petroleum business. More details on our cross-border franchise are included in the appendices on Page 31, 32.
Our Energy business continued to be negatively impacted by volatility in crude and frac sand. Our coal business had lapped some of the lowest numbers from last year and was slightly higher in Q3. Overall energy carloads were down 7%, and revenue was down 15% versus prior year.
Intermodal volumes were down 5%, with revenue decreasing 7% in the quarter, primarily driven by our Lázaro cross-border and Lázaro inter-Mexico business. We're seeing good growth in our cross-border franchise and non-franchise business with -- which more than offsets any general weakness in the overall U.S. market.
The intermodal business was also negatively impacted by the service interruptions early in the quarter, as customers made the decision to use trucks to augment the third quarter shipping capacity. We are optimistic that these lines will return as the current improved service bolsters customer confidence moving into 2017.
With all of the automotive plants being back online, our automotive volume increased 14%, but was impacted by a negative mix, which kept our revenue growth, adjusted for fuel and FX, at 4%.
One note is the impact of a new move we are now making from Laredo to Corpus Christi area which is driving down RPU. This is a very good piece of business with good overall length of haul, but given the way we account for the move, it has a negative impact on RPU. 
In Q4, we'll see one new facility come up to full production and another facility begin production in November. We're also seeing strong volumes at the ports' both import and export volumes, and KCS is well positioned to serve our automotive customers as they grow their business in this important segment.
From a pricing perspective, we continue to see renewals close at a positive rate year-over-year. Excluding a large customer contract from last year, which will remain unchanged in 2016, our overall core pricing came in at mid-single-digit levels. 
Intermodal remains the market segment most impacted by truck competition, but we're confident in the value we're providing and that customers will continue to return to the railroad as we move into 2017.
On Slide 12, we have provided a fourth quarter year-over-year outlook for each of the industry segments. As you can see, we had a favorable or unchanged volume projection for about 90% of the business. This includes normal seasonal shipping in intermodal, as well as the return to some of our automotive parts business versus 2015. We're seeing slightly higher coal shipments year-over-year, as we discussed in our last call, and the Mexico Energy Reform continues to be a focus area for investment. We're already seeing increased shipments of LPGs into Mexico, and KCS believes we'll start to see the refined products business ramp up beginning in Q1 2017.
We're meeting with our customers to ensure that our plants meet their expectations as the law begins to be implemented. We're also seeing some market volatility, as refineries in Mexico have maintenance windows which may impact volume in the month ahead. And we'll continue to provide updates as we know more about the expected rollout and implementation of the new law. The automotive business is expected to grow, as our customers ask us to do more in creating solutions to support their global manufacturing footprint. 
As we've mentioned before, by 2020, Mexico will produce over 5.3 million vehicles and import another 900,000. Over 50% of this production will be added between years 2016 to 2020. We're investing in those projects that will enhance the fluidity and capacity to effectively service this important segment.
The Ag & Minerals business should have a good quarter based on the record harvest we're experiencing this year, and we believe our Industrial & Consumer segments will continue to see fierce competition in both paper and steel into 2017.
Overall, we're upbeat about the opportunities in front of us. As Jeff mentioned, we'll continue to make strategic investments focused on providing our customers with a consistent product that has reliability they can count on as they create their shipping plans into next year. We continue to focus our efforts in adding reliable and capacity -- reliable capacity and fluidity for all of the growing businesses.
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch."
30472,378157524,1056181,"Kansas City Southern, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Kansas City Southern","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start my comments on Slide 14. As Brian just reviewed a few minutes ago, both third quarter volumes and revenues declined 4%.

As Brian just reviewed a few minutes ago, both third quarter volumes and revenues declined 4%. The peso depreciation had a $12 million negative impact on revenues, while declining U.S. fuel prices negatively impacted revenues by $7 million. Fuel surcharge revenues declined $32 million due to lower fuel prices and from rebasing customer contracts.
Adjusted operating ratio increased 1.7 points to 66.9%, primarily due to incremental costs incurred during the quarter that relate to year-to-date true-ups for incentive compensation and expenses related to flooding and service interruptions during the quarter. I'll discuss those details in the next few slides.
Third quarter 2016 reported EPS of $1.12 per share was down 7% from last year, while adjusted EPS was also $1.12 and down 7%. More details on the reconciliation of reported to adjusted EPS can be found on Slide 27 in the appendix.
On Slide 15, for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2016, carloads declined 3% and revenues 5%, mostly from foreign exchange impacts and lower fuel prices. 
Reported operating ratio improved 290 basis points. Despite a challenging operating environment requiring us to manage a number of extraneous events, adjusted operating ratio improved a healthy 230 basis points, largely the benefit of $50 million in fuel excise tax credits, more than offsetting an incremental $14 million in higher incentive compensation. 
Reported EPS increased 4%, while adjusted EPS increased 3%.
Turning to Slide 16. Not only has 2016 been a challenging year from a carload and revenue perspective, but we have experienced increases in out-of-pocket costs related to various flooding-related events in all 3 quarters, increased environmental expenses and higher incentive compensation expense. 
Higher incentive compensation expense for all management employees cost a $14 million increase from the targeted 100% payout level to a higher projected payout for the full year 2016, including both the $9 million true up for the first half of 2016 and a $5 million in-period increase in third quarter. Despite those increased costs, we have improved our adjusted operating ratio by 230 basis points in the 9-month period ending September 30, 2016.
On Slide 17, this reflects foreign exchange and U.S. fuel rates for the first 3 quarters of 2016 and projections for the remainder of the year. As you can see, we continue to expect significant downward pressure on revenues as a result of peso depreciation currently expected to be 13% below 2015 levels during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we saw a similar depreciation of the peso during the third quarter which negatively impacted our revenues by $12 million.
Fuel prices are expected to be approximately the same year-over-year, and thus, fourth quarter could be the first quarter we haven't seen negative fuel impacts on revenue in quite some time.
Turning to Slide 18. Third quarter operating expenses declined $7 million or 2%. Key drivers of the decline in expense included the excise tax credit, the benefit from the depreciating peso, lower headcount and better labor productivity. Offsetting those declines were higher incentive compensation, depreciation, detour costs from flooding and higher environmental expenses.
Let me provide a little bit more color on the excise tax credit. During the quarter, we generated a $16 million fuel excise tax credit, a continuation of the credit we began realizing during the second quarter. As we indicated last quarter, this credit was established for qualifying transportation companies in Mexico and represents the beginning of the transition to world market prices, which we still expect to occur in 2018 and perhaps earlier. 
While we still don't know whether the credit will be available in 2017, the good news is the 2017 draft budget proposal presented to the Mexican Congress does reflect continuation of the credit in 2017. Congress is expected to approve the budget sometime during the fourth quarter. 
As a reminder, we include this credit in operating expense, as it directly relates to our fuel expense, which includes the applicable excise taxes we have always paid on fuel purchases, and accordingly, is included in the operating expense section of the P&L. We have included the credit as a separate line item in operating expense to provide the investors transparency and clearly see the year-over-year impact of the credit rather than netting it with fuel expense.
We actively manage fuel purchases on a daily basis on our cross-border traffic to ensure we are purchasing fuel on the most economical way to produce the lowest possible operating cost. 
Our ability to utilize the credit is dependent on a variety of factors that include having sufficient taxable income and sufficient withholding and income tax liabilities to utilize the credit, as there is no carryforward position available to us. 
We currently expect to generate approximately $15 million in additional credits during the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 19. Compensation and benefits expense went up $15 million, largely due to $16 million of increased incentive compensation.
During the quarter, we increased our accruals for incentive comp to higher payout percentages. The $7 million increase is due to 2015 payout percentages being accrued at 50% and increasing the payout to higher achievement levels in third quarter 2016.
When increasing the projected payout in 3Q, we also recorded true-up adjustments for the first 6 months to increase our accruals to the higher payout percentage, which contributed an additional $9 million year-over-year increase.
For the fourth quarter, to give you a little guidance, we currently expect incentive compensation to be $7 million higher than the fourth quarter 2015. And again, we were -- accrued at a 50% payout level in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Wage inflation is still running in the 3% to 4% range and contributed to another $4 million year-over-year increase in compensation expense. And as you can see in the bar chart, headcount continued to decline by 1%, contributing to $4 million of savings, along with various other productivity improvements.
As Jeff mentioned, we continue to have crews furloughed in the U.S., resulting in year-over-year savings, and we experienced a slight reduction in overall headcount.
Turning to Slide 20. Fuel expense declined $11 million, primarily due to peso depreciation, lower fuel prices, lower volumes and better efficiency. As you can see in the bar chart, fuel price declined both in the U.S. and Mexico, and our average consolidated price per gallon declined from $2.24 in the third quarter last year to $1.99 in the third quarter this year.
And finally, on Slide 21, our capital structure priorities continue to focus on investing in the business to generate the best growth in the rail sector. In fact, despite the downturn in the industrial economy in the past 18 months, we have grown third quarter volumes 19% since 2007 while the rest of the Class Is have experienced declining third quarter volumes on an aggregate basis of about 6%.
We will continue to focus on reinvesting our cash flow back into growing our business for the long run. And projected capital expenditures, as Pat mentioned, for 2016, continue to be in the range of $580 million to $590 million.
Finally, in May of 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. And a little more than halfway through the life of the program, we repurchased about 60% of the authorized amount at an average of $89.63 per share. We will continue to monitor economic and business conditions to determine future levels of share repurchases. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Pat."

I'll just close with a few comments to provide an overall assessment for the quarter. 
Obviously, we continue to be in a challenging business environment, as evidenced by our year-over-year declines in overall volumes. While the weakness is most evident in energy-related business, we did experience year-over-year volume decreases in 5 of our 6 major business lines during the quarter.
The good news is we are seeing sequential improvements, and once we cycle through some dramatic reduction in coal and crude oil revenues that began in early 2015, we should start to see some volume growth returning.
In spite of some unusual cost items which occurred during the third quarter, we feel very good about our overall expense management and productivity trends. We feel that the year-to-date view of operating ratio improvement is a more meaningful indicator of those trends. 
Jeff detailed a few of the specific areas of focus, but there are many more that we are working on across all departments in the company that will make us most more cost efficient and productive in the years ahead. 
I gave a presentation at a recent rail shippers' conference, at which I described the near-term business outlook as tepid, which literally means lukewarm or lacking enthusiasm. When volume growth returns, and we are confident that it will at some point, the expense controls and efficiency initiatives we are currently working on should put us in great condition to begin using terms like incremental margins again, which have been noticeably absent from our vocabulary for the past few quarters. 
Finally, we continue to be very optimistic about our long-term growth outlook based on the key growth drivers that we see impacting the KCS network in the years ahead. 
You've heard us talk about these growth drivers before, but just to reiterate. There are new auto plants in Mexico, new petrochemical facilities being built in the U.S. Gulf Coast, growth in capacity at Lázaro Cárdenas and continued growth and market share gains in the cross-border Intermodal markets will be the primary catalysts for KCS in the years had.
So with that, I'll open the mic for Q&A."

What I would tell you is we feel very comfortable with the intermodal space. As we've discussed over the last couple of quarters, one of the big shipping companies made a decision to move to an all-vessel water solution out of the Pacific into Houston area. And so that impacted our Lázaro cross-border and Lázaro inter-Mexico business. That's primarily the decline you see from an intermodal perspective. All the other segments are growing, and we feel very comfortable that we are competing well. As we've said before, we will not chase the lower trucking pricing that's out there. We're going to continue to provide the value that we do, both in security and reliability of those shipments. What I would tell you is across the board though, we feel very comfortable that, sequentially, we're going to continue to grow. It's just slower than, I think, everyone would like it to be, but it's about what we expect. And we're continuing to manage of the cost structure and the infrastructure investments according to that. So obviously, the investments in supporting the additional automotive continue. Investments in the energy segment, the refined products, all those pieces are still in place.

I'll try to outline a couple of things and give some visibility around fuel, for example, on the initiatives. We're not even complete with installs in the U.S., and we have the whole Mexico network to install fuel technology. And I've kind of provided some numbers on savings on fuel throughout the year here. So I view those things are going to continue and I'm confident that they will continue. I think on the headcount side, you're continuing to see productivity. The noise we saw in the quarter with the disruptions, as mentioned, certainly drives some additional operating expense. And so on a more normalized quarter, I think you're going to continue to see those improvements. Headcount, for me, as we've talked, with all the hiring in 2015, you're starting to see us -- kind of laps that comp. So I think in Q4, you'll continue to see the trend that we saw here in Q3. The one outlier in headcount could be in-sourced effort I talked about. So a very good financial move for us. But I think that will add about 250 and 300 heads to our kind of internal number. So that will skew just the outlook, but that's the reason that you'll see that in Q4. But all in all, very pleased with how things are progressing. I feel like we're still fairly early in kind of the productivity improvements, specially in Mexico. As we  got the headcount right sized, we've got the growth opportunity ahead of us. So I think the productivity focus will be there for us."

I think, the most important piece when you think about the competitive dynamics of Manzaneo and Lázaro, Lázaro was the only port that has a direct rail connection into the U.S. and into the rest of North America. So the addition of the At&T terminal is going to be pretty significant. If you look at what the government has said they're looking to double the initial size of the facility, they want to double the capacity of the Port. We feel very, very comfortable but that port is going to continue to grow. Now when you think about competitiveness into the inter-Mexico area, that's where we see the competition right now the truckers, the low price, there's about -- when you think about the difference between rail and truck, there's about 6% of the volume goes truck, about 40% goes rail, we're hoping that, that continues to improve as people look at the security of the rail, the number of places we can get to, on the fluidity. Obviously, Jeff talked about the big investments that we're making. It is important when you have an intermodal product should be fluid and consistent and that's where we, as a management team, we're spending all of our time because we realize that the growth opportunity there is significant, not only on Lázaro but into the U.S. So from a competitive perspective, we know the value that we bring. We under understand how to price it, we believe that it's going to continue -- tailwinds are going to go our way, as we continue to improve our fluidity. But right now we feel that we're very, very competitive in the space that we're at. But there's also this dynamic of this vessel operators that we are still dealing with and it's a global issue. It's not just Mexico, it's not just North America. And so as the vessel operators sort out probably over the next 12 to 18 months, I think we'll continue to see that [indiscernible] at Lazaro."

And José Zozaya is on the phone as well",512,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. If you look at Page 4, you'll see the lineup which I think is familiar to everyone: Jeff Songer, Brian Hancock, Mike Upchurch. And José Zozaya is on the phone as well this morning.
Let me begin my comments with Slide 5. As you saw in our press release from earlier this morning, we reported diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $1.12, which compares to $1.20 per share last year, which represents a 7% decline from 2015. 
Revenues were $604.5 million, a 4% decline from last year.
Excluding the impact of lower U.S. fuel prices on fuel surcharge revenue and a further weakening of the Mexican peso, our revenues for the quarter would have been about 1% lower than last year. Volumes were down by 4% from last year.
Our reported operating ratio for the quarter was 66.9%, which is 170 basis points higher than last year. However, this include the impacts of some onetime cost events, including higher detour expenses due to flooding in South Texas and service disruptions in Mexico, which, as we stated in our press release, had an adverse impact on revenues. In addition, those disruptions had a negative impact on cost performance during the quarter as well.
In spite of this deterioration in quarterly operating ratio, we feel very good about our overall cost performance during the quarter. Later in the presentation, Jeff Songer will talk about some of the efficiency initiatives that are underway, and Mike Upchurch will get into more detail about what we'll refer to as our normalized cost performance. Just to give you a bit of a preview, this normalized cost performance is demonstrated by looking at our year-to-date operating ratio, which as you can see from the last point on Slide 5, improved by 230 basis points from the adjusted or comparable operating ratio last year to 65%. 
Among other things, this year-to-date view shows our operating ratio performance on a basis which smooths out the impact of timing or events that would have a more pronounced impact on the results in any given quarter. Again, Mike will walk you through this in greater detail in a few moments.
Moving on to Slide 6, I wanted to briefly remind you of the recent guidance which we previously provided and show you that we are on track with that guidance. Last quarter, we told you that we were -- we expected to see sequential revenue growth from the first half to the second half of 2016, and we are confirming that view at this point, and that we expected to see mid-single-digit sequential revenue growth in the third quarter of 2016. As you saw on the previous slide, we generated sequential volume growth of 5%, which led to revenues growing by 6.4% sequentially. We are also confirming our previous guidance regarding second half 2016 automotive volume growth and our overall capital spending targets for 2016.
With that, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer."

Beginning with Slide 8, velocity for the quarter of 27.8 miles per hour improved 10% over prior year, while dwell for the quarter of 24.1 increased 6% versus prior year.
Factors impacting dwell were the July bridge outage in Rosenberg, Texas, which restricted cross-border traffic flow. The border terminals of Sanchez and Nuevo Laredo and Laredo were impacted by this event. Compounding this outage were service disruptions in Mexico during the month of July which caused multiple days of outages across the network. All major terminals in Mexico were impacted, while terminals in Sanchez, Nuevo Laredo and Laredo, already congested by the earlier Texas bridge outage, were affected further.
Our current dwell has shown improvement from the elevated levels we saw between late July to mid-September, and we look for this metric to return to more normal levels through Q4.
Moving to the operations overview on Slide 9. Focus continues on our biggest cost drivers of labor and fuel. Currently, 5% of the U.S. T&E workforce is in furlough status. Overall headcount for the quarter was down 1% versus prior year, as Mike will review in later slides. 12% of our locomotives across this system are in storage. Fuel management programs, as outlined in prior earnings discussions, continued, and we have gained another $1 million in pure fuel efficiency during Q3. 
Year-to-date, we are about 75% complete with the technology installations in the U.S., with Mexico installation work slated for 2017. 
Effective recruit management continues, with year-to-date reductions of 49%, while overtime management provided an additional $2.4 million in savings for the quarter versus prior year.
One other item to note is the completion of a mechanical in-sourcing effort that was finalized during the quarter and went into effect October 1. This represents an approximate $5 million in ongoing annual cost savings. We will recognize these benefits starting in Q4.
Moving on to capital project highlights. I would like to provide a quick update on PTC. First, I would like to acknowledge the tremendous ongoing effort by all the groups involved in this project. We plan to have a first operating subdivision in PTC revenue service in Q4 and have an aggressive implementation schedule in 2017 and 2018. 2017 will be another heavy investment year for PTC and capital spend will begin to reduce thereafter.
Construction work at the previously announced WTC/Watco SLP fluids terminal broke ground during the quarter. Design work for support facilities for the Ford and BMW automotive plants at SLP is underway. Work at the Sasol support yard facility continues and is on schedule for a late 2017 completion. 
Finally, Sanchez Yard classification tracks are on schedule to complete by year-end. This will allow additional handling of trains at Sanchez and will ease some pressure on other terminals in the network while continuing to facilitate cross-border traffic. Additional classification tracks and mechanical facilities at Sanchez will be complete by the end of 2017.
I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock."
30472,378157524,1056260,"Kansas City Southern, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Kansas City Southern","Executives","Thanks jeff, and good morning, everyone.

Our Chemical & Petroleum b",1002,"Thanks jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Page 11, where you can see our year-over-year revenue was down 4% and off 1%, excluding currency and fuel. Our carloads were also down 4% for the quarter versus last year. 
Our Chemical & Petroleum business had a record quarter with 1% year-over-year growth in revenue. Our carloads in this segment were off 4%, primarily due to shipments of fuel oil, as a customer in Mexico had a disruption in production which was partially offset by strong growth in our Plastics segment. We continue to see strength in this line of business as the plastics manufacturers in the Gulf region grow their shipments globally.
Our Industrial & Consumer business remained slow, with year-over-year decreases of 6% volume and 6% revenue, with half of the revenue decline driven by fuel and foreign exchange. This business segment continues to be negatively impacted by softness in our metals and paper segments. These businesses are experiencing stiff global completion, impacted by currency fluctuations and low truck pricing, which we believe to be unsustainable in the long term. This weakness was somewhat offset by strength in our other carload segment.
During Q3, our Ag & Mineral business saw a decrease of 1% in carloads and revenue growth of 3%, driven by strength in grain and food products, particularly in the cross-border business. We continue to see the benefit of the additional equipment serving this important business unit.
Our overall cross-border business showed strong growth of 7% for the quarter, being led by a record-breaking quarter in our automotive business and solid growth in cross-border Ag/Mineral and the Chemical & Petroleum business. More details on our cross-border franchise are included in the appendices on Page 31, 32.
Our Energy business continued to be negatively impacted by volatility in crude and frac sand. Our coal business had lapped some of the lowest numbers from last year and was slightly higher in Q3. Overall energy carloads were down 7%, and revenue was down 15% versus prior year.
Intermodal volumes were down 5%, with revenue decreasing 7% in the quarter, primarily driven by our Lázaro cross-border and Lázaro inter-Mexico business. We're seeing good growth in our cross-border franchise and non-franchise business with -- which more than offsets any general weakness in the overall U.S. market.
The intermodal business was also negatively impacted by the service interruptions early in the quarter, as customers made the decision to use trucks to augment the third quarter shipping capacity. We are optimistic that these lines will return as the current improved service bolsters customer confidence moving into 2017.
With all of the automotive plants being back online, our automotive volume increased 14%, but was impacted by a negative mix, which kept our revenue growth, adjusted for fuel and FX, at 4%.
One note is the impact of a new move we are now making from Laredo to Corpus Christi area which is driving down RPU. This is a very good piece of business with good overall length of haul, but given the way we account for the move, it has a negative impact on RPU. 
In Q4, we'll see one new facility come up to full production and another facility begin production in November. We're also seeing strong volumes at the ports' both import and export volumes, and KCS is well positioned to serve our automotive customers as they grow their business in this important segment.
From a pricing perspective, we continue to see renewals close at a positive rate year-over-year. Excluding a large customer contract from last year, which will remain unchanged in 2016, our overall core pricing came in at mid-single-digit levels. 
Intermodal remains the market segment most impacted by truck competition, but we're confident in the value we're providing and that customers will continue to return to the railroad as we move into 2017.
On Slide 12, we have provided a fourth quarter year-over-year outlook for each of the industry segments. As you can see, we had a favorable or unchanged volume projection for about 90% of the business. This includes normal seasonal shipping in intermodal, as well as the return to some of our automotive parts business versus 2015. We're seeing slightly higher coal shipments year-over-year, as we discussed in our last call, and the Mexico Energy Reform continues to be a focus area for investment. We're already seeing increased shipments of LPGs into Mexico, and KCS believes we'll start to see the refined products business ramp up beginning in Q1 2017.
We're meeting with our customers to ensure that our plants meet their expectations as the law begins to be implemented. We're also seeing some market volatility, as refineries in Mexico have maintenance windows which may impact volume in the month ahead. And we'll continue to provide updates as we know more about the expected rollout and implementation of the new law. The automotive business is expected to grow, as our customers ask us to do more in creating solutions to support their global manufacturing footprint. 
As we've mentioned before, by 2020, Mexico will produce over 5.3 million vehicles and import another 900,000. Over 50% of this production will be added between years 2016 to 2020. We're investing in those projects that will enhance the fluidity and capacity to effectively service this important segment.
The Ag & Minerals business should have a good quarter based on the record harvest we're experiencing this year, and we believe our Industrial & Consumer segments will continue to see fierce competition in both paper and steel into 2017.
Overall, we're upbeat about the opportunities in front of us. As Jeff mentioned, we'll continue to make strategic investments focused on providing our customers with a consistent product that has reliability they can count on as they create their shipping plans into next year. We continue to focus our efforts in adding reliable and capacity -- reliable capacity and fluidity for all of the growing businesses.
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch."

As Brian just reviewed a few minutes ago, both third quarter volumes and revenues declined 4%. The peso depreciation had a $12 million negative impact on revenues, while declining U.S. fuel prices negatively impacted revenues by $7 million. Fuel surcharge revenues declined $32 million due to lower fuel prices and from rebasing customer contracts.
Adjusted operating ratio increased 1.7 points to 66.9%, primarily due to incremental costs incurred during the quarter that relate to year-to-date true-ups for incentive compensation and expenses related to flooding and service interruptions during the quarter. I'll discuss those details in the next few slides.
Third quarter 2016 reported EPS of $1.12 per share was down 7% from last year, while adjusted EPS was also $1.12 and down 7%. More details on the reconciliation of reported to adjusted EPS can be found on Slide 27 in the appendix.
On Slide 15, for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2016, carloads declined 3% and revenues 5%, mostly from foreign exchange impacts and lower fuel prices. 
Reported operating ratio improved 290 basis points. Despite a challenging operating environment requiring us to manage a number of extraneous events, adjusted operating ratio improved a healthy 230 basis points, largely the benefit of $50 million in fuel excise tax credits, more than offsetting an incremental $14 million in higher incentive compensation. 
Reported EPS increased 4%, while adjusted EPS increased 3%.
Turning to Slide 16. Not only has 2016 been a challenging year from a carload and revenue perspective, but we have experienced increases in out-of-pocket costs related to various flooding-related events in all 3 quarters, increased environmental expenses and higher incentive compensation expense. 
Higher incentive compensation expense for all management employees cost a $14 million increase from the targeted 100% payout level to a higher projected payout for the full year 2016, including both the $9 million true up for the first half of 2016 and a $5 million in-period increase in third quarter. Despite those increased costs, we have improved our adjusted operating ratio by 230 basis points in the 9-month period ending September 30, 2016.
On Slide 17, this reflects foreign exchange and U.S. fuel rates for the first 3 quarters of 2016 and projections for the remainder of the year. As you can see, we continue to expect significant downward pressure on revenues as a result of peso depreciation currently expected to be 13% below 2015 levels during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we saw a similar depreciation of the peso during the third quarter which negatively impacted our revenues by $12 million.
Fuel prices are expected to be approximately the same year-over-year, and thus, fourth quarter could be the first quarter we haven't seen negative fuel impacts on revenue in quite some time.
Turning to Slide 18. Third quarter operating expenses declined $7 million or 2%. Key drivers of the decline in expense included the excise tax credit, the benefit from the depreciating peso, lower headcount and better labor productivity. Offsetting those declines were higher incentive compensation, depreciation, detour costs from flooding and higher environmental expenses.
Let me provide a little bit more color on the excise tax credit. During the quarter, we generated a $16 million fuel excise tax credit, a continuation of the credit we began realizing during the second quarter. As we indicated last quarter, this credit was established for qualifying transportation companies in Mexico and represents the beginning of the transition to world market prices, which we still expect to occur in 2018 and perhaps earlier. 
While we still don't know whether the credit will be available in 2017, the good news is the 2017 draft budget proposal presented to the Mexican Congress does reflect continuation of the credit in 2017. Congress is expected to approve the budget sometime during the fourth quarter. 
As a reminder, we include this credit in operating expense, as it directly relates to our fuel expense, which includes the applicable excise taxes we have always paid on fuel purchases, and accordingly, is included in the operating expense section of the P&L. We have included the credit as a separate line item in operating expense to provide the investors transparency and clearly see the year-over-year impact of the credit rather than netting it with fuel expense.
We actively manage fuel purchases on a daily basis on our cross-border traffic to ensure we are purchasing fuel on the most economical way to produce the lowest possible operating cost. 
Our ability to utilize the credit is dependent on a variety of factors that include having sufficient taxable income and sufficient withholding and income tax liabilities to utilize the credit, as there is no carryforward position available to us. 
We currently expect to generate approximately $15 million in additional credits during the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 19. Compensation and benefits expense went up $15 million, largely due to $16 million of increased incentive compensation.
During the quarter, we increased our accruals for incentive comp to higher payout percentages. The $7 million increase is due to 2015 payout percentages being accrued at 50% and increasing the payout to higher achievement levels in third quarter 2016.
When increasing the projected payout in 3Q, we also recorded true-up adjustments for the first 6 months to increase our accruals to the higher payout percentage, which contributed an additional $9 million year-over-year increase.
For the fourth quarter, to give you a little guidance, we currently expect incentive compensation to be $7 million higher than the fourth quarter 2015. And again, we were -- accrued at a 50% payout level in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Wage inflation is still running in the 3% to 4% range and contributed to another $4 million year-over-year increase in compensation expense. And as you can see in the bar chart, headcount continued to decline by 1%, contributing to $4 million of savings, along with various other productivity improvements.
As Jeff mentioned, we continue to have crews furloughed in the U.S., resulting in year-over-year savings, and we experienced a slight reduction in overall headcount.
Turning to Slide 20. Fuel expense declined $11 million, primarily due to peso depreciation, lower fuel prices, lower volumes and better efficiency. As you can see in the bar chart, fuel price declined both in the U.S. and Mexico, and our average consolidated price per gallon declined from $2.24 in the third quarter last year to $1.99 in the third quarter this year.
And finally, on Slide 21, our capital structure priorities continue to focus on investing in the business to generate the best growth in the rail sector. In fact, despite the downturn in the industrial economy in the past 18 months, we have grown third quarter volumes 19% since 2007 while the rest of the Class Is have experienced declining third quarter volumes on an aggregate basis of about 6%.
We will continue to focus on reinvesting our cash flow back into growing our business for the long run. And projected capital expenditures, as Pat mentioned, for 2016, continue to be in the range of $580 million to $590 million.
Finally, in May of 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. And a little more than halfway through the life of the program, we repurchased about 60% of the authorized amount at an average of $89.63 per share. We will continue to monitor economic and business conditions to determine future levels of share repurchases. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Pat."

I'll just close with a few comments to provide an overall assessment for the quarter. 
Obviously, we continue to be in a challenging business environment, as evidenced by our year-over-year declines in overall volumes. While the weakness is most evident in energy-related business, we did experience year-over-year volume decreases in 5 of our 6 major business lines during the quarter.
The good news is we are seeing sequential improvements, and once we cycle through some dramatic reduction in coal and crude oil revenues that began in early 2015, we should start to see some volume growth returning.
In spite of some unusual cost items which occurred during the third quarter, we feel very good about our overall expense management and productivity trends. We feel that the year-to-date view of operating ratio improvement is a more meaningful indicator of those trends. 
Jeff detailed a few of the specific areas of focus, but there are many more that we are working on across all departments in the company that will make us most more cost efficient and productive in the years ahead. 
I gave a presentation at a recent rail shippers' conference, at which I described the near-term business outlook as tepid, which literally means lukewarm or lacking enthusiasm. When volume growth returns, and we are confident that it will at some point, the expense controls and efficiency initiatives we are currently working on should put us in great condition to begin using terms like incremental margins again, which have been noticeably absent from our vocabulary for the past few quarters. 
Finally, we continue to be very optimistic about our long-term growth outlook based on the key growth drivers that we see impacting the KCS network in the years ahead. 
You've heard us talk about these growth drivers before, but just to reiterate. There are new auto plants in Mexico, new petrochemical facilities being built in the U.S. Gulf Coast, growth in capacity at Lázaro Cárdenas and continued growth and market share gains in the cross-border Intermodal markets will be the primary catalysts for KCS in the years had.
So with that, I'll open the mic for Q&A."

What I would tell you is we feel very comfortable with the intermodal space. As we've discussed over the last couple of quarters, one of the big shipping companies made a decision to move to an all-vessel water solution out of the Pacific into Houston area. And so that impacted our Lázaro cross-border and Lázaro inter-Mexico business. That's primarily the decline you see from an intermodal perspective. All the other segments are growing, and we feel very comfortable that we are competing well. As we've said before, we will not chase the lower trucking pricing that's out there. We're going to continue to provide the value that we do, both in security and reliability of those shipments. What I would tell you is across the board though, we feel very comfortable that, sequentially, we're going to continue to grow. It's just slower than, I think, everyone would like it to be, but it's about what we expect. And we're continuing to manage of the cost structure and the infrastructure investments according to that. So obviously, the investments in supporting the additional automotive continue. Investments in the energy segment, the refined products, all those pieces are still in place. So the story is pretty much the same, except for that one intermodal move that took a rail move and made it into a water move into the Houston area."

So I view those things are going to continue and I'm confident that they will continue. I think on the headcount side, you're continuing to see productivity. The noise we saw in the quarter with the disruptions, as mentioned, certainly drives some additional operating expense. And so on a more normalized quarter, I think you're going to continue to see those improvements. Headcount, for me, as we've talked, with all the hiring in 2015, you're starting to see us -- kind of laps that comp. So I think in Q4, you'll continue to see the trend that we saw here in Q3. The one outlier in headcount could be in-sourced effort I talked about. So a very good financial move for us. But I think that will add about 250 and 300 heads to our kind of internal number. So that will skew just the outlook, but that's the reason that you'll see that in Q4. But all in all, very pleased with how things are progressing. I feel like we're still fairly early in kind of the productivity improvements, specially in Mexico. As we  got the headcount right sized, we've got the growth opportunity ahead of us.

And so we're kind of cautiously optimistic that we'll tend to stay where we're at and continue to move effectively with the facilities that we do support. But I don't think any -- there's going to be any wild swings down or up, at least that we can see, in the near term future. Obviously, there -- it's hot in Texas, and that's good. These are facilities that come on from a variable kilowatt-age perspective, so we think that's going to continue. But overall, we don't see a big surge in demand over the next quarter."

But that is the area that we talked about. The Lázaro inter-Mexico and Lázaro cross-border piece of the business that has been off this year primarily due to the decision of one of our customers to move that freight completely by vessel up into the Houston area. And so that volume is not moving at all through the ports. So if it were to move back, obviously, that will be beneficial to us.

I mean, I think the most important piece when you think about the competitive dynamics of Manzanillo and Lázaro, Lázaro was the only port that has a direct rail connection into the U.S. and into the rest of North America. So the addition of the APMT terminal is going to be pretty significant. If you look at what the government has said, they're looking to double the initial size of the facility, they want to double the capacity of the Port. We feel very, very comfortable that, that port is going to continue to grow. Now when you think about competitiveness into the inter-Mexico area, that's where we see the competition right now. The truckers and the low price, there's about -- when you think about the difference between rail and truck, there's about 60% of the volume goes truck, about 40% goes rail. We're hoping that, that continues to improve as people look at the security of the rail, the number of places we can get to and the fluidity. Obviously, Jeff talked about the big investments that we're making. It is important, when you have an intermodal product, to be fluid and consistent. And that's where we, as a management team, are spending all of our time because we realize that the growth opportunity there is significant not only out of Lázaro, but into the U.S. So from a competitive perspective, we know the value that we bring. We understand how to price it. We believe that it's going to continue to -- the tailwinds are going to go our way as we continue to improve our fluidity. But right now, we feel like we're very, very competitive in the space that we're at. But there's also this dynamic of the vessel operators that we're still dealing with. And it's a global issue, it's not just Mexico, it's not just North America. And so as the vessel operators sort out probably over the next 12 to 18 months, I think we'll continue to see that [indiscernible] at Lazaro."

If you look at Page 4, you'll see the lineup, which I think is familiar to everyone: Jeff Songer, Brian Hancock, Mike Upchurch. And José Zozaya is on the phone as well this morning.
Let me begin my comments with Slide 5. As you saw in our press release from earlier this morning, we reported diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $1.12, which compares to $1.20 per share last year, which represents a 7% decline from 2015. 
Revenues were $604.5 million, a 4% decline from last year.
Excluding the impact of lower U.S. fuel prices on fuel surcharge revenue and a further weakening of the Mexican peso, our revenues for the quarter would have been about 1% lower than last year. Volumes were down by 4% from last year.
Our reported operating ratio for the quarter was 66.9%, which is 170 basis points higher than last year. However, this include the impacts of some onetime cost events, including higher detour expenses due to flooding in South Texas and service disruptions in Mexico, which, as we stated in our press release, had an adverse impact on revenues. In addition, those disruptions had a negative impact on cost performance during the quarter as well.
In spite of this deterioration in quarterly operating ratio, we feel very good about our overall cost performance during the quarter. Later in the presentation, Jeff Songer will talk about some of the efficiency initiatives that are underway, and Mike Upchurch will get into more detail about what we'll refer to as our normalized cost performance. Just to give you a bit of a preview, this normalized cost performance is demonstrated by looking at our year-to-date operating ratio, which as you can see from the last point on Slide 5, improved by 230 basis points from the adjusted or comparable operating ratio last year to 65%. 
Among other things, this year-to-date view shows our operating ratio performance on a basis which smooths out the impact of timing or events that would have a more pronounced impact on the results in any given quarter. Again, Mike will walk you through this in greater detail in a few moments.
Moving on to Slide 6, I wanted to briefly remind you of the recent guidance which we previously provided and show you that we are on track with that guidance. Last quarter, we told you that we were -- we expected to see sequential revenue growth from the first half to the second half of 2016, and we are confirming that view at this point, and that we expected to see mid-single-digit sequential revenue growth in the third quarter of 2016. As you saw on the previous slide, we generated sequential volume growth of 5%, which led to revenues growing by 6.4% sequentially. We are also confirming our previous guidance regarding second half 2016 automotive volume growth and our overall capital spending targets for 2016.
With that, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer."

Beginning with Slide 8, velocity for the quarter of 27.8 miles per hour improved 10% over prior year, while dwell for the quarter of 24.1 increased 6% versus prior year.
Factors impacting dwell were the July bridge outage in Rosenberg, Texas, which restricted cross-border traffic flow. The border terminals of Sanchez, Nuevo Laredo and Laredo were impacted by this event. Compounding this outage were service disruptions in Mexico during the month of July, which caused multiple days of outages across the network. All major terminals in Mexico were impacted, while terminals in Sanchez, Nuevo Laredo and Laredo, already congested by the earlier Texas bridge outage, were affected further.
Current dwell has shown improvement from the elevated levels we saw between late July to mid-September, and we look for this metric to return to more normal levels through Q4.
Moving to the operations overview on Slide 9. Focus continues on our biggest cost drivers of labor and fuel. Currently, 5% of the U.S. T&E workforce is in furlough status. Overall headcount for the quarter was down 1% versus prior year, as Mike will review in later slides. 12% of our locomotives across the system are in storage. Fuel management programs, as outlined in prior earnings discussions, continued, and we have gained another $1 million in pure fuel efficiency during Q3. 
Year-to-date, we are about 75% complete with the technology installations in the U.S., with Mexico installation work slated for 2017. 
Effective recruit management continues, with year-to-date reductions of 49%, while overtime management provided an additional $2.4 million in savings for the quarter versus prior year.
One other item to note is the completion of a mechanical in-sourcing effort that was finalized during the quarter and went into effect October 1. This represents an approximate $5 million in ongoing annual cost savings. We will recognize these benefits starting in Q4.
Moving on to capital project highlights. I would like to provide a quick update on PTC. First, I would like to acknowledge the tremendous ongoing effort by all of the groups involved in this project. We plan to have a first operating subdivision in PTC revenue service in Q4 and have an aggressive implementation schedule in 2017 and 2018. 2017 will be another heavy investment year for PTC, and capital spend will begin to reduce thereafter.
Construction work at the previously announced WTC/Watco SLP fluids terminal broke ground during the quarter. Design work for support facilities for the Ford and BMW automotive plants at SLP is underway. Work at the Sasol support yard facility continues and is on schedule for a late 2017 completion. 
Finally, Sanchez Yard classification tracks are on schedule to complete by year-end. This will allow additional handling of trains at Sanchez and will ease some pressure on other terminals in the network while continuing to facilitate cross-border traffic. Additional classification tracks and mechanical facilities at Sanchez will be complete by the end of 2017.
I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock."
30472,378157524,1056351,"Kansas City Southern, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Kansas City Southern","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Page 11, where you can see our year-over-year revenue was down 4% and off 1% excluding currency and fuel. Our carloads were also down 4% for the quarter versus last year. Our Chemical & Petroleum b",1005,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Page 11, where you can see our year-over-year revenue was down 4% and off 1% excluding currency and fuel. Our carloads were also down 4% for the quarter versus last year. 
Our Chemical & Petroleum business had a record quarter with 1% year-over-year growth in revenue. Our carloads in this segment were off 4%, primarily due to shipments of fuel oil, as a customer in Mexico had a disruption in production, which was partially offset by strong growth in our Plastics segment. We continue to see strength in this line of business as the plastics manufacturers in the Gulf region grow their shipments globally.
Our Industrial & Consumer business remained slow, with year-over-year decreases of 6% volume and 6% revenue, with half of the revenue decline driven by fuel and foreign exchange. This business segment continues to be negatively impacted by softness in our metals and paper segments. These businesses are experiencing stiff global completion, impacted by currency fluctuations and low truck pricing, which we believe to be unsustainable in the long term. This weakness was somewhat offset by strength in our other carload segment.
During Q3, our Ag & Mineral business saw a decrease of 1% in carloads and revenue growth of 3%, driven by strength in grain and food products, particularly in the cross-border business. We continue to see the benefit of the additional equipment serving this important business unit.
Our overall cross-border business showed strong growth of 7% for the quarter, being led by a record-breaking quarter in our automotive business and solid growth in cross-border Ag/Mineral and the Chemical & Petroleum business. More details on our cross-border franchise are included in the appendices on Page 31 and 32.
Our Energy business continued to be negatively impacted by volatility in crude and frac sand. Our coal business had lapped some of the lowest numbers from last year and was slightly higher in Q3. Overall energy carloads were down 7%, and revenue was down 15% versus prior year.
Intermodal volumes were down 5%, with revenue decreasing 7% in the quarter, primarily driven by our Lázaro cross-border and Lázaro inter-Mexico business. We're seeing good growth in our cross-border franchise and non-franchise business with -- which more than offsets any general weakness in the overall U.S. market.
The intermodal business was also negatively impacted by the service interruptions earlier in the quarter, as customers made the decision to use trucks to augment their third quarter shipping capacity. We are optimistic that these volumes will return as the current improved service bolsters customer confidence moving into 2017.
With all of the automotive plants being back online, our automotive volume increased 14%, but was impacted by a negative mix, which kept our revenue growth, adjusted for fuel and FX, at 4%.
One note is the impact of a new move we are now making from Laredo to Corpus Christi area, which is driving down RPU. This is a very good piece of business with good overall length of haul, but given the way we account for the move, it has a negative impact on RPU. 
In Q4, we'll see one new facility come up to full production and another facility begin production in November. We're also seeing strong volumes at the ports, both import and export volumes, and KCS is well positioned to serve our automotive customers as they grow their business in this important segment.
From a pricing perspective, we continue to see renewals close at the positive rate year-over-year. Excluding a large customer contract from last year, which will remain unchanged in 2016, our overall core pricing came in at mid-single-digit levels. 
Intermodal remains the market segment most impacted by truck competition, but we're confident in the value we're providing and that customers will continue to return to the railroad as we move into 2017.
On Slide 12, we have provided a fourth quarter year-over-year outlook for each of the industry segments. As you can see, we had a favorable or unchanged volume projection for about 90% of the business. This includes normal seasonal shipping in intermodal, as well as the return of some of our automotive parts business versus 2015. We're seeing slightly higher coal shipments year-over-year, as we discussed on our last call, and the Mexico Energy Reform continues to be a focus area for investment. We're already seeing increased shipments of LPGs into Mexico, and KCS believes we'll start to see the refined products business ramp up beginning in Q1 2017.
We're meeting with our customers to ensure that our plants meet their expectation as the law begins to be implemented. We're also seeing some market volatility, as refineries in Mexico have maintenance windows which may impact volume in the month ahead. And we'll continue to provide updates as we know more about the expected rollout and implementation of the new law. The automotive business is expected to grow, as our customers continue to ask us to do more in creating solutions to support their global manufacturing footprint. 
As we've mentioned before, by 2020, Mexico will produce over 5.3 million vehicles and import another 900,000. Over 50% of this production will be added between years 2016 to 2020. We're investing in those projects that will enhance the fluidity and capacity to effectively service this important segment.
The Ag & Minerals business should have a good quarter based on the record harvest we're experiencing this year, and we believe our Industrial & Consumer segments will continue to see fierce competition in both paper and steel into 2017.
Overall, we're upbeat about the opportunities in front of us. As Jeff mentioned, we'll continue to make strategic investments focused on providing our customers with a consistent product that has reliability they can count on as they create their shipping plans into next year. We continue to focus our efforts in adding reliable and capacity -- reliable capacity and fluidity for all of the growing businesses.
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch."
30472,378157524,1056351,"Kansas City Southern, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Kansas City Southern","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start my comments on Slide 14. As Brian just reviewed a few minutes ago, both third quarter volumes and revenues declined 4%. The peso depreciation had a $12 million negative impact on revenues, whil",1259,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start my comments on Slide 14. As Brian just reviewed a few minutes ago, both third quarter volumes and revenues declined 4%. The peso depreciation had a $12 million negative impact on revenues, while declining U.S. fuel prices negatively impacted revenues by $7 million. Fuel surcharge revenues declined $32 million due to lower fuel prices and from rebasing customer contracts.
Adjusted operating ratio increased 1.7 points to 66.9%, primarily due to incremental costs incurred during the quarter that relate to year-to-date true-ups for incentive compensation and expenses related to flooding and service interruptions during the quarter. I'll discuss those details in the next few slides.
Third quarter 2016 reported EPS of $1.12 per share was down 7% from last year, while adjusted EPS was also $1.12 and down 7%. More details on the reconciliation of reported to adjusted EPS can be found on Slide 27 in the appendix.
On Slide 15, for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2016, carloads declined 3% and revenues 5%, mostly from foreign exchange impacts and lower fuel prices. 
Reported operating ratio improved 290 basis points. Despite a challenging operating environment requiring us to manage a number of extraneous events, adjusted operating ratio improved a healthy 230 basis points, largely the benefit of $50 million in fuel excise tax credits, more than offsetting an incremental $14 million in higher incentive compensation. 
Reported EPS increased 4%, while adjusted EPS increased 3%.
Turning to Slide 16. Not only has 2016 been a challenging year from a carload and revenue perspective, but we have experienced increases in out-of-pocket costs related to various flooding-related events in all 3 quarters, increased environmental expenses and higher incentive compensation expense. 
Higher incentive compensation expense for all management employees caused a $14 million increase from the targeted 100% payout level to a higher projected payout for the full year 2016, including both the $9 million true-up for the first half of 2016 and a $5 million in-period increase in third quarter. Despite those increased costs, we have improved our adjusted operating ratio by 230 basis points in the 9-month period ending September 30, 2016.
On Slide 17, this reflects foreign exchange and U.S. fuel rates for the first 3 quarters of 2016 and projections for the remainder of the year. As you can see, we continue to expect significant downward pressure on revenues as a result of peso depreciation currently expected to be 13% below 2015 levels during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we saw similar depreciation of the peso during the third quarter, which negatively impacted our revenues by $12 million.
Fuel prices are expected to be approximately the same year-over-year, and thus, fourth quarter could be the first quarter we haven't seen negative fuel impacts on revenue in quite some time.
Turning to Slide 18. Third quarter operating expenses declined $7 million or 2%. Key drivers of the decline in expense included the excise tax credit, the benefit from the depreciating peso, lower headcount and better labor productivity. Offsetting those declines were higher incentive compensation, depreciation, detour costs from flooding and higher environmental expenses.
Let me provide a little bit more color on the excise tax credit. During the quarter, we generated a $16 million fuel excise tax credit, a continuation of the credit we began realizing during the second quarter. As we indicated last quarter, this credit was established for qualifying transportation companies in Mexico and represents the beginning of the transition to world market prices, which we still expect to occur in 2018 and perhaps earlier. 
While we still don't know whether the credit will be available in 2017, the good news is the 2017 draft budget proposal presented to the Mexican Congress does reflect continuation of the credit in 2017. Congress is expected to approve the budget sometime during the fourth quarter. 
As a reminder, we include this credit in operating expense, as it directly relates to our fuel expense, which includes the applicable excise taxes we have always paid on fuel purchases, and accordingly, is included in the operating expense section of the P&L. We have included the credit as a separate line item in operating expense to provide investors transparency and clearly see the year-over-year impact of the credit rather than netting it with fuel expense.
We actively manage fuel purchases on a daily basis on our cross-border traffic to ensure we are purchasing fuel in the most economical way to produce the lowest possible operating cost. 
Our ability to utilize the credit is dependent on a variety of factors that include having sufficient taxable income and sufficient withholding and income tax liabilities to utilize the credit, as there is no carryforward provision available to us. 
We currently expect to generate approximately $15 million in additional credits during the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 19. Compensation and benefits expense went up $15 million, largely due to $16 million of increased incentive compensation.
During the quarter, we increased our accruals for incentive comp to higher payout percentages. The $7 million increase is due to 2015 payout percentages being accrued at 50% and increasing the payout to higher achievement levels in third quarter 2016.
When increasing the projected payout in 3Q, we also recorded true-up adjustments for the first 6 months to increase our accruals to the higher payout percentage, which contributed an additional $9 million year-over-year increase.
For the fourth quarter, to give you a little guidance, we currently expect incentive compensation to be $7 million higher than the fourth quarter 2015. And again, we were -- accrued at a 50% payout level in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Wage inflation is still running in the 3% to 4% range and contributed to another $4 million year-over-year increase in compensation expense. And as you can see in the bar chart, headcount continued to decline by 1%, contributing to $4 million of savings, along with various other productivity improvements.
As Jeff mentioned, we continue to have crews furloughed in the U.S., resulting in year-over-year savings, and we experienced a slight reduction in overall headcount.
Turning to Slide 20. Fuel expense declined $11 million, primarily due to peso depreciation, lower fuel prices, lower volumes and better efficiency. As you can see in the bar chart, fuel price declined both in the U.S. and Mexico, and our average consolidated price per gallon declined from $2.24 in the third quarter last year to $1.99 in the third quarter this year.
And finally, on Slide 21, our capital structure priorities continue to focus on investing in the business to generate the best growth in the rail sector. In fact, despite the downturn in the industrial economy in the past 18 months, we have grown third quarter volumes 19% since 2007, while the rest of the Class Is have experienced declining third quarter volumes on an aggregate basis of about 6%.
We will continue to focus on reinvesting our cash flow back into growing our business for the long run. And projected capital expenditures, as Pat mentioned, for 2016, continue to be in the range of $580 million to $590 million.
Finally, in May of 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. And a little more than halfway through the life of the program, we have repurchased about 60% of the authorized amount at an average of $89.63 per share. We will continue to monitor economic and business conditions to determine future levels of share repurchases. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Pat."

I'll just close with a few comments to provide an overall assessment for the quarter. 
Obviously, we continue to be in a challenging business environment, as evidenced by our year-over-year declines in overall volumes. While the weakness is most evident in energy-related business, we did experience year-over-year volume decreases in 5 of our 6 major business lines during the quarter.
The good news is we are seeing sequential improvements, and once we cycle through some dramatic reduction in coal and crude oil revenues that began in early 2015, we should start to see some volume growth returning.
In spite of some unusual cost items which occurred during the third quarter, we feel very good about our overall expense management and productivity trends. We feel that the year-to-date view of operating ratio improvement is a more meaningful indicator of those trends. 
Jeff detailed a few of the specific areas of focus, but there are many more that we are working on across all departments in the company that will make us most more cost efficient and productive in the years ahead. 
I gave a presentation at a recent rail shippers' conference, at which I described the near-term business outlook as tepid, which literally means lukewarm or lacking enthusiasm. When volume growth returns, and we are confident that it will at some point, the expense controls and efficiency initiatives we are currently working on should put us in great condition to begin using terms like incremental margins again, which have been noticeably absent from our vocabulary for the past few quarters. 
Finally, we continue to be very optimistic about our long-term growth outlook based on the key growth drivers that we see impacting the KCS network in the years ahead. 
You've heard us talk about these growth drivers before, but just to reiterate. There are new auto plants in Mexico, new petrochemical facilities being built in the U.S. Gulf Coast, growth in capacity at Lázaro Cárdenas and continued growth and market share gains in the cross-border Intermodal markets will be the primary catalysts for KCS in the years ahead.
So with that, I'll open the mic for Q&A."

What I would tell you is we feel very comfortable with the intermodal space. As we've discussed over the last couple of quarters, one of the big shipping companies made a decision to move to an all-vessel water solution out of the Pacific into Houston area. And so that impacted our Lázaro cross-border and Lázaro inter-Mexico business. That's primarily the decline you see from an intermodal perspective. All the other segments are growing, and we feel very comfortable that we are competing well. As we've said before, we will not chase the lower trucking pricing that's out there. We're going to continue to provide the value that we do, both in security and reliability of those shipments. What I would tell you is across the board, though, we feel very comfortable that, sequentially, we're going to continue to grow. It's just slower than, I think, everyone would like it to be, but it's about what we expect. And we're continuing to manage the cost structure and the infrastructure investments according to that. So obviously, the investments in supporting the additional automotive continue. The investments in the energy segment, the refined products, all those pieces are still in place. So the story is pretty much the same, except for that one intermodal move that took a rail move and made it into a water move into the Houston area."

I think on the headcount side, you're continuing to see productivity. The noise we saw in the quarter with the disruptions, as mentioned, certainly drives some additional operating expense. And so on a more normalized quarter, I think you're going to continue to see those improvements. Headcount, for me, as we've talked, with all the hiring in 2015, you're starting to see us kind of lapse that comp. So I think in Q4, you'll continue to see the trends that we saw here in Q3. The one outlier in headcount could be the in-sourced effort I talked about. So a very good financial move for us. But I think that will add about 250 and 300 heads to our kind of internal number. So that will skew just the outlook, but that's the reason that you'll see that in Q4. But all in all, very pleased with how things are progressing. I feel like we're still fairly early in kind of the productivity improvements. Especially in Mexico, as we got the headcount rightsized, we've got the growth opportunity ahead of us.

If we see a quarter where we don't have those kinds of influences, then we think we can see some continued benefit of these initiatives. Jeff mentioned the in-sourcing of the mechanical function in Mexico, which will create a bump in headcount for the quarter, but net effect on operating income and profitability will be positive. We'll start to see that in the fourth quarter. And in the absence of events that we don't control, we think there is room to improve the operating ratio in the fourth quarter and beyond."

I mean, I think the most important piece when you think about the competitive dynamics of Manzanillo and Lázaro, Lázaro is the only port that has a direct rail connection into the U.S. and into the rest of North America. So the addition of the APMT terminal is going to be pretty significant. If you look at what the government has said, they're looking to double the initial size of the facility. They want to double the capacity of the port. We feel very, very comfortable that, that port is going to continue to grow. Now when you think about competitiveness into the inter-Mexico area, that's where we see the competition right now. The truckers and the low price, there's about -- when you think about the difference between rail and truck, there's about 60% of the volume goes truck, about 40% goes rail. We're hoping that, that continues to improve as people look at the security of the rail, the number of places we can get to and the fluidity. Obviously, Jeff talked about the big investments that we're making. It is important, when you have an intermodal product, to be fluid and consistent. And that's where we, as a management team, are spending all of our time because we realize that the growth opportunity there is significant, not only out of Lázaro, but into the U.S. So from a competitive perspective, we know the value that we bring. We understand how to price it. We believe that it's going to continue to -- the tailwinds are going to go our way as we continue to improve our fluidity. But right now, we feel like we're very, very competitive in the space that we're at. But there's also this dynamic of the vessel operators that we're still dealing with. And it's a global issue. It's not just Mexico. It's not just North America. And so as the vessel operators sort out, probably over the next 12 to 18 months, I think we'll continue to see that port grow at Lazaro."

If you look at Page 4, you'll see the lineup, which I think is familiar to everyone: Jeff Songer, Brian Hancock, Mike Upchurch. And José Zozaya is on the phone as well this morning.
Let me begin my comments with Slide 5. As you saw in our press release from earlier this morning, we reported diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $1.12, which compares to $1.20 per share last year, which represents a 7% decline from 2015. 
Revenues were $604.5 million, a 4% decline from last year.
Excluding the impact of lower U.S. fuel prices on fuel surcharge revenue and a further weakening of the Mexican peso, our revenues for the quarter would have been about 1% lower than last year. Volumes were down by 4% from last year.
Our reported operating ratio for the quarter was 66.9%, which is 170 basis points higher than last year. However, this include the impacts of some onetime cost events, including higher detour expenses due to flooding in South Texas and service disruptions in Mexico, which, as we stated in our press release, had an adverse impact on revenues. In addition, those disruptions had a negative impact on cost performance during the quarter as well.
In spite of this deterioration in quarterly operating ratio, we feel very good about our overall cost performance during the quarter. Later in the presentation, Jeff Songer will talk about some of the efficiency initiatives that are underway, and Mike Upchurch will get into more detail about what we'll refer to as our normalized cost performance. Just to give you a bit of a preview, this normalized cost performance is demonstrated by looking at our year-to-date operating ratio, which as you can see from the last point on Slide 5, improved by 230 basis points from the adjusted or comparable operating ratio last year to 65%. 
Among other things, this year-to-date view shows our operating ratio performance on a basis which smooths out the impact of timing or events that would have a more pronounced impact on the results in any given quarter. Again, Mike will walk you through this in greater detail in a few moments.
Moving on to Slide 6, I wanted to briefly remind you of the recent guidance which we previously provided and show you that we are on track with that guidance. Last quarter, we told you that we were -- we expected to see sequential revenue growth from the first half to the second half of 2016, and we are confirming that view at this point, and that we expected to see mid-single-digit sequential revenue growth in the third quarter of 2016. As you saw on the previous slide, we generated sequential volume growth of 5%, which led to revenues growing by 6.4% sequentially. We are also confirming our previous guidance regarding second half 2016 automotive volume growth and our overall capital spending targets for 2016.
With that, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer."

Beginning with Slide 8, velocity for the quarter of 27.8 miles per hour improved 10% over prior year, while dwell for the quarter of 24.1 increased 6% versus prior year.
Factors impacting dwell were the July bridge outage in Rosenberg, Texas, which restricted cross-border traffic flow. The border terminals of Sanchez, Nuevo Laredo and Laredo were impacted by this event. Compounding this outage were service disruptions in Mexico during the month of July, which caused multiple days of outages across the network. All major terminals in Mexico were impacted, while terminals in Sanchez, Nuevo Laredo and Laredo, already congested by the earlier Texas bridge outage, were affected further.
Current dwell has shown improvement from the elevated levels we saw between late July to mid-September, and we look for this metric to return to more normal levels through Q4.
Moving to the operations overview on Slide 9. Focus continues on our biggest cost drivers of labor and fuel. Currently, 5% of the U.S. T&E workforce is in furlough status. Overall headcount for the quarter was down 1% versus prior year, as Mike will review in later slides. 12% of our locomotives across the system are in storage. Fuel management programs, as outlined in prior earnings discussions, continued, and we have gained another $1 million in pure fuel efficiency during Q3. 
Year-to-date, we are about 75% complete with the technology installations in the U.S., with Mexico installation work slated for 2017. 
Effective recruit management continues, with year-to-date reductions of 49%, while overtime management provided an additional $2.4 million in savings for the quarter versus prior year.
One other item to note is the completion of a mechanical in-sourcing effort that was finalized during the quarter and went into effect October 1. This represents an approximate $5 million in ongoing annual cost savings. We will recognize these benefits starting in Q4.
Moving on to capital project highlights. I would like to provide a quick update on PTC. First, I would like to acknowledge the tremendous ongoing effort by all of the groups involved in this project. We plan to have a first operating subdivision in PTC revenue service in Q4 and have an aggressive implementation schedule in 2017 and 2018. 2017 will be another heavy investment year for PTC, and capital spend will begin to reduce thereafter.
Construction work at the previously announced WTC/Watco SLP fluids terminal broke ground during the quarter. Design work for support facilities for the Ford and BMW automotive plants at SLP is underway. Work at the Sasol support yard facility continues and is on schedule for a late 2017 completion. 
Finally, Sanchez Yard classification tracks are on schedule to complete by year-end. This will allow additional handling of trains at Sanchez and will ease some pressure on other terminals in the network while continuing to facilitate cross-border traffic. Additional classification tracks and mechanical facilities at Sanchez will be complete by the end of 2017.
I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock."

Our Chemical & Petroleum b",1005,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Page 11, where you can see our year-over-year revenue was down 4% and off 1% excluding currency and fuel. Our carloads were also down 4% for the quarter versus last year. 
Our Chemical & Petroleum business had a record quarter with 1% year-over-year growth in revenue. Our carloads in this segment were off 4%, primarily due to shipments of fuel oil, as a customer in Mexico had a disruption in production, which was partially offset by strong growth in our Plastics segment. We continue to see strength in this line of business as the plastics manufacturers in the Gulf region grow their shipments globally.
Our Industrial & Consumer business remained slow, with year-over-year decreases of 6% volume and 6% revenue, with half of the revenue decline driven by fuel and foreign exchange. This business segment continues to be negatively impacted by softness in our metals and paper segments. These businesses are experiencing stiff global completion, impacted by currency fluctuations and low truck pricing, which we believe to be unsustainable in the long term. This weakness was somewhat offset by strength in our other carload segment.
During Q3, our Ag & Mineral business saw a decrease of 1% in carloads and revenue growth of 3%, driven by strength in grain and food products, particularly in the cross-border business. We continue to see the benefit of the additional equipment serving this important business unit.
Our overall cross-border business showed strong growth of 7% for the quarter, being led by a record-breaking quarter in our automotive business and solid growth in cross-border Ag/Mineral and the Chemical & Petroleum business. More details on our cross-border franchise are included in the appendices on Page 31 and 32.
Our Energy business continued to be negatively impacted by volatility in crude and frac sand. Our coal business had lapped some of the lowest numbers from last year and was slightly higher in Q3. Overall energy carloads were down 7%, and revenue was down 15% versus prior year.
Intermodal volumes were down 5%, with revenue decreasing 7% in the quarter, primarily driven by our Lázaro cross-border and Lázaro inter-Mexico business. We're seeing good growth in our cross-border franchise and non-franchise business with -- which more than offsets any general weakness in the overall U.S. market.
The intermodal business was also negatively impacted by the service interruptions earlier in the quarter, as customers made the decision to use trucks to augment their third quarter shipping capacity. We are optimistic that these volumes will return as the current improved service bolsters customer confidence moving into 2017.
With all of the automotive plants being back online, our automotive volume increased 14%, but was impacted by a negative mix, which kept our revenue growth, adjusted for fuel and FX, at 4%.
One note is the impact of a new move we are now making from Laredo to Corpus Christi area, which is driving down RPU. This is a very good piece of business with good overall length of haul, but given the way we account for the move, it has a negative impact on RPU. 
In Q4, we'll see one new facility come up to full production and another facility begin production in November. We're also seeing strong volumes at the ports, both import and export volumes, and KCS is well positioned to serve our automotive customers as they grow their business in this important segment.
From a pricing perspective, we continue to see renewals close at the positive rate year-over-year. Excluding a large customer contract from last year, which will remain unchanged in 2016, our overall core pricing came in at mid-single-digit levels. 
Intermodal remains the market segment most impacted by truck competition, but we're confident in the value we're providing and that customers will continue to return to the railroad as we move into 2017.
On Slide 12, we have provided a fourth quarter year-over-year outlook for each of the industry segments. As you can see, we had a favorable or unchanged volume projection for about 90% of the business. This includes normal seasonal shipping in intermodal, as well as the return of some of our automotive parts business versus 2015. We're seeing slightly higher coal shipments year-over-year, as we discussed on our last call, and the Mexico Energy Reform continues to be a focus area for investment. We're already seeing increased shipments of LPGs into Mexico, and KCS believes we'll start to see the refined products business ramp up beginning in Q1 2017.
We're meeting with our customers to ensure that our plants meet their expectation as the law begins to be implemented. We're also seeing some market volatility, as refineries in Mexico have maintenance windows which may impact volume in the month ahead. And we'll continue to provide updates as we know more about the expected rollout and implementation of the new law. The automotive business is expected to grow, as our customers continue to ask us to do more in creating solutions to support their global manufacturing footprint. 
As we've mentioned before, by 2020, Mexico will produce over 5.3 million vehicles and import another 900,000. Over 50% of this production will be added between years 2016 to 2020. We're investing in those projects that will enhance the fluidity and capacity to effectively service this important segment.
The Ag & Minerals business should have a good quarter based on the record harvest we're experiencing this year, and we believe our Industrial & Consumer segments will continue to see fierce competition in both paper and steel into 2017.
Overall, we're upbeat about the opportunities in front of us. As Jeff mentioned, we'll continue to make strategic investments focused on providing our customers with a consistent product that has reliability they can count on as they create their shipping plans into next year. We continue to focus our efforts in adding reliable and capacity -- reliable capacity and fluidity for all of the growing businesses.
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch."
30472,378157524,1056467,"Kansas City Southern, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Kansas City Southern","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start my comments on Slide 14. As Brian just reviewed a few minutes ago, both third quarter volumes and revenues declined 4%.

As Brian just reviewed a few minutes ago, both third quarter volumes and revenues declined 4%. The peso depreciation had a $12 million negative impact on revenues, while declining U.S. fuel prices negatively impacted revenues by $7 million. Fuel surcharge revenues declined $32 million due to lower fuel prices and from rebasing customer contracts.
Adjusted operating ratio increased 1.7 points to 66.9%, primarily due to incremental costs incurred during the quarter that relate to year-to-date true-ups for incentive compensation and expenses related to flooding and service interruptions during the quarter. I'll discuss those details in the next few slides.
Third quarter 2016 reported EPS of $1.12 per share was down 7% from last year, while adjusted EPS was also $1.12 and down 7%. More details on the reconciliation of reported to adjusted EPS can be found on Slide 27 in the appendix.
On Slide 15, for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2016, carloads declined 3% and revenues 5%, mostly from foreign exchange impacts and lower fuel prices. 
Reported operating ratio improved 290 basis points. Despite a challenging operating environment requiring us to manage a number of extraneous events, adjusted operating ratio improved a healthy 230 basis points, largely the benefit of $50 million in fuel excise tax credits, more than offsetting an incremental $14 million in higher incentive compensation. 
Reported EPS increased 4%, while adjusted EPS increased 3%.
Turning to Slide 16. Not only has 2016 been a challenging year from a carload and revenue perspective, but we have experienced increases in out-of-pocket costs related to various flooding-related events in all 3 quarters, increased environmental expenses and higher incentive compensation expense. 
Higher incentive compensation expense for all management employees caused a $14 million increase from the targeted 100% payout level to a higher projected payout for the full year 2016, including both the $9 million true-up for the first half of 2016 and a $5 million in-period increase in third quarter. Despite those increased costs, we have improved our adjusted operating ratio by 230 basis points in the 9-month period ending September 30, 2016.
On Slide 17, this reflects foreign exchange and U.S. fuel rates for the first 3 quarters of 2016 and projections for the remainder of the year. As you can see, we continue to expect significant downward pressure on revenues as a result of peso depreciation currently expected to be 13% below 2015 levels during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we saw similar depreciation of the peso during the third quarter, which negatively impacted our revenues by $12 million.
Fuel prices are expected to be approximately the same year-over-year, and thus, fourth quarter could be the first quarter we haven't seen negative fuel impacts on revenue in quite some time.
Turning to Slide 18. Third quarter operating expenses declined $7 million or 2%. Key drivers of the decline in expense included the excise tax credit, the benefit from the depreciating peso, lower headcount and better labor productivity. Offsetting those declines were higher incentive compensation, depreciation, detour costs from flooding and higher environmental expenses.
Let me provide a little bit more color on the excise tax credit. During the quarter, we generated a $16 million fuel excise tax credit, a continuation of the credit we began realizing during the second quarter. As we indicated last quarter, this credit was established for qualifying transportation companies in Mexico and represents the beginning of the transition to world market prices, which we still expect to occur in 2018 and perhaps earlier. 
While we still don't know whether the credit will be available in 2017, the good news is the 2017 draft budget proposal presented to the Mexican Congress does reflect continuation of the credit in 2017. Congress is expected to approve the budget sometime during the fourth quarter. 
As a reminder, we include this credit in operating expense, as it directly relates to our fuel expense, which includes the applicable excise taxes we have always paid on fuel purchases, and accordingly, is included in the operating expense section of the P&L. We have included the credit as a separate line item in operating expense to provide investors transparency and clearly see the year-over-year impact of the credit rather than netting it with fuel expense.
We actively manage fuel purchases on a daily basis on our cross-border traffic to ensure we are purchasing fuel in the most economical way to produce the lowest possible operating cost. 
Our ability to utilize the credit is dependent on a variety of factors that include having sufficient taxable income and sufficient withholding and income tax liabilities to utilize the credit, as there is no carryforward provision available to us. 
We currently expect to generate approximately $15 million in additional credits during the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 19. Compensation and benefits expense went up $15 million, largely due to $16 million of increased incentive compensation.
During the quarter, we increased our accruals for incentive comp to higher payout percentages. The $7 million increase is due to 2015 payout percentages being accrued at 50% and increasing the payout to higher achievement levels in third quarter 2016.
When increasing the projected payout in 3Q, we also recorded true-up adjustments for the first 6 months to increase our accruals to the higher payout percentage, which contributed an additional $9 million year-over-year increase.
For the fourth quarter, to give you a little guidance, we currently expect incentive compensation to be $7 million higher than the fourth quarter 2015. And again, we were -- accrued at a 50% payout level in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Wage inflation is still running in the 3% to 4% range and contributed to another $4 million year-over-year increase in compensation expense. And as you can see in the bar chart, headcount continued to decline by 1%, contributing to $4 million of savings, along with various other productivity improvements.
As Jeff mentioned, we continue to have crews furloughed in the U.S., resulting in year-over-year savings, and we experienced a slight reduction in overall headcount.
Turning to Slide 20. Fuel expense declined $11 million, primarily due to peso depreciation, lower fuel prices, lower volumes and better efficiency. As you can see in the bar chart, fuel price declined both in the U.S. and Mexico, and our average consolidated price per gallon declined from $2.24 in the third quarter last year to $1.99 in the third quarter this year.
And finally, on Slide 21, our capital structure priorities continue to focus on investing in the business to generate the best growth in the rail sector. In fact, despite the downturn in the industrial economy in the past 18 months, we have grown third quarter volumes 19% since 2007, while the rest of the Class Is have experienced declining third quarter volumes on an aggregate basis of about 6%.
We will continue to focus on reinvesting our cash flow back into growing our business for the long run. And projected capital expenditures, as Pat mentioned, for 2016, continue to be in the range of $580 million to $590 million.
Finally, in May of 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. And a little more than halfway through the life of the program, we have repurchased about 60% of the authorized amount at an average of $89.63 per share. We will continue to monitor economic and business conditions to determine future levels of share repurchases. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Pat."

I'll just close with a few comments to provide an overall assessment for the quarter. 
Obviously, we continue to be in a challenging business environment, as evidenced by our year-over-year declines in overall volumes. While the weakness is most evident in energy-related business, we did experience year-over-year volume decreases in 5 of our 6 major business lines during the quarter.
The good news is we are seeing sequential improvements, and once we cycle through some dramatic reduction in coal and crude oil revenues that began in early 2015, we should start to see some volume growth returning.
In spite of some unusual cost items which occurred during the third quarter, we feel very good about our overall expense management and productivity trends. We feel that the year-to-date view of operating ratio improvement is a more meaningful indicator of those trends. 
Jeff detailed a few of the specific areas of focus, but there are many more that we are working on across all departments in the company that will make us most more cost efficient and productive in the years ahead. 
I gave a presentation at a recent rail shippers' conference, at which I described the near-term business outlook as tepid, which literally means lukewarm or lacking enthusiasm. When volume growth returns, and we are confident that it will at some point, the expense controls and efficiency initiatives we are currently working on should put us in great condition to begin using terms like incremental margins again, which have been noticeably absent from our vocabulary for the past few quarters. 
Finally, we continue to be very optimistic about our long-term growth outlook based on the key growth drivers that we see impacting the KCS network in the years ahead. 
You've heard us talk about these growth drivers before, but just to reiterate. There are new auto plants in Mexico, new petrochemical facilities being built in the U.S. Gulf Coast, growth in capacity at Lázaro Cárdenas and continued growth and market share gains in the cross-border Intermodal markets will be the primary catalysts for KCS in the years ahead.
So with that, I'll open the mic for Q&A."

What I would tell you is we feel very comfortable with the intermodal space. As we've discussed over the last couple of quarters, one of the big shipping companies made a decision to move to an all-vessel water solution out of the Pacific into Houston area. And so that impacted our Lázaro cross-border and Lázaro inter-Mexico business. That's primarily the decline you see from an intermodal perspective. All the other segments are growing, and we feel very comfortable that we are competing well. As we've said before, we will not chase the lower trucking pricing that's out there. We're going to continue to provide the value that we do, both in security and reliability of those shipments. What I would tell you is across the board, though, we feel very comfortable that, sequentially, we're going to continue to grow. It's just slower than, I think, everyone would like it to be, but it's about what we expect. And we're continuing to manage the cost structure and the infrastructure investments according to that. So obviously, the investments in supporting the additional automotive continue. The investments in the energy segment, the refined products, all those pieces are still in place. So the story is pretty much the same, except for that one intermodal move that took a rail move and made it into a water move into the Houston area."

I've tried to outline a couple of things and give some visibility around fuel, for example, on the initiatives. We're not even complete with the installs in the U.S., and we have the whole Mexico network to install fuel technology. And I've kind of provided some numbers on savings on fuel throughout the year here. So I view those things are going to continue, and I'm confident that they will continue. I think on the headcount side, you're continuing to see productivity. The noise we saw in the quarter with the disruptions, as mentioned, certainly drives some additional operating expense. And so on a more normalized quarter, I think you're going to continue to see those improvements. Headcount, for me, as we've talked, with all the hiring in 2015, you're starting to see us kind of lapse that comp. So I think in Q4, you'll continue to see the trends that we saw here in Q3. The one outlier in headcount could be the in-sourced effort I talked about. So a very good financial move for us. But I think that will add about 250 and 300 heads to our kind of internal number. So that will skew just the outlook, but that's the reason that you'll see that in Q4. But all in all, very pleased with how things are progressing. I feel like we're still fairly early in kind of the productivity improvements. Especially in Mexico, as we got the headcount rightsized, we've got the growth opportunity ahead of us. So I think the productivity focus will be there for us."

I mean, I think the most important piece when you think about the competitive dynamics of Manzanillo and Lázaro, Lázaro is the only port that has a direct rail connection into the U.S. and into the rest of North America. So the addition of the APMT terminal is going to be pretty significant. If you look at what the government has said, they're looking to double the initial size of the facility. They want to double the capacity of the port. We feel very, very comfortable that, that port is going to continue to grow. Now when you think about competitiveness into the inter-Mexico area, that's where we see the competition right now. The truckers and the low price, there's about -- when you think about the difference between rail and truck, there's about 60% of the volume goes truck, about 40% goes rail. We're hoping that, that continues to improve as people look at the security of the rail, the number of places we can get to and the fluidity. Obviously, Jeff talked about the big investments that we're making. It is important, when you have an intermodal product, to be fluid and consistent. And that's where we, as a management team, are spending all of our time because we realize that the growth opportunity there is significant, not only out of Lázaro, but into the U.S. So from a competitive perspective, we know the value that we bring. We understand how to price it. We believe that it's going to continue to -- the tailwinds are going to go our way as we continue to improve our fluidity. But right now, we feel like we're very, very competitive in the space that we're at. But there's also this dynamic of the vessel operators that we're still dealing with. And it's a global issue. It's not just Mexico. It's not just North America. And so as the vessel operators sort out, probably over the next 12 to 18 months, I think we'll continue to see that port grow at Lazaro."

If you look at Page 4, you'll see the lineup, which I think is familiar to everyone: Jeff Songer, Brian Hancock, Mike Upchurch. And José Zozaya is on the phone as well this morning.
Let me begin my comments with Slide 5. As you saw in our press release from earlier this morning, we reported diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $1.12, which compares to $1.20 per share last year, which represents a 7% decline from 2015. 
Revenues were $604.5 million, a 4% decline from last year.
Excluding the impact of lower U.S. fuel prices on fuel surcharge revenue and a further weakening of the Mexican peso, our revenues for the quarter would have been about 1% lower than last year. Volumes were down by 4% from last year.
Our reported operating ratio for the quarter was 66.9%, which is 170 basis points higher than last year. However, this include the impacts of some onetime cost events, including higher detour expenses due to flooding in South Texas and service disruptions in Mexico, which, as we stated in our press release, had an adverse impact on revenues. In addition, those disruptions had a negative impact on cost performance during the quarter as well.
In spite of this deterioration in quarterly operating ratio, we feel very good about our overall cost performance during the quarter. Later in the presentation, Jeff Songer will talk about some of the efficiency initiatives that are underway, and Mike Upchurch will get into more detail about what we'll refer to as our normalized cost performance. Just to give you a bit of a preview, this normalized cost performance is demonstrated by looking at our year-to-date operating ratio, which as you can see from the last point on Slide 5, improved by 230 basis points from the adjusted or comparable operating ratio last year to 65%. 
Among other things, this year-to-date view shows our operating ratio performance on a basis which smooths out the impact of timing or events that would have a more pronounced impact on the results in any given quarter. Again, Mike will walk you through this in greater detail in a few moments.
Moving on to Slide 6, I wanted to briefly remind you of the recent guidance which we previously provided and show you that we are on track with that guidance. Last quarter, we told you that we were -- we expected to see sequential revenue growth from the first half to the second half of 2016, and we are confirming that view at this point, and that we expected to see mid-single-digit sequential revenue growth in the third quarter of 2016. As you saw on the previous slide, we generated sequential volume growth of 5%, which led to revenues growing by 6.4% sequentially. We are also confirming our previous guidance regarding second half 2016 automotive volume growth and our overall capital spending targets for 2016.
With that, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer."

Beginning with Slide 8, velocity for the quarter of 27.8 miles per hour improved 10% over prior year, while dwell for the quarter of 24.1 increased 6% versus prior year.
Factors impacting dwell were the July bridge outage in Rosenberg, Texas, which restricted cross-border traffic flow. The border terminals of Sanchez, Nuevo Laredo and Laredo were impacted by this event. Compounding this outage were service disruptions in Mexico during the month of July, which caused multiple days of outages across the network. All major terminals in Mexico were impacted, while terminals in Sanchez, Nuevo Laredo and Laredo, already congested by the earlier Texas bridge outage, were affected further.
Current dwell has shown improvement from the elevated levels we saw between late July to mid-September, and we look for this metric to return to more normal levels through Q4.
Moving to the operations overview on Slide 9. Focus continues on our biggest cost drivers of labor and fuel. Currently, 5% of the U.S. T&E workforce is in furlough status. Overall headcount for the quarter was down 1% versus prior year, as Mike will review in later slides. 12% of our locomotives across the system are in storage. Fuel management programs, as outlined in prior earnings discussions, continued, and we have gained another $1 million in pure fuel efficiency during Q3. 
Year-to-date, we are about 75% complete with the technology installations in the U.S., with Mexico installation work slated for 2017. 
Effective recruit management continues, with year-to-date reductions of 49%, while overtime management provided an additional $2.4 million in savings for the quarter versus prior year.
One other item to note is the completion of a mechanical in-sourcing effort that was finalized during the quarter and went into effect October 1. This represents an approximate $5 million in ongoing annual cost savings. We will recognize these benefits starting in Q4.
Moving on to capital project highlights. I would like to provide a quick update on PTC. First, I would like to acknowledge the tremendous ongoing effort by all of the groups involved in this project. We plan to have a first operating subdivision in PTC revenue service in Q4 and have an aggressive implementation schedule in 2017 and 2018. 2017 will be another heavy investment year for PTC, and capital spend will begin to reduce thereafter.
Construction work at the previously announced WTC/Watco SLP fluids terminal broke ground during the quarter. Design work for support facilities for the Ford and BMW automotive plants at SLP is underway. Work at the Sasol support yard facility continues and is on schedule for a late 2017 completion. 
Finally, Sanchez Yard classification tracks are on schedule to complete by year-end. This will allow additional handling of trains at Sanchez and will ease some pressure on other terminals in the network while continuing to facilitate cross-border traffic. Additional classification tracks and mechanical facilities at Sanchez will be complete by the end of 2017.
I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock."
30472,378157524,1056555,"Kansas City Southern, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Kansas City Southern","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone.

Our Chemical & Petroleum b",1005,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Page 11, where you can see our year-over-year revenue was down 4% and off 1% excluding currency and fuel. Our carloads were also down 4% for the quarter versus last year. 
Our Chemical & Petroleum business had a record quarter with 1% year-over-year growth in revenue. Our carloads in this segment were off 4%, primarily due to shipments of fuel oil, as a customer in Mexico had a disruption in production, which was partially offset by strong growth in our Plastics segment. We continue to see strength in this line of business as the plastics manufacturers in the Gulf region grow their shipments globally.
Our Industrial & Consumer business remained slow, with year-over-year decreases of 6% volume and 6% revenue, with half of the revenue decline driven by fuel and foreign exchange. This business segment continues to be negatively impacted by softness in our metals and paper segments. These businesses are experiencing stiff global completion, impacted by currency fluctuations and low truck pricing, which we believe to be unsustainable in the long term. This weakness was somewhat offset by strength in our other carload segment.
During Q3, our Ag & Mineral business saw a decrease of 1% in carloads and revenue growth of 3%, driven by strength in grain and food products, particularly in the cross-border business. We continue to see the benefit of the additional equipment serving this important business unit.
Our overall cross-border business showed strong growth of 7% for the quarter, being led by a record-breaking quarter in our automotive business and solid growth in cross-border Ag/Mineral and the Chemical & Petroleum business. More details on our cross-border franchise are included in the appendices on Page 31 and 32.
Our Energy business continued to be negatively impacted by volatility in crude and frac sand. Our coal business had lapped some of the lowest numbers from last year and was slightly higher in Q3. Overall energy carloads were down 7%, and revenue was down 15% versus prior year.
Intermodal volumes were down 5%, with revenue decreasing 7% in the quarter, primarily driven by our Lázaro cross-border and Lázaro inter-Mexico business. We're seeing good growth in our cross-border franchise and non-franchise business with -- which more than offsets any general weakness in the overall U.S. market.
The intermodal business was also negatively impacted by the service interruptions earlier in the quarter, as customers made the decision to use trucks to augment their third quarter shipping capacity. We are optimistic that these volumes will return as the current improved service bolsters customer confidence moving into 2017.
With all of the automotive plants being back online, our automotive volume increased 14%, but was impacted by a negative mix, which kept our revenue growth, adjusted for fuel and FX, at 4%.
One note is the impact of a new move we are now making from Laredo to Corpus Christi area, which is driving down RPU. This is a very good piece of business with good overall length of haul, but given the way we account for the move, it has a negative impact on RPU. 
In Q4, we'll see one new facility come up to full production and another facility begin production in November. We're also seeing strong volumes at the ports, both import and export volumes, and KCS is well positioned to serve our automotive customers as they grow their business in this important segment.
From a pricing perspective, we continue to see renewals close at the positive rate year-over-year. Excluding a large customer contract from last year, which will remain unchanged in 2016, our overall core pricing came in at mid-single-digit levels. 
Intermodal remains the market segment most impacted by truck competition, but we're confident in the value we're providing and that customers will continue to return to the railroad as we move into 2017.
On Slide 12, we have provided a fourth quarter year-over-year outlook for each of the industry segments. As you can see, we had a favorable or unchanged volume projection for about 90% of the business. This includes normal seasonal shipping in intermodal as well as the return of some of our automotive parts business versus 2015. We're seeing slightly higher coal shipments year-over-year, as we discussed on our last call, and the Mexico Energy Reform continues to be a focus area for investment. We're already seeing increased shipments of LPGs into Mexico, and KCS believes we'll start to see the refined products business ramp up beginning in Q1 2017.
We're meeting with our customers to ensure that our plants meet their expectation as the law begins to be implemented. We're also seeing some market volatility, as refineries in Mexico have maintenance windows which may impact volume in the month ahead. And we'll continue to provide updates as we know more about the expected rollout and implementation of the new law. The automotive business is expected to grow, as our customers continue to ask us to do more in creating solutions to support their global manufacturing footprint. 
As we've mentioned before, by 2020, Mexico will produce over 5.3 million vehicles and import another 900,000. Over 50% of this production will be added between years 2016 to 2020. We're investing in those projects that will enhance the fluidity and capacity to effectively service this important segment.
The Ag & Minerals business should have a good quarter based on the record harvest we're experiencing this year, and we believe our Industrial & Consumer segments will continue to see fierce competition in both paper and steel into 2017.
Overall, we're upbeat about the opportunities in front of us. As Jeff mentioned, we'll continue to make strategic investments focused on providing our customers with a consistent product that has reliability they can count on as they create their shipping plans into next year. We continue to focus our efforts in adding reliable and capacity -- reliable capacity and fluidity for all of the growing businesses.
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch."
30472,378157524,1056555,"Kansas City Southern, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Kansas City Southern","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start my comments on Slide 14. As Brian just reviewed a few minutes ago, both third quarter volumes and revenues declined 4%.

As Brian just reviewed a few minutes ago, both third quarter volumes and revenues declined 4%. The peso depreciation had a $12 million negative impact on revenues, while declining U.S. fuel prices negatively impacted revenues by $7 million. Fuel surcharge revenues declined $32 million due to lower fuel prices and from rebasing customer contracts.
Adjusted operating ratio increased 1.7 points to 66.9%, primarily due to incremental costs incurred during the quarter that relate to year-to-date true-ups for incentive compensation and expenses related to flooding and service interruptions during the quarter. I'll discuss those details in the next few slides.
Third quarter 2016 reported EPS of $1.12 per share was down 7% from last year, while adjusted EPS was also $1.12 and down 7%. More details on the reconciliation of reported to adjusted EPS can be found on Slide 27 in the appendix.
On Slide 15, for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2016, carloads declined 3% and revenues 5%, mostly from foreign exchange impacts and lower fuel prices. 
Reported operating ratio improved 290 basis points. Despite a challenging operating environment requiring us to manage a number of extraneous events, adjusted operating ratio improved a healthy 230 basis points, largely the benefit of $50 million in fuel excise tax credits, more than offsetting an incremental $14 million in higher incentive compensation. 
Reported EPS increased 4%, while adjusted EPS increased 3%.
Turning to Slide 16. Not only has 2016 been a challenging year from a carload and revenue perspective, but we have experienced increases in out-of-pocket costs related to various flooding-related events in all 3 quarters, increased environmental expenses and higher incentive compensation expense. 
Higher incentive compensation expense for all management employees caused a $14 million increase from the targeted 100% payout level to a higher projected payout for the full year 2016, including both the $9 million true-up for the first half of 2016 and a $5 million in-period increase in third quarter. Despite those increased costs, we have improved our adjusted operating ratio by 230 basis points in the 9-month period ending September 30, 2016.
On Slide 17, this reflects foreign exchange and U.S. fuel rates for the first 3 quarters of 2016 and projections for the remainder of the year. As you can see, we continue to expect significant downward pressure on revenues as a result of peso depreciation currently expected to be 13% below 2015 levels during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we saw similar depreciation of the peso during the third quarter, which negatively impacted our revenues by $12 million.
Fuel prices are expected to be approximately the same year-over-year, and thus, fourth quarter could be the first quarter we haven't seen negative fuel impacts on revenue in quite some time.
Turning to Slide 18. Third quarter operating expenses declined $7 million or 2%. Key drivers of the decline in expense included the excise tax credit, the benefit from the depreciating peso, lower headcount and better labor productivity. Offsetting those declines were higher incentive compensation, depreciation, detour costs from flooding and higher environmental expenses.
Let me provide a little bit more color on the excise tax credit. During the quarter, we generated a $16 million fuel excise tax credit, a continuation of the credit we began realizing during the second quarter. As we indicated last quarter, this credit was established for qualifying transportation companies in Mexico and represents the beginning of the transition to world market prices, which we still expect to occur in 2018 and perhaps earlier. 
While we still don't know whether the credit will be available in 2017, the good news is the 2017 draft budget proposal presented to the Mexican Congress does reflect continuation of the credit in 2017. Congress is expected to approve the budget sometime during the fourth quarter. 
As a reminder, we include this credit in operating expense, as it directly relates to our fuel expense, which includes the applicable excise taxes we have always paid on fuel purchases, and accordingly, is included in the operating expense section of the P&L. We have included the credit as a separate line item in operating expense to provide investors transparency and clearly see the year-over-year impact of the credit rather than netting it with fuel expense.
We actively manage fuel purchases on a daily basis on our cross-border traffic to ensure we are purchasing fuel in the most economical way to produce the lowest possible operating cost. 
Our ability to utilize the credit is dependent on a variety of factors that include having sufficient taxable income and sufficient withholding and income tax liabilities to utilize the credit, as there is no carryforward provision available to us. 
We currently expect to generate approximately $15 million in additional credits during the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 19. Compensation and benefits expense went up $15 million, largely due to $16 million of increased incentive compensation.
During the quarter, we increased our accruals for incentive comp to higher payout percentages. The $7 million increase is due to 2015 payout percentages being accrued at 50% and increasing the payout to higher achievement levels in third quarter 2016.
When increasing the projected payout in 3Q, we also recorded true-up adjustments for the first 6 months to increase our accruals to the higher payout percentage, which contributed an additional $9 million year-over-year increase.
For the fourth quarter, to give you a little guidance, we currently expect incentive compensation to be $7 million higher than the fourth quarter 2015. And again, we were -- accrued at a 50% payout level in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Wage inflation is still running in the 3% to 4% range and contributed to another $4 million year-over-year increase in compensation expense. And as you can see in the bar chart, headcount continued to decline by 1%, contributing to $4 million of savings, along with various other productivity improvements.
As Jeff mentioned, we continue to have crews furloughed in the U.S., resulting in year-over-year savings, and we experienced a slight reduction in overall headcount.
Turning to Slide 20. Fuel expense declined $11 million, primarily due to peso depreciation, lower fuel prices, lower volumes and better efficiency. As you can see in the bar chart, fuel price declined both in the U.S. and Mexico, and our average consolidated price per gallon declined from $2.24 in the third quarter last year to $1.99 in the third quarter this year.
And finally, on Slide 21, our capital structure priorities continue to focus on investing in the business to generate the best growth in the rail sector. In fact, despite the downturn in the industrial economy in the past 18 months, we have grown third quarter volumes 19% since 2007, while the rest of the Class Is have experienced declining third quarter volumes on an aggregate basis of about 6%.
We will continue to focus on reinvesting our cash flow back into growing our business for the long run. And projected capital expenditures, as Pat mentioned, for 2016, continue to be in the range of $580 million to $590 million.
Finally, in May of 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. And a little more than halfway through the life of the program, we have repurchased about 60% of the authorized amount at an average of $89.63 per share. We will continue to monitor economic and business conditions to determine future levels of share repurchases. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Pat."

I'll just close with a few comments to provide an overall assessment for the quarter. 
Obviously, we continue to be in a challenging business environment, as evidenced by our year-over-year declines in overall volumes. While the weakness is most evident in energy-related business, we did experience year-over-year volume decreases in 5 of our 6 major business lines during the quarter.
The good news is we are seeing sequential improvements, and once we cycle through some dramatic reduction in coal and crude oil revenues that began in early 2015, we should start to see some volume growth returning.
In spite of some unusual cost items which occurred during the third quarter, we feel very good about our overall expense management and productivity trends. We feel that the year-to-date view of operating ratio improvement is a more meaningful indicator of those trends. 
Jeff detailed a few of the specific areas of focus, but there are many more that we are working on across all departments in the company that will make us most more cost efficient and productive in the years ahead. 
I gave a presentation at a recent rail shippers' conference, at which I described the near-term business outlook as tepid, which literally means lukewarm or lacking enthusiasm. When volume growth returns, and we are confident that it will at some point, the expense controls and efficiency initiatives we are currently working on should put us in great condition to begin using terms like incremental margins again, which have been noticeably absent from our vocabulary for the past few quarters. 
Finally, we continue to be very optimistic about our long-term growth outlook based on the key growth drivers that we see impacting the KCS network in the years ahead. 
You've heard us talk about these growth drivers before, but just to reiterate. There are new auto plants in Mexico, new petrochemical facilities being built in the U.S. Gulf Coast, growth in capacity at Lázaro Cárdenas and continued growth and market share gains in the cross-border Intermodal markets will be the primary catalysts for KCS in the years ahead.
So with that, I'll open the mic for Q&A."

What I would tell you is we feel very comfortable with the intermodal space. As we've discussed over the last couple of quarters, one of the big shipping companies made a decision to move to an all-vessel water solution out of the Pacific into Houston area. And so that impacted our Lázaro cross-border and Lázaro inter-Mexico business. That's primarily the decline you see from an intermodal perspective. All the other segments are growing, and we feel very comfortable that we are competing well. As we've said before, we will not chase the lower trucking pricing that's out there. We're going to continue to provide the value that we do, both in security and reliability of those shipments. What I would tell you is across the board, though, we feel very comfortable that, sequentially, we're going to continue to grow. It's just slower than, I think, everyone would like it to be, but it's about what we expect. And we're continuing to manage the cost structure and the infrastructure investments according to that. So obviously, the investments in supporting the additional automotive continue. The investments in the energy segment, the refined products, all those pieces are still in place. So the story is pretty much the same, except for that one intermodal move that took a rail move and made it into a water move into the Houston area."

I think on the headcount side, you're continuing to see productivity. The noise we saw in the quarter with the disruptions, as mentioned, certainly drives some additional operating expense. And so on a more normalized quarter, I think you're going to continue to see those improvements. Headcount, for me, as we've talked, with all the hiring in 2015, you're starting to see us kind of lapse that comp. So I think in Q4, you'll continue to see the trends that we saw here in Q3. The one outlier in headcount could be the in-sourced effort I talked about. So a very good financial move for us. But I think that will add about 250 and 300 heads to our kind of internal number. So that will skew just the outlook, but that's the reason that you'll see that in Q4. But all in all, very pleased with how things are progressing. I feel like we're still fairly early in kind of the productivity improvements. Especially in Mexico, as we got the headcount rightsized, we've got the growth opportunity ahead of us.

But that is the area that we talked about. The Lázaro inter-Mexico and Lázaro cross-border piece of the business that has been off this year primarily due to the decision of one of our customers to move that freight completely by vessel up into the Houston area. And so that volume is not moving at all through the ports. So if it were to move back, obviously, that will be beneficial to us.

They want to double the capacity of the port. We feel very, very comfortable that, that port is going to continue to grow. Now when you think about competitiveness into the inter-Mexico area, that's where we see the competition right now. The truckers and the low price, there's about -- when you think about the difference between rail and truck, there's about 60% of the volume goes truck, about 40% goes rail. We're hoping that, that continues to improve as people look at the security of the rail, the number of places we can get to and the fluidity. Obviously, Jeff talked about the big investments that we're making. It is important, when you have an intermodal product, to be fluid and consistent.

We understand how to price it. We believe that it's going to continue to -- the tailwinds are going to go our way as we continue to improve our fluidity. But right now, we feel like we're very, very competitive in the space that we're at. But there's also this dynamic of the vessel operators that we're still dealing with. And it's a global issue. It's not just Mexico. It's not just North America. And so as the vessel operators sort out, probably over the next 12 to 18 months, I think we'll continue to see that port grow at Lazaro."

If you look at Page 4, you'll see the lineup, which I think is familiar to everyone: Jeff Songer, Brian Hancock, Mike Upchurch. And José Zozaya is on the phone as well this morning.
Let me begin my comments with Slide 5. As you saw in our press release from earlier this morning, we reported diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of $1.12, which compares to $1.20 per share last year, which represents a 7% decline from 2015. 
Revenues were $604.5 million, a 4% decline from last year.
Excluding the impact of lower U.S. fuel prices on fuel surcharge revenue and a further weakening of the Mexican peso, our revenues for the quarter would have been about 1% lower than last year. Volumes were down by 4% from last year.
Our reported operating ratio for the quarter was 66.9%, which is 170 basis points higher than last year. However, this include the impacts of some onetime cost events, including higher detour expenses due to flooding in South Texas and service disruptions in Mexico, which, as we stated in our press release, had an adverse impact on revenues. In addition, those disruptions had a negative impact on cost performance during the quarter as well.
In spite of this deterioration in quarterly operating ratio, we feel very good about our overall cost performance during the quarter. Later in the presentation, Jeff Songer will talk about some of the efficiency initiatives that are underway, and Mike Upchurch will get into more detail about what we'll refer to as our normalized cost performance. Just to give you a bit of a preview, this normalized cost performance is demonstrated by looking at our year-to-date operating ratio, which as you can see from the last point on Slide 5, improved by 230 basis points from the adjusted or comparable operating ratio last year to 65%. 
Among other things, this year-to-date view shows our operating ratio performance on a basis which smooths out the impact of timing or events that would have a more pronounced impact on the results in any given quarter. Again, Mike will walk you through this in greater detail in a few moments.
Moving on to Slide 6, I wanted to briefly remind you of the recent guidance which we previously provided and show you that we are on track with that guidance. Last quarter, we told you that we were -- we expected to see sequential revenue growth from the first half to the second half of 2016, and we are confirming that view at this point, and that we expected to see mid-single-digit sequential revenue growth in the third quarter of 2016. As you saw on the previous slide, we generated sequential volume growth of 5%, which led to revenues growing by 6.4% sequentially. We are also confirming our previous guidance regarding second half 2016 automotive volume growth and our overall capital spending targets for 2016.
With that, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer."

Beginning with Slide 8, velocity for the quarter of 27.8 miles per hour improved 10% over prior year, while dwell for the quarter of 24.1 increased 6% versus prior year.
Factors impacting dwell were the July bridge outage in Rosenberg, Texas, which restricted cross-border traffic flow. The border terminals of Sanchez, Nuevo Laredo and Laredo were impacted by this event. Compounding this outage were service disruptions in Mexico during the month of July, which caused multiple days of outages across the network. All major terminals in Mexico were impacted, while terminals in Sanchez, Nuevo Laredo and Laredo, already congested by the earlier Texas bridge outage, were affected further.
Current dwell has shown improvement from the elevated levels we saw between late July to mid-September, and we look for this metric to return to more normal levels through Q4.
Moving to the operations overview on Slide 9. Focus continues on our biggest cost drivers of labor and fuel. Currently, 5% of the U.S. T&E workforce is in furlough status. Overall headcount for the quarter was down 1% versus prior year, as Mike will review in later slides. 12% of our locomotives across the system are in storage. Fuel management programs, as outlined in prior earnings discussions, continued, and we have gained another $1 million in pure fuel efficiency during Q3. 
Year-to-date, we are about 75% complete with the technology installations in the U.S., with Mexico installation work slated for 2017. 
Effective recruit management continues, with year-to-date reductions of 49%, while overtime management provided an additional $2.4 million in savings for the quarter versus prior year.
One other item to note is the completion of a mechanical in-sourcing effort that was finalized during the quarter and went into effect October 1. This represents an approximate $5 million in ongoing annual cost savings. We will recognize these benefits starting in Q4.
Moving on to capital project highlights. I would like to provide a quick update on PTC. First, I would like to acknowledge the tremendous ongoing effort by all of the groups involved in this project. We plan to have a first operating subdivision in PTC revenue service in Q4 and have an aggressive implementation schedule in 2017 and 2018. 2017 will be another heavy investment year for PTC, and capital spend will begin to reduce thereafter.
Construction work at the previously announced WTC/Watco SLP fluids terminal broke ground during the quarter. Design work for support facilities for the Ford and BMW automotive plants at SLP is underway. Work at the Sasol support yard facility continues and is on schedule for a late 2017 completion. 
Finally, Sanchez Yard classification tracks are on schedule to complete by year-end. This will allow additional handling of trains at Sanchez and will ease some pressure on other terminals in the network while continuing to facilitate cross-border traffic. Additional classification tracks and mechanical facilities at Sanchez will be complete by the end of 2017.
I will now turn the presentation over to our Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock."
30472,378157524,1423279,"Kansas City Southern, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Kansas City Southern","Executives","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Page 11, where you can see our year-over-year revenue was down 4% and off 1% excluding currency and fuel. Our carloads were also down 4% for the quarter versus last year. Our Chemical & Petroleum b",1005,"Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Page 11, where you can see our year-over-year revenue was down 4% and off 1% excluding currency and fuel. Our carloads were also down 4% for the quarter versus last year. 
Our Chemical & Petroleum business had a record quarter with 1% year-over-year growth in revenue. Our carloads in this segment were off 4%, primarily due to shipments of fuel oil, as a customer in Mexico had a disruption in production, which was partially offset by strong growth in our Plastics segment. We continue to see strength in this line of business as the plastics manufacturers in the Gulf region grow their shipments globally.
Our Industrial & Consumer business remained slow, with year-over-year decreases of 6% volume and 6% revenue, with half of the revenue decline driven by fuel and foreign exchange. This business segment continues to be negatively impacted by softness in our metals and paper segments. These businesses are experiencing stiff global completion, impacted by currency fluctuations and low truck pricing, which we believe to be unsustainable in the long term. This weakness was somewhat offset by strength in our other carload segment.
During Q3, our Ag & Mineral business saw a decrease of 1% in carloads and revenue growth of 3%, driven by strength in grain and food products, particularly in the cross-border business. We continue to see the benefit of the additional equipment serving this important business unit.
Our overall cross-border business showed strong growth of 7% for the quarter, being led by a record-breaking quarter in our automotive business and solid growth in cross-border Ag/Mineral and the Chemical & Petroleum business. More details on our cross-border franchise are included in the appendices on Page 31 and 32.
Our Energy business continued to be negatively impacted by volatility in crude and frac sand. Our coal business had lapped some of the lowest numbers from last year and was slightly higher in Q3. Overall energy carloads were down 7%, and revenue was down 15% versus prior year.
Intermodal volumes were down 5%, with revenue decreasing 7% in the quarter, primarily driven by our Lázaro cross-border and Lázaro inter-Mexico business. We're seeing good growth in our cross-border franchise and non-franchise business with -- which more than offsets any general weakness in the overall U.S. market.
The intermodal business was also negatively impacted by the service interruptions earlier in the quarter, as customers made the decision to use trucks to augment their third quarter shipping capacity. We are optimistic that these volumes will return as the current improved service bolsters customer confidence moving into 2017.
With all of the automotive plants being back online, our automotive volume increased 14%, but was impacted by a negative mix, which kept our revenue growth, adjusted for fuel and FX, at 4%.
One note is the impact of a new move we are now making from Laredo to Corpus Christi area, which is driving down RPU. This is a very good piece of business with good overall length of haul, but given the way we account for the move, it has a negative impact on RPU. 
In Q4, we'll see one new facility come up to full production and another facility begin production in November. We're also seeing strong volumes at the ports, both import and export volumes, and KCS is well positioned to serve our automotive customers as they grow their business in this important segment.
From a pricing perspective, we continue to see renewals close at the positive rate year-over-year. Excluding a large customer contract from last year, which will remain unchanged in 2016, our overall core pricing came in at mid-single-digit levels. 
Intermodal remains the market segment most impacted by truck competition, but we're confident in the value we're providing and that customers will continue to return to the railroad as we move into 2017.
On Slide 12, we have provided a fourth quarter year-over-year outlook for each of the industry segments. As you can see, we had a favorable or unchanged volume projection for about 90% of the business. This includes normal seasonal shipping in intermodal as well as the return of some of our automotive parts business versus 2015. We're seeing slightly higher coal shipments year-over-year, as we discussed on our last call, and the Mexico Energy Reform continues to be a focus area for investment. We're already seeing increased shipments of LPGs into Mexico, and KCS believes we'll start to see the refined products business ramp up beginning in Q1 2017.
We're meeting with our customers to ensure that our plants meet their expectation as the law begins to be implemented. We're also seeing some market volatility, as refineries in Mexico have maintenance windows which may impact volume in the month ahead. And we'll continue to provide updates as we know more about the expected rollout and implementation of the new law. The automotive business is expected to grow, as our customers continue to ask us to do more in creating solutions to support their global manufacturing footprint. 
As we've mentioned before, by 2020, Mexico will produce over 5.3 million vehicles and import another 900,000. Over 50% of this production will be added between years 2016 to 2020. We're investing in those projects that will enhance the fluidity and capacity to effectively service this important segment.
The Ag & Minerals business should have a good quarter based on the record harvest we're experiencing this year, and we believe our Industrial & Consumer segments will continue to see fierce competition in both paper and steel into 2017.
Overall, we're upbeat about the opportunities in front of us. As Jeff mentioned, we'll continue to make strategic investments focused on providing our customers with a consistent product that has reliability they can count on as they create their shipping plans into next year. We continue to focus our efforts in adding reliable and capacity -- reliable capacity and fluidity for all of the growing businesses.
I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch."

Fuel surcharge revenues declined $32 million due to lower fuel prices and from rebasing customer contracts.
Adjusted operating ratio increased 1.7 points to 66.9%, primarily due to incremental costs incurred during the quarter that relate to year-to-date true-ups for incentive compensation and expenses related to flooding and service interruptions during the quarter. I'll discuss those details in the next few slides.
Third quarter 2016 reported EPS of $1.12 per share was down 7% from last year, while adjusted EPS was also $1.12 and down 7%. More details on the reconciliation of reported to adjusted EPS can be found on Slide 27 in the appendix.
On Slide 15, for the 9-month period ended September 30, 2016, carloads declined 3% and revenues 5%, mostly from foreign exchange impacts and lower fuel prices. 
Reported operating ratio improved 290 basis points. Despite a challenging operating environment requiring us to manage a number of extraneous events, adjusted operating ratio improved a healthy 230 basis points, largely the benefit of $50 million in fuel excise tax credits, more than offsetting an incremental $14 million in higher incentive compensation. 
Reported EPS increased 4%, while adjusted EPS increased 3%.
Turning to Slide 16. Not only has 2016 been a challenging year from a carload and revenue perspective, but we have experienced increases in out-of-pocket costs related to various flooding-related events in all 3 quarters, increased environmental expenses and higher incentive compensation expense. 
Higher incentive compensation expense for all management employees caused a $14 million increase from the targeted 100% payout level to a higher projected payout for the full year 2016, including both the $9 million true-up for the first half of 2016 and a $5 million in-period increase in third quarter. Despite those increased costs, we have improved our adjusted operating ratio by 230 basis points in the 9-month period ending September 30, 2016.
On Slide 17, this reflects foreign exchange and U.S. fuel rates for the first 3 quarters of 2016 and projections for the remainder of the year. As you can see, we continue to expect significant downward pressure on revenues as a result of peso depreciation currently expected to be 13% below 2015 levels during the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we saw similar depreciation of the peso during the third quarter, which negatively impacted our revenues by $12 million.
Fuel prices are expected to be approximately the same year-over-year, and thus, fourth quarter could be the first quarter we haven't seen negative fuel impacts on revenue in quite some time.
Turning to Slide 18. Third quarter operating expenses declined $7 million or 2%. Key drivers of the decline in expense included the excise tax credit, the benefit from the depreciating peso, lower headcount and better labor productivity. Offsetting those declines were higher incentive compensation, depreciation, detour costs from flooding and higher environmental expenses.
Let me provide a little bit more color on the excise tax credit. During the quarter, we generated a $16 million fuel excise tax credit, a continuation of the credit we began realizing during the second quarter. As we indicated last quarter, this credit was established for qualifying transportation companies in Mexico and represents the beginning of the transition to world market prices, which we still expect to occur in 2018 and perhaps earlier. 
While we still don't know whether the credit will be available in 2017, the good news is the 2017 draft budget proposal presented to the Mexican Congress does reflect continuation of the credit in 2017. Congress is expected to approve the budget sometime during the fourth quarter. 
As a reminder, we include this credit in operating expense, as it directly relates to our fuel expense, which includes the applicable excise taxes we have always paid on fuel purchases, and accordingly, is included in the operating expense section of the P&L. We have included the credit as a separate line item in operating expense to provide investors transparency and clearly see the year-over-year impact of the credit rather than netting it with fuel expense.
We actively manage fuel purchases on a daily basis on our cross-border traffic to ensure we are purchasing fuel in the most economical way to produce the lowest possible operating cost. 
Our ability to utilize the credit is dependent on a variety of factors that include having sufficient taxable income and sufficient withholding and income tax liabilities to utilize the credit, as there is no carryforward provision available to us. 
We currently expect to generate approximately $15 million in additional credits during the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 19. Compensation and benefits expense went up $15 million, largely due to $16 million of increased incentive compensation.
During the quarter, we increased our accruals for incentive comp to higher payout percentages. The $7 million increase is due to 2015 payout percentages being accrued at 50% and increasing the payout to higher achievement levels in third quarter 2016.
When increasing the projected payout in 3Q, we also recorded true-up adjustments for the first 6 months to increase our accruals to the higher payout percentage, which contributed an additional $9 million year-over-year increase.
For the fourth quarter, to give you a little guidance, we currently expect incentive compensation to be $7 million higher than the fourth quarter 2015. And again, we were -- accrued at a 50% payout level in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Wage inflation is still running in the 3% to 4% range and contributed to another $4 million year-over-year increase in compensation expense. And as you can see in the bar chart, headcount continued to decline by 1%, contributing to $4 million of savings, along with various other productivity improvements.
As Jeff mentioned, we continue to have crews furloughed in the U.S., resulting in year-over-year savings, and we experienced a slight reduction in overall headcount.
Turning to Slide 20. Fuel expense declined $11 million, primarily due to peso depreciation, lower fuel prices, lower volumes and better efficiency. As you can see in the bar chart, fuel price declined both in the U.S. and Mexico, and our average consolidated price per gallon declined from $2.24 in the third quarter last year to $1.99 in the third quarter this year.
And finally, on Slide 21, our capital structure priorities continue to focus on investing in the business to generate the best growth in the rail sector. In fact, despite the downturn in the industrial economy in the past 18 months, we have grown third quarter volumes 19% since 2007, while the rest of the Class Is have experienced declining third quarter volumes on an aggregate basis of about 6%.
We will continue to focus on reinvesting our cash flow back into growing our business for the long run. And projected capital expenditures, as Pat mentioned, for 2016, continue to be in the range of $580 million to $590 million.
Finally, in May of 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program. And a little more than halfway through the life of the program, we have repurchased about 60% of the authorized amount at an average of $89.63 per share. We will continue to monitor economic and business conditions to determine future levels of share repurchases. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Pat."

I'll just close with a few comments to provide an overall assessment for the quarter. 
Obviously, we continue to be in a challenging business environment, as evidenced by our year-over-year declines in overall volumes. While the weakness is most evident in energy-related business, we did experience year-over-year volume decreases in 5 of our 6 major business lines during the quarter.
The good news is we are seeing sequential improvements, and once we cycle through some dramatic reduction in coal and crude oil revenues that began in early 2015, we should start to see some volume growth returning.
In spite of some unusual cost items which occurred during the third quarter, we feel very good about our overall expense management and productivity trends. We feel that the year-to-date view of operating ratio improvement is a more meaningful indicator of those trends. 
Jeff detailed a few of the specific areas of focus, but there are many more that we are working on across all departments in the company that will make us most more cost efficient and productive in the years ahead. 
I gave a presentation at a recent rail shippers' conference, at which I described the near-term business outlook as tepid, which literally means lukewarm or lacking enthusiasm. When volume growth returns, and we are confident that it will at some point, the expense controls and efficiency initiatives we are currently working on should put us in great condition to begin using terms like incremental margins again, which have been noticeably absent from our vocabulary for the past few quarters. 
Finally, we continue to be very optimistic about our long-term growth outlook based on the key growth drivers that we see impacting the KCS network in the years ahead. 
You've heard us talk about these growth drivers before, but just to reiterate. There are new auto plants in Mexico, new petrochemical facilities being built in the U.S. Gulf Coast, growth in capacity at Lázaro Cárdenas and continued growth and market share gains in the cross-border Intermodal markets will be the primary catalysts for KCS in the years ahead.
So with that, I'll open the mic for Q&A."

What I would tell you is we feel very comfortable with the intermodal space. As we've discussed over the last couple of quarters, one of the big shipping companies made a decision to move to an all-vessel water solution out of the Pacific into Houston area. And so that impacted our Lázaro cross-border and Lázaro inter-Mexico business. That's primarily the decline you see from an intermodal perspective. All the other segments are growing, and we feel very comfortable that we are competing well. As we've said before, we will not chase the lower trucking pricing that's out there. We're going to continue to provide the value that we do, both in security and reliability of those shipments. What I would tell you is across the board, though, we feel very comfortable that, sequentially, we're going to continue to grow. It's just slower than, I think, everyone would like it to be, but it's about what we expect. And we're continuing to manage the cost structure and the infrastructure investments according to that. So obviously, the investments in supporting the additional automotive continue. The investments in the energy segment, the refined products, all those pieces are still in place. So the story is pretty much the same, except for that one intermodal move that took a rail move and made it into a water move into the Houston area."

And so on a more normalized quarter, I think you're going to continue to see those improvements. Headcount, for me, as we've talked, with all the hiring in 2015, you're starting to see us kind of lapse that comp. So I think in Q4, you'll continue to see the trends that we saw here in Q3. The one outlier in headcount could be the in-sourced effort I talked about. So a very good financial move for us. But I think that will add about 250 and 300 heads to our kind of internal number. So that will skew just the outlook, but that's the reason that you'll see that in Q4. But all in all, very pleased with how things are progressing.

I would say there's no one out there saying, ""Boy, I want to take action in this way or that way,"" as has been suggested in other places around surcharges and things like that. That's really not the space that we're in. I would tell you, the customers are very aware of the impact as the peso devalues or increases in value. So it's just one of those things we stay very close with them on. But most of the other business that's in dollars is going to stay that way simply because of its global nature."

If we see a quarter where we don't have those kinds of influences, then we think we can see some continued benefit of these initiatives. Jeff mentioned the in-sourcing of the mechanical function in Mexico, which will create a bump in headcount for the quarter, but net effect on operating income and profitability will be positive.

I mean, I think the most important piece when you think about the competitive dynamics of Manzanillo and Lázaro, Lázaro is the only port that has a direct rail connection into the U.S. and into the rest of North America. So the addition of the APMT terminal is going to be pretty significant. If you look at what the government has said, they're looking to double the initial size of the facility. They want to double the capacity of the port. We feel very, very comfortable that, that port is going to continue to grow. Now when you think about competitiveness into the inter-Mexico area, that's where we see the competition right now. The truckers and the low price, there's about -- when you think about the difference between rail and truck, there's about 60% of the volume goes truck, about 40% goes rail. We're hoping that, that continues to improve as people look at the security of the rail, the number of places we can get to and the fluidity. Obviously, Jeff talked about the big investments that we're making. It is important, when you have an intermodal product, to be fluid and consistent. And that's where we, as a management team, are spending all of our time because we realize that the growth opportunity there is significant, not only out of Lázaro, but into the U.S. So from a competitive perspective, we know the value that we bring. We understand how to price it. We believe that it's going to continue to -- the tailwinds are going to go our way as we continue to improve our fluidity. But right now, we feel like we're very, very competitive in the space that we're at. But there's also this dynamic of the vessel operators that we're still dealing with. And it's a global issue. It's not just Mexico. It's not just North America. And so as the vessel operators sort out, probably over the next 12 to 18 months, I think we'll continue to see that port grow at Lazaro."

Turning to our fourth quarter. The combination of a challenging economy and the dual impacts of a weak peso and lower-than-normal fuel surcharge revenues resulted in revenues declining 7% from fourth quarter 2014. The combination of foreign exchange and lower U.S. fuel prices had a significant effect on our consolidated revenue. Excluding those factors, KCS's revenue for the fourth quarter 2014 were approximately flat for the prior year. The company responded very well to the difficult macro conditions, which is illustrated by our posting of 63.3% operating ratio for the quarter, an improvement of 3.4 points compared to fourth quarter 2014. Prime contributors to KCS's strong operating ratio were a strict, steadily improving system velocity and system dwell metrics, which have essentially returned to our 2013 levels. Making our performance even more impressive is the fact that we have to contend with a hurricane that hit Mexico in the late October and devastating floods in Southern Missouri in late December. In both cases, we had to work around washouts and weather-related service delays. Despite the challenges, we operated at a high-level efficiency and recorded service metrics that put KCS in the top tier amongst Class 1s.
Macroeconomic forces served to constrain levels of business growth in certain commodity segments, which appears to be the case moving into 2016. We do not have a crystal ball to help project how the industrial economy will perform over the next 6 to 12 months. For that reason, we are unable to project definite growth and revenue numbers for the near future. 
Pat and Jeff will discuss some of the areas in which we believe KCS can show measurable productivity improvements in 2016 as well as cover some of the capital projects necessary to handle the business growth opportunities that Brian Hancock and his team will be bringing online in the second half of 2016 and into '17 and beyond. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Pat."

We will spend more time this morning focusing on the things that we can and did manage to drive performance in an increasingly volatile and uncertain economic environment. Things like service, cost control, asset utilization and capital structure and liquidity.
Now going back to Slide 7. Here, we show you our velocity and dwell trends over the past 3 years and compare them to the average of all of the other Class 1 rails, excluding KCS. Over the course of 2015, we showed noticeable improvement in both of these key metrics, and we have returned to the strong performance levels that we were producing at the beginning of 2013. This service recovery is even more impressive when you consider that, unlike most of our industry peers, we are handling more volume than we were at the beginning of this period in 2013. In addition, Dave mentioned the weather factors that we had to overcome last year as well. 
Taking a closer look at velocity, this graph shows that we did see some deterioration during the second half of 2014 and first half of 2015. However, we were still performing at a level that was better than the overall industry average. This was not the case for dwell, but we have improved overall terminal dwells by 9% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter and feel that we are back where we need to be to run an efficient network and meet our customers' expectations. 
In addition, our intermodal product has returned to a highly reliable and consistent service, which is the key to regaining and securing some of the lost business that we talked about the last couple of quarters and eventually returning to the higher growth rates we believe are possible, given the size of the truck conversion opportunity here. In a few moments, Jeff Songer will talk about some of the specific things we did to manage these outcomes and why we believe this service performance is sustainable going forward. I will just say that we now have an excellent operating leadership team in place with substantial Class 1 rail experience at multiple layers through the organization. Jeff will elaborate in a few minutes. 
Since becoming President last March, I have worked closely with Jeff and the entire operating team and can assure you that there is a very high sense of urgency in identifying and implementing key initiatives that are behind the improvement and improvements evidenced on these graphs. This process will continue. Jeff has better aligned functional responsibilities with the correct experiences and leadership skills and clear accountabilities to improve the way we manage the railroad, and that is showing up in both our service and cost metrics.
Moving on to Slide 8. You can also see the impact of this improved management focus on this chart. We are very pleased to show this trend has continued, quarter-to-quarter improvement in operating ratio over the course of a very difficult and volatile year and in the absence of volume growth, and therefore, no benefit from incremental margins. Obviously, there are many gives and takes from items like fuel and currency. But even excluding those items, we delivered real productivity gains over the course of a very difficult year. This is another example of managing things that we can control by cost and asset utilization in an environment where there are significant negative factors that we do not. 
Finally, I'll wrap up with Slide 9. I'll give you all a heads up that other than CapEx, which we'll talk about in a couple of minutes, this is the only guidance that we're going to provide at this time. Given the uncertainty that we see in the near-term economic and business environment, the only guidance we can provide is that the long-term outlook continues to be positive, driven by growth in several key market areas; strong pricing trends, which Brian will touch on in a few minutes; and sustainable improvement in service, cost control and asset utilization. And as we state in the center of the slide, we expect to show long-term continued improvement in operating ratio, earnings per share and return on invested capital. As you've heard from all of the other rails that have reported so far, the short-term outlook is very uncertain, and as a result, we are just not in a position to provide more definitive guidance regarding volume, revenue or operating ratio.
Many of you on the call this morning have as much or better information regarding the economic outlook, commodity and currency markets than we do. I was at a rail industry conference last week, and I thought one railroad executive characterized the current landscape quite well when he said, and I'm paraphrasing here, ""We are in an energy market depression, an industrial and manufacturing recession, but somehow, the consumer is doing okay."" We do know that the long-term outlook is strong. And for the near term, we will focus again on those things over which we have more control to drive long-term continued improvement in all of our key metrics. 
Mike Upchurch will talk to you in a few moments about a recently completed debt restructuring, which we believe improves our overall liquidity profile and strengthens our financial flexibility. Growth will return. The investments in chemical plants, auto production, port terminals and other facilities that is taking place in our service area is quite remarkable. In 2016, we are forecasting a reduction in overall capital spending. Jeff will touch -- give you more detail on that in a minute. But we will continue to spend on those key projects that support the industrial development activity and new business opportunities taking place on our network. When these new plants and terminals open, we will be ready to capitalize immediately on the opportunities that we know are coming over the longer-term horizon. 
In closing, I will restate once more that our near-term focus will be on those things over which we have more control, such as service, cost control, asset utilization and capital structure. With that, I will turn the presentation over to Jeff Songer."

2015 was a challenging year for the operating team. As outlined on past calls, wide fluctuations in volume, while aligning an appropriate resources, had a negative impact on service levels. However, the team has worked through these challenges and has ended the year with a positive trend. Organizationally, we continue to make changes necessary to ensure our continued performance improvements. When I stepped into the job over a year ago, one of our first organizational moves was to appoint a new vice president of transportation in the U.S. This individual brings over 30 years of railroad experience from Union Pacific and CSX and positions the operating team well into the future. 
Likewise in Mexico, we promoted a new head of transportation who has led the efforts in restoring our workforce and is now focused on regaining service levels. About that time, we announced a new vice president of our mechanical organization. This individual brings 30 years of experience, notably with Amtrak and CSX. Last August, we added a director of intermodal and automotive operations in Mexico. This former CSX employee brings 8 years of experience, leading large intermodal terminals in Chicago and New York. 
Finally, in November, we promoted a new lead for our Network Operations Center and crew management function. This individual came to KCS in 2013 from the BNSF, where he had successfully worked in the operating departments since 1997. Additional realignment of our Network Operating Center and field operating teams as well as restructuring our crew management team should lead for greater synergy and coordination of the network. 
Touching on our workforce, the 2015 Mexico hiring initiative is complete, and crews in Mexico are stable. In the U.S., we are currently at 6% of the T&E workforce on furlough status, and we will continue to manage our resources to meet volume demands.
Moving into 2016. Well, we continue -- we will continue our focus on service and increasing productivity to reduce cost. Specific actions already in process include the implementation of interdivisional trains, which allow for the reduction in crew starts across the segment due to improved velocity. This operation started in January between Shreveport and Meridian. And we will implement a similar approach in Mexico between Nuevo Laredo and Monterrey, where our capital improvements have allowed us to increase track speed to 70 miles an hour in this segment. 
Working in coordination with the UP, we have relocated a dispatch console from Kansas City to Spring, Texas, to dispatch this joint KCS/UP/BNSF territory. All railroads are now working together in the same facility to ensure the most efficient operation. 
Sanchez Yard Phase I has completed schedule and Phase II is underway. The additional capacity will enable us to process trains at the border more fluidly; and in 2016, will allow for transition of some work from Laredo to Sanchez to reduce overall labor cost in this segment. Opportunities to streamline the departure process from the port of Lázaro will allow us to reduce car handling and improve cycle times by an average by 6 hours per train. Additionally, we've allocated capital in 2016 to install locomotive fuel optimization technology for 20% of our road fleet, which will help to improve fuel efficiency and velocity of our trains. 
Regarding operating metrics for the quarter, system velocity improved 1% to 27 miles per hour, while dwell time in terminals improved 9% versus Q4 2014. Velocity and dwell metrics continue to be a focus as we regain our consistent service levels and will also allow for improved asset utilization, driving down equipment cost.
Moving on to Slide 12. Capital spending for 2016 is projected at $580 million to $590 million, which represents a 10% reduction from 2015. Reductions in overall maintenance spend and no planned locomotive purchases in 2016 will more than offset our continued investment in growth-related industries. 
We remain steadfast in our commitment to invest in projects such as Sasol, Sanchez Yard, the Port of Lázaro as well as adding additional automotive and intermodal equipment to meet the future projected growth in these areas. 
I will now turn the presentation over to Chief Marketing Officer, Brian Hancock."

2015 was a year in which the organization faced continued volatility in commodity prices and general business conditions. Overall, we're pleased with the creativity and perseverance that the team is shown in working through these issues. To begin, as noted earlier, carloadings for the quarter were down 2% year-over-year and revenue was flat after taking out the impact of currency in fuel, while we continued to see solid pricing of 4.1% all-in for the quarter. Let me provide a little more detail by line of business using Page 14 as a reference. 
In our Chemicals & Petroleum business, we saw an increase of 8% in carloads with a 4% increase in revenue, driven by increased volume in our petroleum and plastic shipments. Our Industrial & Consumer business unit was down 14% versus 2014, which continues the trend we've seen for most of 2015. The year-over-year decrease for the quarter was driven by continued weakness in our metals business, being slightly offset by an increase in our other carloads area. Our Ag & Mineral business delivered a 2% increase in carloads in the fourth quarter, driven by strength in the food products and ores and minerals segments, offset by slightly lighter grain volumes. Revenue for Ag & Mineral was up 4% when you remove the effects of fuel and foreign exchange. Our Energy segment continues to be impacted by mix and continued volatility in the commodity prices. Overall carloads in the quarter were up 11%, while adjusted revenue was off 4%. 
For the quarter, our Intermodal volume was down 6%, with adjusted revenues off 5%. And our cross-border volume was off 8%, and down 3% in revenue. As Jeff mentioned, given the improved service levels in the latter half of the year, our Intermodal offering continues to compete well for the increased volume in this segment. 
For the fourth quarter, our Automotive business increased year-over-year 1%, with an adjusted revenue increase of 6%. Our Automotive group was able to take advantage of the improved fluidity in the network and provide additional capacity and speed on our finished vehicle shipments, providing a strong finish to the quarter. 
On Slide 15, we provided visual update to some of our largest investments, which will continue to increase capacity and fluidity across the network. On the top left-hand side, you can see a picture of the new super Panamax cranes being delivered to the APM Terminal in Lázaro Cárdenas. As stated previously, this terminal will double the port capacity when it opens in the second half of 2016. 
In the bottom left-hand corner, you can see a picture taken last week of the construction at the new BMW manufacturing plant. This facility is another tangible example of the growing automotive manufacturing footprint in Mexico. 
On the top right-hand side, an updated view of the Sasol plant on the Gulf, which will provide an anchor for our growth in the plastics industry. 
And in the bottom right, we show a long-term illustration of the Sanchez Yard in Nuevo Laredo, which will provide better capacity and fluidity on all of our cross-border moves. This capability provides our customers with better and more reliable solutions they can count on as they expand their cross-border supply chain. 
As we've mentioned earlier, we continue to stay focused on preparing for the opportunities in front of us, and we plan to take advantage of our enhanced capacity and fluidity as we execute our critical customer deliverables in 2016. 
With that, I'll now turn the presentation over to our CFO, Mike Upchurch."
30472,318875551,1423285,"Kansas City Southern, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 22, 2016",2016-01-22,"Earnings Calls","Kansas City Southern","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone.

I'm going to start my comments on Slide 17. Our fourth quarter volumes declined 2%, while revenues declined 7%. The peso depreciation had a $20 million negative impact on revenue growth during the quarter, while declining U.S. fuel prices had a $27 million unfavorable impact on revenue growth. Combined, this $47 million impact contributed to a 7 percentage point negative impact on the revenues. Operating ratio improved 330 basis points to 63.4%, a new record for fourth quarter. A 12% reduction in expenses helped offset the negative impacts from lower volumes and revenues. And I'll cover more expense details in a couple of slides. 
Our adjusted effective income tax rate for the quarter was 32.4%, and further details are included in the appendix on Slide 35. I might offer one comment that the Congress enacted legislation in December, providing us an extension of the short-line tax credit, not only for 2015 but also 2016. And the 2015 benefit in the fourth quarter was about $2.5 million, while we expect about a $3.5 million benefit in 2016. 
Reported fourth quarter 2015 EPS was $1.28 a share, flat year-over-year. And adjusting for debt exchange cost and foreign exchange impact, adjusted EPS was $1.23, a 3% decline from fourth quarter of 2014. We've provided a reconciliation of our reported to adjusted EPS in the appendix on Slide 31 and have also included full year results in the appendix and in our consolidated investor report on our website.
Turning to Slide 18. While the peso did experience significant depreciation quarter-over-quarter, you can see the impact was minimal on the operating income at an estimated $200,000 due to our peso-based revenues and expenses essentially offsetting each other.
Moving to Slide 19. As I mentioned on my first slide, we did experience a $47 million negative impact of revenues from foreign exchange and lower U.S. fuel prices. That is the trend that we expect to continue in 2016 as the peso is expected to continue to decline, particularly in the first and second quarters as projected exchange rates are 16% and 12%, respectively, lower than what we saw in 2015. Likewise, we are projected to experience significant declines in revenue from lower U.S. fuel surcharges more pronounced in first, second and third quarters at 26%, 20%, and 12% declines. These factors are based on readily available estimates, but I might note that the current exchange rate is significantly worse than the estimates, and we're currently at $18.50, while highway diesel prices are at $2.11 per gallon. Again, the take away here, we will have significant pressure in first quarter and second quarter at a minimum from foreign exchange and lower U.S. fuel prices.
Moving to Slide 20. Fourth quarter operating expenses declined $50 million year-over-year, most notably from peso depreciation, lower U.S. fuel prices and continued lower incentive compensation expense. Beyond those items, we managed expenses lower by $11 million through various cost reduction and expense control effort while depreciation increased $7 million. And I'll cover more expense details in the next few slides. 
In Slide 21, compensation and benefits expense declined $19 million for the quarter, mainly from lower incentive compensation, impacts from the peso depreciation and year-over-year benefits, primarily from unfavorable actuarial true-ups in our fourth quarter of 2014 that relate to post-employment benefits. Offsetting those declines were $4 million in wage inflation. And while overall average FTEs increased 3% to support improving service levels in Mexico that Jeff previously covered, we experienced lower headcount in the U.S., resulting in no net expense increases as a result of wage differential. 
Moving to Slide 22. Fuel expense declined $25 million, largely due to declining U.S. fuel prices and the impact of the peso depreciation. Our average U.S. fuel price was $1.54 per gallon during fourth quarter 2015, a 37% decline from the previous year. On a constant currency basis, we saw Mexican fuel prices stay flat year-over-year as a result of government price actions.
Moving to Slide 23. During the fourth quarter, equipment cost declined $1 million, while depreciation increased $7 million. We've continued to experience lower equipment cost as a result of our strategies [indiscernible]  leased assets, and accordingly, we saw a $2 million decline in equipment costs. Partially offsetting that $2 million in lower equipment costs due to leased conversion with higher depreciation of $1 million. Other increases in equipment cost were primarily incremental car hire expenses as we continue to experience hire cars on line. Depreciation also increased by $6 million from a larger asset base as a result of our capital expenditure programs. 
On Slide 24, during the fourth quarter, we saw purchased services decline $11 million due to maintenance contract restructuring, lower repair cost, foreign exchange benefits, reduced joint facility cost and lower legal fees. Materials & Other expense was flat year-over-year, benefiting from the peso depreciation, which was offset by higher materials and supplies expense, resulting from the in-sourcing of a previously mentioned maintenance contract.
Moving to Slide 25. I'd like to provide an update on our capital structure priorities. And we continue to be focused on investing in our business to maximize our growth opportunities. For 2015, we incurred $649 million in capital, slightly below our guidance of $650 million to $670 million. And for 2016, as Jeff already mentioned, acknowledging the uncertain volume environment we're operating under, we expect to further reduce our capital to somewhere between $580 million and $590 million. 
With respect to shareholder returns, we continue to repurchase our shares during the fourth quarter and repurchased approximately 675,000 shares for $58 million or an average price of $85.69. Through the first 6 month of the program, we've repurchased approximately 194 million in stock, which represents a reduction in our shares outstanding by 2.1 million shares. We front-loaded the program by buying about 40% of the authorized $500 million 2-year repurchase program during the first 6 months. 
And finally, we continue to optimize our capital structure. As Pat mentioned in December, we completed a debt consolidation program by exchanging approximately $2 billion of our KCSR and KCSM subsidiary debt into parent company debt, which provides us more financial flexibility, lower future borrowing costs, less administrative costs of maintaining 2 capital structures and enhanced cash flow flexibility. Additionally, we established a corporate-level revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, increasing our overall liquidity to $800 million. 
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Dave."

Before opening up the call for questions, I'd like to end with just a few glass-half-full comments. What we're going through right now reminds me a lot of what we were going through back in 2009. KCS, like the other rails, reacted to the recession with a host of service and productivity initiatives that partially mitigated the impact of the business downturn. We at KCS, at the same time, knew that we had an abundance of business growth opportunities on the near horizon. Sure enough, KCS came out of the recession, hitting on all cylinders with a new business growth and efficient operations fueling strong earnings from 2010 to 2014. 
Now fast-forward to 2016. Reacting to the challenging economy, KCS has implemented and continues to implement service and productivity initiatives. The impact of which have already been shown to be positive. And just like 2009, we're looking at expansive, near-term business growth opportunities. To name but a few on the horizon, 2 new auto plants in Mexico will open in the second half of 2016. While at the same time, we will also begin to see the benefits from the plant expansions at the 3 of the auto facilities we serve in Mexico. I might also add that in the near future, you will likely hear of an additional auto growth on our line, but that's a story for another day. 
Also during the second half, the APM Maersk Terminal at Lázaro Cárdenas is presently scheduled to open. 2017 Mexican Energy Reform goes into effect and will provide us the opportunity to remove buying products into Mexico, which promises to be a very good-sized business opportunity. And over the next couple of years, KCS expects to begin to gain the benefit of the growth of a plastics production that will be centered in the Gulf region. 
But let me be clear. KCS, like everybody else, is confronted with some challenging economic issues impacting some of our commodities. These issues will be with us for a while. But the growth opportunities we see coming online, coupled with stronger than ever operations, makes us confident and excited about our future. 
So with that, I'll open it up for questions."

But when we -- the growth numbers that we see over the next few years, again we've got to support that growth, and overall, just the rail growth in our industry for the next years. I'm pleased that all of the railroads are continuing to spend on capital because we are a network. And if one railroad has service problems, it reflects -- it affects all of us. So I think we're all continuing to do the right thing. We're franchises that can't be duplicated. You're not going to build another railroad. So we've got to be aware -- or we've got to be committed to our business. And I think we are. So when shareholders come to our office and ask me how are we going to spend their money, the first thing is for growth. And I think that's what they want to hear. Then it's dividend, then it's a stock buyback. But growth tops everything. And that's what we're continuing to do. So what I talk more about on feeling the 2009 with 2016 is more of that feeling that we were working through cost issues. We were taking a lot of low-hanging fruit off. But Jeff now is -- he's taking it to a different level. He's going after things that we never had an opportunity to. He's got a great team. So we're focusing on what we can control in today's environment. So when we come out of this recession into the back half of '16 hopefully, '17, '18, we're going to be poised to get back to those margins, those outsized margins we had back in that 4-year period.

But right now, that's really the only rifle shot approach or flexibility, if you will, that we've done in the past, that and some of the commodities. But it's been based on short-term capacity availability, no new locomotives. And did it makes sense to put it in our network? And was it a very positive contribution? Absolutely. So those will still -- but we're not going to get into the discount business. That's not what railroads do. So if that's your question, are we going to become a commodity-based pricing and we're going to get into the discount business? I don't think we need to do that. The challenge is still going to be for the coming years is having the capacity to handle the demand."

And how do you think about -- I guess, if Mexico was up, I would imagine Mexico was up, and there's a good portion to that 3%. You said that 6% of U.S. is furloughed. Is that the right number to use in terms of trying to figure out how much Mexico is really up and how much the U.S. is down? I'm just trying to figure out that balance."

In the U.S., same story, we've kind of went through a fluctuation of increases in the significant furloughs last year. I think we're just coming out of the year in a better place. So to me, the more -- the better story this year is that some of the productivity initiatives we've seen and I've outlined, those are actually leaning toward the furloughs in the U.S. versus just the total volume component, so..."

Some of the changes that Jeff talked about in his comments are allowing us to do, as Dave said, more with less, to use crews and assets more efficiently. And so it's not just a function of looking at headcount, it's really the efficiency of the network. The other thing and kind of ties in with the previous question is, as we said, we still feel confident based on all of the things that we're seeing being built on our network, that growth will return. And given the lead time in this business on things like crews and hiring and training crews and other assets that are needed to handle that growth. You've kind of got to look a little bit further down the line, so to speak, in order to fine-tune exactly what that balance is between, ""What do I need to handle business volumes today versus what do I know is coming in the relatively near future."" And if circumstances change and our outlook changes, then we have to move in and manage that. So there's no doubt that the environment we're in is causing us to be much more nimble. And I think we've responded pretty well. Jeff's team has done an outstanding job of kind of being on their toes and really looking at ways that we can respond. If you just look at 2015 as an example, I think we showed a slide like this in the previous earnings call, started out strong. We were hiring and training in January and in the early part of the first quarter a year ago. Then everything energy-related collapsed. And we were literally furloughing crews as they were coming out of training. And then volume kind of recovered in the third quarter, and we were scrambling to get them back. So we were kind of chasing our tail. So we really -- one of the things we focused on is looking a little bit longer term but being nimble and quick to respond as we get better information about the outlook to manage the resources appropriately."

Do you worry at all about the fact that perhaps some shippers and carriers are going to be bringing the freight across the border, be it a handoff at the border from one trucking company to the next, and then handing it off to the UP, north of the border where the Intermodal service in theory is more truck-like? Or am I reading too much into those big investments that the UP is making along the border?"

But Port of Laredo has been there for years, so this is not anything new. I know UP is going through a big expansion and there's still a lot of business that comes into Laredo, a lot of business gets transloaded. If you look at the slides of the truck market, we've talked about it being over $3 million. So that's always part of our target market is to go after that truck that stops at Laredo for some reason. But we still see the market growing to the point. I don't blame the UP for doing what they did. They want to make sure they've got capacity. But I do look at Port of Laredo being more of that traffic that's coming from the northern end of Mexico. When you get deeper into Mexico, down into our service territory, the cross-border is still by far the best cost savings, security and the way to keep your cargo together for our border crossings. But Laredo is always a challenge for us even because of brokers. So anyway, look, that does not keep us awake at night. It's just part of the overall growth."
