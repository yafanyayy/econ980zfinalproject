Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NASDAQ's fourth quarter 2015 and full-year results. I will set a quick agenda for today's call. I want to first review our strong fourth quarter results then provide more color around how we will deliver for our customers and shareholders in the periods to come. And lastly, our CFO has decided to retire and we'll discuss more at the end of the prepared remarks before opening up to Q&A.
Turning back now to our results. We are extremely pleased to deliver another record-setting quarter and full year 2015 results for our shareholders. This is highlighted by record net revenues and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 10% year-over-year despite a 4% FX headwind. The positive organic growth in net revenues, 5% year-over-year for the quarter and 4% for the year, generated across this entire franchise suggests that we are on the right path in terms of running our business well and delivering for our clients. Even more impressive was that our nontrading segments grew 8% for the quarter and 6% for the year.
At the same time, in 2015, we invested over $400 million in R&D initiatives, capital expenditures and bolt-on acquisitions to support our future growth while also returning a very significant amount of capital to our shareholders. 
But what is important to me is I believe this quarter really echoes our laser focus on our customers, and as I assess the competitive positioning of each of our businesses in the very diverse markets in which we compete, I am again most proud that the vast majority of our businesses improved their competitive positioning during the quarter and the year relative to their competitors and most importantly in meeting and anticipating our customers' needs. Let me now give you a few highlights on the year and continued advancements of our strategic plan. 
Our foundational businesses, our Cash Equities and Listing Services on both sides of the Atlantic continued to perform at the highest levels. Combined revenues of $134 million this quarter was the highest since the first quarter of 2010 and saw a combined organic growth of 16% versus the prior year. While we continue to benefit today from the contributions of these businesses, I'm especially encouraged about how our broader portfolio, which leverages this foundation will benefit us in the periods to come. 
In our Listing Services segment, we continued to provide companies with an outstanding platform to access capital by leveraging our DNA as a financial technology provider. Let me give you a few examples. During the quarter, Listing Services achieved a 15% organic growth and record quarterly revenues, capping a record-setting year. We continue to demonstrate strong competitive leadership in the IPO market where we won an astounding 78% of all IPOs in the quarter and 73% for the full year. Our proposition more and more is echoing favorably with companies who want to access the broad spectrum of solutions we offer and benefit from the visibility of our vibrant brand. To further underscore this, during the quarter, we were the beneficiaries of several significant switches to our equity markets, including TD Ameritrade, T-Mobile and CSX. All in all, we welcomed 27 switches during the year from our competitors with a combined market cap of around $90 billion.
Our Nordic markets were also a leading choice for IPOs in 2015 with 91 listing, raising over $54 billion SEC. It was truly an outstanding performance and, as a result, we had one of the strongest IPO markets that certainly I can remember or in that region's history. 
Our product set, as you know, is not limited to public companies. We have made considerable investments in developing our market for private companies. These companies are the very foundation of an ecosystem of innovation and economic growth. During the quarter, we continued to expand and develop our platform for private companies with strong organic growth in our customer base, and we announced and closed the acquisition of SecondMarket. This further establishes NASDAQ private market as the leading provider of innovative technology-driven efficient solutions for secondary liquidity and equity management services. And we're thrilled to have added significant talent and quality customers that can benefit from our expanded offerings. NPM is a true innovation and a private company solution, and in the quarter we innovated upon that innovation with the deployment of blockchain technology. As compared to 3-day settlement in the public market, we settled, cleared and moved the money in minutes in the private market. 
In technology circles, you frequently attempt to have a first release of a product be minimally viable. It is extraordinary that our first release of blockchain settlement and clearing is so substantially superior to what has been represented in the public market for over 50 years.
In our Market Services segment, we are creating more efficient trading opportunities where our clients need it most. In addition to relatively strong average capture and healthy activity levels we saw during the fourth quarter, we also announced our agreement to acquire Chi-X Canada. Chi-X Canada is an ATS is the #2 player in the Canadian equity space has exhibited strong trends in share and revenue growth and has healthy profitability with margins broadly comparable to our business in the U.S. This transaction is expected to close in the first quarter this year and we're looking forward to working with Chi's management team to integrate our organizations, systems and offerings to further expand on their compelling offering to the Canadian market.
Moving beyond our foundational Equity Trading and Listing's business, we saw encouraging performance across other businesses, including Information Services, which grew 7% year-over-year on an organic basis, further highlighting the tremendous value and in depth intelligence these solutions provide our clients. On the Index side, we saw growth in both the Dorsey Rice Smart Beta franchise as well as our legacy index properties.
Now moving to Technology Solutions segment, we made equally strong progress to lever the power of the innovative technology we developed, use ourselves and make available to clients. Market Technology grew 16% year-on-year on an organic basis, in part due to an exceptionally strong period for change request while operationally achieving important milestone, the completion of a successful Phase I implementation of Borsa Istanbul, which included the launch of a new equity trading platform, settlement and clearing solution. This was one of the most complex and ambitious product deliveries by any exchange. It represents a great effort by both the team at NASDAQ and at Borsa Istanbul. We look forward to continuing to work towards the Phase II delivery milestone, including the launch of their new derivatives trading platform in the periods to come. 
We also experienced an exceptional quarter in terms of total order value, one of the highest ever, including new contracts through INET trading system for the Tel Aviv Stock exchange, Genium INET clearing for the Australian exchange and one of our larger order intakes ever for the smart trades surveillance and several significant BY contracts. Our ambition is to do more for our clients and anticipating their needs also continues to drive how we evaluate and invest and execute on new opportunities. In 2015, we made significant progress on this front and I want to highlight a few examples for you today. 
I mentioned NASDAQ private market and our continued progress. In 2015, we invested significantly in this platform both from internal initiatives and, obviously, the SecondMarket acquisition. Our secondary market transactions hit record levels in 2015. NASDAQ platforms facilitated over 40 transactions worth over $1.6 billion. This represents a 33% increase from the previous year. As a result, NPM, including the partial quarter impact of SecondMarket, served over 107 private companies, up from 61 in 2014, a very strong performance. 
It is our job to make sure we push the limits of our systems and technology can accomplish, as I mentioned, leveraging our core DNA as the financial technology provider is fundamental to us. We see blockchain technology as having great potential to enable markets operate more efficiently, that's why we continue to explore ways we can harness its capabilities to the benefits of our clients. We -- in November, we announced that we were exploring the application of blockchain technology to proxy voting in Estonia and an application is currently in development, while we also expect to initiate more used cases in the short term. We feel good about our position to lead new market innovation in this space, and you'll certainly hear more from us about our efforts in the months to come.
Another significant investment we made during the year that highlights our commitment to our corporate clients was NASDAQ IR insight. Here, we are advancing a technology platform created from the ground up to reshape the workflow and the productivity of our corporate offices. The full version of IR insight was launched on schedule and made available to our customers just a few weeks ago. Early feedback from new users has been very encouraging, citing its clear and easy-to-use interface. It's a huge step forward in terms of productivity and how well it stacks up to competing offerings. Already in the first few weeks we've seen incremental sales wins across all 3 global regions, including first-time custom wins, some from competitors as well as existing customers adding new users. Some new sales have also come bundled with wins in other Corporate Solutions products, affirming how IR insight can accelerate growth in the other products because its core architecture was designed to support cross product functionality. Early days, but very encouraging. 
We made other key investments in the last year in our other core franchises as well, including our Information Services segment. We accelerated our path to become one of the leading Smart Beta index providers through the acquisition and integration of Dorsey Wright at the beginning of the year and our partnership with first trust open the door for the alpha decks family of indexes to switch to NASDAQ. In addition, we launched 56 new exchange traded products linked to NASDAQ indices, which along with growth in our existing product, helped AUM grow in products tracking our indices by 15% in 2015. 
We will never stop seeking ways where we can bring efficiency, scale and benefits for our trading customers. In 2015, we launched NFX, a bold execution of this strategy. We begun laying the groundwork for this over 2 years ago, inspired by our desire to provide market participants with a more efficient and cost-effective solution in the energy derivatives space. Now in its sixth month of operation, a wide section of the trading community is using our platform with over 90 firms executing transactions on it thus far. Just last week, we hit the sixth month anniversary. We've traded 4.3 million contracts over that time, and we achieved a new milestone with open interest crossing 500,000 contracts for the first time just this week. We are encouraged by the progress we're making in the energy and commodity space while broadening our product offerings in ways that lever our core technology assets and deep customer relationships.
So far, I have highlighted the various ways our core businesses are growing through our client focus, ability to execute and the investments we're making in our future. When we look at the prongs of our strategy and ability to execute well, our disciplined use of capital plays a significant role in our ability to deliver strong returns to our shareholders. As I have a highlighted throughout my remarks, however, we believe our future is determined in our ability to challenge the status quo and making sure the investments we make are not only strategic but also yield attractive return. I'm pleased to report that in 2015 we invested in a number of R&D initiatives like NFX, complementary acquisitions like Dorsey, Wright & Associates and SecondMarket as well as the pending closure of acquisition of Chi-x Canada. In combination with our second highest CapEx total history, a total of over $400 million in investment was made for our future while still returning a very material amount of capital to our shareholders.
Now I'd like to spend a little bit on some of the key opportunities and areas of focus for us in 2016. At NASDAQ, we are never afraid to look inward at how we do things to make sure we are organized and structured in a way that enables us to lever all our assets to deliver for our client. I think the creation of the role of a COO and appointment of Adena Friedman to this position, which we announced in the fourth quarter, certainly is at the heart of this philosophy and we're looking forward to her contributions. 
We believe the underlying economic trends in the geographies where we operate are healthy, but we also realize the world is more globally interconnected than ever before. Our model and business mix provides us with a number of ways to not only respond to these trends but to develop new opportunities in lockstep with our clients. At the same time, our model ensures we see direct and immediate revenue benefit in operating leverage from elevated volumes. 
In closing, this year really points to the fact that our business model is incredibly sound. We are anticipating the needs of our clients better than ever, which is really driving our ability to deliver meaningful long-term growth across this franchise. It was a great quarter and a great year. I'd like to thank again the NASDAQ team, and I look forward to working with them to take our business even further in the months ahead. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. My commentary will focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations to GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and then the presentation is available",1651,"Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. My commentary will focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations to GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and then the presentation is available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com. 
I want to start off as I did in the last few quarters by highlighting the impact the stronger dollar had on our year-over-year results. Excluding the impact of FX, our net revenues would have been up $37 million or 7% from the prior year and operating income would have been up $21 million or 9%. I will start by reviewing fourth quarter revenue performance relative to the prior year quarter as shown on Page 3 of the presentation. 
The 4% or $19 million increase in reported revenue of $536 million consisted of organic growth in the nontrading segments revenue of $26 million or 8% due to growth in Listings, Information Services and Market Technology, plus $9 million in revenues from the DWA acquisition reduced by a $10 million FX impact. 
Organic growth in Market Services net revenues of $2 million or 1% resulting principally from higher cash equity revenues reduced by an $8 million FX impact. 
And if we move to Page 4 in the presentation, we show how organic growth breaks down historically between the nontrading Information Services, Technology Solutions and Listing Services segments, which collectively had 8% organic growth this quarter and the volume-sensitive Market Services segment at 1% for the quarter. 
Looking at our full year 2015 results, we have achieved 6% organic growth for our nontrading segments, around the upper end of our mid-single-digit medium-term guidance, and in Market Services, we achieved 3% organic growth for the full year 2015, continuing positive organic growth for the second straight year. 
I'm now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be to the prior-year period unless otherwise noted. 
Information Services on Page 5 saw an $8 million or 7% organic increase plus a $9 million increase from the DWA acquisition, reduced by $3 million FX impact. Market Data revenues saw a $7 million or 8% organic increase, reflecting growth in tape plan and proprietary revenues. Index licensing and services saw a $1 million or 5% organic increase from higher listing revenue from asset-based fees, partially offset by volume declines in revenues tied to certain derivative products. 
Technology Solutions, as shown on Page 6, saw a $9 million or 6% organic revenue increase, reduced by a $5 million FX impact. The operating margin was 21%, up from 16% in the prior-year period. For the full year, Technology Solutions operating margin totaled 15%, a 200 basis point improvement year-over-year. We continue to have confidence in reaching our medium-term objective and expect further progress as we move through 2016. 
Market Technology revenues saw a $10 million or 16% organic increase due to organic growth in surveillance products and increases in change requests. New order intake was $116 million in the fourth quarter, our strongest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2014. And the period end backlog finished at an all-time record $788 million, up 10% year-over-year. 
Corporate Solutions revenue saw a $1 million or 1% organic decline as we continue to progress through the late stages of the integration and customer transitions from the acquisition of the Thomson Reuters corporate businesses. 
We continue to see improving momentum in the business, particularly with the fourth consecutive quarter of net positive subscription sales, which totaled $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the positive catalyst of the full IR insight launch in 2016. 
Listing Services on Page 7 saw a $9 million or 15% organic increase in revenues, driven by pricing changes and an increase in the issuer base, reduced by $2 million of an FX impact. Operating margin of 41% was up from 38% in the prior year quarter. I'd note here that looking forward, we expect a return to low single digits listing revenue growth, consistent with our medium-term outlook, as the impact of the January 2015 pricing changes is fully in the run rate. 
Market Services on Page 8 saw a $2 million or 1% organic increase in net revenues, reduced by an $8 million FX impact. Operating margin declined to 53% from 55% in the prior-year period. Equity Derivatives, trading and clearing net revenues saw a 6% organic decline, primarily due to lower industry trading volumes followed by lower U.S. market share. Cash equities trading net revenues saw a 17% organic increase as higher cash equity net capture and increased industry volumes were partially offset by modestly lower market shares. Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities, trading and clearing net revenues saw a 24% organic decline from the prior year, principally due to volume-driven declines in U.S. fixed income, followed by European energy. Access and Broker Services revenue saw a 3% organic revenue increase.
Turning to Pages 9 and 14 to revenue the income statement and expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses, increased $12 million on an organic basis or a 4% increase and $4 million primarily due to the Dorsey Wright acquisition, partially offset by $11 million in an FX impact. The $285 million in fourth quarter 2015 expenses put us at a full-year total of $1,114,000,000, up 3% on an organic basis. 
Non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter rose 7% on an organic basis versus a 6% reported increase. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 47%, up from 46% in the prior-year period, reflecting the margin improvement of our Listings and Technology Solutions business. Net interest expense was $27 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $1 million versus prior year, mainly due to higher net debt. And the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 33% and the full year 2015 figure was 33.4%, at the low end of our 33% to 35% tax rate guidance. 
Non-GAAP net income was $150 million or $0.89 per diluted share compared to $139 million or $0.81 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The $0.08 increase in our non-GAAP EPS represents core organic EPS growth of 6%, $0.02 of growth due to acquisitions, $0.02 due to a lower share count and a $0.01 increase due to a lower effective tax rate in the quarter, partially offset by $0.03 impact -- negative $0.03 impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. 
Our 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance is $1,110,000,000 to $1,160,000,000 and the midpoint of our expense guidance corresponds to a 2% increase from 2015 non-GAAP operating expenses. The expense guidance does not yet include the impact of our acquisition of Chi-X Canada, which we expect to close later in the first quarter of 2015. We also continue to expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 33% to 35% in 2016.
Moving on to the balance sheet, cash flow and capital, please turn to Slide 11 and 12. We repurchased 67 million in stock during the fourth quarter and through dividends and repurchases returned $526 million in capital to shareholders in 2015, accounting for more than 90% of non-GAAP net income.
Now onto the last thing I wanted to cover in my prepared remarks today. After nearly 5 years here at NASDAQ and many more serving as an adviser to the company and to the industry, I've decided to retire from my CFO position to accept an invitation to join the board of a public company, which will be announced later today. This is an opportunity for me to bring my experience to the board level and develop another set of skills. I'm very grateful to NASDAQ, and to both Bob and Adena in particular, to have had the opportunity to serve as the CFO and be a part of its leadership team, and I'm proud of what the company has accomplished during my time here. I've learned a tremendous amount in the role and am grateful to all of my colleagues for their support and friendship. When I arrived, I saw an opportunity to build on NASDAQ's expense discipline with a complementary capital discipline that has been critical to allocating the substantial cash we generate as effectively as possible. This discipline also supported our decision to initiate a regular dividend and significantly grow our payout ratio. We also streamlined our business line reporting, introduce segment profitability disclosure and initiated an organic growth outlook for our nontransactional segments, underscoring the company's confidence and the sustainable growth prospects of these businesses. I believe strongly all of these serve to make clear the quality of NASDAQ's diverse portfolio. I feel emphatically that my departure comes at a time when NASDAQ's financial position and accounting are in outstanding health, in step with the operations of its strong business portfolio. And I'm also confident that strong capital discipline has become embedded at NASDAQ and will be continued to be applied in all uses of capital. And if it isn't, I will be front and center at the next shareholders meeting to hold management accountable. 
Ron Hassen, NASDAQ's controller for the past 14 years, will step into the role of CFO on an interim basis for the second time in his career. And I will stay at the company in March to support Ron and to ensure a seamless transition of responsibilities. The company has commenced the search for a permanent CFO replacement. 
I would also like to stay it's been a truly rewarding experience getting to know the investors and analysts that covered, invested in and followed NASDAQ during my time here. I've learned an extraordinary amount from your diverse perspectives, try to apply it where possible and look forward to continuing our interaction during my remaining time here. So please don't take this call as a final goodbye. Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to Bob."

So we definitely did have a strong underlying quarter. But on a full-year basis, you can see that we believe that our margins for that business in 2015 were 16%. And we continue to make progress against the 20% goal for full-year margin. But we still have some work to do. And as we go into 2016, we see a few things of particular strength. Number one, we still have not yet recognized revenue from the Borsa Istanbul contract. That will start to be able to recognize that as we continue to deliver on that contract. We also have continued growth in SMART which will continue to drive both topline revenue and margin expansion. And then in Corporate Solutions, the IR Insight rollout has just begun. We launched it 2 weeks ago. We already have about 100 clients using the new product. We have clients calling us asking us when they can get migrated or rolled out. And we have a very full schedule in the months to come as we continue to roll out that new service. So we feel very good going in 2016 around the progress there, but we still have work to do to get to that full-year 20% margin goal."

And then on the Technology Solutions margin, as Adena indicated, I think we are excited about 2 things. One, with the IR Insight launch, that clearly enables to reach the final phase for us in eliminating some of the expenses. You are seeing some of the impact of the investments that we've made in the IR Insight platform in our depreciation and amortization. But the upside will also be driven by success in revenue growth. And as I indicated in the comments, the net subscription sales and overall new sales of products in the Corporate Solutions sector as a leading indicator has been very positive and gives us confidence about making that continued progress against the goal in 2016."

Generally speaking, what we look at is obviously we look at AUM, but we also look at TSO, which is the total shares outstanding. And that's more an indication a core indication of the demand for the product from investors. So right now, we are seeing our TSO is holding steady as we've been dealing with the volatility in the market. And so for us that means the underlying demand for the product is strong.

The third community is the buy side community. And for the first time this year, we do have 3 buy side clients who have signed up for the service. And we have chosen to invest through our R&D program to build out more fulsome buy side solution for this trade surveillance. So by side firms, both hedge funds and traditional's, are really becoming much more sophisticated in their trading operations and they realize now that they need sophisticated tools to couple with the sophistication of their trading strategies. So we believe that, that will be a new area of increased demand for us for the smart service. We also are looking at how we can integrate more machine intelligence into the solution and we have been discussing how to integrate even more intelligence to make it more useful across the platform in terms of compliance and trades provision.

And I also think Reg NMS deserve some credit in that we had a duopoly kind of situation before Reg NMS came along. And we've seen a dramatic decline in spreads and effective transaction cost in the market. So it's served the purpose for a long period of time, but we certainly think refinement is in order. With respect to IEX, our position is thoughtful, could be innovative and it's very similar to what we had suggested to commission back in 2012. They told us it was not in either the letter or the spirit of Reg NMS, said we could not do it. So our position with IEX is that really should be after there's a rethink of Reg NMS in how we get to new market structure in place and let innovation develop under the new set of rules and not patchwork and try to get exceptions under the existing rules that exist."

But when you think of NASDAQ and blockchain, you have to think of us being focused on what's the art of the doable, what's pragmatic and what's possible. So obviously, with NASDAQ private market is at the beginning of times we're able to create the experience we wanted. We're looking for similar type of opportunities. We want to have used cases where we can deliver when you paid for and bring real value today. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we're committed to proxy voting in Estonia. They have a rule set that will allow us to do that. We have about 3 other use cases which we'll not announce today, but very close to being funded. And those used costs cases will have a common theme that will be doable. We can deliver it and deliver real value and not get wrapped up in the allure of blockchain is a technology, but focus on blockchain to enable real products that customers want to pay us for."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NASDAQ's fourth quarter 2015 and Full-year Results. I will set a quick agenda for today's call. I want to first review our strong fourth quarter results, then provide more color around how we will deliver for our customers and shareholders in the periods to come, and lastly, our esteemed CFO has decided to retire and we'll discuss this more at the end of the prepared remarks before opening up to Q&A.
Turning back now to our results. We are extremely pleased to deliver another record-setting quarter and full year 2015 results for our shareholders. This is highlighted by record net revenues and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 10% year-over-year despite a 4% FX headwind. The positive organic growth in net revenues, 5% year-over-year for the quarter and 4% for the year, generated across this entire franchise suggest that we are on the right path in terms of running our business well and delivering for our clients. Even more impressive was that our nontrading segments grew 8% for the quarter and 6% for the year.
At the same time, in 2015, we invested over $400 million in R&D initiatives, capital expenditures and bolt-on acquisitions to support our future growth while also returning a very significant amount of capital to our shareholders. 
But what is important to me is I believe this quarter really echoes our laser focus on our customers, and as I assess the competitive positioning of each of our businesses in the very diverse markets in which we compete, I am again most proud that the vast majority of our businesses improved their competitive positioning during the quarter and the year, relative to their competitors and most importantly, in meeting and anticipating our customers' needs. Let me now give you a few highlights on the year and continued advancements of our strategic plan. 
Our foundational businesses, our Cash Equities and Listing Services on both sides of the Atlantic continued to perform at the highest levels. Combined revenues of $134 million this quarter were the highest since the first quarter of 2010 and saw a combined organic growth of 16% versus the prior year. While we continue to benefit today from the contributions of these businesses, I'm especially encouraged about how our broader portfolio, which leverages these -- this foundation, will benefit us in the periods to come. 
In our Listing Services segment, we continued to provide companies with an outstanding platform to access capital by leveraging our DNA as a financial technology provider. Let me give you a few examples. During the quarter, Listing Services achieved a 15% organic growth and record quarterly revenues, capping a record-setting year. We continue to demonstrate strong competitive leadership in the IPO market where we won an astounding 78% of all IPOs in the quarter and 73% for the full year. Our proposition more and more is echoing favorably with companies who want to access the broad spectrum of solutions we offer and benefit from the visibility of our vibrant brand. To further underscore this, during the quarter, we were the beneficiaries of several significant switches to our equity markets, including TD Ameritrade, T-Mobile and CSX. All in all, we welcomed 27 switches during the year from our competitors with a combined market cap of around $90 billion.
Our Nordic markets were also a leading choice for IPOs in 2015 with 91 listing, raising over SEK 54 billion. It was truly an outstanding performance and as a result, we had one of the strongest IPO markets that certainly I can remember or in that region's history. 
Our product set, as you know, is not limited to public companies. We have made considerable investments in developing our market for private companies. These companies are the very foundation of an ecosystem of innovation and economic growth. During the quarter, we continued to expand and develop our platform for private companies with strong organic growth in our customer base, and we announced and closed the acquisition of SecondMarket. This further establishes NASDAQ Private Market as the leading provider of innovative, technology-driven, efficient solutions for a secondary liquidity and equity management services. And we're thrilled to have added significant talent and quality customers that can benefit from our expanded offerings. NPM is a true innovation and a private company solution, and in the quarter we innovated upon that innovation with the deployment of blockchain technology. As compared to 3-day settlement in the public market, we settled, cleared and moved the money in minutes in the private market. 
In technology circles, you frequently attempt to have your first release of a product be minimally viable. It is very extraordinary that our first release of blockchain settlement and clearing is so substantially superior to what has been represented in the public market for over 50 years.
In our Market Services segment, we are creating more efficient trading opportunities where our clients need it most. In addition to relatively strong average capture and healthy activity levels we saw during the fourth quarter, we also announced our agreement to acquire Chi-X Canada. Chi-X Canada is an ATS, is the #2 player in the Canadian equity space, has exhibited strong trends in share and revenue growth, and has healthy profitability with margins broadly comparable to our business in the U.S. This transaction is expected to close in the first quarter this year, and we're looking forward to working with Chi-X's management team to integrate our organizations, systems and offerings to further expand on their compelling offering to the Canadian market.
Moving beyond our foundational Equity Trading and Listing's business, we saw encouraging performance across other businesses, including Information Services, which grew 7% year-over-year on an organic basis, further highlighting the tremendous value and in-depth intelligence these solutions provide our clients. On the Index side, we saw growth in both the Dorsey, Wright's Smart Beta franchise, as well as our legacy index properties.
Now moving to Technology Solutions segment, we made equally strong progress to lever the power of the innovative technology we developed, used ourselves and make available to clients. Market Technology grew 16% year-on-year on an organic basis, in part due to an exceptionally strong period for change request while operationally achieving important milestone, the completion of a successful Phase I implementation of Borsa Istanbul, which included the launch of a new equity trading platform, settlement and clearing solution. This was one of the most complex and ambitious product deliveries by any exchange. It represents a great effort by both the team at NASDAQ and at Borsa Istanbul. We look forward to continuing to work towards the Phase II delivery milestone, including the launch of their new derivatives trading platform, in the periods to come. 
We also experienced an exceptional quarter in terms of total order value, one of the highest ever, including new contracts through Genium INET trading system for the Tel Aviv Stock exchange, Genium INET clearing for the Australian exchange and one of our larger order intakes ever for the smarts trades surveillance and several significant BWise contracts. Our ambition is to do more for our clients and anticipating their needs also continues to drive how we evaluate and invest and execute in new opportunities. In 2015, we made significant progress on this front and I want to highlight a few examples for you today. 
I mentioned NASDAQ private market and our continued progress. In 2015, we invested significantly in this platform both through internal initiatives and, obviously, the SecondMarket acquisition. Our secondary market transactions hit record levels in 2015. NASDAQ platforms facilitated over 40 transactions worth over $1.6 billion. This represents a 33% increase from the previous year. As a result, NPM, including the partial quarter impact of SecondMarket, served over 107 private companies, up from 61 in 2014, a very strong performance. 
It is our job to make sure we push the limits of what our systems and technology can accomplish, and I as mentioned, leveraging our core DNA as the financial technology provider is fundamental to us. We see blockchain technology as having great potential to enable markets to operate more efficiently, that's why we continue to explore ways we can harness its capabilities to the benefits of our clients. We -- in November, we announced that we were exploring the application of blockchain technology to proxy voting in Estonia and that application is currently in development, while we also expect to initiate more used cases in the short term. We feel good about our position to lead new market innovation in this space, and you'll certainly hear more from us about our efforts in the months to come.
Another significant investment we made during the year that highlights our commitment to our corporate clients was NASDAQ IR Insight. Here we are advancing a technology platform created from the ground up to reshape the workflow and the productivity of our corporate offices. The full version of IR Insight was launched on schedule and made available to our customers just a few weeks ago. Early feedback from new users has been very encouraging, citing its clear and easy-to-use interface. It's a huge step forward in terms of productivity, and how well it stacks up to competing offerings. Already in the first few weeks, we've seen incremental sales wins across all 3 global regions, including first-time custom wins, some from competitors as well as existing customers adding new users. Some new sales have also come bundled with wins in other Corporate Solution products, affirming how IR Insight can accelerate growth in the other products because its core architecture was designed to support cross product functionality. Early days, but very encouraging. 
We made other key investments in the last year in our other core franchises as well, including our Information Services segment. We accelerated our path to become one of the leading Smart Beta index providers through the acquisition and integration of Dorsey, Wright at the beginning of the year and our partnership with First Trust opened the door for the Alpha Index family of indexes to switch to NASDAQ. In addition, we launched 56 new exchange-traded products linked to NASDAQ indices, which along with growth in our existing product, helped AUM grow in products tracking our indices by 15% in 2015. 
We will never stop seeking ways where we can bring efficiency, scale and benefits for our training (trading) [sic] customers. In 2015, we launched NFX, a bold execution of this strategy. We begun laying the groundwork for this over 2 years ago, inspired by our desire to provide market participants with a more efficient and cost-effective solution in the energy derivatives space. Now in its sixth month of operation, a wide section of the trading community is using our platform with over 90 firms executing transactions on it thus far. Just last week, we hit the 6-month anniversary. We've traded 4.3 million contracts over that time, and we achieved a new milestone with open interest crossing 500,000 contracts for the first time just this week. We're encouraged by the progress we're making in the energy and commodity space while broadening our product offerings in ways that lever our core technology assets and deep customer relationships.
So far, I have highlighted the various ways our core businesses are growing through our client focus, ability to execute and the investments we're making in our future. When we look at the prongs of our strategy and ability to execute well, our disciplined use of capital plays a significant role in our ability to deliver strong returns to our shareholders. As I have a highlighted throughout my remarks, however, we believe our future is determined in our ability to challenge the status quo and making sure the investments we make are not only strategic, but also yield attractive returns. I'm pleased to report that in 2015 we invested in a number of R&D initiatives like NFX, complementary acquisitions like Dorsey, Wright & Associates and SecondMarket, as well as the pending closure of acquisition of Chi-X Canada. In combination with our second highest CapEx total in history, a total of over $400 million in investment was made for our future while still returning a very material amount of capital to our shareholders.
Now I'd like to spend a little bit on some of the key opportunities and areas of focus for us in 2016. At NASDAQ, we are never afraid to look inward at how we do things to make sure we are organized and structured in a way that enables us to lever all our assets to deliver for our client. I think the creation of the role of a COO, and appointment of Adena Friedman to this position, which we announced in the fourth quarter, certainly is at the heart of this philosophy and we're looking forward to her contributions. 
We believe the underlying economic trends in the geographies where we operate are healthy, but we also realize the world is more globally interconnected than ever before. Our model and business mix provides us with a number of ways to not only respond to these trends but to develop new opportunities in lockstep with our clients. At the same time, our model ensures we see direct and immediate revenue benefit in operating leverage from elevated volumes. 
In closing, this year really points to the fact that our business model is incredibly sound. We are anticipating the needs of our clients better than ever, which is really driving our ability to deliver meaningful long-term growth across this franchise. It was a great quarter and a great year. I'd like to thank again the NASDAQ team, and I look forward to working with them to take our business even further in the months ahead. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. My commentary will focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations to GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release, and then the presentation is available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com. 
I want to start off, as I did in the last few quarters, by highlighting the impact the stronger dollar had on our year-over-year results. Excluding the impact of FX, our net revenues would have been up $37 million or 7% from the prior year and operating income would have been up $21 million or 9%. I will start by reviewing fourth quarter revenue performance relative to the prior year quarter as shown on Page 3 of the presentation. 
The 4% or $19 million increase in reported revenue of $536 million consisted of organic growth in the nontrading segments revenue of $26 million or 8% due to growth in Listings, Information Services and Market Technology, plus $9 million in revenues from the DWA acquisition, reduced by a $10 million FX impact. 
Organic growth in Market Services net revenues of $2 million or 1%, resulting principally from higher cash equity revenues, reduced by an $8 million FX impact. 
And if we move to Page 4 in the presentation, we show how organic growth breaks down historically between the nontrading Information Services, Technology Solutions and Listing Services segments, which collectively had 8% organic growth this quarter and the volume-sensitive Market Services segment at 1% for the quarter. 
Looking at our full year 2015 results, we have achieved 6% organic growth for our nontrading segments, around the upper end of our mid-single-digit medium-term guidance, and in Market Services, we achieved 3% organic growth for the full year 2015, continuing positive organic growth for the second straight year. 
I'm now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be to the prior-year period unless otherwise noted. 
Information Services on Page 5 saw an $8 million or 7% organic increase plus a $9 million increase from the DWA acquisition, reduced by $3 million FX impact. Market Data revenues saw a $7 million or 8% organic increase, reflecting growth in tape plan and proprietary revenues. Index Licensing and Services saw a $1 million or 5% organic increase from higher listing revenue from asset-based fees, partially offset by volume declines in revenues tied to certain licensed derivative products. 
Technology Solutions, as shown on Page 6, saw a $9 million or 6% organic revenue increase, reduced by a $5 million FX impact. The operating margin was 21%, up from 16% in the prior-year period. For the full year, Technology Solutions operating margin totaled 15%, a 200 basis point improvement year-over-year. We continue to have confidence in reaching our medium-term objective and expect further progress as we move through 2016. 
Market Technology revenues saw a $10 million or 16% organic increase due to organic growth in surveillance products and increases in change requests. New order intake was $116 million in the fourth quarter, our strongest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2014. And the period end backlog finished at an all-time record $788 million, up 10% year-over-year. 
Corporate Solutions revenue saw a $1 million or 1% organic decline as we continue to progress through the late stages of the integration and customer transitions from the acquisition of the Thomson Reuters corporate businesses. 
We continue to see improving momentum in the business, particularly with the fourth consecutive quarter of net positive subscription sales, which totaled $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the positive catalyst of the full IR Insight launch in 2016. 
Listing Services, on Page 7, saw a $9 million or 15% organic increase in revenues, driven by pricing changes and an increase in the issuer base, reduced by $2 million of an FX impact. Operating margin of 41% was up from 38% in the prior year quarter. I'd note here that looking forward, we expect a return to low single digits listing revenue growth, consistent with our medium-term outlook, as the impact of the January 2015 pricing changes is fully in the run rate. 
Market Services on Page 8 saw a $2 million or 1% organic increase in net revenues, reduced by an $8 million FX impact. Operating margin declined to 53% from 55% in the prior-year period. Equity Derivatives, Trading and Clearing net revenues saw a 6% organic decline, primarily due to lower industry trading volumes followed by lower U.S. market share. Cash Equities Trading net revenues saw a 17% organic increase as higher cash equity net capture and increased industry volumes were partially offset by modestly lower market shares. Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Trading and Clearing net revenues saw a 24% organic decline from the prior year, principally due to volume-driven declines in U.S. fixed income, followed by European energy. Access and Broker Services revenues saw a 3% organic revenue increase.
Turning to Pages 9 and 14 to review the income statement and expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses, increased $12 million on an organic basis or a 4% increase, and $4 million primarily due to the Dorsey, Wright acquisition, partially offset by $11 million in an FX impact. The $285 million in fourth quarter 2015 expenses put us at a full-year total of $1,114,000,000 up 3% on an organic basis. 
Non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter rose 7% on an organic basis versus a 6% reported increase. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 47%, up from 46% in the prior-year period, reflecting the margin improvement of our Listings and Technology Solutions business. Net interest expense was $27 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $1 million versus prior year, mainly due to higher net debt. And the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 33% and the full year 2015 figure was 33.4%, at the low end of our 33% to 35% tax rate guidance. 
Non-GAAP net income was $150 million or $0.89 per diluted share compared to $139 million or $0.81 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The $0.08 increase in our non-GAAP EPS represents core organic EPS growth of 6%, $0.02 of growth due to acquisitions, $0.02 due to a lower share count and a $0.01 increase due to a lower effective tax rate in the quarter, partially offset by $0.03 impact -- negative $0.03 impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. 
Our 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance is $1,110,000,000 to $1,160,000,000 and the midpoint of our expense guidance corresponds to a 2% increase from 2015 non-GAAP operating expenses. The expense guidance does not yet include the impact of our acquisition of Chi-X Canada, which we expect to close later in the first quarter of 2015. We also continue to expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 33% to 35% in 2016.
Moving on to the balance sheet, cash flow and capital, please turn to Slides 11 and 12. We repurchased 67 million in stock during the fourth quarter and through dividends and repurchases returned $526 million in capital to shareholders in 2015, accounting for more than 90% of non-GAAP net income.
Now onto the last thing I wanted to cover in my prepared remarks today. After nearly 5 years here at NASDAQ, and many more serving as an adviser to the company and to the industry, I've decided to retire from my CFO position to accept an invitation to join the board of a public company, which will be announced later today. This is an opportunity for me to bring my experience to the board level and develop another set of skills. I'm very grateful to NASDAQ, and to both Bob and Adena in particular, to have'd the opportunity to serve as its CFO and be a part of its leadership team, and I'm proud of what the company has accomplished during my time here. I've learned a tremendous amount in the role and am grateful to all of my colleagues for their support and friendship. When I arrived, I saw an opportunity to build on NASDAQ's expense discipline with a complementary capital discipline that has been critical to allocating the substantial cash flow we generate as effectively as possible. This discipline also supported our decision to initiate a regular dividend and significantly grow our payout ratio. We also streamlined our business line reporting, introduced segment profitability disclosure and initiated an organic growth outlook for our nontransactional segments, underscoring the company's confidence in the sustainable growth prospects of these businesses. I believe strongly, all of these serve to make clear the quality of NASDAQ's diverse portfolio. I feel emphatically that my departure comes at a time when NASDAQ's financial position and accounting are in outstanding health, in step with the operations of its strong business portfolio. And I'm also confident that strong capital discipline has become embedded at NASDAQ and will be continued to be applied in all uses of capital. And if it isn't, I will be front and center at the next shareholders meeting to hold management accountable. 
Ron Hassen, NASDAQ's controller for the past 14 years, will step into the role of CFO on an interim basis for the second time in his career, and I will stay at the company in March to support Ron and to ensure a seamless transition of responsibilities. The company has commenced the search for a permanent CFO replacement. 
I would also like to say it's been a truly rewarding experience getting to know the investors and analyst that covered, invested in and followed NASDAQ during my time here. I've learned an extraordinary amount from your diverse perspectives, try to apply it where possible, and look forward to continuing our interaction during my remaining time here. So please don't take this call as a final goodbye. Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to Bob."

So I think the first thing to recognize, Richard, is that as you know is that the Technology Solutions business has some seasonality to it. So the fourth quarter is always, has been and probably will always be the strongest quarter in the year. In the quarter, we did have very strong revenue from our change request in our technology services business, as well as some new license sales and continued growth in smart. And on the Corporate Solutions side, we continue to have very good cost discipline and we had nice sales, as well as, people using our services in the fourth quarter where we can recognize revenue. So we definitely did have a strong underlying quarter. But on a full-year basis, you can see that we believe that our margins for that business in 2015 were 16%. And we continue to make progress against the 20% goal for full-year margin. But we still have some work to do. And as we go into 2016, we see a few things of particular strength. Number 1, we still have not yet recognized revenue from the Borsa Istanbul contract. So that will start to -- we will start to be able to recognize that as we continue to deliver on that contract. We also have continued growth in SMARTS which will continue to drive both topline revenue and margin expansion. And then in Corporate Solutions, the IR Insight rollout has just begun. We launched it 2 weeks ago. We already have about 100 clients using the new product. We have clients calling us asking us when they can get migrated or rolled out. And we have a very full schedule in the months to come, as we continue to roll out that new service. So we feel very good, going into 2016 around the progress there, but we still have work to do to get to that full-year 20% margin goal."

I don't really have anything to add to Adena's comment on the margin. You did ask a question about audit revenue in the period, which relates not to Technology Solutions but the to the Information Services business. As we typically disclose, the audit revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.6 million, and that compares to a year ago where we had a reversal of about $300,000 of audit revenue. So there -- that is a contributor on a year-over-year basis. As you know, that audit revenue can be volatile quarter to quarter to quarter. So that will give you some basis for comparison. And then on the Technology Solutions margin, as Adena indicated, I think we are excited about 2 things. One, with the IR Insight launch, you know that clearly enables to reach the final phase for us in eliminating some of the expenses. You are seeing some of the impact of the investment that we've made in the IR Insight platform in our depreciation and amortization. But the upside will also be driven by success in revenue growth. And as I indicated in the comments, the net subscription sales and overall new sales of products in the Corporate Solutions sector as a leading indicator has been very positive and gives us confidence about making that continued progress against the goal in 2016."

And that's generally contractual for over several years. So we don't really have the ability to kind of fluctuate pricing year-over-year. And therefore, there is a fair amount of data that does start to occur once you launch an ETF, in terms of the AUM growth, and sometimes some declines based on market performance. Generally speaking, what we look at is -- obviously we look at AUM, but we also look at TSO, which is the total shares outstanding. And that's more an indication, a core indication of the demand for the product from investors. So right now, we are seeing our TSO is holding steady as we've been dealing with the volatility in the markets. And so for us, that means the underlying demand for the products is strong. And it's just a matter of riding through some of these data winds that come when we have a market volatility. But the pricing tends to be fixed upon launching the product, Mike."

But that's all -- that's a longer sales cycle. Obviously, there's a finite number of exchanges that we continue to find real success there, and that's the more mature part of our business. The broker-dealer community is the second community that we have sold to and that's a newer part of our business, but definitely the fastest growing. We actually surpassed a 1,000 users this year, and we're just thrilled with that. We in fact sent him a small gift and then -- this happened with the client. And I think that it's really exciting to see continued double-digit growth in that part of the business as we continue to find striking demand for Trade Surveillance solutions across the broker-dealer community. In the year -- over the last 2 years, we've made it to it's multi-asset class and it's every geography. So it really concerns any and all trading firms in the world. The third community is the buy side community. And for the first time this year, we do have 3 buy side clients who have signed up for the service. And we have chosen to invest through our R&D program to build out more a fulsome buy side solution for this trade surveillance. So buy side firms, both hedge funds and traditions, are really becoming much more sophisticated in their trading operations, and they realize now that they need sophisticated tools to couple with the sophistication of their trading strategies. So we believe that, that will be a new area of increased demand for us, for the smart service. We also are looking at how we can integrate more machine intelligence into the solution and we have been discussing how to integrate even more intelligence to make it more useful across the platform in terms of compliance and trades provision.

So it's served it's purpose for a long period of time, but we certainly think refinement is in order. With respect to IEX, our position is that it's thoughtful, could be innovative and it's very similar to what we had suggested to the commission back in 2012. They told us it was not in, either the letter or the spirit of Reg NMS, and said we could not do it. So our position with IEX is that, it really should be after there's a rethink of Reg NMS and how we get the new market structure in place and let innovation develop under the new set of rules and not patchwork, and try to get exceptions under the existing rules that exist."

So we'll be involved with those conversations in an active participant, but when you think of NASDAQ and blockchain, you have to think of us being focused on what's the art of the doable, what's pragmatic and what's possible. So obviously, with the NASDAQ private market is the beginning of times we're able to create the experience we wanted. We're looking for similar type of opportunities. We want to have use cases where you can deliver, when you get paid for and bring real value today. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we're committed to proxy voting in Estonia. They have a rule set that will allow us to do that. We have about 3 other use cases which we'll not announce today, but are very close to being funded. And those used costs cases will have a common theme that they'll be doable, we can deliver it and deliver real value and not get wrapped up in the allure of blockchain as a technology, but focus on blockchain to enable real products that customers want to pay us for."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NASDAQ's fourth quarter 2015 and Full-year Results. I will set a quick agenda for today's call. I want to first review our strong fourth quarter results, then provide more color around how we will deliver for our customers and shareholders in the periods to come, and lastly, our esteemed CFO has decided to retire and we'll discuss this more at the end of the prepared remarks before opening up to Q&A.
Turning back now to our results. We are extremely pleased to deliver another record-setting quarter and full year 2015 results for our shareholders. This is highlighted by record net revenues and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 10% year-over-year despite a 4% FX headwind. The positive organic growth in net revenues, 5% year-over-year for the quarter and 4% for the year, generated across this entire franchise suggest that we are on the right path in terms of running our business well and delivering for our clients. Even more impressive was that our nontrading segments grew 8% for the quarter and 6% for the year.
At the same time, in 2015, we invested over $400 million in R&D initiatives, capital expenditures and bolt-on acquisitions to support our future growth while also returning a very significant amount of capital to our shareholders. 
But what is important to me is I believe this quarter really echoes our laser focus on our customers, and as I assess the competitive positioning of each of our businesses in the very diverse markets in which we compete, I am again most proud that the vast majority of our businesses improved their competitive positioning during the quarter and the year, relative to their competitors and most importantly, in meeting and anticipating our customers' needs. Let me now give you a few highlights on the year and continued advancements of our strategic plan. 
Our foundational businesses, our Cash Equities and Listing Services on both sides of the Atlantic continued to perform at the highest levels. Combined revenues of $134 million this quarter were the highest since the first quarter of 2010 and saw a combined organic growth of 16% versus the prior year. While we continue to benefit today from the contributions of these businesses, I'm especially encouraged about how our broader portfolio, which leverages these -- this foundation, will benefit us in the periods to come. 
In our Listing Services segment, we continued to provide companies with an outstanding platform to access capital by leveraging our DNA as a financial technology provider. Let me give you a few examples. During the quarter, Listing Services achieved a 15% organic growth and record quarterly revenues, capping a record-setting year. We continued to demonstrate strong competitive leadership in the IPO market where we won an astounding 78% of all IPOs in the quarter and 73% for the full year. Our proposition more and more is echoing favorably with companies who want to access the broad spectrum of solutions we offer and benefit from the visibility of our vibrant brand. To further underscore this, during the quarter, we were the beneficiaries of several significant switches to our equity markets, including TD Ameritrade, T-Mobile and CSX. All in all, we welcomed 27 switches during the year from our competitors with a combined market cap of around $90 billion.
Our Nordic markets were also a leading choice for IPOs in 2015 with 91 listings, raising over SEK 54 billion. It was truly an outstanding performance and as a result, we had one of the strongest IPO markets that certainly I can remember or in that region's history. 
Our product set, as you know, is not limited to public companies. We have made considerable investments in developing our market for private companies. These companies are the very foundation of an ecosystem of innovation and economic growth. During the quarter, we continued to expand and develop our platform for private companies with strong organic growth in our customer base, and we announced and closed the acquisition of SecondMarket. This further establishes NASDAQ Private Market as the leading provider of innovative, technology-driven, efficient solutions for a secondary liquidity and equity management services. And we're thrilled to have added significant talent and quality customers that can benefit from our expanded offerings. NPM is a true innovation and a private company solution, and in the quarter we innovated upon that innovation with the deployment of blockchain technology. As compared to 3-day settlement in the public market, we settled, cleared and moved the money in minutes in the private market. 
In technology circles, you frequently attempt to have your first release of a product be minimally viable. It is very extraordinary that our first release of blockchain settlement and clearing is so substantially superior to what has been represented in the public market for over 50 years.
In our Market Services segment, we are creating more efficient trading opportunities where our clients need it most. In addition to relatively strong average capture and healthy activity levels we saw during the fourth quarter, we also announced our agreement to acquire Chi-X Canada. Chi-X Canada is an ATS, is the #2 player in the Canadian equity space, has exhibited strong trends in share and revenue growth, and has healthy profitability with margins broadly comparable to our business in the U.S. This transaction is expected to close in the first quarter this year, and we're looking forward to working with Chi-X's management team to integrate our organizations, systems and offerings to further expand on their compelling offering to the Canadian market.
Moving beyond our foundational Equity Trading and Listing's business, we saw encouraging performance across other businesses, including Information Services, which grew 7% year-over-year on an organic basis, further highlighting the tremendous value and in-depth intelligence these solutions provide our clients. On the Index side, we saw growth in both the Dorsey, Wright's Smart Beta franchise, as well as our legacy index properties.
Now moving to Technology Solutions segment, we made equally strong progress to lever the power of the innovative technology we developed, use ourselves and make available to clients. Market Technology grew 16% year-on-year on an organic basis, in part due to an exceptionally strong period for change request while operationally achieving important milestone, the completion of a successful Phase I implementation of Borsa Istanbul, which included the launch of a new equity trading platform, settlement and clearing solutions. This was one of the most complex and ambitious product deliveries by any exchange. It represents a great effort by both the team at NASDAQ and at Borsa Istanbul. We look forward to continuing to work towards the Phase II delivery milestone, including the launch of their new derivatives trading platform, in the periods to come. 
We also experienced an exceptional quarter in terms of total order value, one of the highest ever, including new contracts through Genium INET trading system for the Tel Aviv Stock exchange, Genium INET clearing for the Australian exchange and one of our larger order intakes ever for the smarts trades surveillance and several significant BWise contracts. Our ambition is to do more for our clients and anticipating their needs also continues to drive how we evaluate and invest and execute in new opportunities. In 2015, we made significant progress on this front and I want to highlight a few examples for you today. 
I mentioned NASDAQ private market and our continued progress. In 2015, we invested significantly in this platform both through internal initiatives and, obviously, the SecondMarket acquisition. Our secondary market transactions hit record levels in 2015. NASDAQ platforms facilitated over 40 transactions worth over $1.6 billion. This represents a 33% increase from the previous year. As a result, NPM, including the partial quarter impact of SecondMarket, served over 107 private companies, up from 61 in 2014, a very strong performance. 
It is our job to make sure we push the limits of what our systems and technology can accomplish, and I as mentioned, leveraging our core DNA as a financial technology provider is fundamental to us. We see blockchain technology as having great potential to enable markets to operate more efficiently, is why we continue to explore ways we can harness its capabilities to the benefits of our clients. We -- in November, we announced that we were exploring the application of blockchain technology to proxy voting in Estonia and that application is currently in development, while we also expect to initiate more use cases in the short term. We feel good about our position to lead new market innovation in this space, and you'll certainly hear more from us about our efforts in the months to come.
Another significant investment we made during the year that highlights our commitment to our corporate clients was NASDAQ IR Insight. Here we are advancing a technology platform created from the ground up to reshape the workflow and the productivity of our corporate offices. The full version of IR Insight was launched on schedule and made available to our customers just a few weeks ago. Early feedback from new users has been very encouraging, citing its clear and easy-to-use interface. It's a huge step forward in terms of productivity, and how well it stacks up to competing offerings. Already in the first few weeks, we've seen incremental sales' wins across all 3 global regions, including first-time custom wins, some from competitors as well as existing customers adding new users. Some new sales have also come bundled with wins in other Corporate Solution products, affirming how IR Insight can accelerate growth in our other products because its core architecture was designed to support cross product functionality. Early days, but very encouraging. 
We made other key investments in the last year in our other core franchises as well, including our Information Services segment. We accelerated our path to become one of the leading Smart Beta index providers through the acquisition and integration of Dorsey, Wright at the beginning of the year and our partnership with First Trust opened the door for the Alpha Index family of indexes to switch to NASDAQ. In addition, we launched 56 new exchange-traded products linked to NASDAQ indices, which along with growth in our existing product, helped AUM grow in products tracking our indices by 15% in 2015. 
We will never stop seeking ways where we can bring efficiency, scale and benefits for our training (trading) [sic] customers. In 2015, we launched NFX, a bold execution of this strategy. We had begun laying the groundwork for this over 2 years ago, inspired by our desire to provide market participants with a more efficient and cost-effective solution in the energy derivatives space. Now in its sixth month of operation, a wide section of the trading community is using our platform with over 90 firms executing transactions on it thus far. Just last week, we hit the 6-month anniversary. We've traded 4.3 million contracts over that time, and we achieved a new milestone with open interest crossing 500,000 contracts for the first time just this week. We're encouraged by the progress we're making in the energy and commodity space while broadening our product offerings in ways that lever our core technology assets and deep customer relationships.
So far, I have highlighted the various ways our core businesses are growing through our client focus, ability to execute and the investments we're making in our future. When we look at the prongs of our strategy and ability to execute well, our disciplined use of capital plays a significant role in our ability to deliver strong returns to our shareholders. As I have highlighted throughout my remarks, however, we believe our future is determined in our ability to challenge the status quo and making sure the investments we make are not only strategic, but also yield attractive returns. I'm pleased to report that in 2015 we invested in a number of R&D initiatives like NFX, complementary acquisitions like Dorsey, Wright & Associates and SecondMarket, as well as the pending closure of acquisition of Chi-X Canada. In combination with our second highest CapEx total in history, a total of over $400 million investment was made for our future while still returning a very material amount of capital to our shareholders.
Now I'd like to spend a little bit on some of the key opportunities and areas of focus for us in 2016. At NASDAQ, we are never afraid to look inward at how we do things to make sure we are organized and structured in a way that enables us to lever all our assets to deliver for our client. I think the creation of the role of a COO, and appointment of Adena Friedman to this position, which we announced in the fourth quarter, certainly is at the heart of this philosophy and we're looking forward to her contributions. 
We believe the underlying economic trends in the geographies where we operate are healthy, but we also realize the world is more globally interconnected than ever before. Our model and business mix provides us with a number of ways to not only respond to these trends but to develop new opportunities in lockstep with our clients. At the same time, our model ensures we see direct and immediate revenue benefit in operating leverage from elevated volumes. 
In closing, this year really points to the fact that our business model is incredibly sound. We are anticipating the needs of our clients better than ever, which is really driving our ability to deliver meaningful long-term growth across this franchise. It was a great quarter and a great year. I'd like to thank again the NASDAQ team, and I look forward to working with them to take our business even further in the months ahead. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. My commentary will focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations to GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release, and then the presentation is available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com. 
I want to start off, as I did the last few quarters, by highlighting the impact the stronger dollar had on our year-over-year results. Excluding the impact of FX, our net revenues would have been up $37 million or 7% from the prior year and operating income would have been up $21 million or 9%. I will start by reviewing fourth quarter revenue performance relative to the prior year quarter as shown on Page 3 of the presentation. 
The 4% or $19 million increase in reported revenue of $536 million consisted of organic growth in the nontrading segments revenue of $26 million or 8% due to growth in Listings, Information Services and Market Technology, plus $9 million in revenues from the DWA acquisition, reduced by a $10 million FX impact. 
Organic growth in Market Services net revenues of $2 million or 1%, resulting principally from higher cash equity revenues, reduced by an $8 million FX impact. 
And if we move to Page 4 in the presentation, we show how organic growth breaks down historically between the nontrading Information Services, Technology Solutions and Listing Services segments, which collectively had 8% organic growth this quarter and the volume-sensitive Market Services segment at 1% for the quarter. 
Looking at our full year 2015 results, we have achieved 6% organic growth for our nontrading segments, around the upper end of our mid-single-digit medium-term guidance, and in Market Services, we achieved 3% organic growth for the full year 2015, continuing positive organic growth for the second straight year. 
I'm now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be to the prior-year period unless otherwise noted. 
Information Services on Page 5 saw an $8 million or 7% organic increase plus a $9 million increase from the DWA acquisition, reduced by $3 million FX impact. Market Data revenues saw a $7 million or 8% organic increase, reflecting growth in tape plan and proprietary revenues. Index Licensing and Services saw a $1 million or 5% organic increase from higher listing revenue from asset-based fees, partially offset by volume declines in revenues tied to certain licensed derivative products. 
Technology Solutions, as shown on Page 6, saw a $9 million or 6% organic revenue increase, reduced by a $5 million FX impact. The operating margin was 21%, up from 16% in the prior-year period. For the full year, Technology Solutions operating margin totaled 15%, a 200 basis point improvement year-over-year. We continue to have confidence in reaching our medium-term objective and expect further progress as we move through 2016. 
Market Technology revenues saw a $10 million or 16% organic increase due to organic growth in surveillance products and increases in change requests. New order intake was $116 million in the fourth quarter, our strongest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2014. And the period end backlog finished at an all-time record $788 million, up 10% year-over-year. 
Corporate Solutions revenue saw a $1 million or 1% organic decline as we continue to progress through the late stages of the integration and customer transitions from the acquisition of the Thomson Reuters corporate businesses. 
We continue to see improving momentum in the business, particularly with the fourth consecutive quarter of net positive subscription sales, which totaled $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the positive catalyst of the full IR Insight launch in 2016. 
Listing Services, on Page 7, saw a $9 million or 15% organic increase in revenues, driven by pricing changes and an increase in the issuer base, reduced by $2 million of an FX impact. Operating margin of 41% was up from 38% in the prior year quarter. I'd note here that looking forward, we expect a return to low single digits listing revenue growth, consistent with our medium-term outlook, as the impact of the January 2015 pricing changes is fully in the run rate. 
Market Services on Page 8 saw a $2 million or 1% organic increase in net revenues, reduced by an $8 million FX impact. Operating margin declined to 53% from 55% in the prior-year period. Equity Derivatives, Trading and Clearing net revenues saw a 6% organic decline, primarily due to lower industry trading volumes followed by lower U.S. market share. Cash Equities Trading net revenues saw a 17% organic increase as higher cash equity net capture and increased industry volumes were partially offset by modestly lower market shares. Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Trading and Clearing net revenues saw a 24% organic decline from the prior year, principally due to volume-driven declines in U.S. fixed income, followed by European energy. Access and Broker Services revenues saw a 3% organic revenue increase.
Turning to Pages 9 and 14 to review the income statement and expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses, increased $12 million on an organic basis or a 4% increase, and $4 million primarily due to the Dorsey, Wright acquisition, partially offset by $11 million in an FX impact. The $285 million in fourth quarter 2015 expenses put us at a full-year total of $1,114,000,000 up 3% on an organic basis. 
Non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter rose 7% on an organic basis versus a 6% reported increase. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 47%, up from 46% in the prior-year period, reflecting the margin improvement of our Listings and Technology Solutions business. Net interest expense was $27 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $1 million versus prior year, mainly due to higher net debt. And the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 33% and the full year 2015 figure was 33.4%, at the low end of our 33% to 35% tax rate guidance. 
Non-GAAP net income was $150 million or $0.89 per diluted share compared to $139 million or $0.81 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The $0.08 increase in our non-GAAP EPS represents core organic EPS growth of 6%, $0.02 of growth due to acquisitions, $0.02 due to a lower share count and a $0.01 increase due to a lower effective tax rate in the quarter, partially offset by $0.03 impact -- negative $0.03 impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. 
Our 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance is $1,110,000,000 to $1,160,000,000 and the midpoint of our expense guidance corresponds to a 2% increase from 2015 non-GAAP operating expenses. The expense guidance does not yet include the impact of our acquisition of Chi-X Canada, which we expect to close later in the first quarter of 2015 (sic) [2016]. We also continue to expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 33% to 35% in 2016.
Moving on to the balance sheet, cash flow and capital, please turn to Slides 11 and 12. We repurchased 67 million in stock during the fourth quarter and through dividends and repurchases returned $526 million in capital to shareholders in 2015, accounting for more than 90% of non-GAAP net income.
Now onto the last thing I wanted to cover in my prepared remarks today. After nearly 5 years here at NASDAQ, and many more serving as an adviser to the company and to the industry, I've decided to retire from my CFO position to accept an invitation to join the board of a public company, which will be announced later today. This is an opportunity for me to bring my experience to the board level and develop another set of skills. I'm very grateful to NASDAQ, and to both Bob and Adena in particular, to have had the opportunity to serve as its CFO and be a part of its leadership team, and I'm proud of what the company has accomplished during my time here. I've learned a tremendous amount in the role and am grateful to all of my colleagues for their support and friendship. When I arrived, I saw an opportunity to build on NASDAQ's expense discipline with a complementary capital discipline that has been critical to allocating the substantial cash flow we generate as effectively as possible. This discipline also supported our decision to initiate a regular dividend and significantly grow our payout ratio. We also streamlined our business line reporting, introduced segment profitability disclosure and initiated an organic growth outlook for our nontransactional segments, underscoring the company's confidence in the sustainable growth prospects of these businesses. I believe strongly, all of these serve to make clear the quality of NASDAQ's diverse portfolio. I feel emphatically that my departure comes at a time when NASDAQ's financial position and accounting are in outstanding health, in step with the operations of its strong business portfolio. And I'm also confident that strong capital discipline has become embedded at NASDAQ and will be continued to be applied in all uses of capital. And if it isn't, I will be front and center at the next shareholders meeting to hold management accountable. 
Ron Hassen, NASDAQ's controller for the past 14 years, will step into the role of CFO on an interim basis for the second time in his career, and I will stay at the company in March to support Ron and to ensure a seamless transition of responsibilities. The company has commenced the search for a permanent CFO replacement. 
I would also like to say it's been a truly rewarding experience getting to know the investors and analysts that covered, invested in and followed NASDAQ during my time here. I've learned an extraordinary amount from your diverse perspectives, tried to apply it where possible, and look forward to continuing our interaction during my remaining time here. So please don't take this call as a final goodbye. Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to Bob."

So I think the first thing to recognize, Richard, is that as you know is that the Technology Solutions business has some seasonality to it.

And on the Corporate Solutions side, we continue to have very good cost discipline and we had nice sales, as well as, people using our services in the fourth quarter where we can recognize revenue. So we definitely did have a strong underlying quarter. But on a full-year basis, you can see that we believe that our margins for that business in 2015 were 16%. And we continued to make progress against the 20% goal for full-year margin. But we still have some work to do. And as we go into 2016, we see a few things of particular strength. Number one, we still have not yet recognized revenue from the Borsa Istanbul contract. So that will start to -- we will start to be able to recognize that as we continue to deliver on that contract. We also have continued growth in SMARTS which will continue to drive both topline revenue and margin expansion. And then in Corporate Solutions, the IR Insight rollout has just begun. We launched it 2 weeks ago. We already have about 100 clients using the new product. We have clients calling us asking us when they can get migrated or rolled out. And we have a very full schedule in the months to come, as we continue to roll out that new service. So we feel very good, going into 2016 around the progress there, but we still have work to do to get to that full-year 20% margin goal."

I don't really have anything to add to Adena's comment on the margin. You did ask a question about audit revenue in the period, which relates not to Technology Solutions but the to the Information Services business.

So there -- that is a contributor on a year-over-year basis. As you know, that audit revenue can be volatile quarter to quarter to quarter. So that will give you some basis for comparison.

One, with the IR Insight launch, you know that clearly enables to reach the final phase for us in eliminating some of the expenses. You are seeing some of the impact of the investment that we've made in the IR Insight platform in our depreciation and amortization. But the upside will also be driven by success in revenue growth. And as I indicated in the comments, the net subscription sales and overall new sales of products in the Corporate Solutions sector as a leading indicator has been very positive and gives us confidence about making that continued progress against the goal in 2016."

And therefore, there is a fair amount of data that does start to occur once you launch an ETF, in terms of the AUM growth, and sometimes some declines based on market performance. Generally speaking, what we look at is -- obviously we look at AUM, but we also look at TSO, which is the total shares outstanding. And that's more an indication, a core indication of the demand for the product from investors. So right now, we are seeing our TSO is holding steady as we've been dealing with the volatility in the markets. And so for us, that means the underlying demand for the products is strong. And it's just a matter of riding through some of these data winds that come when we have market volatility. But the pricing tends to be fixed upon launching the product, Mike."

We have the exchanges, which was the original business for SMARTS, and it's the longest standing business. It's a deployed solution out to the clients, we've been selling to exchanges for many years, as well as the regulators -- I should say exchanges and regulators, and that continues as you can tell to grow, in terms of new exchanges taking our solution like Nigerian Stock Exchange most recently. But that's all -- that's a longer sales cycle. Obviously, there's a finite number of exchanges that we continue to find real success there, and that's the more mature part of our business. The broker-dealer community is the second community that we have sold to and that's a newer part of our business, but definitely the fastest growing. We actually surpassed a 1,000 users this year, and we were just thrilled with that. We in fact sent him a small gift and then -- this client. And I think that it's really exciting to see continued double-digit growth in that part of the business as we continue to find striking demand for Trade Surveillance solutions across the broker-dealer community. In the year -- over the last 2 years, we've made it so it's multi-asset class and it's every geography. So it really can serve any and all trading firms in the world. The third community is the buy side community. And for the first time this year, we do have 3 buy side clients who have signed up for the service. And we have chosen to invest through our R&D program to build out a more fulsome buy side solution for this trade surveillance. So buy side firms, both hedge funds and traditionals, are really becoming much more sophisticated in their trading operations, and they realize now that they need sophisticated tools to couple with the sophistication of their trading strategies. So we believe that, that will be a new area of increased demand for us, for the SMARTS service. We also are looking at how we can integrate more machine intelligence into the solution and we have been discussing how to integrate even more intelligence to make it more useful across the platform in terms of compliance and trades provision.

So it's served a purpose for a long period of time, but we certainly think refinement is in order. With respect to IEX, our position is that it's thoughtful, could be innovative and it's very similar to what we had suggested to the commission back in 2012. They told us it was not in, either the letter or the spirit of Reg NMS, and said we could not do it. So our position with IEX is that, it really should be after there's a rethink of Reg NMS and how do we get the new market structure in place and let innovation develop under the new set of rules and not patchwork, and try to get exceptions under the existing rules that exist."

So obviously, with the NASDAQ private market is the beginning of times we're able to create the experience we wanted. We're looking for similar type opportunities. We want to have use cases where you can deliver, when you get paid for and bring real value today. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we're committed to proxy voting in Estonia. They have a rule set that will allow us to do that. We have about 3 other use cases which we'll not announce today, but are very close to being funded.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss NASDAQ's fourth quarter 2015 and Full-year Results. I will set a quick agenda for today's call. I want to first review our strong fourth quarter results, then provide more color around how we will deliver for our customers and shareholders in the periods to come, and lastly, our esteemed CFO has decided to retire and we'll discuss this more at the end of the prepared remarks before opening up to Q&A.
Turning back now to our results. We are extremely pleased to deliver another record-setting quarter and full year 2015 results for our shareholders. This is highlighted by record net revenues and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 10% year-over-year despite a 4% FX headwind. The positive organic growth in net revenues, 5% year-over-year for the quarter and 4% for the year, generated across this entire franchise suggest that we are on the right path in terms of running our business well and delivering for our clients. Even more impressive was that our nontrading segments grew 8% for the quarter and 6% for the year.
At the same time, in 2015, we invested over $400 million in R&D initiatives, capital expenditures and bolt-on acquisitions to support our future growth while also returning a very significant amount of capital to our shareholders. 
But what is important to me is I believe this quarter really echoes our laser focus on our customers, and as I assess the competitive positioning of each of our businesses in the very diverse markets in which we compete, I am again most proud that the vast majority of our businesses improved their competitive positioning during the quarter and the year, relative to their competitors and most importantly, in meeting and anticipating our customers' needs. Let me now give you a few highlights on the year and continued advancements of our strategic plan. 
Our foundational businesses, our Cash Equities and Listing Services on both sides of the Atlantic continued to perform at the highest levels. Combined revenues of $134 million this quarter were the highest since the first quarter of 2010 and saw a combined organic growth of 16% versus the prior year. While we continue to benefit today from the contributions of these businesses, I'm especially encouraged about how our broader portfolio, which leverages these -- this foundation, will benefit us in the periods to come. 
In our Listing Services segment, we continued to provide companies with an outstanding platform to access capital by leveraging our DNA as a financial technology provider. Let me give you a few examples. During the quarter, Listing Services achieved a 15% organic growth and record quarterly revenues, capping a record-setting year. We continued to demonstrate strong competitive leadership in the IPO market where we won an astounding 78% of all IPOs in the quarter and 73% for the full year. Our proposition more and more is echoing favorably with companies who want to access the broad spectrum of solutions we offer and benefit from the visibility of our vibrant brand. To further underscore this, during the quarter, we were the beneficiaries of several significant switches to our equity markets, including TD Ameritrade, T-Mobile and CSX. All in all, we welcomed 27 switches during the year from our competitors with a combined market cap of around $90 billion.
Our Nordic markets were also a leading choice for IPOs in 2015 with 91 listings, raising over SEK 54 billion. It was truly an outstanding performance and as a result, we had one of the strongest IPO markets that certainly I can remember or in that region's history. 
Our product set, as you know, is not limited to public companies. We have made considerable investments in developing our market for private companies. These companies are the very foundation of an ecosystem of innovation and economic growth. During the quarter, we continued to expand and develop our platform for private companies with strong organic growth in our customer base, and we announced and closed the acquisition of SecondMarket. This further establishes NASDAQ Private Market as the leading provider of innovative, technology-driven, efficient solutions for a secondary liquidity and equity management services. And we're thrilled to have added significant talent and quality customers that can benefit from our expanded offerings. NPM is a true innovation and a private company solution, and in the quarter we innovated upon that innovation with the deployment of blockchain technology. As compared to 3-day settlement in the public market, we settled, cleared and moved the money in minutes in the private market. 
In technology circles, you frequently attempt to have your first release of a product be minimally viable. It is very extraordinary that our first release of blockchain settlement and clearing is so substantially superior to what has been represented in the public market for over 50 years.
In our Market Services segment, we are creating more efficient trading opportunities where our clients need it most. In addition to relatively strong average capture and healthy activity levels we saw during the fourth quarter, we also announced our agreement to acquire Chi-X Canada. Chi-X Canada is an ATS, is the #2 player in the Canadian equity space, has exhibited strong trends in share and revenue growth, and has healthy profitability with margins broadly comparable to our business in the U.S. This transaction is expected to close in the first quarter this year, and we're looking forward to working with Chi-X's management team to integrate our organizations, systems and offerings to further expand on their compelling offering to the Canadian market.
Moving beyond our foundational Equity Trading and Listing's business, we saw encouraging performance across other businesses, including Information Services, which grew 7% year-over-year on an organic basis, further highlighting the tremendous value and in-depth intelligence these solutions provide our clients. On the Index side, we saw growth in both the Dorsey, Wright's Smart Beta franchise as well as our legacy index properties.
Now moving to Technology Solutions segment, we made equally strong progress to lever the power of the innovative technology we developed, use ourselves and make available to clients. Market Technology grew 16% year-on-year on an organic basis, in part due to an exceptionally strong period for change request while operationally achieving important milestone, the completion of a successful Phase I implementation of Borsa Istanbul, which included the launch of a new equity trading platform, settlement and clearing solutions. This was one of the most complex and ambitious product deliveries by any exchange. It represents a great effort by both the team at NASDAQ and at Borsa Istanbul. We look forward to continuing to work towards the Phase II delivery milestone, including the launch of their new derivatives trading platform, in the periods to come. 
We also experienced an exceptional quarter in terms of total order value, one of the highest ever, including new contracts through Genium INET trading system for the Tel Aviv Stock exchange, Genium INET clearing for the Australian exchange and one of our larger order intakes ever for the smarts trades surveillance and several significant BWise contracts. Our ambition is to do more for our clients and anticipating their needs also continues to drive how we evaluate and invest and execute in new opportunities. In 2015, we made significant progress on this front and I want to highlight a few examples for you today. 
I mentioned NASDAQ private market and our continued progress. In 2015, we invested significantly in this platform both through internal initiatives and, obviously, the SecondMarket acquisition. Our secondary market transactions hit record levels in 2015. NASDAQ platforms facilitated over 40 transactions worth over $1.6 billion. This represents a 33% increase from the previous year. As a result, NPM, including the partial quarter impact of SecondMarket, served over 107 private companies, up from 61 in 2014, a very strong performance. 
It is our job to make sure we push the limits of what our systems and technology can accomplish, and I as mentioned, leveraging our core DNA as a financial technology provider is fundamental to us. We see blockchain technology as having great potential to enable markets to operate more efficiently, is why we continue to explore ways we can harness its capabilities to the benefits of our clients. We -- in November, we announced that we were exploring the application of blockchain technology to proxy voting in Estonia and that application is currently in development, while we also expect to initiate more use cases in the short term. We feel good about our position to lead new market innovation in this space, and you'll certainly hear more from us about our efforts in the months to come.
Another significant investment we made during the year that highlights our commitment to our corporate clients was NASDAQ IR Insight. Here we are advancing a technology platform created from the ground up to reshape the workflow and the productivity of our corporate offices. The full version of IR Insight was launched on schedule and made available to our customers just a few weeks ago. Early feedback from new users has been very encouraging, citing its clear and easy-to-use interface. It's a huge step forward in terms of productivity, and how well it stacks up to competing offerings. Already in the first few weeks, we've seen incremental sales' wins across all 3 global regions, including first-time custom wins, some from competitors as well as existing customers adding new users. Some new sales have also come bundled with wins in other Corporate Solution products, affirming how IR Insight can accelerate growth in our other products because its core architecture was designed to support cross product functionality. Early days, but very encouraging. 
We made other key investments in the last year in our other core franchises as well, including our Information Services segment. We accelerated our path to become one of the leading Smart Beta index providers through the acquisition and integration of Dorsey, Wright at the beginning of the year and our partnership with First Trust opened the door for the Alpha Index family of indexes to switch to NASDAQ. In addition, we launched 56 new exchange-traded products linked to NASDAQ indices, which along with growth in our existing product, helped AUM grow in products tracking our indices by 15% in 2015. 
We will never stop seeking ways where we can bring efficiency, scale and benefits for our training (sic) [ trading ] customers. In 2015, we launched NFX, a bold execution of this strategy. We had begun laying the groundwork for this over 2 years ago, inspired by our desire to provide market participants with a more efficient and cost-effective solution in the energy derivatives space. Now in its sixth month of operation, a wide section of the trading community is using our platform with over 90 firms executing transactions on it thus far. Just last week, we hit the 6-month anniversary. We've traded 4.3 million contracts over that time, and we achieved a new milestone with open interest crossing 500,000 contracts for the first time just this week. We're encouraged by the progress we're making in the energy and commodity space while broadening our product offerings in ways that lever our core technology assets and deep customer relationships.
So far, I have highlighted the various ways our core businesses are growing through our client focus, ability to execute and the investments we're making in our future. When we look at the prongs of our strategy and ability to execute well, our disciplined use of capital plays a significant role in our ability to deliver strong returns to our shareholders. As I have highlighted throughout my remarks, however, we believe our future is determined in our ability to challenge the status quo and making sure the investments we make are not only strategic, but also yield attractive returns. I'm pleased to report that in 2015 we invested in a number of R&D initiatives like NFX, complementary acquisitions like Dorsey, Wright & Associates and SecondMarket as well as the pending closure of acquisition of Chi-X Canada. In combination with our second highest CapEx total in history, a total of over $400 million investment was made for our future while still returning a very material amount of capital to our shareholders.
Now I'd like to spend a little bit on some of the key opportunities and areas of focus for us in 2016. At NASDAQ, we are never afraid to look inward at how we do things to make sure we are organized and structured in a way that enables us to lever all our assets to deliver for our client. I think the creation of the role of a COO, and appointment of Adena Friedman to this position, which we announced in the fourth quarter, certainly is at the heart of this philosophy and we're looking forward to her contributions. 
We believe the underlying economic trends in the geographies where we operate are healthy, but we also realize the world is more globally interconnected than ever before. Our model and business mix provides us with a number of ways to not only respond to these trends but to develop new opportunities in lockstep with our clients. At the same time, our model ensures we see direct and immediate revenue benefit in operating leverage from elevated volumes. 
In closing, this year really points to the fact that our business model is incredibly sound. We are anticipating the needs of our clients better than ever, which is really driving our ability to deliver meaningful long-term growth across this franchise. It was a great quarter and a great year. I'd like to thank again the NASDAQ team, and I look forward to working with them to take our business even further in the months ahead. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Lee."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. My commentary will focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations to GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release, and then the presentation is available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com. 
I want to start off, as I did the last few quarters, by highlighting the impact the stronger dollar had on our year-over-year results. Excluding the impact of FX, our net revenues would have been up $37 million or 7% from the prior year and operating income would have been up $21 million or 9%. I will start by reviewing fourth quarter revenue performance relative to the prior year quarter as shown on Page 3 of the presentation. 
The 4% or $19 million increase in reported revenue of $536 million consisted of organic growth in the nontrading segments revenue of $26 million or 8% due to growth in Listings, Information Services and Market Technology, plus $9 million in revenues from the DWA acquisition, reduced by a $10 million FX impact. 
Organic growth in Market Services net revenues of $2 million or 1%, resulting principally from higher cash equity revenues, reduced by an $8 million FX impact. 
And if we move to Page 4 in the presentation, we show how organic growth breaks down historically between the nontrading Information Services, Technology Solutions and Listing Services segments, which collectively had 8% organic growth this quarter and the volume-sensitive Market Services segment at 1% for the quarter. 
Looking at our full year 2015 results, we have achieved 6% organic growth for our nontrading segments, around the upper end of our mid-single-digit medium-term guidance, and in Market Services, we achieved 3% organic growth for the full year 2015, continuing positive organic growth for the second straight year. 
I'm now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be to the prior-year period unless otherwise noted. 
Information Services on Page 5 saw an $8 million or 7% organic increase plus a $9 million increase from the DWA acquisition, reduced by $3 million FX impact. Market Data revenues saw a $7 million or 8% organic increase, reflecting growth in tape plan and proprietary revenues. Index Licensing and Services saw a $1 million or 5% organic increase from higher listing revenue from asset-based fees, partially offset by volume declines in revenues tied to certain licensed derivative products. 
Technology Solutions, as shown on Page 6, saw a $9 million or 6% organic revenue increase, reduced by a $5 million FX impact. The operating margin was 21%, up from 16% in the prior-year period. For the full year, Technology Solutions operating margin totaled 15%, a 200 basis point improvement year-over-year. We continue to have confidence in reaching our medium-term objective and expect further progress as we move through 2016. 
Market Technology revenues saw a $10 million or 16% organic increase due to organic growth in surveillance products and increases in change requests. New order intake was $116 million in the fourth quarter, our strongest quarter since the fourth quarter of 2014. And the period end backlog finished at an all-time record $788 million, up 10% year-over-year. 
Corporate Solutions revenue saw a $1 million or 1% organic decline as we continue to progress through the late stages of the integration and customer transitions from the acquisition of the Thomson Reuters corporate businesses. 
We continue to see improving momentum in the business, particularly with the fourth consecutive quarter of net positive subscription sales, which totaled $3 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the positive catalyst of the full IR Insight launch in 2016. 
Listing Services, on Page 7, saw a $9 million or 15% organic increase in revenues, driven by pricing changes and an increase in the issuer base, reduced by $2 million of an FX impact. Operating margin of 41% was up from 38% in the prior year quarter. I'd note here that looking forward, we expect a return to low single digits listing revenue growth, consistent with our medium-term outlook, as the impact of the January 2015 pricing changes is fully in the run rate. 
Market Services on Page 8 saw a $2 million or 1% organic increase in net revenues, reduced by an $8 million FX impact. Operating margin declined to 53% from 55% in the prior-year period. Equity Derivatives, Trading and Clearing net revenues saw a 6% organic decline, primarily due to lower industry trading volumes followed by lower U.S. market share. Cash Equities Trading net revenues saw a 17% organic increase as higher cash equity net capture and increased industry volumes were partially offset by modestly lower market shares. Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Trading and Clearing net revenues saw a 24% organic decline from the prior year, principally due to volume-driven declines in U.S. fixed income, followed by European energy. Access and Broker Services revenues saw a 3% organic revenue increase.
Turning to Pages 9 and 14 to review the income statement and expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses, increased $12 million on an organic basis or a 4% increase, and $4 million primarily due to the Dorsey, Wright acquisition, partially offset by $11 million in an FX impact. The $285 million in fourth quarter 2015 expenses put us at a full-year total of $1,114,000,000 up 3% on an organic basis. 
Non-GAAP operating income in the fourth quarter rose 7% on an organic basis versus a 6% reported increase. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 47%, up from 46% in the prior-year period, reflecting the margin improvement of our Listings and Technology Solutions business. Net interest expense was $27 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $1 million versus prior year, mainly due to higher net debt. And the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 was 33% and the full year 2015 figure was 33.4%, at the low end of our 33% to 35% tax rate guidance. 
Non-GAAP net income was $150 million or $0.89 per diluted share compared to $139 million or $0.81 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2014. The $0.08 increase in our non-GAAP EPS represents core organic EPS growth of 6%, $0.02 of growth due to acquisitions, $0.02 due to a lower share count and a $0.01 increase due to a lower effective tax rate in the quarter, partially offset by $0.03 impact -- negative $0.03 impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. 
Our 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance is $1,110,000,000 to $1,160,000,000 and the midpoint of our expense guidance corresponds to a 2% increase from 2015 non-GAAP operating expenses. The expense guidance does not yet include the impact of our acquisition of Chi-X Canada, which we expect to close later in the first quarter of 2015 (sic) [ 2016 ]. We also continue to expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 33% to 35% in 2016.
Moving on to the balance sheet, cash flow and capital, please turn to Slides 11 and 12. We repurchased 67 million in stock during the fourth quarter and through dividends and repurchases returned $526 million in capital to shareholders in 2015, accounting for more than 90% of non-GAAP net income.
Now onto the last thing I wanted to cover in my prepared remarks today. After nearly 5 years here at NASDAQ, and many more serving as an adviser to the company and to the industry, I've decided to retire from my CFO position to accept an invitation to join the board of a public company, which will be announced later today. This is an opportunity for me to bring my experience to the board level and develop another set of skills. I'm very grateful to NASDAQ, and to both Bob and Adena in particular, to have had the opportunity to serve as its CFO and be a part of its leadership team, and I'm proud of what the company has accomplished during my time here. I've learned a tremendous amount in the role and am grateful to all of my colleagues for their support and friendship. When I arrived, I saw an opportunity to build on NASDAQ's expense discipline with a complementary capital discipline that has been critical to allocating the substantial cash flow we generate as effectively as possible. This discipline also supported our decision to initiate a regular dividend and significantly grow our payout ratio. We also streamlined our business line reporting, introduced segment profitability disclosure and initiated an organic growth outlook for our nontransactional segments, underscoring the company's confidence in the sustainable growth prospects of these businesses. I believe strongly, all of these serve to make clear the quality of NASDAQ's diverse portfolio. I feel emphatically that my departure comes at a time when NASDAQ's financial position and accounting are in outstanding health, in step with the operations of its strong business portfolio. And I'm also confident that strong capital discipline has become embedded at NASDAQ and will be continued to be applied in all uses of capital. And if it isn't, I will be front and center at the next shareholders meeting to hold management accountable. 
Ron Hassen, NASDAQ's controller for the past 14 years, will step into the role of CFO on an interim basis for the second time in his career, and I will stay at the company in March to support Ron and to ensure a seamless transition of responsibilities. The company has commenced the search for a permanent CFO replacement. 
I would also like to say it's been a truly rewarding experience getting to know the investors and analysts that covered, invested in and followed NASDAQ during my time here. I've learned an extraordinary amount from your diverse perspectives, tried to apply it where possible, and look forward to continuing our interaction during my remaining time here. So please don't take this call as a final goodbye. Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to Bob."

So we definitely did have a strong underlying quarter. But on a full-year basis, you can see that we believe that our margins for that business in 2015 were 16%. And we continued to make progress against the 20% goal for full-year margin. But we still have some work to do. And as we go into 2016, we see a few things of particular strength. Number one, we still have not yet recognized revenue from the Borsa Istanbul contract. So that will start to -- we will start to be able to recognize that as we continue to deliver on that contract. We also have continued growth in SMARTS which will continue to drive both topline revenue and margin expansion. And then in Corporate Solutions, the IR Insight rollout has just begun. We launched it 2 weeks ago. We already have about 100 clients using the new product. We have clients calling us asking us when they can get migrated or rolled out.

I don't really have anything to add to Adena's comment on the margin. You did ask a question about audit revenue in the period, which relates not to Technology Solutions but the to the Information Services business. As we typically disclose, the audit revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.6 million, and that compares to a year ago where we had a reversal of about $300,000 of audit revenue. So there -- that is a contributor on a year-over-year basis. As you know, that audit revenue can be volatile quarter to quarter to quarter. So that will give you some basis for comparison. And then on the Technology Solutions margin, as Adena indicated, I think we are excited about 2 things. One, with the IR Insight launch, you know that clearly enables to reach the final phase for us in eliminating some of the expenses. You are seeing some of the impact of the investment that we've made in the IR Insight platform in our depreciation and amortization. But the upside will also be driven by success in revenue growth. And as I indicated in the comments, the net subscription sales and overall new sales of products in the Corporate Solutions sector as a leading indicator has been very positive and gives us confidence about making that continued progress against the goal in 2016."

And therefore, there is a fair amount of data that does start to occur once you launch an ETF, in terms of the AUM growth, and sometimes some declines based on market performance. Generally speaking, what we look at is -- obviously we look at AUM, but we also look at TSO, which is the total shares outstanding. And that's more an indication, a core indication of the demand for the product from investors. So right now, we are seeing our TSO is holding steady as we've been dealing with the volatility in the markets. And so for us, that means the underlying demand for the products is strong. And it's just a matter of riding through some of these data winds that come when we have market volatility. But the pricing tends to be fixed upon launching the product, Mike."

So the first thing I would say is, SMARTS has really 3 different markets that we are trying to serve at this point. We have the exchanges, which was the original business for SMARTS, and it's the longest standing business. It's a deployed solution out to the clients, we've been selling to exchanges for many years as well as the regulators -- I should say exchanges and regulators, and that continues as you can tell to grow, in terms of new exchanges taking our solution like Nigerian Stock Exchange most recently. But that's all -- that's a longer sales cycle. Obviously, there's a finite number of exchanges that we continue to find real success there, and that's the more mature part of our business. The broker-dealer community is the second community that we have sold to and that's a newer part of our business, but definitely the fastest growing. We actually surpassed a 1,000 users this year, and we were just thrilled with that. We in fact sent him a small gift and then -- this client. And I think that it's really exciting to see continued double-digit growth in that part of the business as we continue to find striking demand for Trade Surveillance solutions across the broker-dealer community. In the year -- over the last 2 years, we've made it so it's multi-asset class and it's every geography. So it really can serve any and all trading firms in the world. The third community is the buy side community. And for the first time this year, we do have 3 buy side clients who have signed up for the service. And we have chosen to invest through our R&D program to build out a more fulsome buy side solution for this trade surveillance. So buy side firms, both hedge funds and traditionals, are really becoming much more sophisticated in their trading operations, and they realize now that they need sophisticated tools to couple with the sophistication of their trading strategies. So we believe that, that will be a new area of increased demand for us, for the SMARTS service. We also are looking at how we can integrate more machine intelligence into the solution and we have been discussing how to integrate even more intelligence to make it more useful across the platform in terms of compliance and trades provision. So that's a quick synopsis of the SMARTS business, but it really is a great business for us."

So it's served a purpose for a long period of time, but we certainly think refinement is in order. With respect to IEX, our position is that it's thoughtful, could be innovative and it's very similar to what we had suggested to the commission back in 2012. They told us it was not in, either the letter or the spirit of Reg NMS, and said we could not do it. So our position with IEX is that, it really should be after there's a rethink of Reg NMS and how do we get the new market structure in place and let innovation develop under the new set of rules and not patchwork, and try to get exceptions under the existing rules that exist."

So obviously, with the NASDAQ private market is the beginning of times we're able to create the experience we wanted. We're looking for similar type opportunities. We want to have use cases where you can deliver, when you get paid for and bring real value today. So as I said in my prepared remarks, we're committed to proxy voting in Estonia.

First, I want to thank those of you that attended our recent Investor Day. I hope you found it beneficial in your understanding of our mission and our strategy.
Among the themes we highlighted during this day was we are an applied technology company at our core. Our spirit of innovation and how that lays the foundation for our growth, our resiliency for both our customers and for our shareholders and our drive to generate attractive returns for our shareholders. I'll update everyone on how this quarter reinforces those themes later in my remarks.
Regarding generating attractive results for shareholders, we're also clearly detailed -- we have also clearly detailed opportunity we have to consistently deliver strong returns. So in keeping with that theme, I can't think of a more compelling way to start than in the context of record quarter results we delivered and how it indicates how our model is performing.
In the first quarter of 2016, on a non-GAAP basis compared to the prior-year, organic net revenue growth was a solid 4%. Our operating income grew 8%, due in large part to a strong operating leverage. And then largely due to the impact of capital deployment over the last year, our diluted EPS grew to a more impressive 14%. 
Adding in the dividend, which we recently announced had been raised, and an approximate 2% yield, the total shareholder return, assuming constant valuation, was around 16%. 
Now, we certainly know the stars have always aligned every quarter, but we do know our strong organic growth prospects, our operating leverage and our discipline around capital positions us to deliver strong returns for shareholders.
Non-GAAP diluted EPS reached an all-time high of $0.91, and non-GAAP operating income and net income both records $254 million and $153 million, respectively.
During Investor Day, we also said that at NASDAQ, our fundamental mission, first and foremost, is to serve our customers. We accomplish this through intensive engagement and feedback loop with these customers. We see our success based on the 4 core principles: Applied technology, growth, innovation and resiliency. When we do all of these well, it will translate into a very positive total shareholder return, and that is our focus.
So with that in mind, I'm going to organize my remarks today around these 4 principles as they relate to our performance this quarter.
The first principle I'll discuss is growth. Here, we are focused on 2 key areas, organic growth and expansion through acquisitions that are strategically compelling and meet our strict financial criteria on returns and accretion.
When you look at the NASDAQ value proposition, we know our clients faced increasingly complex challenges. And as a result, everything we do is laser focused to ensure we are listening to them and executing to better meet their needs. Clearly a good example of this intense focus is our market services business. We saw strong organic growth, 6% as compared to the prior year quarter. Our Cash Equities business saw an organic growth of 17% on a higher volumes in capture, while also closed the acquisition of Chi-X Canada, which provides NASDAQ access to a healthy adjacent market and expands our equities footprint in North America.
Our laser focus on the soundness and efficiency of our market plays a significant factor in our ability to capture higher share during times of volatility, and this is certainly what we experienced in the first quarter. We look forward to seeing how far new concepts like dynamic pricing can take things to further improve the quality of our markets in those critical times.
Turning to our Listing Services. Despite a rough start to the year for the broader IPO market, this business still delivered its second best quarter ever in terms of revenue, driven by a strong year-on-year increase in the number of listed companies. Overall, NASDAQ's U.S. win rate continues to be a very strong 76% market share of all IPOs and 278 new listings during the last 12 months. We won 10 of 10 IPOs in the first quarter, so certainly while 10 is not a good number, 10 out of 10, we have to be proud of.
This increasing competitive effectiveness should benefit us as we move past a volatile start to 2016 and have better prospects of seeing more IPOs come out of a still healthy backlog of filed issuers.
IPO activity on our Nordics market has been quite remarkable. During the quarter, NASDAQ welcomed 14 new Nordic listings, a near record quarter. Beyond IPO activity, we've seen $122 billion in market value switched to our market in the last 12 months, with category leaders, such as Willis, Towers Watson, Scripts Networks Interactive, CSX, TD Ameritrade and T-Mobile.
We're also seeing a very strong performance in ETP listings. Year-to-date, NASDAQ won 43 new ETPs or switches, including 25 in the first quarter alone, clearly the most by any U.S. exchange. Our total ETP listings at NASDAQ were 241 at the end of the quarter, up 36% versus the same period a year ago. The second quarter is also off to a fast start with 18 additional new listings. Clearly these are big wins for us and certainly this is further indication of the value proposition this franchise offers in the marketplace. We're the only U.S. provider of a complete life cycle solution to the ETP industry, ranging from product development and index creation to launch, listing and trading of the ETP.
I've said several times over recent periods, but I think it bears repeating again this quarter, the foundation of NASDAQ's very diversified product offering at NASDAQ, is our Equity Trading and listing business. So it's very encouraging to see it performing so effectively, with results at multiyear highs as well as maximizing opportunities for other businesses across our broader franchise such as in derivatives, data and connectivity.
A great example of a business that is leveraging that foundation to succeed in terms of organic growth is our Information Services business, where we saw record revenues and solid year-on-year growth, not only in data products, but also in index. And despite the first quarter's pullback in average market levels, as our first quarter '15 acquisition of Deutsche Boerse, they enjoyed significant organic growth post close.
Now in addition to some of the positive organic growth trends I just shared, another fundamental prong in our growth strategy is strategic acquisitions. During the quarter, we announced our closed 4 new acquisitions, which we're quite pleased about, most importantly, because they are all in our previously committed strategic direction, they are leveraging our areas of expertise, they will build upon the business -- businesses we are already successful and well-established in.
Repeating the disclosures made at Investor Day, we said these acquisitions are each expected to generate attractive returns and generate EPS accretion within 12 months of closing, and together, would have driven an 11% increase in our non-GAAP diluted EPS based on 2015 results, assuming full synergy realization. We are confident these acquisitions will also drive meaningful growth opportunities and deliver even larger impact in the years to come.
In the Market Services segment, we closed the acquisition of Chi-X Canada, the #2 player in the Canadian equity space in early February. We are currently working on further expanding this offering incorporating our technology and added capabilities, which will benefit the Canadian market.
The acquisition of ISE will provide us with an opportunity to broaden our U.S. options offering, in particular gaining new capabilities through ISE's leadership and complex options trading and provide new opportunities to innovate and bring greater value to our clients.
Last week, we were informed by the DOJ that the ISE transaction, HSR review, has been successfully completed and we will work with the SEC towards obtaining their approval for this transaction. 
Contingent on receiving regulatory approval, this transaction could close as early as the end of the second quarter. Our original estimate was in the second half of the year.
In our Corporate Solutions business, we announced 2 acquisitions: Acquisition of Marketwired and Boardvantage. These acquisitions will enable us to extend our corporate client customer base and increase our exposure to some of the highest margins in fastest-growing segment in our Corporate Solutions business.
With respect to Marketwired, which closed in late February, we are now working through the integration of the systems, technology and talent, with the goal of a single new platform for news distribution and analytical information.
With respect to Boardvantage, we received notice yesterday that the HSR review has also been successfully completed, and we anticipate closing in the coming week. We look forward to strengthening our position as a leading provider of board and collaboration tools.
As I mentioned earlier, technology is core to what we do here. It is core to the way we apply everything in our businesses and we do that across products and solutions with a singular focus to benefit our clients. Let me give you a few examples of this. With NASDAQ Private Market, we are on a mission to bring increased liquidity and other advantages from the public markets to the private markets space. Our efforts continue to resonate with private companies. And at the end of the quarter, NPM now is 122 private companies using our software products, our employee shareholder liquidity and equity administration. this compares to 46 in the prior year period. We continue to enhance this platform in new and innovative ways to reduce the administrative complexities and costs private companies face today.
This success follows last quarter's successful execution of the first blockchain enabled transaction in the private space. This enabled participants to reach settlement in minutes compared to the industries, the public companies industries public standard, which are measured in days. We are doing a credible exciting things on the private market space today. But most important, we are only beginning to scratch the surface in terms of the level of innovation and capabilities we can, in fact, deliver for private companies.
In our Corporate Solutions business, which serves issuers both public and private, we successfully launched our next-generation IR Insight platform in the first weeks of January. And through the first 3 months of this launch, we migrated 750 clients and over 1,200 users, that's truly impressive. We also received much feedback from the early adopters, most of overwhelmingly positive, but this feedback loop is also helping us to develop and quickly deploy innovative new features. We expect to complete the transition of the remaining 2,500 clients within the next 6 months and sunset the legacy T1 platform on schedule during the fourth quarter of this year. 
We've added also new customers through cross-selling our existing base and reading competitive situations. In addition, we're seeing IR Insight and the integration of platinum offers serve us as an opportunity to deepen relationships with customers by cross-selling other products and advisory and communication segments.
While still early days, we see clear examples of how elevating the bar in terms of technology and product design will be key to bringing sustained organic growth to Corporate Solutions in the periods to come.
Moving on to our Market Technology business. We are also leveraging the trends for applied technology to increase the capabilities to utilize blockchain technologies to evolve our post-trade operations as we continue to enjoy near record high in our signed contract backlog. SMARTS, our leading solution in the surveillance space, is a good example of the success we've had evolving a product over time, to increase the value for our clients. In fact, we had a record quarter in terms of SMARTS's new order intake, and this is really a strong growth story for us as our clients are turning to us more and more to help them manage the complexities of the new regulatory environment.
We are also currently exploring the application of technology, such as machine intelligence, which we expect to open up a host of new opportunities and capabilities for advanced compliance and surveillance that will detect fraud more quickly and in more asset classes. We're also currently scoring a number of proofs of concepts in our lab that looks to harness the predictive capabilities machine intelligence offers to enhance our listing, our trading, our index and our data product areas. To ensure we are positioned to take advantage of these opportunities, we are making investments and also we are partnering with Digital Reasoning, one of the thought leaders in this space.
Our use of applied technology is really only 1/2 of the equation. It is what we do with this technology to deliver on our client's needs that is most important and in many respects, we're true innovation takes place. And FX, our energy derivatives market, is a good example for focus on new concepts and a better way to serve our clients. Now, in its 9th month of operation, we are extremely encouraged by the volume and open interest progress we are seeing.
During the April trading, volume passed a significant milestone, moving above 100,000 contracts per day on average, while open interest also continued to set new records and we want about 800,000 contracts just this week and we now make up about 40% of the futures open interest at OCC. We are seeing a growing number of firms use our NFX service. And during the first quarter, more than 70 companies manage their trading and hedging needs on NFX.
On May 1, we will implement our new fee program for NFX. We are committed to provide the market with transaction costs that are 50% lower than the incumbent. These fees will be introduced in a phased manner. May 1 is the first phase of that program.
When we think about resiliency at NASDAQ, we, of course, think about our technology and the systems and how reliably they serve our customers. We also think more broadly than that and how we run this organization. Central to this business model, our business model is a diversed mix of subscription and recurring revenue. Almost 3 quarters of our port revenue is subscription is recurring. We're also continuing our maniacal focus on optimizing efficiency and margins on a product by product basis, even while investing materially to grow each franchise. And this is evidence in the significant increase in our profitability year-over-year. In fact, our 48% non-GAAP operating margin matches a multiyear high. Together, these give us an exceptional amount of visibility and stability in our growth path, which combined with our organic growth opportunity, significant operating leverage and disciplined deployment and return to capital has us on a great path to deliver strong shareholder return, both in terms of combined earnings, growth and dividend yield.
It also continues a successful story that we can continue investing and innovating on behalf of our consumers, as well as nourishing the seeds of tomorrow's growth.
In closing, it was another tremendous quarter for this franchise. The examples I've outlined here today clearly demonstrates this franchise's focus on the innovative use of technology, growth and resiliency is not only increasing the amount of client opportunities for us, but it does manifest itself in the results we deliver to our shareholders.
What is most exciting for me is that when we look across all our businesses we are in, there are perhaps more quality opportunities in front of us today than during any other time during my tenure. We certainly feel very good about our ability to execute on these behind the resilient business model we have built. We alluded to strong value creation during Investor Day and I think this quarter is clearly an indication that we are on the right path of the achieve this and look forward to exceeding expectations for our clients and our shareholders in the quarters to come. I'll now turn the call over to Ron."

My commentary will focus on non-GAAP results, reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at IR not NASDAQ.com.
I will start by reviewing first quarter revenue performance. Relative to the prior-year quarter, as shown on Page 3 of the presentation, the 5% or $27 million increase and reported net revenue of $534 million consisted of organic growth and market services, net revenue of $12 million or 6%, resulting approximately from higher cash equity and access revenues.
Organic growth in non-trading Information Services, Technology Solutions and Listing Services segments totaled $7 million or 2% due to the growth in listings and Information Services.
In addition, there was $10 million in revenue from recently completed acquisitions of Marketwired, the Chi-X Canada plus 1 additional month in the first quarter of 2016 from DWA, while year-over-year change in FX rates reduced revenue by $2 million.
I am now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be to the prior-year period, unless otherwise noted. Information Services, on Page 5, saw a $5 million or 4% organic increase plus a $4 million increase related to DWA and Chi-X Canada acquisition, reduced by a $1 million FX impact. Market Data revenues saw a $4 million or 4% organic increase, reflecting revenue growth in index data and proprietary products.
Index licensing and services saw a $1 million or 4% organic increase reflecting growth in DWA. Technology Solutions, shown on Page 6, saw a $4 million or 3% increase in revenue, including $4 million contributions from the acquisition of Marketwired. The operating margin was focused at up from 11% in the prior year period. We continued to have confidence and reaching our medium term objective and expect further progress as we move through 2016.
Corporate Solutions saw a $1 million or 1% organic decline as shown as growth indirected --  as growth was more than offset by declines in multimedia. Repeating what we said at the recent Investor Day, we continued to believe we are on the path to returning to organic revenue growth in Corporate Solutions, but would expect that in the second half of 2016 at the earliest.
Market Technology revenues saw a $1 million or 2% organic increase, due to organic growth in surveillance products. New order intake was $22 million in the first quarter, and the period end backlog finished at $783 million, up 8% year-over-year and there are all-time record of $788 million set in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Listing Services on Page 7 saw a $2 million or 3% organic increase in revenues, driven primarily by increase in the number of listed companies. Operating margin of 42% was down from 44% in the prior year period -- prior-year quarter.
Market services, on Page 8, saw a $12 million or 6% organic increase in that revenue's, plus a $2 million increased due to the acquisition of Chi-X Canada, reduced by $1 million FX impact, operating margin increased to 56% from 54% in the prior year period.
Equity derivatives trading and clearing net revenues achieved a 4% organic growth, primarily due to the higher U.S. industry trading volumes and higher U.S. average net capture, partially offset by lower U.S. market share. Cash equities trading net revenues saw a 17% organic increase due to the higher cash equity and net capture and increased industry volumes, partially offset by modestly lower market share.
Fixed income, currency and commodities trading and clearing net revenues saw a 17% organic decline from the prior year, basically due to NFX related trading incentives and lower U.S. Treasury volumes, partially offset by growth in European fixed income and commodities trading.
Access and broker services saw a just 7% organic revenue increase, due to the increase in customer demand for network connectivity.
Turning to Pages 9 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $5 million on an organic basis, or 2% increase due to $6 million -- and $6 million due to DWA, Marketwired and Chi-X Canada acquisitions, partially offset by a $3 million in FX impact, resulting in an $8 million or 3% reported increase.
Turning to Slide 11. Our revised 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance is $1,180,000,000 to $1,230,000,000 versus the previous $1,110,000,000 to $1,160,000,000. The core expense balance is unchanged, what we're the updating it to include the impact of closed NASDAQ Canada the Deutsche Boerse Chi-X Canada as well as MarketWatch as well as Boardvantage acquisition, which we expect to close to th next week. Which we collectively are expected at $70 million off expense in 2016, including $5 million that was already included in the first quarter this year. The expense guidance does not include the impact of our pending acquisition of ISE, but we look forward to updating you on this impact after it has closed.
Non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter increased 6% on an organic basis and 8% in total. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 48%, up from 46% in the prior year period and primarily reflecting the margin improvement of our market service business.
Net interest expense was $27 million in the first quarter, unchanged from the prior year period. Other nonoperating income came to $3 million in the first quarter. This income primarily represents our portion of our income and losses from certain investment interest, such as our equity interest and OCC, euros CCP and TOM. Going forward, including the pickup in the income of OCC, that will occur when we close ISE, we expect other operating income to range between $1 million or $2 million per quarter for the foreseeable future. Non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33.5%, and was within our guidance. Non-GAAP net income was a record of $153 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared to $138 million or $0.80 per diluted share in the first quarter 2015.
Now moving on to cash flow and capital. Please turn to Slide 13. During the quarter, we repurchased 29 million in stock. And through dividends and repurchases, we returned $70 million in capital to the shareholders. Additionally, during the quarter, we announced a 28% increase at our quarterly dividend to $0.32, and NASDAQ's Board of Directors authorized an additional $370 million in share repurchase, bringing the total remaining value authorized to $500 million. This authorization is expected to be used primarily to offset share issuance, such as employee share-based equity plans. And as such, we expect its utilization to be over a multi-year period. Thank you for your time, and I'll turn the call back over to Bob."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's record first quarter 2016 results. First, I want to thank those of you that attended our recent Investor Day. I hope you found it beneficial in your understandin",2672,"Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's record first quarter 2016 results. First, I want to thank those of you that attended our recent Investor Day. I hope you found it beneficial in your understanding of our mission and our strategy. 
Among the themes we highlighted during this day was we are an applied technology company at our core, our spirit of innovation and how that lays the foundation for our growth, our resiliency for both our customers and for our shareholders and our drive to generate attractive returns for our shareholders. I'll update everyone on how this quarter reinforces those themes later in my remarks.
Regarding generating attractive results for shareholders, we're also clearly detailed -- we have also clearly detailed the opportunity we have to consistently deliver strong returns. So in keeping with that theme, I can't think of a more compelling way to start than in the context of record quarter results we delivered and how it indicates how our model is performing.
In the first quarter of 2016, on a non-GAAP basis compared to the prior year, organic net revenue growth was a solid 4%. Our operating income grew 8% due in large part to a strong operating leverage. And then largely due to the impact of capital deployment over the last year, our diluted EPS grew to a more impressive 14%. Adding in the dividend, which we recently announced had been raised and an approximate 2% yield, the total shareholder return, assuming constant valuation, was around 16%. 
Now we certainly know the stars have always aligned every quarter, but we do know our strong organic growth prospects, our operating leverage and our discipline around capital positions us to deliver strong returns for shareholders. Non-GAAP diluted EPS reached an all-time high of $0.91, and non-GAAP operating income and net income, both records, at $254 million and $153 million, respectively.
During Investor Day, we also said that at Nasdaq, our fundamental mission, first and foremost, is to serve our customers. We accomplish this through intensive engagement and feedback loop with these customers. We see our success based on the 4 core principles: applied technology, growth, innovation and resiliency. When we do all these well, it will translate into a very positive total shareholder return, and that is our focus. So with that in mind, I'm going to organize my remarks today around these 4 principles as they relate to our performance this quarter. 
The first principle I'll discuss is growth. Here, we're focused on 2 key areas, organic growth and expansion through acquisitions that are strategically compelling and meet our strict financial criteria on returns and accretion. When you look at the Nasdaq value proposition, we know our clients face increasingly complex challenges, and as a result, everything we do is laser focused to ensure we are listening to them and executing to better meet their needs. 
Clearly, a good example of this intense focus is our Market Services business. We saw a strong organic growth, 6% as compared to the prior year quarter. Our Cash Equities business saw organic growth of 17% on a higher volumes and capture while we also closed the acquisition of Chi-X Canada, which provides Nasdaq access to a healthy adjacent market and expands our equities footprint in North America.
Our laser focus on the soundness and efficiency of our market plays a significant factor in our ability to capture higher share during times of volatility, and this is certainly what we experienced in the first quarter. We look forward to seeing how far new concepts, like dynamic pricing, can take things to further improve the quality of our markets in those critical times.
Turning to our Listing Services. Despite a rough start to the year for the broader IPO market, this business still delivered its second best quarter ever in terms of revenue, driven by a strong year-on-year increase in the number of listed companies. Overall, Nasdaq's U.S. win rate continues to be a very strong 76% market share of all IPOs and 278 new listings during the last 12 months. We won 10 of 10 IPOs in the first quarter. So certainly why 10 -- while 10 is not a good number, 10 out of 10, we have to be proud of. This increasing competitive effectiveness should benefit us as we move past a volatile start to 2016 and have better prospects of seeing more IPOs come out of a still healthy backlog of filed issuers.  
IPO activity on our Nordic markets has been quite remarkable. During the quarter, Nasdaq welcomed 14 new Nordic listings, a near record quarter. 
Beyond IPO activity, we've seen $122 billion in market value switched to our market in the last 12 months with category leaders, such as Willis Towers Watson, Scripps Networks Interactive, CSX, TD Ameritrade and T-Mobile.
We're also seeing a very strong performance in ETP listings. Year-to-date, Nasdaq won 43 new ETPs or switches, including 25 in the first quarter alone, clearly, the most by any U.S. exchange. Our total ETP listings at Nasdaq were 241 at the end of the quarter, up 36% versus the same period a year ago. The second quarter is also off to a fast start with 18 additional new listings. 
Clearly, these are big wins for us and certainly this is further indication of the value proposition this franchise offers in the marketplace. We're the only U.S. provider of a complete life cycle solution to the ETP industry, ranging from product development and index creation to launch, listing and trading of the ETP.
I've said several times over recent periods, but I think it bears repeating again this quarter, the foundation of Nasdaq's very diversified product offering at Nasdaq, is our equity trading and Listings business. So it's very encouraging to see it performing so effectively with results at multiyear highs as well as maximizing opportunities for other businesses across our broader franchise, such as in derivatives, data and connectivity.
A great example of a business that is leveraging that foundation to succeed in terms of organic growth is our Information Services business, where we saw record revenues and solid year-on-year growth, not only in Data Products, but also in Index. And despite the first quarter's pullback in average market levels, as our first quarter '15 acquisition of Dorsey, Wright, they enjoyed significant organic growth post close.
Now in addition to some of the positive organic growth trends I just shared, another fundamental prong in our growth strategy is strategic acquisitions. During the quarter, we announced or closed 4 new acquisitions, which we're quite pleased about, most importantly, because they are all in our previously committed strategic direction, they are leveraging our areas of expertise, they will build upon the business -- businesses we're already successful and well established in.
Repeating the disclosures made at Investor Day, we said these acquisitions are each expected to generate attractive returns and generate EPS accretion within 12 months of closing and, together, would have driven an 11% increase in our non-GAAP diluted EPS based on 2015 results, assuming full synergy realization. We are confident these acquisitions will also drive meaningful growth opportunities and deliver even larger impact in the years to come.
In the Market Services segment, we closed the acquisition of Chi-X Canada, the #2 player in the Canadian equity space in early February. We are currently working on further expanding this offering, incorporating our technology and added capabilities, which will benefit the Canadian market.
The acquisition of ISE will provide us with the opportunity to broaden our U.S. options offering, in particular, gaining new capability through ISE's leadership in complex options trading and provide new opportunities to innovate and bring greater value to our clients.
Last week, we were informed by the DOJ that the ISE transaction's HSR review has been successfully completed, and we will work with the SEC towards obtaining their approval for this transaction. Contingent on receiving regulatory approval, this transaction could close as early as the end of the second quarter. Our original estimate was in the second half of the year.
In our Corporate Solutions business, we announced 2 acquisitions: Marketwired and Boardvantage. These acquisitions will enable us to extend our corporate client customer base and increase our exposure to some of the highest margin in fastest-growing segments in our Corporate Solutions business.
With respect to Marketwired, which closed in late February, we are now working through the integration of the systems, technology and talent with the goal of a single new platform for news distribution and analytical information.
With respect to Boardvantage, we received notice yesterday that the HSR review has also been successfully completed, and we anticipate closing in the coming week. We look forward to strengthening our position as a leading provider of board and collaboration tools.
As I mentioned earlier, technology is core to what we do here. It is core to the way we apply everything in our businesses and we do that across products and solutions with a singular focus to benefit our clients. Let me give you a few examples of this. 
With NASDAQ Private Market, we are on a mission to bring increased liquidity and other advantages from the public market to the private market space. Our efforts continue to resonate with private companies, and at the end of the quarter, NPM now has 122 private companies using our software products for employee shareholder liquidity and equity cap table administration. This compares to 46 in the prior year period. We continue to enhance this platform in new and innovative ways to reduce the administrative complexities and costs private companies face today.
This success follows last quarter's successful execution of the first blockchain-enabled transaction in the private space. This enable participants to reach settlement in minutes compared to the industries -- the public companies industry current standards, which is measured in days. 
We are doing incredibly exciting things in the private market space today. But most importantly, we are only beginning to scratch the surface in terms of the level of innovation and capabilities we can, in fact, deliver for private companies.
In our Corporate Solutions business, which serves issuers both public and private, we successfully launched our next-generation IR Insight platform in the first weeks of January. And through the first 3 months of this launch, we migrated 750 clients and over 1,200 users. That's truly impressive. We also received much feedback from the early adopters, most of it overwhelmingly positive, but this feedback loop is also helping us to develop and quickly deploy innovative new features. We expect to complete the transition of the remaining 2,500 clients within the next 6 months and sunset the legacy T1 platform on schedule during the fourth quarter of this year. 
We've added also new customers through cross-selling our existing base and winning competitive situations. In addition, we're seeing IR Insight and the integration of platform offers serve us as an opportunity to deepen relationships with customers by cross-selling other products in advisory and communication segments. While still early days, we see clear examples of how elevating the bar in terms of technology and product design will be key to bringing sustained organic growth to Corporate Solutions in the periods to come.
Moving on to our Market Technology business. We're also leveraging the trends for applied technology to increase the capabilities to utilize blockchain technologies to evolve our post-trade operations as we continue to enjoy near-record highs in our signed contract backlog. 
SMARTS, our leading solution in the surveillance space, is a good example of the success we've had in evolving a product over time, to increase the value for our clients. In fact, we had a record quarter in terms of SMARTS' new order intake, and this is really a strong growth story for us as our clients are turning to us more and more to help them manage the complexities of the new regulatory environment.
We're also currently exploring the application of technology, such as machine intelligence, which we expect to open up a host of new opportunities and capabilities for advanced compliance and surveillance that will detect fraud more quickly and in more asset classes. We're also currently exploring a number of proofs of concept in our lab that looks to harness the predictive capabilities machine intelligence offers to enhance our Listing, our Trading, our Index and our Data Product areas. To ensure we are positioned to take advantage of these opportunities, we are making investments and also we partnered with Digital Reasoning, one of the thought leaders in this space.
Our use of applied technology is really only 1/2 of the equation. It is what we do with this technology to deliver on our client's need that is most important and, in many respects, where true innovation takes place. 
NFX, our energy derivatives market, is a good example of our focus on new concepts and a better way to serve our clients. Now in its ninth month of operation, we are extremely encouraged by the volume and open interest progress we are seeing. During the April trading, volume passed a significant milestone, moving above 100,000 contracts per day, on average, while open interest also continued to set new records. And we went above 800,000 contracts, just this week, and we now make up about 40% of the futures open interest at OCC. 
We are seeing a growing number of firms use our NFX service, and during the first quarter, more than 70 companies managed their trading and hedging needs on NFX. On May 1, we will implement our new fee program for NFX. We are committed to provide the market with transaction costs that are 50% lower than the incumbent. These fees will be introduced in a phased manner. May 1 is the first phase of that program.
When we think about resiliency at Nasdaq, we, of course, think about our technology and the systems and how reliably they serve our customers. But we also think more broadly than that in how we run this organization. Central to this business model, our business model is a diverse mix of subscription and recurring revenue. Almost 3 quarters of our current revenue is subscription and recurring. 
We're also continuing our maniacal focus on optimizing efficiency and margins on a product by product basis even while investing materially to grow each franchise, and this is evidence in the significant increase in our profitability year-over-year. In fact, our 48% non-GAAP operating margin matches a multiyear high. 
Together, these give us an exceptional amount of visibility and stability in our growth path, which, combined with our organic growth opportunity, significant operating leverage and disciplined deployment and return to capital, has us on a great path to deliver strong shareholder return, both in terms of combined earnings, growth and dividend yield. It also continues a successful story that can -- we can continue investing and innovating on behalf of our consumers as well as nourishing the seeds of tomorrow's growth.
In closing, it was another tremendous quarter for this franchise. The examples I've outlined here today clearly demonstrate this franchise's focus on the innovative use of technology. Growth and resiliency is not only increasing the amount of client opportunities for us, but it does manifest itself in the results we deliver to our shareholders. What is most exciting for me is that when we look across all our businesses we're in, there are perhaps more quality opportunities in front of us today than during any other time during my tenure. We certainly feel very good about our ability to execute on these behind the resilient business model we have built. 
We alluded to strong value creation during Investor Day, and I think this quarter is clearly an indication that we're on the right path to achieve this and look forward to exceeding expectations for our clients and our shareholders in the quarters to come.

Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's availabl",1123,"Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. My commentary will focus on non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com.
I will start by reviewing first quarter revenue performance relative to the prior year quarter, as shown on Page 3 of the presentation. The 5% or $27 million increase in reported net revenue of $534 million consisted of organic growth in Market Services net revenue of $12 million or 6%, resulting principally from higher Cash Equity and Access revenues. Organic growth in non-trading Information Services, Technology Solutions and Listing Services segments totaled $7 million or 2% due to the growth in Listings and Information Services. In addition, it was a -- there was $10 million in revenue from recently completed acquisitions of Marketwired, Chi-X Canada plus one additional month in the first quarter of 2016 from DWA while year-over-year change in FX rates reduced revenue by $2 million.
I am now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. Information Services, on Page 5, saw a $5 million or 4% organic increase, plus a $4 million increase related to DWA and Chi-X Canada acquisitions, reduced by a $1 million FX impact. Market Data revenue saw a $4 million or 4% organic increase, reflecting revenue growth in index, data and proprietary products. Index Licensing and Services saw a $1 million or 4% organic increase, reflecting growth in DWA. 
Technology Solutions, shown on Page 6, saw a $4 million or 3% increase in revenue, including $4 million contribution from the acquisition of Marketwired. The operating margin was 12%, up from 11% in the prior year period. We continue to have confidence in reaching our medium-term objective and expect further progress as we move through 2016. Corporate Solutions saw a $1 million or 1% organic decline as shown in Directors -- as growth in Directors Desk was more than offset by declines in multimedia. Repeating what we said at the recent Investor Day, we continue to believe we are on the path to returning to organic revenue growth in Corporate Solutions, but would expect that in the second half of 2016 at the earliest. Market Technology revenue saw a $1 million or 2% organic increase due to organic growth in surveillance products. New order intake was $22 million in the first quarter, and the period-end backlog finished at $783 million, up 8% year-over-year and near our all-time record of $788 set in -- $788 million set in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Listing Services, on Page 7, saw a $2 million or 3% organic increase in revenues, driven primarily by increase in the number of listed companies. Operating margin of 42% was down from 44% in the prior year period -- prior year quarter.
Market Services, on Page 8, saw a $12 million or 6% organic increase in net revenues, plus a $2 million increase due to the acquisition of Chi-X Canada, reduced by $1 million FX impact. Operating margin increased to 56% from 54% in the prior year period. Equity Derivatives trading and clearing net revenue achieved a 4% organic growth, primarily due to the higher U.S. industry trading volumes and higher U.S. average net capture, partially offset by lower U.S. market share. Cash Equities trading net revenue saw a 17% organic increase due to the higher cash equity and net capture and increased industry volumes, partially offset by modestly lower market share. Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities trading and clearing net revenue saw a 17% organic decline from the prior year, principally due to NFX-related trading incentives and lower U.S. Treasury volumes, partially offset by growth in European fixed income and commodities trading. Access and Broker Services saw a 7% organic revenue increase due to the increase in customer demand for network connectivity.
Turning to Pages 9 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $5 million on an organic basis or 2% increase due to the $6 million -- and $6 million due to DWA, Marketwired and Chi-X Canada acquisitions, partially offset by a $3 million FX impact, resulting in an $8 million or 3% reported increase.
Turning to Slide 11. Our revised 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance is $1,180,000,000 to $1,230,000,000 versus the previous $1,110,000,000 to $1,160,000,000. The core expense guidance is unchanged, but we are updating it to include the impact of closed Chi-X Canada and Marketwired as well as Boardvantage acquisition, which we expect to close in the next week, which we collectively are expect to add $70 million of expense in 2016, including $5 million that was already included in the first quarter this year. The expense guidance does not include the impact of our pending acquisition of ISE, but we look forward to updating you on its impact after it has closed.
Non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter increased 6% on an organic basis and 8% in total. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 48%, up from 46% in the prior year period and primarily reflecting the margin improvement of our Market Service business. Net interest expense was $27 million in the first quarter, unchanged from the prior year period. Other nonoperating income came to $3 million in the first quarter. This income primarily represents our portion of income and losses from certain investment interests, such as our equity interest in OCC, EuroCCP and TOM. Going forward, including the pickup from the incremental equity in OCC that will occur when we close ISE, we expect other operating income to range between $1 million to $2 million per quarter for the foreseeable future. Non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33.5% and was within our guidance. Non-GAAP net income was a record of $153 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared to $138 million or $0.80 per diluted share in the first quarter 2015.
Now moving on to cash flow and capital. Please turn to Slide 13. During the quarter, we repurchased 29 million in stock. And through dividends, we -- and repurchases, we returned $70 million in capital to the shareholders. Additionally, during the quarter, we announced a 28% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.32. And Nasdaq Board of Directors authorized an additional $370 million in share repurchase, bringing the total remaining value authorized to $500 million. This authorization is expected to be used primarily to offset share issuance, such as employee share-based equity plans, and as such, we expect its utilization to be over a multiyear period. 
Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it -- call back over to Bob."

And it's a strange and curious situation where the 2 listing exchange is not part of that committee, and I think that, in some very significant way, diminishes the authority of the committee, even though it doesn't have an official position. So we'll digest what they said, and then we'll comment either through the official period or depending what makes it through or we'll comment now. So we're working with it. So with respect to the access fee, as you know and you referenced, we tried that. We tried that by ourselves, and clearly, it has to be a coordinated effort by the industry.

First, I want to thank those of you that attended our recent Investor Day. I hope you found it beneficial in your understanding of our mission and our strategy. 
Among the themes we highlighted during this day was we are an applied technology company at our core, our spirit of innovation and how that lays the foundation for our growth, our resiliency for both our customers and for our shareholders and our drive to generate attractive returns for our shareholders. I'll update everyone on how this quarter reinforces those themes later in my remarks.
Regarding generating attractive results for shareholders, we're also clearly detailed -- we have also clearly detailed the opportunity we have to consistently deliver strong returns. So in keeping with that theme, I can't think of a more compelling way to start than in the context of record quarter results we delivered and how it indicates how our model is performing.
In the first quarter of 2016, on a non-GAAP basis compared to the prior year, organic net revenue growth was a solid 4%. Our operating income grew 8% due in large part to a strong operating leverage. And then largely due to the impact of capital deployment over the last year, our diluted EPS grew to a more impressive 14%. Adding in the dividend, which we recently announced had been raised and an approximate 2% yield, the total shareholder return, assuming constant valuation, was around 16%. 
Now we certainly know the stars have always aligned every quarter, but we do know our strong organic growth prospects, our operating leverage and our discipline around capital positions us to deliver strong returns for shareholders. Non-GAAP diluted EPS reached an all-time high of $0.91, and non-GAAP operating income and net income, both records, at $254 million and $153 million, respectively.
During Investor Day, we also said that at Nasdaq, our fundamental mission, first and foremost, is to serve our customers. We accomplish this through intensive engagement and feedback loop with these customers. We see our success based on the 4 core principles: applied technology, growth, innovation and resiliency. When we do all these well, it will translate into a very positive total shareholder return, and that is our focus. So with that in mind, I'm going to organize my remarks today around these 4 principles as they relate to our performance this quarter. 
The first principle I'll discuss is growth. Here, we're focused on 2 key areas, organic growth and expansion through acquisitions that are strategically compelling and meet our strict financial criteria on returns and accretion. When you look at the Nasdaq value proposition, we know our clients face increasingly complex challenges, and as a result, everything we do is laser focused to ensure we are listening to them and executing to better meet their needs. 
Clearly, a good example of this intense focus is our Market Services business. We saw a strong organic growth, 6% as compared to the prior year quarter. Our Cash Equities business saw organic growth of 17% on a higher volumes and capture while we also closed the acquisition of Chi-X Canada, which provides Nasdaq access to a healthy adjacent market and expands our equities footprint in North America.
Our laser focus on the soundness and efficiency of our market plays a significant factor in our ability to capture higher share during times of volatility, and this is certainly what we experienced in the first quarter. We look forward to seeing how far new concepts, like dynamic pricing, can take things to further improve the quality of our markets in those critical times.
Turning to our Listing Services. Despite a rough start to the year for the broader IPO market, this business still delivered its second best quarter ever in terms of revenue, driven by a strong year-on-year increase in the number of listed companies. Overall, Nasdaq's U.S. win rate continues to be a very strong 76% market share of all IPOs and 278 new listings during the last 12 months. We won 10 of 10 IPOs in the first quarter. So certainly why 10 -- while 10 is not a good number, 10 out of 10, we have to be proud of. This increasing competitive effectiveness should benefit us as we move past a volatile start to 2016 and have better prospects of seeing more IPOs come out of a still healthy backlog of filed issuers.  
IPO activity on our Nordic markets has been quite remarkable. During the quarter, Nasdaq welcomed 14 new Nordic listings, a near record quarter. 
Beyond IPO activity, we've seen $122 billion in market value switched to our market in the last 12 months with category leaders, such as Willis Towers Watson, Scripps Networks Interactive, CSX, TD Ameritrade and T-Mobile.
We're also seeing a very strong performance in ETP listings. Year-to-date, Nasdaq won 43 new ETPs or switches, including 25 in the first quarter alone, clearly, the most by any U.S. exchange. Our total ETP listings at Nasdaq were 241 at the end of the quarter, up 36% versus the same period a year ago. The second quarter is also off to a fast start with 18 additional new listings. 
Clearly, these are big wins for us and certainly this is further indication of the value proposition this franchise offers in the marketplace. We're the only U.S. provider of a complete life cycle solution to the ETP industry, ranging from product development and index creation to launch, listing and trading of the ETP.
I've said several times over recent periods, but I think it bears repeating again this quarter, the foundation of Nasdaq's very diversified product offering at Nasdaq, is our equity trading and listings business. So it's very encouraging to see it performing so effectively with results at multiyear highs as well as maximizing opportunities for other businesses across our broader franchise, such as in derivatives, data and connectivity.
A great example of a business that is leveraging that foundation to succeed in terms of organic growth is our Information Services business, where we saw record revenues and solid year-on-year growth, not only in Data Products, but also in Index. And despite the first quarter's pullback in average market levels, as our first quarter '15 acquisition of Dorsey, Wright, they enjoyed significant organic growth post close.
Now in addition to some of the positive organic growth trends I just shared, another fundamental prong in our growth strategy is strategic acquisitions. During the quarter, we announced or closed 4 new acquisitions, which we're quite pleased about, most importantly, because they are all in our previously committed strategic direction, they are leveraging our areas of expertise, they will build upon the business -- businesses we're already successful and well established in.
Repeating the disclosures made at Investor Day, we said these acquisitions are each expected to generate attractive returns and generate EPS accretion within 12 months of closing and, together, would have driven an 11% increase in our non-GAAP diluted EPS based on 2015 results, assuming full synergy realization. We are confident these acquisitions will also drive meaningful growth opportunities and deliver even larger impact in the years to come.
In the Market Services segment, we closed the acquisition of Chi-X Canada, the #2 player in the Canadian equity space in early February. We are currently working on further expanding this offering, incorporating our technology and added capabilities, which will benefit the Canadian market.
The acquisition of ISE will provide us with the opportunity to broaden our U.S. options offering, in particular, gaining new capability through ISE's leadership in complex options trading and provide new opportunities to innovate and bring greater value to our clients.
Last week, we were informed by the DOJ that the ISE transaction's HSR review has been successfully completed, and we will work with the SEC towards obtaining their approval for this transaction. Contingent on receiving regulatory approval, this transaction could close as early as the end of the second quarter. Our original estimate was in the second half of the year.
In our Corporate Solutions business, we announced 2 acquisitions: Marketwired and Boardvantage. These acquisitions will enable us to extend our corporate client customer base and increase our exposure to some of the highest margin and fastest-growing segments in our Corporate Solutions business.
With respect to Marketwired, which closed in late February, we are now working through the integration of the systems, technology and talent with the goal of a single new platform for news distribution and analytical information.
With respect to Boardvantage, we received notice yesterday that the HSR review has also been successfully completed, and we anticipate closing in the coming week. We look forward to strengthening our position as a leading provider of board and collaboration tools.
As I mentioned earlier, technology is core to what we do here. It is core to the way we apply everything in our businesses and we do that across products and solutions with a singular focus to benefit our clients. Let me give you a few examples of this. 
With NASDAQ Private Market, we are on a mission to bring increased liquidity and other advantages from the public market to the private market space. Our efforts continue to resonate with private companies, and at the end of the quarter, NPM now has 122 private companies using our software products for employee shareholder liquidity and equity cap table administration. This compares to 46 in the prior year period. We continue to enhance this platform in new and innovative ways to reduce the administrative complexities and costs private companies face today.
This success follows last quarter's successful execution of the first blockchain-enabled transaction in the private space. This enable participants to reach settlement in minutes compared to the industry's -- the public companies industry current standards, which is measured in days. 
We are doing incredibly exciting things in the private market space today. But most importantly, we are only beginning to scratch the surface in terms of the level of innovation and capabilities we can, in fact, deliver for private companies.
In our Corporate Solutions business, which serves issuers both public and private, we successfully launched our next-generation IR Insight platform in the first weeks of January. And through the first 3 months of this launch, we migrated 750 clients and over 1,200 users. That's truly impressive. We also received much feedback from the early adopters, most of it overwhelmingly positive, but this feedback loop is also helping us to develop and quickly deploy innovative new features. We expect to complete the transition of the remaining 2,500 clients within the next 6 months and sunset the legacy T1 platform on schedule during the fourth quarter of this year. 
We've added also new customers through cross-selling our existing base and winning competitive situations. In addition, we're seeing IR Insight and the integration of platform offers serve us as an opportunity to deepen relationships with customers by cross-selling other products in advisory and communication segments. While still early days, we see clear examples of how elevating the bar in terms of technology and product design will be key to bringing sustained organic growth to Corporate Solutions in the periods to come.
Moving on to our Market Technology business. We're also leveraging the trends for applied technology to increase the capabilities to utilize blockchain technologies to evolve our post-trade operations as we continue to enjoy near-record highs in our signed contract backlog. 
SMARTS, our leading solution in the surveillance space, is a good example of the success we've had in evolving a product over time, to increase the value for our clients. In fact, we had a record quarter in terms of SMARTS' new order intake, and this is really a strong growth story for us as our clients are turning to us more and more to help them manage the complexities of the new regulatory environment.
We're also currently exploring the application of technology, such as machine intelligence, which we expect to open up a host of new opportunities and capabilities for advanced compliance and surveillance that will detect fraud more quickly and in more asset classes. We're also currently exploring a number of proofs of concept in our lab that looks to harness the predictive capabilities machine intelligence offers to enhance our Listing, our Trading, our Index and our Data Product areas. To ensure we are positioned to take advantage of these opportunities, we are making investments and also we partnered with Digital Reasoning, one of the thought leaders in this space.
Our use of applied technology is really only one half of the equation. It is what we do with this technology to deliver on our client's need that is most important and, in many respects, where true innovation takes place. 
NFX, our energy derivatives market, is a good example of our focus on new concepts and a better way to serve our clients. Now in its ninth month of operation, we are extremely encouraged by the volume and open interest progress we are seeing. During the April trading, volume passed a significant milestone, moving above 100,000 contracts per day, on average, while open interest also continued to set new records. And we went above 800,000 contracts, just this week, and we now make up about 40% of the futures open interest at OCC. 
We are seeing a growing number of firms use our NFX service, and during the first quarter, more than 70 companies managed their trading and hedging needs on NFX. On May 1, we will implement our new fee program for NFX. We are committed to provide the market with transaction costs that are 50% lower than the incumbent. These fees will be introduced in a phased manner. May 1 is the first phase of that program.
When we think about resiliency at Nasdaq, we, of course, think about our technology and the systems and how reliably they serve our customers. But we also think more broadly than that in how we run this organization. Central to this business model, our business model is a diverse mix of subscription and recurring revenue. Almost 3 quarters of our current revenue is subscription and recurring. 
We're also continuing our maniacal focus on optimizing efficiency and margins on a product by product basis even while investing materially to grow each franchise, and this is evidence in the significant increase in our profitability year-over-year. In fact, our 48% non-GAAP operating margin matches a multiyear high. 
Together, these give us an exceptional amount of visibility and stability in our growth path, which, combined with our organic growth opportunity, significant operating leverage and disciplined deployment and return to capital, has us on a great path to deliver strong shareholder return, both in terms of combined earnings, growth and dividend yield. It also continues a successful story that can -- we can continue investing and innovating on behalf of our customers as well as nourishing the seeds of tomorrow's growth.
In closing, it was another tremendous quarter for this franchise. The examples I've outlined here today clearly demonstrate this franchise's focus on the innovative use of technology. Growth and resiliency is not only increasing the amount of client opportunities for us, but it does manifest itself in the results we deliver to our shareholders. What is most exciting for me is that when we look across all our businesses we're in, there are perhaps more quality opportunities in front of us today than during any other time during my tenure. We certainly feel very good about our ability to execute on these behind the resilient business model we have built. 
We alluded to strong value creation during Investor Day, and I think this quarter is clearly an indication that we're on the right path to achieve this and look forward to exceeding expectations for our clients and our shareholders in the quarters to come. 
I'll now turn the call over to Ron."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. My commentary will focus on non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com.
I will start by reviewing first quarter revenue performance relative to the prior year quarter, as shown on Page 3 of the presentation. The 5% or $27 million increase in reported net revenue of $534 million consisted of organic growth in Market Services net revenue of $12 million or 6%, resulting principally from higher Cash Equity and Access revenues. Organic growth in non-trading Information Services, Technology Solutions and Listing Services segments totaled $7 million or 2% due to the growth in Listings and Information Services. In addition, it was a -- there was $10 million in revenue from recently completed acquisitions of Marketwired, Chi-X Canada plus one additional month in the first quarter of 2016 from DWA while year-over-year change in FX rates reduced revenue by $2 million.
I am now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. Information Services, on Page 5, saw a $5 million or 4% organic increase, plus a $4 million increase related to DWA and Chi-X Canada acquisitions, reduced by a $1 million FX impact. Market Data revenue saw a $4 million or 4% organic increase, reflecting revenue growth in index, data and proprietary products. Index Licensing and Services saw a $1 million or 4% organic increase, reflecting growth in DWA. 
Technology Solutions, shown on Page 6, saw a $4 million or 3% increase in revenue, including $4 million contribution from the acquisition of Marketwired. The operating margin was 12%, up from 11% in the prior year period. We continue to have confidence in reaching our medium-term objective and expect further progress as we move through 2016. Corporate Solutions saw a $1 million or 1% organic decline as shown in Directors -- as growth in Directors Desk was more than offset by declines in multimedia. Repeating what we said at the recent Investor Day, we continue to believe we are on the path to returning to organic revenue growth in Corporate Solutions, but would expect that in the second half of 2016 at the earliest. Market Technology revenue saw a $1 million or 2% organic increase due to organic growth in surveillance products. New order intake was $22 million in the first quarter, and the period-end backlog finished at $783 million, up 8% year-over-year and near our all-time record of $788 set in -- $788 million set in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Listing Services, on Page 7, saw a $2 million or 3% organic increase in revenues, driven primarily by increase in the number of listed companies. Operating margin of 42% was down from 44% in the prior year period -- prior year quarter.
Market Services, on Page 8, saw a $12 million or 6% organic increase in net revenues, plus a $2 million increase due to the acquisition of Chi-X Canada, reduced by $1 million FX impact. Operating margin increased to 56% from 54% in the prior year period. Equity Derivatives trading and clearing net revenue achieved a 4% organic growth, primarily due to the higher U.S. industry trading volumes and higher U.S. average net capture, partially offset by lower U.S. market share. Cash Equities trading net revenue saw a 17% organic increase due to the higher cash equity and net capture and increased industry volumes, partially offset by modestly lower market share. Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities trading and clearing net revenue saw a 17% organic decline from the prior year, principally due to NFX-related trading incentives and lower U.S. Treasury volumes, partially offset by growth in European fixed income and commodities trading. Access and Broker Services saw a 7% organic revenue increase due to the increase in customer demand for network connectivity.
Turning to Pages 9 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $5 million on an organic basis or 2% increase due to the $6 million -- and $6 million due to DWA, Marketwired and Chi-X Canada acquisitions, partially offset by a $3 million FX impact, resulting in an $8 million or 3% reported increase.
Turning to Slide 11. Our revised 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance is $1,180,000,000 to $1,230,000,000 versus the previous $1,110,000,000 to $1,160,000,000. The core expense guidance is unchanged, but we are updating it to include the impact of closed Chi-X Canada and Marketwired as well as Boardvantage acquisition, which we expect to close in the next week, which we collectively are expect to add $70 million of expense in 2016, including $5 million that was already included in the first quarter this year. The expense guidance does not include the impact of our pending acquisition of ISE, but we look forward to updating you on its impact after it has closed.
Non-GAAP operating income in the first quarter increased 6% on an organic basis and 8% in total. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 48%, up from 46% in the prior year period and primarily reflecting the margin improvement of our Market Service business. Net interest expense was $27 million in the first quarter, unchanged from the prior year period. Other nonoperating income came to $3 million in the first quarter. This income primarily represents our portion of income and losses from certain investment interests, such as our equity interest in OCC, EuroCCP and TOM. Going forward, including the pickup from the incremental equity in OCC that will occur when we close ISE, we expect other operating income to range between $1 million to $2 million per quarter for the foreseeable future. Non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 33.5% and was within our guidance. Non-GAAP net income was a record of $153 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared to $138 million or $0.80 per diluted share in the first quarter 2015.
Now moving on to cash flow and capital. Please turn to Slide 13. During the quarter, we repurchased 29 million in stock. And through dividends, we -- and repurchases, we returned $70 million in capital to the shareholders. Additionally, during the quarter, we announced a 28% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.32. And Nasdaq's Board of Directors authorized an additional $370 million in share repurchase, bringing the total remaining value authorized to $500 million. This authorization is expected to be used primarily to offset share issuance, such as employee share-based equity plans, and as such, we expect its utilization to be over a multiyear period.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review Nasdaq's second quarter 2016 results. Certainly, when you look at our performance this quarter and during the first half of the year, the balance of our business model continues to demonstrate its resiliency. As of -- as I have pointed out to you before, while we are not immune to market forces and significant global events, we are, however, intensely focused on serving our clients and supporting them throughout pivotal moments in their evolution. As a FinTech company, technology has always been the fundamental focus that drives our decisions, and ultimately, enables us to expand and grow our competitive position in the marketplace. 
During the quarter, Nasdaq delivered record revenues of $559 million as well as record non-GAAP operating income of $259 million. We achieved non-GAAP EPS of $0.91, which ties our all-time high and is a second quarter record. It represents a 10% year-on-year increase and underscores our ability to deliver double-digit shareholder returns through EPS growth and dividend yield. 
Clearly, organic revenue growth is one of the key benchmarks by which we judge our progress, and I'm pleased to report that it was positive in all 4 segments. Our non-transaction segments combined delivered a very respectable 4% organic growth in the second quarter versus the prior-year period. The biggest standout was our Technology Solutions segment, which saw organic growth of 6% when compared to the prior-year quarter. Truly outstanding, and this was driven by recent business wins and continued growth in Market Technology, including SMARTS surveillance and revenue recognition of our Bolsa Istanbul contract. 
On top of the organic progress, we also closed 2 important acquisitions during the quarter in ISE and Boardvantage. We are now clearly in execution mode on all 4 acquisitions we completed during this year. We have been and will continue to be maniacally focused on delivering maximum value in each of the -- these deals to our clients and our shareholders. I'm pleased to report we've achieved the first $10 million of synergies in the second quarter. 
When we look at how we are improving our competitive position across this franchise and all the businesses in which we compete, we are doing it in a variety of compelling ways. One, through organic investments and fundamentally disruptive technologies and also organic growth initiatives, as well as expansion through acquisitions that lever our core competencies. I want to talk about our progress this quarter in the context of these 3 core areas of focus and highlight how they continue to drive client opportunities and growth. 
As I mentioned, organic growth reinforces that we are on the right track strategically and in terms of running our business as well. It's also a sound endorsement that we're doing the right things on behalf of our clients. 
In our Market Services segment, we continue to focus on creating one of the most robust multi-asset platforms in the industry for our clients. To this point or perhaps most exciting for us right now is the progress of NFX. We just passed the one-year anniversary since the launch, and we've hit 3 major milestones around that one year mark. First, we had, just this week, our first 5% market share day. Second, we had our 100 firm transact on the platform; and third, we've gone over 1 million contracts in open interest. Operationally, we began a new chapter in the NFX story when we introduced fees in beginning of May. In the 2-month period that followed in May and June, I'm pleased to report that open interest ended 22% higher, while average daily volume was 27% higher. Our market share during the same 2-month period increased by 70 basis points, a 29% improvement. As I said before, pricing is being introduced at modest but meaningful levels in the products that have already seen a meaningful liquidity bill. We will continue to price according to the value we are delivering to our customers. 
In addition, we are already off to a strong start in the second half of the year. This is against the backdrop that featured macro and geopolitical volatility as well as progress we've seen on strategic initiatives, such as our acquisitions, and I'll come back to those a little bit later. Given our momentum, we are in a strong position to defend and improve our competitive position in our Trading businesses, something it has and always will be fundamental to our future. 
In our Listing Services business, organic growth continued to be solid at 3% during the quarter. Overall, Nasdaq remains the new listings global leader in the first half of 2016, with a total of 167 new listings, including 68 IPOs and a 73% win rate in our U.S. market. One standout for us has been the performance in the Nordic markets where we saw 47 new listings in the first half of the year with over EUR 4.2 billion in capital raised. And included in these numbers was the largest IPO of the year globally, the Dong Energy [ph] listing in our Copenhagen market. We also continue to maintain strong exchange listing transfer momentum in the U.S. with 13 companies switched from NYSE in the first half of 2016. They were led by such great companies such as Scripps Networks interactive; tronc, which is formerly Tribune Publishing; OPKO, a leading biotechnology company. Since 2005, over $830 billion in market value has chosen to switch to Nasdaq, including $43 billion in the first 6 months of 2016, truly outstanding. 
Elsewhere, we also continued to improve in ETF listings. Nasdaq added 61 new listings in the first half of the year, including 24 switches, leading the industry with a 39% share of new listings and switches and driving the total number of ETP listed at Nasdaq to 2 77 at midyear, up 57% versus the prior year. 
While still clearly in early stage initiative in terms of revenue, we continue to see strong operational traction in Nasdaq private market. We saw 133 private companies used our platform in the second quarter, more than doubling from 62 in the prior year period. We also are working to expand our offering, the private market opportunities continues to grow. We have new clients coming onboard just recently such as Usero [ph] and Skybox [ph]. During the first half of 2016, the private companies secondary market saw the number of transactions grow by over 20%. The dollar volume rose most significantly 135% year-over-year, again, another outstanding performance. 
As I mentioned before, our Technology Solutions segment saw the most and dynamic growth during the quarter, achieving 6% organic growth. This was driven by Market Technology business, which benefited from continued strong trends in the surveillance post-trade and GRC spaces, but also as revenue recognition starts to reflect more of the recent period's significant business wins. These are just a few of the examples of how our focus on efficiency and serving clients continues to manifest itself in our results and improve our competitive positioning. 
Now as you know, in addition to organic growth, strategic acquisitions are core to our growth strategy and will deliver increased value to our clients. Let me give you a brief update on our progress. As I mentioned, during the quarter, we closed 2 acquisitions, ISE and Boardvantage. With ISE, we closed the transaction at the very end of June, and I'm pleased we're able to do so in such a timely fashion, less than 4 months from announcement and executing on a financing package at lower-than-expected cost. We are intensely focused on leveraging our platforms to provide new capabilities and functionalities to clients of the combined businesses. We are off to a strong start, and since closing the transaction, our combined options market share has remained very close to the 40% level, combining all our franchises together. It's certainly an early sign that the market understands and is responding positively to our client discussions and how the combination will deliver great value and opportunity. 
Upon closing the transaction, we have already realized approximately $8 million in annualized run rate synergies, a first step against the total $40 million synergy opportunity. And I'm pleased to report that the transaction is immediately accretive to non-GAAP earnings, very similar to Philex, remember, Ron, back in the day. Of course, we are targeting much higher synergies as we continue integrating our technology assets and teams and migrating to our core trading platform. I'm looking forward to updating you on that progress as well as our progress in integrating and migrating on Nasdaq CXC business onto our core trading platform in the quarters to come. 
In our Corporate Solutions business, we closed Boardvantage in May and are well underway with the integration and our focus to provide one of the most robust set of boarding [ph] collaboration tools in the marketplace today. Taking the Boardvantage acquisition together for the first quarter's close on the Marketwired acquisition, our expanded footprint in PR distribution and governance space gives our Corporate Solutions business a heavier mix for what we believe are the higher growth, higher margin and more scalable businesses as well as material cost synergy opportunity. We achieved $2 million in run rate synergies in the second quarter versus a targeted $20 million opportunity within 18 months of closing. Perhaps, even more importantly, as we work more broadly to return Corporate Solutions to positive organic growth, the 2 deals bring approximately 7,500 new corporate clients to expand our relationships and drive new cross-selling opportunities across this franchise. 
In summary, during the first half of the year, we closed 4 acquisitions on or ahead of schedule at significantly better-than-expected financing costs. Based on that, as well as our increased confidence in revenue trends and synergies, we feel comfortable raising the 2015 diluted EPS accretion number to $0.40 per share from the prior $0.37 we provided during our March Investor Day. The $0.40 accretion assumes 2015 pro forma results with full synergy realization. Certainly, very good progress so far. 
As a financial technology company, our ability to see around corners and apply technology in new and innovative ways for clients is fundamental to our success and the future of the franchise. I want to briefly highlight our ongoing progress during the quarter. 
In May, at our semiannual future of technology conference for Market Technology customers in Stockholm, with the largest customer attendance ever, we announced a significant step in the evolution of how we will deliver technology to our clients and our internal systems as well. The Nasdaq Financial Framework is a result of listening to our clients and the result of the significant R&D efforts. It truly transforms our offering into a more modular approach that will enable more flexibility in the way our clients use our solutions. The heart of the framework will be an open and high-speed communication operations and resiliency layer that will allow us to more effectively introduce new functionality, including blockchain capabilities across the entire trade life cycle for clients. It's early days yet, but we're excited about the potential this innovation will bring to capital markets as we begin to roll it out later this fall, and the interesting conversation levels with current and potential customers has been remarkable. 
Likewise, in our Corporate Solutions business, we continue to accelerate the rate of innovation and new solutions we're putting onto the platform. For example, we continue to enhance IR Insights even as we dedicate significant resources to the migration of thousands of users onto the platform. In June, we announced the addition to the platform of IR Analytics, which will provide clients with dynamic and rich data dashboards to help them analyze large amounts of data from multiple sources and make better decisions about how they allocate finite valuable resources to pursue their objectives. 
In addition, we also introduced Nasdaq Influences to our PR release and communications suite, where we are empowering communications and marketing clients around the world to tap into an increasingly important network of thought leaders. These are just a few examples of the types of ongoing innovation occurring at Nasdaq. In addition to proofs of concepts, we continue to develop to better leverage new technologies, like machine learning and blockchain to improve our clients workflow and alleviate business complexities. 
In closing, I am proud of the team and the results we delivered this quarter. It is certainly indicative of our strong ability to execute against a variety of backdrops while continuing to meet our clients need. Perhaps though, what's most exciting for me is the level and intensity of innovation occurring throughout this organization. As I've stated before, I do not judge our business on backward looking financial results, but forward-looking measures of -- such as how we're meeting our clients' needs and how is our relative competitiveness. In both of these important measures, it has been a most outstanding quarter. We look forward to the second half of the year and hope to execute just as strong for both our clients and shareholders as we did for the first half of the year. 
Before I turn the call over to Ron Hassen, I want to introduce everyone to our new Chief Financial Officer, Michael Ptasznik. We are very excited to have you join the team, with over 20 years of experience, we certainly look forward to working with him and benefiting from his extensive experience in both the financial and operational sides. This is a particularly busy time in our company's evolution. We know Michael is a great asset for the team, and you will enjoy getting to know him and working with him. Welcome, Michael. 
I also wanted thank Ron for his dedication and guiding us through this transition, as well as working and serving as our Corporate Controller over my entire tenure at Nasdaq. His contributions have been immeasurable. He will be missed. 
Now, I turn the call over to Ron Hassen one last time to review the financial details."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. my commentary will focus on non-GAAP results. Later, in my prepared remarks, I will discuss the [indiscernible] differences between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing the second quarter revenue performance relative to prior-year quarter, as shown on Page 4 of the presentation. 
The 8% or $41 million increase in reported net revenue of $559 million consisted of organic growth in Market Services net revenues of $1 million or 1% resulting principally from higher access fees or revenues. Organic growth in non-trading Information Services, Technology Solutions and Listing Service segments totaled $13 million or 4%. In addition, there was a $24 million in revenues from our recently completed acquisitions of Marketwired, Boardvantage and Nasdaq CXC. Year-over-year, changes in FX rates increased revenues by $3 million. 
I am now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments, all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. 
Information Services on Page 6 saw a $3 million organic growth, a $2 million increase related to Nasdaq's CXC acquisition and a $1 million increase due to the positive impact of foreign exchange. Data Product revenues increased 8%, including organic growth and consolidated proprietary Data Products revenues as well as growth in audit collections. Index licensing and services saw a $2 million decline due to lower average assets under management in the period, which was primarily due to declines in market values. 
Technology Solutions, as shown on Page 7, increased $28 million, reflecting a $19 [ph] million contribution from the acquisitions of Boardvantage and Marketwired, $8 million was 6% organic increase. The non-GAAP operating margin was 18%, up from 14% in the prior year period. We continue to have confidence in reaching our medium-term objective of 20% and expect further year-over-year progress as we move forward. 
Corporate Solutions revenue increased due to the impact of -- I'm sorry, Corporate Solutions revenue increased due to the impact of the 2 acquisitions. We continue to believe we are on a path to return to organic revenue growth in Corporate Solutions in the coming quarters. 
Market Technology's revenues increased by $10 million or 17%, primarily due to increased revenues from licensing and support contracts, change request and surveillance products. New order intake was $69 million in the second quarter and the period -- and at the period end, backlog finished at $769 million, up 9% year-over-year. 
Listing Services, which is on Page 8, saw a $2 million or 3% organic increase in revenues, driven primarily by increased in the number of listings. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 43% was down from 44% in the prior year quarter. 
Market Services, which is on Page 9, saw a $1 million or 1% organic increase in net revenues plus a $3 million increase due to the acquisition of Nasdaq CXC and a $1 million positive impact from foreign exchange. Non-GAAP operating income increased to 54% from 53% in the prior period. 
Equity derivatives Trading and clearing net revenues increased 5%, primarily due to the higher U.S. industry trading volume and market share. Cash equities net revenue increased 2% due to the higher industry U.S. volumes and the inclusion of revenue from Nasdaq CXC, partially offset by lower market share in both the U.S. and European markets and lower capture rate in the U.S. 
Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Trading and Clearing net revenues decreased by 13% from the prior year, principally due to the impact of NFX-related trading incentives and a lower U.S. treasury revenues, partially offset by growth in European fixed income and commodity trading. 
Access and broker services revenue increased by 8% due to an increasing customer demand across most product areas. 
Before we turn to expense trends, I would like to take a moment and give some detail around the non-GAAP adjustments this quarter. First, we had a $33 million restructuring charges related to the completion of the restructuring program that began in the first quarter of 2015. The total cost of restructuring program was $214 million, which included $119 million related to the writeoff of the OMX tradename. Excluding the writeoff of the tradename, the restructuring cost was $95 million. The estimated annual savings associated with these costs are $36 million, which will result in a 3-year recovery. 
Second, we had $35 million in charters related to the acquisition and integration activities, substantially all of this related to the ISE acquisition. 
Third, during the quarter, we received an unfavorable tax ruling, which resulted in a $27 million charge on our tax line. 
Turning to Page 10 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $19 million. The increase included $15 million due to our acquisitions and $4 million in organic growth. 
Turning to Slide 12. Our revised 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance has increased by $35 million from the prior guidance to reflect the expected impact of the acquisition of ISE. 
Non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter increased 4% on an organic basis and 9% in total. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 46%, up 50 basis points from the prior year period. Net interest expense was $31 million in the second quarter, an increase of $5 million versus the prior year period, reflecting the additional interest expense from our recent bond offering. Non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2016 was 33.8%, within our unchanged 33% to 35% full year guidance. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $153 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared to $143 million or $0.83 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015. 
Moving onto cash flow and capital. Please turn to Slide 15. We repurchased $16 million in stock during the quarter -- during the second quarter of 2016. We purchased an additional $8 million in the first few days of July of 2016. Through dividends and repurchases, Nasdaq returned nearly $70 million in capital to shareholders during the second quarter of 2016. 
As of July 26, there is $476 million remaining on the board repurchase authorization plan. 
Now as many of you know that the time I served as Interim CFO coincided with my planned retirement from Nasdaq after serving 14 wonderful years as the Corporate Controller. And so I am probably even more excited about Mr. Ptasznik arrival as the new CFO than the rest of the team. In addition, to welcome Michael, I want to thank Bob, Adena, Hans OLE and the rest of the Nasdaq management team and the board for the opportunity to serve as the Interim CFO. ""to the analysts and the investors I met during this period, it was truly a pleasure talking to you about Nasdaq, a company that is positioned and well to move forward to tackle its unique opportunities. Thank you for your time, and I'm turning it over to Bob."

I think that the second thing was the CRs, and those tend to be ebb and flow quarter-over-quarter there's seasonality to that. It's based on change request that our clients ask for. We got off to somewhat of a slow start to the year, but the second quarter was a great quarter for us in terms of the CR revenue. And we do tend to see that happen in both the second and the fourth quarter tend to be our strongest quarters there. And then lastly on SMARTS, you're right that the SMARTS trade system is SaaS-based model, so we have about a $2 million impact there, and that will be an ongoing uplift that we can enjoy going forward as we continue to sell more of that service throughout the clients. So we're very excited about how market tech continues to progress."

On the other side, you have to recognize that blockchain by itself and I'd tie it back to what Larry Ellison said back in the dot.com days is, that's a feature, it's not a company. So blockchain is another method of storing data, and it needs to be integrated into solutions that fit within the construct of the ecosystem we live in. And what we announced at the technology of the future conference, which I referenced in my prepared remarks, is a pure recognition of that. So we're putting the blockchain as a key part, a central part of the Nasdaq Financial Framework. But by itself, it doesn't do anything. So I think the integration, the deep integration of blockchain into core technologies is fundamental, and we're on that mission. So we see this as a major opportunity, but we think just somebody out there trying to sell blockchain technology is not going to get that far. It has to get integrated into what happens today."

And then if we turn it over to Corporate Solutions, Corporate Solutions continues to have a variety, frankly, of sales environments in it because it's a wide range of products. But in terms of the need for, for instance, portal technology and more intelligent peer distribution and intelligent solutions, that continues to be an area of very good growth for us in terms of the Investor Relations product, I would say depends it on the sectors.

So just wondering what you think about that kind of initiative. It seems like it would actually impact a lot of that market, if they really include all the different symbols. And some of the folks we've talked, meet think this can actually be a pretty big negative for volumes down the line. So any thoughts, any discussions you've had from your end will be helpful."

It's the core of what we do, we're paying a lot of attention to it. So as we get larger and do different things, it's important to recognize, we will not do that unless we execute quite successfully in all our chosen businesses, and cash equities is really first among equals. So with respect to what's happening, as you recollect, we attempted of our own accord to do a basic access fee pilot. And we picked certain stocks, and we thought this was a good thing to do, because when you think about the passage of Reg NMS and the $0.30 was pegged as the limit for access fee, that may or may not have been the right number at that point in time, but it cannot be the right number a decade later. And we have a belief that, that number is too high, so we are in full support of the commission moving forward with that. On the other side of the equation, we believe in rebates. We believe in the maker-taker model, but we also do not believe that the maker fee should be so high that it creates activity in and of itself. It should be there to provide incentive for somebody to reveal their hand first. So to the extent we shrink the access fee and the maker rebate declines, I think that could be a good thing for the market. So first and foremost, we believe that high-quality markets are good for Nasdaq and good for us and we fully support what hopefully will happen in a faster pace with the commission. And we certainly think that, as I said before, if the market quality is better, then an organization like Nasdaq is better served."

I would say that probably high single-digits, low double digits is kind of the type of growth rate we've seen in these products and what Boardvantage and directors have been experiencing. So we definitely continue to see companies moving away from paper towards electronic solutions and realizing how critical it is to have a very, very highly secured solution because of the sensitivity of the information that they're sharing either across the management team or with the Board, and that has continue to drive rate demand, both in private companies and public companies for these types of services."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review Nasdaq's second quarter 2016 results.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review Nasdaq's second quarter 2016 results. Certainly, when you look at our performance this quarter and during the first half of the year, the balance of our business model continues to demonstrate its resiliency. As of -- as I have pointed out to you before, while we are not immune to market forces and significant global events, we are, however, intensely focused on serving our clients and supporting them throughout pivotal moments in their evolution. As a FinTech company, technology has always been the fundamental focus that drives our decisions, and ultimately, enables us to expand and grow our competitive position in the marketplace. 
During the quarter, Nasdaq delivered record revenues of $559 million as well as record non-GAAP operating income of $259 million. We achieved non-GAAP EPS of $0.91, which ties our all-time high and is a second quarter record. It represents a 10% year-on-year increase and underscores our ability to deliver double-digit shareholder returns through EPS growth and dividend yield. 
Clearly, organic revenue growth is one of the key benchmarks by which we judge our progress, and I'm pleased to report that it was positive in all 4 segments. Our non-transaction segments combined delivered a very respectable 4% organic growth in the second quarter versus the prior-year period. The biggest standout was in our Technology Solutions segment, which saw organic growth of 6% when compared to the prior-year quarter. Truly outstanding, and this was driven by recent business wins and continued growth in Market Technology, including SMARTS surveillance and revenue recognition of our Borsa Istanbul contract. 
On top of the organic progress, we also closed 2 important acquisitions during the quarter in ISE and Boardvantage. We are now clearly in execution mode on all 4 acquisitions we completed during this year. We have been, and will continue to be, maniacally focused on delivering maximum value in each of the -- these deals to our clients and our shareholders. I'm pleased to report we've achieved the first $10 million of synergies in the second quarter. 
When we look at how we are improving our competitive position across this franchise in all the businesses in which we compete, we are doing it in a variety of compelling ways. One, through organic investments in fundamentally disruptive technologies and also organic growth initiatives, as well as expansion through acquisitions that lever our core competencies. I want to talk about our progress this quarter in the context of these 3 core areas of focus and highlight how they continue to drive client opportunities and growth. 
As I mentioned, organic growth reinforces that we are on the right track strategically, and in terms of running our business as well. It's also a sound endorsement that we're doing the right things on behalf of our clients. 
In our Market Services segment, we continue to focus on creating one of the most robust multi-asset platforms in the industry for our clients. To this point or perhaps most exciting for us right now is the progress of NFX. We just passed the one-year anniversary since the launch, and we've hit 3 major milestones around that one year mark. First, we had, just this week, our first 5% market share day; second, we had our 100th firm transact on the platform; and third, we've gone over 1 million contracts in open interest. Operationally, we began a new chapter in the NFX story when we introduced fees in the beginning of May. In the 2-month period that followed in May and June, I'm pleased to report that open interest ended 22% higher, while average daily volume was 27% higher. Our market share during the same 2-month period increased by 70 basis points, a 29% improvement. As I've said before, pricing is being introduced at modest but meaningful levels in the products that have already seen a meaningful liquidity bill. We will continue to price according to the value we are delivering to our customers. 
In addition, we are already off to a strong start in the second half of the year. This is against the backdrop that featured macro and geopolitical volatility as well as progress we've seen on strategic initiatives, such as our acquisitions, and I'll come back to those a little bit later. Given our momentum, we are in a strong position to defend and improve our competitive position in our Trading businesses, something it has and always will be fundamental to our future. 
In our Listing Services business, organic growth continued to be solid at 3% during the quarter. Overall, Nasdaq remains the new listings global leader in the first half of 2016, with a total of 167 new listings, including 68 IPOs and a 73% win rate in our U.S. market. One standout for us has been the performance in the Nordic markets where we saw 47 new listings in the first half of the year with over EUR 4.2 billion in capital raised. And included in these numbers was the largest IPO of the year globally, the DONG Energy listing on our Copenhagen market. We also continue to maintain strong exchange listing transfer momentum in the U.S., with 13 companies switched from NYSE in the first half of 2016. They were led by such great companies as Scripps Networks interactive; tronc, which is formerly Tribune Publishing; OPKO, a leading biotechnology company. Since 2005, over $830 billion in market value has chosen to switch to Nasdaq, including $43 billion in the first 6 months of 2016, truly outstanding. 
Elsewhere, we also continued to improve in ETF listings. Nasdaq added 61 new listings in the first half of the year, including 24 switches, leading the industry with a 39% share of new listings and switches, and driving the total number of ETP listed at Nasdaq to 277 at midyear, up 57% versus the prior year. 
While still clearly an early stage initiative in terms of revenue, we continue to see strong operational traction in Nasdaq private market. We saw 133 private companies use our platform in the second quarter, more than doubling from 62 in the prior year period. We also are working to expand our offering to private market opportunities as it continues to grow. We have new clients coming onboard just recently such as Usero [ph] and Skybox. During the first half of 2016, the private companies secondary market saw the number of transactions grow by over 20%. The dollar volume rose, most significantly, 135% year-over-year, again, another outstanding performance. 
As I mentioned before, our Technology Solutions segment saw the most dynamic growth during the quarter, achieving 6% organic growth. This was driven by our Market Technology business, which benefited from continued strong trends in the surveillance post-trade and GRC spaces, but also as revenue recognition starts to reflect more of the recent period's significant business wins. These are just a few of the examples of how our focus on efficiency and serving clients continues to manifest itself in our results and improve our competitive positioning. 
Now as you know, in addition to organic growth, strategic acquisitions are core to our growth strategy and will deliver increased value to our clients. Let me give you a brief update on our progress. As I mentioned, during the quarter, we closed 2 acquisitions, ISE and Boardvantage. With ISE, we closed the transaction at the very end of June, and I'm pleased we're able to do so in such a timely fashion, less than 4 months from announcing and executing on a financing package at lower-than-expected cost. We are intensely focused on leveraging our platforms to provide new capabilities and functionalities to clients of the combined businesses. We're off to a strong start, and since closing that transaction, our combined options market share has remained very close to the 40% level, combining all our franchises together. It's certainly an early sign that the market understands and is responding positively to our client discussions and how the combination will deliver greater value and opportunity. 
Upon -- in closing of the transaction, we've already realized approximately $8 million in annualized run rate synergies, a first step against the total $40 million synergy opportunity. And I am pleased to report that the transaction is immediately accretive to non-GAAP earnings, very similar to Philex. Remember, Ron? Back in the day."

I'm looking forward to updating you on that progress as well as our progress in integrating and migrating our Nasdaq CXC business onto our core trading platform in the quarters to come. 
In our Corporate Solutions business, we closed Boardvantage in May and are well underway with the integration and our focus to provide one of the most robust set of boarding collaboration tools in the marketplace today. Taking the Boardvantage acquisition together with the first quarter's close on the Marketwired acquisition, our expanded footprint in PR distribution and governance space gives our Corporate Solutions business a heavier mix in what we believe are the high growth, higher margin and more scalable businesses as well as material cost synergy opportunity. We achieved $2 million in run rate synergies in the second quarter versus a targeted $20 million opportunity within 18 months of closing. Perhaps, even more importantly, as we work more broadly to return Corporate Solutions to positive organic growth, the 2 deals bring approximately 7,500 new corporate clients to expand our relationships and drive new cross-selling opportunities across this franchise. 
In summary, during the first half of the year, we closed 4 acquisitions on or ahead of schedule at significantly better-than-expected financing cost. Based on that, as well as our increased confidence in revenue trends and synergies, we feel comfortable raising the 2015 diluted EPS accretion number to $0.40 per share from the prior $0.37 we provided during our March Investor Day. The $0.40 accretion assumes 2015 pro forma results with full synergy realization. Certainly, very good progress so far. 
As a financial technology company, our ability to see around corners and apply technology in new and innovative ways for clients is fundamental to our success and the future of the franchise. I want to briefly highlight our ongoing progress during the quarter. 
In May, at our semiannual Future of Technology Conference for Market Technology customers in Stockholm, with the largest customer attendance ever, we announced a significant step in the evolution of how we will deliver technology to our clients and our internal systems as well. The Nasdaq Financial Framework is a result of listening to our clients and the result of significant R&D efforts. It truly transforms our offering into a more modular approach that'll enable more flexibility in the way our clients use our solutions. The heart of the framework will be an open and high-speed communication operations and resiliency layer that will allow us to more effectively introduce new functionality, including blockchain capabilities across the entire trade life cycle for clients. It's early days yet, but we are excited about the potential this innovation will bring to capital markets as we begin to roll it out later this fall, and the interesting conversation levels with current and potential customers has been remarkable. 
Likewise, in our Corporate Solutions business, we continue to accelerate the rate of innovation and new solutions we're putting onto the platform. For example, we continue to enhance IR Insight, even as we dedicate significant resources to the migration of thousands of users onto the platform. In June, we announced the addition to the platform of IR Analytics, which will provide clients with dynamic and rich data dashboards to help them analyze large amounts of data from multiple sources and make better decisions about how they allocate finite valuable resources to pursue their objectives. 
In addition, we also introduced Nasdaq Influences to our PR and communication suite, where we are empowering communications and marketing clients around the world to tap into an increasingly important network of thought leaders. These are just a few examples of the types of ongoing innovation occurring at Nasdaq. In addition to proofs of concepts, we continue to develop to better leverage new technologies, like machine learning and blockchain, to improve our client's workflow and alleviate business complexities. 
In closing, I am proud of the team and the results we delivered this quarter. It is certainly indicative of our strong ability to execute against a variety of backdrops while continuing to meet our clients need. Perhaps though, what is most exciting for me is the level and intensity of innovation occurring throughout this organization. As I've stated before, I do not judge our business on backward-looking financial results, but forward-looking measures of -- such as how we're meeting our clients' needs and how is our relative competitiveness. In both of these most important measures, it has been a most outstanding quarter. We look forward to the second half of the year and hope to execute just as strong for both our clients as a -- and shareholders, as we did for the first half of the year. 
Before I turn the call over to Ron Hassen, I want to introduce everyone to our new Chief Financial Officer, Michael Ptasznik. We are very excited to have him join the team. With over 20 years of experience, we certainly look forward to working with him and benefiting from his extensive experience on both the financial and operational sides. This is a particularly busy time in our company's evolution. We know Michael is a great asset for the team, and you will enjoy getting to know him and working with him. Welcome, Michael. 
I also wanted to thank Ron for his dedication and guiding us through this transition, as well as working and serving as our Corporate Controller over my entire tenure at Nasdaq. His contributions have been immeasurable. He will be missed. 
Now, I turn the call over to Ron Hassen, one last time, to review the financial details."

All right, good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. My commentary will focus on our non-GAAP results. Later in my prepared remarks, I will discuss the -- in the periods differences between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com. 
I will start by reviewing the second quarter revenue performance relative to prior-year quarter, as shown on Page 4 of the presentation.  The 8% or $41 million increase in reported net revenue of $559 million consisted of organic growth in Market Services net revenues of $1 million or 1%, resulting principally from higher access fees or revenues. Organic growth in non-trading Information Services, Technology Solutions and Listing Service segments totaled $13 million or 4%. In addition, there was a $24 million in revenues from our recently completed acquisitions of Marketwired, Boardvantage and Nasdaq CXC. Year-over-year, changes in FX rates increased revenues by $3 million. 
I am now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. 
Information Services, on Page 6, saw a $3 million organic growth, a $2 million increase related to Nasdaq CXC acquisition, and a $1 million increase due to the positive impact of foreign exchange. Data Product revenues increased 8%, including organic growth in consolidated and proprietary Data Products revenues as well as a growth in audit collections. Index Licensing and Services saw a $2 million decline due to lower average assets under management in the period, which was primarily due to decline in market values. 
Technology Solutions, as shown on Page 7, increased $28 million, reflecting a $19 million contribution from the acquisitions of Boardvantage and Marketwired, $8 million or 6% organic increase. The non-GAAP operating margin was 18%, up from 14% in the prior year period. We continue to have confidence in reaching our medium-term objective of 20%, and expect further year-over-year progress as we move forward. 
Corporate Solutions revenue increased due to the -- to the impact of -- I'm sorry, Corporate Solutions' revenue increased due to the impact of the 2 acquisitions. We continue to believe we are on a path to return to organic revenue growth in Corporate Solutions in the coming quarters. 
Market Technology's revenues increased by $10 million or 17%, primarily due to increased revenues from licensing and support contracts, change request and surveillance products. New order intake was $69 million in the second quarter and the period -- and at the period end, backlog finished at $769 million, up 9% year-over-year. 
Listing Services, which is on Page 8, saw a $2 million or 3% organic increase in revenues, driven primarily by an increase in the number of listings. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 43% was down from 44% in the prior year quarter. 
Market Services, which is on Page 9, saw a $1 million or 1% organic increase in net revenues plus a $3 million increase due to the acquisition of Nasdaq CXC and a $1 million positive impact from foreign exchange. Non-GAAP operating income increased to 54% from 53% in the -- than the prior year period. 
Equity Derivatives trading and clearing net revenues increased 5%, primarily due to the higher U.S. industry trading volume and market share. Cash equities net revenue increased 2% due to a higher industry U.S. volumes and the inclusion of revenue from Nasdaq CXC, partially offset by lower market share in both the U.S. and European markets and lower capture rate in the U.S. 
Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Trading and Clearing net revenues decreased by 13% from the prior year, principally due to the impact of NFX-related trading incentives and a lower U.S. Treasury revenues, partially offset by growth in European fixed income and commodity trading. 
Access and Broker Services revenue increased by 8% due to an increase in customer demand across most product areas. 
Before we turn in to expense trends, I'd like to take a moment and give some detail around the non-GAAP adjustments this quarter. First, we had a $33 million restructuring charges related to the completion of the restructuring program that began in the first quarter of 2015. The total cost of this, the restructuring program, was $214 million, which included $119 million related to the writeoff of the OMX tradename. Excluding the writeoff of the tradename, the restructuring cost was $95 million. The estimated annual savings associated with these costs are $36 million, which will result in a 3-year recovery. 
Second, we had $35 million in charters related to the acquisition and integration activity, substantially, all of this related to the ISE acquisition. 
Third, during the quarter, we received an unfavorable tax ruling, which resulted in a $27 million charge on our tax line. 
Turning to Page 10 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $19 million. The increase included $15 million due to our acquisitions and $4 million in organic growth. 
Turning to Slide 12. Our revised 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance has increased by $35 million from the prior guidance to reflect the expected impact of the acquisition of ISE. 
Non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter increased 4% on an organic basis and 9% in total. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 46%, up 50 basis points from the prior year period. Net interest expense was $31 million in the second quarter, an increase of $5 million versus the prior year period, reflecting the additional interest expense from our recent bond offering. Non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2016 was 33.8%, within our unchanged 33% to 35% full year guidance. Non-GAAP net income attributed to Nasdaq was $153 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared to $143 million or $0.83 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015. 
Moving on to cash flow and capital. Please turn to Slide 15. We repurchased $16 million in stock during the quarter -- during the second quarter of 2016. We purchased an additional $8 million in the first few days of July of 2016. Through dividends and repurchases, Nasdaq returned nearly $70 million in capital to shareholders during the second quarter of 2016. 
As of July 26, there is $476 million remaining on the board repurchase authorization plan. 
Now as many of you know that the time I served as Interim CFO coincided with my planned retirement from Nasdaq after serving 14 wonderful years as the Corporate Controller. And so I am probably even more excited about Mr. Ptasznik's arrival as the new CFO than the rest of the team. In addition to welcoming Michael, I wanted to thank Bob, Adena, Hans-Ole and the rest of the Nasdaq management team and the board for the opportunity to serve as the Interim CFO. To the analyst and the investors I met during this period, it was truly a pleasure talking to you about Nasdaq, a company that is positioned well to move forward to tackle its unique opportunities.

One, on the optimistic side is, the blockchain will change everything with respect to post-trade across a wide variety of asset classes across the globe. In time, that will happen. On the other side, you have to recognize that blockchain by itself, and I'd tie it back to what Larry Ellison said back in the dot.com days is, that's a feature, it's not a company. So blockchain is another method of storing data, and it needs to be integrated into solutions that fit within the construct of the ecosystem we live in. And what we announced at the Technology of the Future Conference, which I referenced in my prepared remarks, is a pure recognition of that. So we're putting the blockchain as a key part, a central part of the Nasdaq Financial Framework. But by itself, it doesn't do anything. So I think the integration -- the deep integration of blockchain into core technologies is fundamental, and we're on that mission. So we see this as a major opportunity, but we think just somebody out there trying to sell blockchain technology is not going to get that far. It has to get integrated into what happens today."

So I don't think Brexit is going to have an impact on either of those businesses in any meaningful way. And then if we turn it over to Corporate Solutions, Corporate Solutions continues to have a variety, frankly, of sales environments in it because it's a wide range of products. But in terms of the need for, for instance, board portal technology and more intelligent peer distribution and intelligent solutions, that continues to be an area of very good growth for us. In terms of the Investor Relations product, I would say depends it on the sectors. So we continue to see weakness in the energy sector, but strength in some of the biotech and the technology sectors.

So as we get larger and do different things, it's important to recognize, we will not do that unless we execute quite successfully in all of our chosen businesses, and cash equities is really first among equals. So with respect to what's happening, as you recollect, we attempted of our own accord to do a basic access fee pilot. And we picked certain stocks, and we thought this was a good thing to do, because when you think about the passage of Reg NMS and the $0.30 was pegged as the limit for access fee, that may or may not have been the right number at that point in time, but it cannot be the right number a decade later. And we have a belief that, that number is too high, so we are in full support of the commission moving forward with that. On the other side of the equation, we believe in rebates. We believe in the maker-taker model, but we also do not believe that the maker fee should be so high that it creates activity in and of itself. It should be there to provide incentive for somebody to reveal their hand first. So to the extent we shrink the access fee and the maker rebate declines, I think that could be a good thing for the market. So first and foremost, we believe that high-quality markets are good for Nasdaq and good for us, and we fully support what, hopefully, will happen in a faster pace with the commission.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review Nasdaq's second quarter 2016 results.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review Nasdaq's second quarter 2016 results. Certainly, when you look at our performance this quarter and during the first half of the year, the balance of our business model continues to demonstrate its resiliency. As of -- as I have pointed out to you before, while we are not immune to market forces and significant global events, we are, however, intensely focused on serving our clients and supporting them throughout pivotal moments in their evolution. As a FinTech company, technology has always been the fundamental focus that drives our decisions, and ultimately, enables us to expand and grow our competitive position in the marketplace. 
During the quarter, Nasdaq delivered record revenues of $559 million as well as record non-GAAP operating income of $259 million. We achieved non-GAAP EPS of $0.91, which ties our all-time high and is a second quarter record. It represents a 10% year-on-year increase and underscores our ability to deliver double-digit shareholder returns through EPS growth and dividend yield. 
Clearly, organic revenue growth is one of the key benchmarks by which we judge our progress, and I am pleased to report that it was positive in all 4 segments. Our non-transaction segments combined delivered a very respectable 4% organic growth in the second quarter versus the prior year period. The biggest standout was in our Technology Solutions segment, which saw organic growth of 6% when compared to the prior year quarter. Truly outstanding, and this was driven by recent business wins and continued growth in Market Technology, including SMARTS surveillance and revenue recognition of our Borsa Istanbul contract. 
On top of the organic progress, we also closed 2 important acquisitions during the quarter in ISE and Boardvantage. We are now clearly in execution mode on all 4 acquisitions we completed during this year. We have been, and will continue to be, maniacally focused on delivering maximum value in each of the -- these deals to our clients and our shareholders. I'm pleased to report we've achieved the first $10 million of synergies in the second quarter. 
When we look at how we are improving our competitive position across this franchise in all the businesses in which we compete, we are doing it in a variety of compelling ways. One, through organic investments in fundamentally disruptive technologies and also organic growth initiatives, as well as expansion through acquisitions that lever our core competencies. I want to talk about our progress this quarter in the context of these 3 core areas of focus and highlight how they continue to drive client opportunities and growth. 
As I mentioned, organic growth reinforces that we are on the right track strategically, and in terms of running our business as well. It's also a sound endorsement that we're doing the right things on behalf of our clients. 
In our Market Services segment, we continue to focus on creating one of the most robust multi-asset platforms in the industry for our clients. To this point or perhaps most exciting for us right now is the progress of NFX. We just passed the one-year anniversary since the launch, and we've hit 3 major milestones around that one-year mark. First, we had, just this week, our first 5% market share day; second, we had our 100th firm transact on the platform; and third, we've gone over 1 million contracts in open interest. Operationally, we began a new chapter in the NFX story when we introduced fees in the beginning of May. In the 2-month period that followed in May and June, I'm pleased to report that open interest ended 22% higher, while average daily volume was 27% higher. Our market share during the same 2-month period increased by 70 basis points, a 29% improvement. As I've said before, pricing is being introduced at modest but meaningful levels in the products that have already seen a meaningful liquidity bill. We will continue to price according to the value we are delivering to our customers. 
In addition, we are already off to a strong start in the second half of the year. This is against a backdrop that featured macro and geopolitical volatility as well as progress we've seen on strategic initiatives, such as our acquisitions, and I'll come back to those a little bit later. Given our momentum, we are in a strong position to defend and improve our competitive position in our trading businesses, something that has and always will be fundamental to our future. 
In our Listing Services business, organic growth continued to be solid at 3% during the quarter. Overall, Nasdaq remains the new listings global leader in the first half of 2016, with a total of 167 new listings, including 68 IPOs and a 73% win rate in our U.S. market. One standout for us has been the performance in the Nordic markets where we saw 47 new listings in the first half of the year with over EUR 4.2 billion in capital raised. Included in these numbers was the largest IPO of the year globally, the DONG Energy listing on our Copenhagen market. We also continue to maintain strong exchange listing transfer momentum in the U.S. We had 13 companies switch from NYSE in the first half of 2016. They were led by such great companies as Scripps Networks Interactive; tronc, which is formerly Tribune Publishing; OPKO, a leading biotechnology company. Since 2005, over $830 billion in market value has chosen to switch to Nasdaq, including $43 billion in the first 6 months of 2016. Truly outstanding. 
Elsewhere, we also continued to improve in ETF listings. Nasdaq added 61 new listings in the first half of the year, including 24 switches, leading the industry with a 39% share of new listings and switches, and driving the total number of ETP listed at Nasdaq to 277 at midyear, up 57% versus the prior year. 
While still clearly an early stage initiative in terms of revenue, we continue to see strong operational traction in Nasdaq private market. We saw 133 private companies use our platform in the second quarter, more than doubling from 62 in the prior year period. We also are working to expand our offering. The private market opportunity continues to grow. We have new clients coming onboard just recently, such as Usero [ph] and Skybox. During the first half of 2016, the private company secondary market saw the number of transactions grow by over 20%. The dollar volume rose, most significantly, 135% year-over-year. Again, another outstanding performance. 
As I mentioned before, our Technology Solutions segment saw the most dynamic growth during the quarter, achieving 6% organic growth. This was driven by our Market Technology business, which benefited from continued strong trends in the surveillance post-trade and GRC spaces, but also as revenue recognition starts to reflect more of the recent period's significant business wins. These are just a few of the examples of how our focus on efficiency and serving clients continues to manifest itself in our results and improve our competitive positioning. 
Now as you know, in addition to organic growth, strategic acquisitions are core to our growth strategy and will deliver increased value to our clients. Let me give you a brief update on our progress. As I mentioned, during the quarter, we closed 2 acquisitions, ISE and Boardvantage. With ISE, we closed the transaction at the very end of June, and I'm pleased we were able to do so in such a timely fashion, less than 4 months from announcement and executing on a financing package at lower-than-expected cost. We are intensely focused on leveraging our platforms to provide new capabilities and functionalities to clients of the combined businesses. We're off to a strong start, and since closing the transaction, our combined options market share has remained very close to the 40% level, combining all our franchises together. It's certainly an early sign that the market understands and is responding positively to our client discussions and how the combination will deliver greater value and opportunity. 
Upon closing the transaction, we've already realized approximately $8 million in annualized run rate synergies, a first step against the total $40 million synergy opportunity. And I am pleased to report that the transaction is immediately accretive to non-GAAP earnings, very similar to Philly. Remember, Ron? Back in the day."

I'm looking forward to updating you on that progress as well as our progress in integrating and migrating our Nasdaq CXC business onto our core trading platform in the quarters to come. 
In our Corporate Solutions business, we closed Boardvantage in May and are well underway with the integration and our focus to provide one of the most robust set of boarding collaboration tools in the marketplace today. Taking the Boardvantage acquisition together with the first quarter's close on the Marketwired acquisition, our expanded footprint in PR distribution and governance space gives our Corporate Solutions business a heavier mix in what we believe are the higher growth, higher margin and more scalable businesses as well as material cost synergy opportunity. We achieved $2 million in run rate synergies in the second quarter versus a targeted $20 million opportunity within 18 months of closing. Perhaps even more importantly, as we work more broadly to return Corporate Solutions to positive organic growth, the 2 deals bring approximately 7,500 new corporate clients to expand our relationships and drive new cross-selling opportunities across this franchise. 
In summary, during the first half of the year, we closed 4 acquisitions on or ahead of schedule at significantly better-than-expected financing cost. Based on that, as well as our increased confidence in revenue trends and synergies, we feel comfortable raising the 2015 diluted EPS accretion number to $0.40 per share from the prior $0.37 we provided during our March Investor Day. The $0.40 accretion assumes 2015 pro forma results with full synergy realization. Certainly, very good progress so far. 
As a financial technology company, our ability to see around corners and apply technology in new and innovative ways for clients is fundamental to our success and the future of the franchise. I want to briefly highlight our ongoing progress during the quarter. 
In May, at our semiannual Future of Technology Conference for Market Technology customers in Stockholm, with the largest customer attendance ever, we announced a significant step in the evolution of how we will deliver technology to our clients and our internal systems as well. The Nasdaq Financial Framework is a result of listening to our clients and the result of significant R&D efforts. It truly transforms our offering into a more modular approach that will enable more flexibility in the way our clients use our solutions. The heart of the framework will be an open and high-speed communication operations and resiliency layer that will allow us to more effectively introduce new functionality, including blockchain capabilities across the entire trade life cycle for clients. It's early days yet, but we are excited about the potential this innovation will bring to capital markets as we begin to roll it out later this fall, and the interest and conversation levels with current and potential customers has been remarkable. 
Likewise, in our Corporate Solutions business, we continue to accelerate the rate of innovation and new solutions we're putting onto the platform. For example, we continue to enhance IR Insight, even as we dedicate significant resources to the migration of thousands of users onto the platform. In June, we announced the addition to the platform of IR Analytics, which will provide clients with dynamic and rich data dashboards to help them analyze large amounts of data from multiple sources and make better decisions about how they allocate finite valuable resources to pursue their objectives. 
In addition, we also introduced Nasdaq Influencers to our PR and communication suite, where we are empowering communications and marketing clients around the world to tap into an increasingly important network of thought leaders. These are just a few examples of the types of ongoing innovation occurring at Nasdaq. In addition to proofs of concepts, we continue to develop to better leverage new technologies, like machine learning and blockchain to improve our client's workflow and alleviate business complexities. 
In closing, I am proud of the team and the results we delivered this quarter. It is certainly indicative of our strong ability to execute against a variety of backdrops while continuing to meet our clients' needs. Perhaps, though, what is most exciting for me is the level and intensity of innovation occurring throughout this organization. As I've stated before, I do not judge our business on backward-looking financial results, but forward-looking measures of -- such as how are we meeting our clients' needs and how is our relative competitiveness. In both of these most important measures, it has been a most outstanding quarter. We look forward to the second half of the year and hope to execute just as strong for both our clients as a -- and shareholders, as we did for the first half of the year. 
Before I turn the call over to Ron Hassen, I want to introduce everyone to our new Chief Financial Officer, Michael Ptasznik. We are very excited to have him join the team. With over 20 years of experience, we certainly look forward to working with him and benefiting from his extensive experience on both the financial and operational sides. This is a particularly busy time in our company's evolution. We know Michael is a great asset for the team, and you will enjoy getting to know him and working with him. Welcome, Michael. 
I also want to thank Ron for his dedication in guiding us through this transition, as well as working and serving as our Corporate Controller over my entire tenure at Nasdaq. His contributions have been immeasurable. He will be missed. 
Now I turn the call over to Ron Hassen, one last time, to review the financial details."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. My commentary will focus on our non-GAAP results. Later in my prepared remarks, I will discuss the period's differences between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com. 
I will start by reviewing the second quarter revenue performance relative to prior year quarter, as shown on Page 4 of the presentation.  The 8% or $41 million increase in reported net revenue of $559 million consisted of organic growth in Market Services net revenues of $1 million or 1%, resulting principally from higher access fees -- revenues. Organic growth in non-trading Information Services, Technology Solutions and Listing Service segments totaled $13 million or 4%. In addition, there was a $24 million in revenues from our recently completed acquisitions of Marketwired, Boardvantage and Nasdaq CXC. Year-over-year, changes in FX rates increased revenues by $3 million. 
I am now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. 
Information Services, on Page 6, saw a $3 million organic growth, a $2 million increase related to Nasdaq CXC acquisition and a $1 million increase due to the positive impact of foreign exchange. Data Product revenues increased 8%, including organic growth in consolidated and proprietary Data Products revenues as well as a growth in audit collections. Index Licensing and Services saw a $2 million decline due to lower average assets under management in the period, which was primarily due to declines in market values. 
Technology Solutions, as shown on Page 7, increased $28 million, reflecting a $19 million contribution from the acquisitions of Boardvantage and Marketwired, $8 million or 6% organic increase. The non-GAAP operating margin was 18%, up from 14% in the prior year period. We continue to have confidence in reaching our medium-term objective of 20% and expect further year-over-year progress as we move forward. 
Corporate Solutions revenue increased due to the -- to the impact of -- I'm sorry, Corporate Solutions revenue increased due to the impact of the 2 acquisitions. We continue to believe we are on a path to return to organic revenue growth in Corporate Solutions in the coming quarters. 
Market Technology's revenues increased by $10 million or 17%, primarily due to increased revenues from licensing and support contracts, change requests and surveillance products. New order intake was $69 million in the second quarter and period -- at the period end, backlog finished at $769 million, up 9% year-over-year. 
Listing Services, which is on Page 8, saw a $2 million or 3% organic increase in revenues, driven primarily by an increase in the number of listings. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 43% was down from 44% in the prior year quarter. 
Market Services, which is on Page 9, saw a $1 million or 1% organic increase in net revenues, plus a $3 million increase due to the acquisition of Nasdaq CXC and a $1 million positive impact from foreign exchange. Non-GAAP operating income increased to 54% from 53% in the prior period. 
Equity Derivatives trading and clearing net revenues increased 5%, primarily due to the higher U.S. industry trading volume and market share. Cash equities net revenue increased 2% due to a higher industry U.S. volumes and the inclusion of revenue from Nasdaq CXC, partially offset by lower market share in both the U.S. and European markets and lower capture rate in the U.S. 
Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Trading and Clearing net revenues decreased by 13% from the prior year, principally due to the impact of NFX-related trading incentives and a lower U.S. Treasury revenues, partially offset by growth in European fixed income and commodity trading. 
Access and Broker Services revenue increased by 8% due to an increase in customer demand across most product areas. 
Before we turn to expense trends, I'd like to take a moment and give some detail around the non-GAAP adjustments this quarter. First, we had a $33 million restructuring charges related to the completion of the restructuring program that began in the first quarter of 2015. The total cost of the restructuring program was $214 million, which included $119 million related to the write-off of the OMX trade name. Excluding the write-off of the trade name, the restructuring cost was $95 million. The estimated annual savings associated with these costs are $36 million, which would result in a 3-year recovery. 
Second, we had $35 million in charges related to the acquisition and integration activity, substantially all of this related to the ISE acquisition. 
Third, during the quarter, we received an unfavorable tax ruling, which resulted in a $27 million charge on our tax line. 
Turning to Page 10 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $19 million. The increase included $15 million due to our acquisitions and $4 million in organic growth. 
Turning to Slide 12. Our revised 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance has increased by $35 million from the prior guidance to reflect the expected impact of the acquisition of ISE. 
Non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter increased 4% on an organic basis and 9% in total. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 46%, up 50 basis points from the prior year period. Net interest expense was $31 million in the second quarter, an increase of $5 million versus the prior year period, reflecting the additional interest expense from our recent bond offering. Non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2016 was 33.8%, within our unchanged 33% to 35% full year guidance. Non-GAAP net income attributed to Nasdaq was $153 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared to $143 million or $0.83 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015. 
Moving on to cash flow and capital. Please turn to Slide 15. We repurchased $16 million in stock during the quarter -- during the second quarter of 2016. We purchased an additional $8 million in the first few days of July of 2016. Through dividends and repurchases, Nasdaq returned nearly $70 million in capital to shareholders during the second quarter of 2016. 
As of July 26, there is $476 million remaining on the board repurchase authorization plan. 
Now as many of you know that the time I served as Interim CFO coincided with my planned retirement from Nasdaq after serving 14 wonderful years as the Corporate Controller. And so I am probably even more excited about Mr. Ptasznik's arrival as the new CFO than the rest of the team. In addition to welcoming Michael, I wanted to thank Bob, Adena, Hans-Ole and the rest of the Nasdaq management team and the board for the opportunity to serve as the Interim CFO. To the analyst and the investors I met during this period, it was truly a pleasure talking to you about Nasdaq, a company that is positioned well to move forward to tackle its unique opportunities. Thank you for your time, and I'm turning it over to Bob."

It's based on change requests that our clients ask for. We got off to somewhat of a slow start to the year, but the second quarter was a great quarter for us in terms of the CR revenue.

One, on the optimistic side is, the blockchain will change everything with respect to post-trade across a wide variety of asset classes across the globe. In time, that will happen. On the other side, you have to recognize that blockchain by itself, and I'd tie back to what Larry Ellison said back in the dot.com days is, that's a feature. It's not a company. So blockchain is another method of storing data, and it needs to be integrated into solutions that fit within the construct of the ecosystem we live in. And what we announced at the Technology of the Future Conference, which I referenced in my prepared remarks, is a pure recognition of that. So we're putting the blockchain as a key part, a central part of the Nasdaq Financial Framework. But by itself, it doesn't do anything. So I think the integration -- the deep integration of blockchain into core technologies is fundamental, and we're on that mission. So we see this as a major opportunity, but we think just somebody out there trying to sell blockchain technology is not going to get that far. It has to get integrated into what happens today."

We did sign on a new client in the first quarter. We've renewed several contracts. We've upgraded several of our contracts. That's why we had such good order intake in the second quarter. And we continue to see very good opportunity in our core market tech business, in addition to the SMARTS trade system, which, frankly, has tremendous traction, is an award-winning solution and is -- we continue to see a very, very robust pipeline of sales opportunities there. So I don't think Brexit is going to have an impact on either of those businesses in any meaningful way. And then if we turn over to Corporate Solutions, Corporate Solutions continues to have a variety, frankly, of sales environments in it because it's a wide range of products. But in terms of the need for, for instance, board portal technology and more intelligent PR distribution and intelligent solutions, that continues to be an area of very good growth for us. In terms of the Investor Relations products, I would say it depends on the sector. So we continue to see weakness in the energy sector, but strength in some of the biotech and the technology sectors. And again, Brexit doesn't really have any impact on that business either. So I hope that answers your question."

It's the core of what we do and we pay a lot of attention to it. So as we get larger and do different things, it's important to recognize, we will not do that unless we execute quite successfully in all our chosen businesses, and Cash Equities is really first among equals. So with respect to what's happening, as you recollect, we attempted of our own accord to do a basic access fee pilot. And we picked certain stocks, and we thought this was a good thing to do, because when you think about the passage of Reg NMS and the $0.30 was pegged as the limit for access fee, that may or may not have been the right number at that point in time, but it cannot be the right number a decade later. And we have a belief that, that number is too high, so we're in full support of the commission moving forward with that. On the other side of the equation, we believe in rebates. We believe in the maker-taker model, but we also do not believe that the maker fee should be so high that it creates activity in and of itself. It should be there to provide incentive for somebody to reveal their hand first. So to the extent we shrink the access fee and the maker rebate declines, I think that could be a good thing for the market. So first and foremost, we believe that high-quality markets are good for Nasdaq and good for us, and we fully support what, hopefully, will happen in a faster pace with the commission. And we certainly think that, as I said before, if the market quality is better, then an organization like Nasdaq is better served."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review Nasdaq's second quarter 2016 results. Certainly, when you look at our performance this quarter and during the first half of the year, the balance of our business model continues to demonstrate its resiliency. As of -- as I have pointed out to you before, while we are not immune to market forces and significant global events, we are, however, intensely focused on serving our clients and supporting them throughout pivotal moments in their evolution. As a FinTech company, technology has always been the fundamental focus that drives our decisions, and ultimately, enables us to expand and grow our competitive position in the marketplace. 
During the quarter, Nasdaq delivered record revenues of $559 million as well as record non-GAAP operating income of $259 million. We achieved non-GAAP EPS of $0.91, which ties our all-time high and is a second quarter record. It represents a 10% year-on-year increase and underscores our ability to deliver double-digit shareholder returns through EPS growth and dividend yield. 
Clearly, organic revenue growth is one of the key benchmarks by which we judge our progress, and I am pleased to report that it was positive in all 4 segments. Our non-transaction segments combined delivered a very respectable 4% organic growth in the second quarter versus the prior year period. The biggest standout was in our Technology Solutions segment, which saw organic growth of 6% when compared to the prior year quarter. Truly outstanding, and this was driven by recent business wins and continued growth in Market Technology, including SMARTS surveillance and revenue recognition of our Borsa Istanbul contract. 
On top of the organic progress, we also closed 2 important acquisitions during the quarter in ISE and Boardvantage. We are now clearly in execution mode on all 4 acquisitions we completed during this year. We have been, and will continue to be, maniacally focused on delivering maximum value in each of the -- these deals to our clients and our shareholders. I'm pleased to report we've achieved the first $10 million of synergies in the second quarter. 
When we look at how we are improving our competitive position across this franchise in all the businesses in which we compete, we are doing it in a variety of compelling ways. One, through organic investments in fundamentally disruptive technologies and also organic growth initiatives, as well as expansion through acquisitions that lever our core competencies. I want to talk about our progress this quarter in the context of these 3 core areas of focus and highlight how they continue to drive client opportunities and growth. 
As I mentioned, organic growth reinforces that we are on the right track strategically, and in terms of running our business as well. It's also a sound endorsement that we're doing the right things on behalf of our clients. 
In our Market Services segment, we continue to focus on creating one of the most robust multi-asset platforms in the industry for our clients. To this point or perhaps most exciting for us right now is the progress of NFX. We just passed the one-year anniversary since the launch, and we've hit 3 major milestones around that one-year mark. First, we had, just this week, our first 5% market share day; second, we had our 100th firm transact on the platform; and third, we've gone over 1 million contracts in open interest. Operationally, we began a new chapter in the NFX story when we introduced fees in the beginning of May. In the 2-month period that followed in May and June, I'm pleased to report that open interest ended 22% higher, while average daily volume was 27% higher. Our market share during the same 2-month period increased by 70 basis points, a 29% improvement. As I've said before, pricing is being introduced at modest but meaningful levels in the products that have already seen a meaningful liquidity bill. We will continue to price according to the value we are delivering to our customers. 
In addition, we are already off to a strong start in the second half of the year. This is against a backdrop that featured macro and geopolitical volatility as well as progress we've seen on strategic initiatives, such as our acquisitions, and I'll come back to those a little bit later. Given our momentum, we are in a strong position to defend and improve our competitive position in our trading businesses, something that has and always will be fundamental to our future. 
In our Listing Services business, organic growth continued to be solid at 3% during the quarter. Overall, Nasdaq remains the new listings global leader in the first half of 2016, with a total of 167 new listings, including 68 IPOs and a 73% win rate in our U.S. market. One standout for us has been the performance in the Nordic markets where we saw 47 new listings in the first half of the year with over EUR 4.2 billion in capital raised. Included in these numbers was the largest IPO of the year globally, the DONG Energy listing on our Copenhagen market. We also continue to maintain strong exchange listing transfer momentum in the U.S. We had 13 companies switch from NYSE in the first half of 2016. They were led by such great companies as Scripps Networks Interactive; tronc, which is formerly Tribune Publishing; OPKO, a leading biotechnology company. Since 2005, over $830 billion in market value has chosen to switch to Nasdaq, including $43 billion in the first 6 months of 2016. Truly outstanding. 
Elsewhere, we also continued to improve in ETF listings. Nasdaq added 61 new listings in the first half of the year, including 24 switches, leading the industry with a 39% share of new listings and switches, and driving the total number of ETP listed at Nasdaq to 277 at midyear, up 57% versus the prior year. 
While still clearly an early stage initiative in terms of revenue, we continue to see strong operational traction in Nasdaq private market. We saw 133 private companies use our platform in the second quarter, more than doubling from 62 in the prior year period. We also are working to expand our offering. The private market opportunity continues to grow. We have new clients coming onboard just recently, such as Usero [ph] and Skybox. During the first half of 2016, the private company secondary market saw the number of transactions grow by over 20%. The dollar volume rose, most significantly, 135% year-over-year. Again, another outstanding performance. 
As I mentioned before, our Technology Solutions segment saw the most dynamic growth during the quarter, achieving 6% organic growth. This was driven by our Market Technology business, which benefited from continued strong trends in the surveillance post-trade and GRC spaces, but also as revenue recognition starts to reflect more of the recent period's significant business wins. These are just a few of the examples of how our focus on efficiency and serving clients continues to manifest itself in our results and improve our competitive positioning. 
Now as you know, in addition to organic growth, strategic acquisitions are core to our growth strategy and will deliver increased value to our clients. Let me give you a brief update on our progress. As I mentioned, during the quarter, we closed 2 acquisitions, ISE and Boardvantage. With ISE, we closed the transaction at the very end of June, and I'm pleased we were able to do so in such a timely fashion, less than 4 months from announcement and executing on a financing package at lower-than-expected cost. We are intensely focused on leveraging our platforms to provide new capabilities and functionalities to clients of the combined businesses. We're off to a strong start, and since closing the transaction, our combined options market share has remained very close to the 40% level, combining all our franchises together. It's certainly an early sign that the market understands and is responding positively to our client discussions and how the combination will deliver greater value and opportunity. 
Upon closing the transaction, we've already realized approximately $8 million in annualized run rate synergies, a first step against the total $40 million synergy opportunity. And I am pleased to report that the transaction is immediately accretive to non-GAAP earnings, very similar to Philly. Remember, Ron? Back in the day."

I'm looking forward to updating you on that progress as well as our progress in integrating and migrating our Nasdaq CXC business onto our core trading platform in the quarters to come. 
In our Corporate Solutions business, we closed Boardvantage in May and are well underway with the integration and our focus to provide one of the most robust set of boarding collaboration tools in the marketplace today. Taking the Boardvantage acquisition together with the first quarter's close on the Marketwired acquisition, our expanded footprint in PR distribution and governance space gives our Corporate Solutions business a heavier mix in what we believe are the higher growth, higher margin and more scalable businesses as well as material cost synergy opportunity. We achieved $2 million in run rate synergies in the second quarter versus a targeted $20 million opportunity within 18 months of closing. Perhaps even more importantly, as we work more broadly to return Corporate Solutions to positive organic growth, the 2 deals bring approximately 7,500 new corporate clients to expand our relationships and drive new cross-selling opportunities across this franchise. 
In summary, during the first half of the year, we closed 4 acquisitions on or ahead of schedule at significantly better-than-expected financing cost. Based on that, as well as our increased confidence in revenue trends and synergies, we feel comfortable raising the 2015 diluted EPS accretion number to $0.40 per share from the prior $0.37 we provided during our March Investor Day. The $0.40 accretion assumes 2015 pro forma results with full synergy realization. Certainly, very good progress so far. 
As a financial technology company, our ability to see around corners and apply technology in new and innovative ways for clients is fundamental to our success and the future of the franchise. I want to briefly highlight our ongoing progress during the quarter. 
In May, at our semiannual Future of Technology Conference for Market Technology customers in Stockholm, with the largest customer attendance ever, we announced a significant step in the evolution of how we will deliver technology to our clients and our internal systems as well. The Nasdaq Financial Framework is a result of listening to our clients and the result of significant R&D efforts. It truly transforms our offering into a more modular approach that will enable more flexibility in the way our clients use our solutions. The heart of the framework will be an open and high-speed communication operations and resiliency layer that will allow us to more effectively introduce new functionality, including blockchain capabilities across the entire trade life cycle for clients. It's early days yet, but we are excited about the potential this innovation will bring to capital markets as we begin to roll it out later this fall, and the interest and conversation levels with current and potential customers has been remarkable. 
Likewise, in our Corporate Solutions business, we continue to accelerate the rate of innovation and new solutions we're putting onto the platform. For example, we continue to enhance IR Insight, even as we dedicate significant resources to the migration of thousands of users onto the platform. In June, we announced the addition to the platform of IR Analytics, which will provide clients with dynamic and rich data dashboards to help them analyze large amounts of data from multiple sources and make better decisions about how they allocate finite valuable resources to pursue their objectives. 
In addition, we also introduced Nasdaq Influencers to our PR and communication suite, where we are empowering communications and marketing clients around the world to tap into an increasingly important network of thought leaders. These are just a few examples of the types of ongoing innovation occurring at Nasdaq. In addition to proofs of concepts, we continue to develop to better leverage new technologies, like machine learning and blockchain to improve our client's workflow and alleviate business complexities. 
In closing, I am proud of the team and the results we delivered this quarter. It is certainly indicative of our strong ability to execute against a variety of backdrops while continuing to meet our clients' needs. Perhaps, though, what is most exciting for me is the level and intensity of innovation occurring throughout this organization. As I've stated before, I do not judge our business on backward-looking financial results, but forward-looking measures of -- such as how are we meeting our clients' needs and how is our relative competitiveness. In both of these most important measures, it has been a most outstanding quarter. We look forward to the second half of the year and hope to execute just as strong for both our clients as a -- and shareholders, as we did for the first half of the year. 
Before I turn the call over to Ron Hassen, I want to introduce everyone to our new Chief Financial Officer, Michael Ptasznik. We are very excited to have him join the team. With over 20 years of experience, we certainly look forward to working with him and benefiting from his extensive experience on both the financial and operational sides. This is a particularly busy time in our company's evolution. We know Michael is a great asset for the team, and you will enjoy getting to know him and working with him. Welcome, Michael. 
I also want to thank Ron for his dedication in guiding us through this transition, as well as working and serving as our Corporate Controller over my entire tenure at Nasdaq. His contributions have been immeasurable. He will be missed. 
Now I turn the call over to Ron Hassen, one last time, to review the financial details."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. My commentary will focus on our non-GAAP results. Later in my prepared remarks, I will discuss the period's differences between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com. 
I will start by reviewing the second quarter revenue performance relative to prior year quarter, as shown on Page 4 of the presentation.  The 8% or $41 million increase in reported net revenue of $559 million consisted of organic growth in Market Services net revenues of $1 million or 1%, resulting principally from higher access fees -- revenues. Organic growth in non-trading Information Services, Technology Solutions and Listing Service segments totaled $13 million or 4%. In addition, there was a $24 million in revenues from our recently completed acquisitions of Marketwired, Boardvantage and Nasdaq CXC. Year-over-year, changes in FX rates increased revenues by $3 million. 
I am now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. 
Information Services, on Page 6, saw a $3 million organic growth, a $2 million increase related to Nasdaq CXC acquisition and a $1 million increase due to the positive impact of foreign exchange. Data Product revenues increased 8%, including organic growth in consolidated and proprietary Data Products revenues as well as a growth in audit collections. Index Licensing and Services saw a $2 million decline due to lower average assets under management in the period, which was primarily due to declines in market values. 
Technology Solutions, as shown on Page 7, increased $28 million, reflecting a $19 million contribution from the acquisitions of Boardvantage and Marketwired, $8 million or 6% organic increase. The non-GAAP operating margin was 18%, up from 14% in the prior year period. We continue to have confidence in reaching our medium-term objective of 20% and expect further year-over-year progress as we move forward. 
Corporate Solutions revenue increased due to the -- to the impact of -- I'm sorry, Corporate Solutions revenue increased due to the impact of the 2 acquisitions. We continue to believe we are on a path to return to organic revenue growth in Corporate Solutions in the coming quarters. 
Market Technology's revenues increased by $10 million or 17%, primarily due to increased revenues from licensing and support contracts, change requests and surveillance products. New order intake was $69 million in the second quarter and period -- at the period end, backlog finished at $769 million, up 9% year-over-year. 
Listing Services, which is on Page 8, saw a $2 million or 3% organic increase in revenues, driven primarily by an increase in the number of listings. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 43% was down from 44% in the prior year quarter. 
Market Services, which is on Page 9, saw a $1 million or 1% organic increase in net revenues, plus a $3 million increase due to the acquisition of Nasdaq CXC and a $1 million positive impact from foreign exchange. Non-GAAP operating income increased to 54% from 53% in the prior period. 
Equity Derivatives trading and clearing net revenues increased 5%, primarily due to the higher U.S. industry trading volume and market share. Cash equities net revenue increased 2% due to a higher industry U.S. volumes and the inclusion of revenue from Nasdaq CXC, partially offset by lower market share in both the U.S. and European markets and lower capture rate in the U.S. 
Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Trading and Clearing net revenues decreased by 13% from the prior year, principally due to the impact of NFX-related trading incentives and a lower U.S. Treasury revenues, partially offset by growth in European fixed income and commodity trading. 
Access and Broker Services revenue increased by 8% due to an increase in customer demand across most product areas. 
Before we turn to expense trends, I'd like to take a moment and give some detail around the non-GAAP adjustments this quarter. First, we had a $33 million restructuring charges related to the completion of the restructuring program that began in the first quarter of 2015. The total cost of the restructuring program was $214 million, which included $119 million related to the write-off of the OMX trade name. Excluding the write-off of the trade name, the restructuring cost was $95 million. The estimated annual savings associated with these costs are $36 million, which would result in a 3-year recovery. 
Second, we had $35 million in charges related to the acquisition and integration activity, substantially all of this related to the ISE acquisition. 
Third, during the quarter, we received an unfavorable tax ruling, which resulted in a $27 million charge on our tax line. 
Turning to Page 10 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $19 million. The increase included $15 million due to our acquisitions and $4 million in organic growth. 
Turning to Slide 12. Our revised 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance has increased by $35 million from the prior guidance to reflect the expected impact of the acquisition of ISE. 
Non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter increased 4% on an organic basis and 9% in total. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 46%, up 50 basis points from the prior year period. Net interest expense was $31 million in the second quarter, an increase of $5 million versus the prior year period, reflecting the additional interest expense from our recent bond offering. Non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2016 was 33.8%, within our unchanged 33% to 35% full year guidance. Non-GAAP net income attributed to Nasdaq was $153 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared to $143 million or $0.83 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015. 
Moving on to cash flow and capital. Please turn to Slide 15. We repurchased $16 million in stock during the quarter -- during the second quarter of 2016. We purchased an additional $8 million in the first few days of July of 2016. Through dividends and repurchases, Nasdaq returned nearly $70 million in capital to shareholders during the second quarter of 2016. 
As of July 26, there is $476 million remaining on the board repurchase authorization plan. 
Now as many of you know that the time I served as Interim CFO coincided with my planned retirement from Nasdaq after serving 14 wonderful years as the Corporate Controller. And so I am probably even more excited about Mr. Ptasznik's arrival as the new CFO than the rest of the team. In addition to welcoming Michael, I wanted to thank Bob, Adena, Hans-Ole and the rest of the Nasdaq management team and the board for the opportunity to serve as the Interim CFO. To the analyst and the investors I met during this period, it was truly a pleasure talking to you about Nasdaq, a company that is positioned well to move forward to tackle its unique opportunities. Thank you for your time, and I'm turning it over to Bob."

I think that the second thing was the CRs, and those tend to be -- they kind of ebb and flow quarter-over-quarter. There's some seasonality to that. It's based on change requests that our clients ask for. We got off to somewhat of a slow start to the year, but the second quarter was a great quarter for us in terms of the CR revenue. And we do tend to see that happen in -- both the second and the fourth quarter tend to be our strongest quarters there. And then, lastly on SMARTS.

As I've said before, we have been shut out in a number of deals, but then, after waiting for a long period of time, the 4 deals we've done this year, as we said, are, I think, fairly priced. They represent right down the bowling alley in terms of what we do today, the synergy numbers are impressive and the return to our shareholders will be equally impressive. So those kind of deals, if they become available, we'll be in the game. If they're not and they're richly priced, representing some type of asset bubble, then we're happy to lose."

One, on the optimistic side is, the blockchain will change everything with respect to post-trade across a wide variety of asset classes across the globe. In time, that will happen. On the other side, you have to recognize that blockchain by itself, and I'd tie back to what Larry Ellison said back in the dot.com days is, that's a feature. It's not a company. So blockchain is another method of storing data, and it needs to be integrated into solutions that fit within the construct of the ecosystem we live in. And what we announced at the Technology of the Future Conference, which I referenced in my prepared remarks, is a pure recognition of that. So we're putting the blockchain as a key part, a central part of the Nasdaq Financial Framework. But by itself, it doesn't do anything. So I think the integration -- the deep integration of blockchain into core technologies is fundamental, and we're on that mission. So we see this as a major opportunity, but we think just somebody out there trying to sell blockchain technology is not going to get that far. It has to get integrated into what happens today."

Alex, so if we start with the market tech business, I think that we continue to find a very receptive audience among our clients, as well as new potential clients. We did sign on a new client in the first quarter. We've renewed several contracts. We've upgraded several of our contracts. That's why we had such good order intake in the second quarter. And we continue to see very good opportunity in our core market tech business, in addition to the SMARTS trade system, which, frankly, has tremendous traction, is an award-winning solution and is -- we continue to see a very, very robust pipeline of sales opportunities there. So I don't think Brexit is going to have an impact on either of those businesses in any meaningful way. And then if we turn over to Corporate Solutions, Corporate Solutions continues to have a variety, frankly, of sales environments in it because it's a wide range of products. But in terms of the need for, for instance, board portal technology and more intelligent PR distribution and intelligent solutions, that continues to be an area of very good growth for us. In terms of the Investor Relations products, I would say it depends on the sector. So we continue to see weakness in the energy sector, but strength in some of the biotech and the technology sectors. And again, Brexit doesn't really have any impact on that business either. So I hope that answers your question."

It's the core of what we do and we pay a lot of attention to it. So as we get larger and do different things, it's important to recognize, we will not do that unless we execute quite successfully in all our chosen businesses, and Cash Equities is really first among equals. So with respect to what's happening, as you recollect, we attempted of our own accord to do a basic access fee pilot. And we picked certain stocks, and we thought this was a good thing to do, because when you think about the passage of Reg NMS and the $0.30 was pegged as the limit for access fee, that may or may not have been the right number at that point in time, but it cannot be the right number a decade later. And we have a belief that, that number is too high, so we're in full support of the commission moving forward with that. On the other side of the equation, we believe in rebates. We believe in the maker-taker model, but we also do not believe that the maker fee should be so high that it creates activity in and of itself. It should be there to provide incentive for somebody to reveal their hand first. So to the extent we shrink the access fee and the maker rebate declines, I think that could be a good thing for the market. So first and foremost, we believe that high-quality markets are good for Nasdaq and good for us, and we fully support what, hopefully, will happen in a faster pace with the commission. And we certainly think that, as I said before, if the market quality is better, then an organization like Nasdaq is better served."

And so we go into this recognizing we can, and we have some big data analysis behind us to help us, serve 2 masters where we can more competitively price where it matters to our customers and probably gain some extra capture where the customers are relatively price insensitive.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review Nasdaq's second quarter 2016 results. Certainly, when you look at our performance this quarter and during the first half of the year, the balance of our business model continues to demonstrate its resiliency. As of -- as I have pointed out to you before, while we are not immune to market forces and significant global events, we are, however, intensely focused on serving our clients and supporting them throughout pivotal moments in their evolution. As a FinTech company, technology has always been the fundamental focus that drives our decisions, and ultimately, enables us to expand and grow our competitive position in the marketplace. 
During the quarter, Nasdaq delivered record revenues of $559 million as well as record non-GAAP operating income of $259 million. We achieved non-GAAP EPS of $0.91, which ties our all-time high and is a second quarter record. It represents a 10% year-on-year increase and underscores our ability to deliver double-digit shareholder returns through EPS growth and dividend yield. 
Clearly, organic revenue growth is one of the key benchmarks by which we judge our progress, and I am pleased to report that it was positive in all 4 segments. Our non-transaction segments combined delivered a very respectable 4% organic growth in the second quarter versus the prior year period. The biggest standout was in our Technology Solutions segment, which saw organic growth of 6% when compared to the prior year quarter. Truly outstanding, and this was driven by recent business wins and continued growth in Market Technology, including SMARTS surveillance and revenue recognition of our Borsa Istanbul contract. 
On top of the organic progress, we also closed 2 important acquisitions during the quarter in ISE and Boardvantage. We are now clearly in execution mode on all 4 acquisitions we completed during this year. We have been, and will continue to be, maniacally focused on delivering maximum value in each of the -- these deals to our clients and our shareholders. I'm pleased to report we've achieved the first $10 million of synergies in the second quarter. 
When we look at how we are improving our competitive position across this franchise in all the businesses in which we compete, we are doing it in a variety of compelling ways. One, through organic investments in fundamentally disruptive technologies and also organic growth initiatives, as well as expansion through acquisitions that lever our core competencies. I want to talk about our progress this quarter in the context of these 3 core areas of focus and highlight how they continue to drive client opportunities and growth. 
As I mentioned, organic growth reinforces that we are on the right track strategically, and in terms of running our business as well. It's also a sound endorsement that we're doing the right things on behalf of our clients. 
In our Market Services segment, we continue to focus on creating one of the most robust multi-asset platforms in the industry for our clients. To this point or perhaps most exciting for us right now is the progress of NFX. We just passed the one-year anniversary since the launch, and we've hit 3 major milestones around that one-year mark. First, we had, just this week, our first 5% market share day; second, we had our 100th firm transact on the platform; and third, we've gone over 1 million contracts in open interest. Operationally, we began a new chapter in the NFX story when we introduced fees in the beginning of May. In the 2-month period that followed in May and June, I'm pleased to report that open interest ended 22% higher, while average daily volume was 27% higher. Our market share during the same 2-month period increased by 70 basis points, a 29% improvement. As I've said before, pricing is being introduced at modest but meaningful levels in the products that have already seen a meaningful liquidity bill. We will continue to price according to the value we are delivering to our customers. 
In addition, we are already off to a strong start in the second half of the year. This is against a backdrop that featured macro and geopolitical volatility as well as progress we've seen on strategic initiatives, such as our acquisitions, and I'll come back to those a little bit later. Given our momentum, we are in a strong position to defend and improve our competitive position in our trading businesses, something that has and always will be fundamental to our future. 
In our Listing Services business, organic growth continued to be solid at 3% during the quarter. Overall, Nasdaq remains the new listings global leader in the first half of 2016, with a total of 167 new listings, including 68 IPOs and a 73% win rate in our U.S. market. One standout for us has been the performance in the Nordic markets where we saw 47 new listings in the first half of the year with over EUR 4.2 billion in capital raised. Included in these numbers was the largest IPO of the year globally, the DONG Energy listing on our Copenhagen market. We also continue to maintain strong exchange listing transfer momentum in the U.S. We had 13 companies switch from NYSE in the first half of 2016. They were led by such great companies as Scripps Networks Interactive; tronc, which is formerly Tribune Publishing; OPKO, a leading biotechnology company. Since 2005, over $830 billion in market value has chosen to switch to Nasdaq, including $43 billion in the first 6 months of 2016. Truly outstanding. 
Elsewhere, we also continued to improve in ETF listings. Nasdaq added 61 new listings in the first half of the year, including 24 switches, leading the industry with a 39% share of new listings and switches, and driving the total number of ETP listed at Nasdaq to 277 at midyear, up 57% versus the prior year. 
While still clearly an early stage initiative in terms of revenue, we continue to see strong operational traction in Nasdaq private market. We saw 133 private companies use our platform in the second quarter, more than doubling from 62 in the prior year period. We also are working to expand our offering. The private market opportunity continues to grow. We have new clients coming onboard just recently, such as Usero [ph] and Skybox. During the first half of 2016, the private company secondary market saw the number of transactions grow by over 20%. The dollar volume rose, most significantly, 135% year-over-year. Again, another outstanding performance. 
As I mentioned before, our Technology Solutions segment saw the most dynamic growth during the quarter, achieving 6% organic growth. This was driven by our Market Technology business, which benefited from continued strong trends in the surveillance post-trade and GRC spaces, but also as revenue recognition starts to reflect more of the recent period's significant business wins. These are just a few of the examples of how our focus on efficiency and serving clients continues to manifest itself in our results and improve our competitive positioning. 
Now as you know, in addition to organic growth, strategic acquisitions are core to our growth strategy and will deliver increased value to our clients. Let me give you a brief update on our progress. As I mentioned, during the quarter, we closed 2 acquisitions, ISE and Boardvantage. With ISE, we closed the transaction at the very end of June, and I'm pleased we were able to do so in such a timely fashion, less than 4 months from announcement and executing on a financing package at lower-than-expected cost. We are intensely focused on leveraging our platforms to provide new capabilities and functionalities to clients of the combined businesses. We're off to a strong start, and since closing the transaction, our combined options market share has remained very close to the 40% level, combining all our franchises together. It's certainly an early sign that the market understands and is responding positively to our client discussions and how the combination will deliver greater value and opportunity. 
Upon closing the transaction, we've already realized approximately $8 million in annualized run rate synergies, a first step against the total $40 million synergy opportunity. And I am pleased to report that the transaction is immediately accretive to non-GAAP earnings, very similar to Philly. Remember, Ron? Back in the day."

I'm looking forward to updating you on that progress as well as our progress in integrating and migrating our Nasdaq CXC business onto our core trading platform in the quarters to come. 
In our Corporate Solutions business, we closed Boardvantage in May and are well underway with the integration and our focus to provide one of the most robust set of boarding collaboration tools in the marketplace today. Taking the Boardvantage acquisition together with the first quarter's close on the Marketwired acquisition, our expanded footprint in PR distribution and governance space gives our Corporate Solutions business a heavier mix in what we believe are the higher growth, higher margin and more scalable businesses as well as material cost synergy opportunity. We achieved $2 million in run rate synergies in the second quarter versus a targeted $20 million opportunity within 18 months of closing. Perhaps even more importantly, as we work more broadly to return Corporate Solutions to positive organic growth, the 2 deals bring approximately 7,500 new corporate clients to expand our relationships and drive new cross-selling opportunities across this franchise. 
In summary, during the first half of the year, we closed 4 acquisitions on or ahead of schedule at significantly better-than-expected financing cost. Based on that, as well as our increased confidence in revenue trends and synergies, we feel comfortable raising the 2015 diluted EPS accretion number to $0.40 per share from the prior $0.37 we provided during our March Investor Day. The $0.40 accretion assumes 2015 pro forma results with full synergy realization. Certainly, very good progress so far. 
As a financial technology company, our ability to see around corners and apply technology in new and innovative ways for clients is fundamental to our success and the future of the franchise. I want to briefly highlight our ongoing progress during the quarter. 
In May, at our semiannual Future of Technology Conference for Market Technology customers in Stockholm, with the largest customer attendance ever, we announced a significant step in the evolution of how we will deliver technology to our clients and our internal systems as well. The Nasdaq Financial Framework is a result of listening to our clients and the result of significant R&D efforts. It truly transforms our offering into a more modular approach that will enable more flexibility in the way our clients use our solutions. The heart of the framework will be an open and high-speed communication operations and resiliency layer that will allow us to more effectively introduce new functionality, including blockchain capabilities across the entire trade life cycle for clients. It's early days yet, but we are excited about the potential this innovation will bring to capital markets as we begin to roll it out later this fall, and the interest and conversation levels with current and potential customers has been remarkable. 
Likewise, in our Corporate Solutions business, we continue to accelerate the rate of innovation and new solutions we're putting onto the platform. For example, we continue to enhance IR Insight, even as we dedicate significant resources to the migration of thousands of users onto the platform. In June, we announced the addition to the platform of IR Analytics, which will provide clients with dynamic and rich data dashboards to help them analyze large amounts of data from multiple sources and make better decisions about how they allocate finite valuable resources to pursue their objectives. 
In addition, we also introduced Nasdaq Influencers to our PR and communication suite, where we are empowering communications and marketing clients around the world to tap into an increasingly important network of thought leaders. These are just a few examples of the types of ongoing innovation occurring at Nasdaq. In addition to proofs of concepts, we continue to develop to better leverage new technologies, like machine learning and blockchain to improve our client's workflow and alleviate business complexities. 
In closing, I am proud of the team and the results we delivered this quarter. It is certainly indicative of our strong ability to execute against a variety of backdrops while continuing to meet our clients' needs. Perhaps, though, what is most exciting for me is the level and intensity of innovation occurring throughout this organization. As I've stated before, I do not judge our business on backward-looking financial results, but forward-looking measures of -- such as how are we meeting our clients' needs and how is our relative competitiveness. In both of these most important measures, it has been a most outstanding quarter. We look forward to the second half of the year and hope to execute just as strong for both our clients as a -- and shareholders, as we did for the first half of the year. 
Before I turn the call over to Ron Hassen, I want to introduce everyone to our new Chief Financial Officer, Michael Ptasznik. We are very excited to have him join the team. With over 20 years of experience, we certainly look forward to working with him and benefiting from his extensive experience on both the financial and operational sides. This is a particularly busy time in our company's evolution. We know Michael is a great asset for the team, and you will enjoy getting to know him and working with him. Welcome, Michael. 
I also want to thank Ron for his dedication in guiding us through this transition, as well as working and serving as our Corporate Controller over my entire tenure at Nasdaq. His contributions have been immeasurable. He will be missed. 
Now I turn the call over to Ron Hassen, one last time, to review the financial details."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. My commentary will focus on our non-GAAP results. Later in my prepared remarks, I will discuss the period's differences between U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com. 
I will start by reviewing the second quarter revenue performance relative to prior year quarter, as shown on Page 4 of the presentation.  The 8% or $41 million increase in reported net revenue of $559 million consisted of organic growth in Market Services net revenues of $1 million or 1%, resulting principally from higher access fees -- revenues. Organic growth in non-trading Information Services, Technology Solutions and Listing Service segments totaled $13 million or 4%. In addition, there was a $24 million in revenues from our recently completed acquisitions of Marketwired, Boardvantage and Nasdaq CXC. Year-over-year, changes in FX rates increased revenues by $3 million. 
I am now going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. 
Information Services, on Page 6, saw a $3 million organic growth, a $2 million increase related to Nasdaq CXC acquisition and a $1 million increase due to the positive impact of foreign exchange. Data Product revenues increased 8%, including organic growth in consolidated and proprietary Data Products revenues as well as a growth in audit collections. Index Licensing and Services saw a $2 million decline due to lower average assets under management in the period, which was primarily due to declines in market values. 
Technology Solutions, as shown on Page 7, increased $28 million, reflecting a $19 million contribution from the acquisitions of Boardvantage and Marketwired, $8 million or 6% organic increase. The non-GAAP operating margin was 18%, up from 14% in the prior year period. We continue to have confidence in reaching our medium-term objective of 20% and expect further year-over-year progress as we move forward. 
Corporate Solutions revenue increased due to the -- to the impact of -- I'm sorry, Corporate Solutions revenue increased due to the impact of the 2 acquisitions. We continue to believe we are on a path to return to organic revenue growth in Corporate Solutions in the coming quarters. 
Market Technology's revenues increased by $10 million or 17%, primarily due to increased revenues from licensing and support contracts, change requests and surveillance products. New order intake was $69 million in the second quarter and period -- at the period end, backlog finished at $769 million, up 9% year-over-year. 
Listing Services, which is on Page 8, saw a $2 million or 3% organic increase in revenues, driven primarily by an increase in the number of listings. Non-GAAP operating income margin of 43% was down from 44% in the prior year quarter. 
Market Services, which is on Page 9, saw a $1 million or 1% organic increase in net revenues, plus a $3 million increase due to the acquisition of Nasdaq CXC and a $1 million positive impact from foreign exchange. Non-GAAP operating income increased to 54% from 53% in the prior period. 
Equity Derivatives trading and clearing net revenues increased 5%, primarily due to the higher U.S. industry trading volume and market share. Cash equities net revenue increased 2% due to a higher industry U.S. volumes and the inclusion of revenue from Nasdaq CXC, partially offset by lower market share in both the U.S. and European markets and lower capture rate in the U.S. 
Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities Trading and Clearing net revenues decreased by 13% from the prior year, principally due to the impact of NFX-related trading incentives and a lower U.S. Treasury revenues, partially offset by growth in European fixed income and commodity trading. 
Access and Broker Services revenue increased by 8% due to an increase in customer demand across most product areas. 
Before we turn to expense trends, I'd like to take a moment and give some detail around the non-GAAP adjustments this quarter. First, we had a $33 million restructuring charges related to the completion of the restructuring program that began in the first quarter of 2015. The total cost of the restructuring program was $214 million, which included $119 million related to the write-off of the OMX trade name. Excluding the write-off of the trade name, the restructuring cost was $95 million. The estimated annual savings associated with these costs are $36 million, which would result in a 3-year recovery. 
Second, we had $35 million in charges related to the acquisition and integration activity, substantially all of this related to the ISE acquisition. 
Third, during the quarter, we received an unfavorable tax ruling, which resulted in a $27 million charge on our tax line. 
Turning to Page 10 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $19 million. The increase included $15 million due to our acquisitions and $4 million in organic growth. 
Turning to Slide 12. Our revised 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance has increased by $35 million from the prior guidance to reflect the expected impact of the acquisition of ISE. 
Non-GAAP operating income in the second quarter increased 4% on an organic basis and 9% in total. Non-GAAP operating margin came in at 46%, up 50 basis points from the prior year period. Net interest expense was $31 million in the second quarter, an increase of $5 million versus the prior year period, reflecting the additional interest expense from our recent bond offering. Non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2016 was 33.8%, within our unchanged 33% to 35% full year guidance. Non-GAAP net income attributed to Nasdaq was $153 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared to $143 million or $0.83 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2015. 
Moving on to cash flow and capital. Please turn to Slide 15. We repurchased $16 million in stock during the quarter -- during the second quarter of 2016. We purchased an additional $8 million in the first few days of July of 2016. Through dividends and repurchases, Nasdaq returned nearly $70 million in capital to shareholders during the second quarter of 2016. 
As of July 26, there is $476 million remaining on the board repurchase authorization plan. 
Now as many of you know that the time I served as Interim CFO coincided with my planned retirement from Nasdaq after serving 14 wonderful years as the Corporate Controller. And so I am probably even more excited about Mr. Ptasznik's arrival as the new CFO than the rest of the team. In addition to welcoming Michael, I wanted to thank Bob, Adena, Hans-Ole and the rest of the Nasdaq management team and the board for the opportunity to serve as the Interim CFO. To the analyst and the investors I met during this period, it was truly a pleasure talking to you about Nasdaq, a company that is positioned well to move forward to tackle its unique opportunities. Thank you for your time, and I'm turning it over to Bob."

I think that the second thing was the CRs, and those tend to be -- they kind of ebb and flow quarter-over-quarter. There's some seasonality to that. It's based on change requests that our clients ask for. We got off to somewhat of a slow start to the year, but the second quarter was a great quarter for us in terms of the CR revenue. And we do tend to see that happen in -- both the second and the fourth quarter tend to be our strongest quarters there. And then, lastly on SMARTS. You're right that the SMARTS trade system is a SaaS-based model, so when -- we have about a $2 million impact there, and that would be an ongoing uplift that we can enjoy going forward as we continue to sell more of that service throughout the clients.

So blockchain is another method of storing data, and it needs to be integrated into solutions that fit within the construct of the ecosystem we live in. And what we announced at the Technology of the Future Conference, which I referenced in my prepared remarks, is a pure recognition of that. So we're putting the blockchain as a key part, a central part of the Nasdaq Financial Framework. But by itself, it doesn't do anything. So I think the integration -- the deep integration of blockchain into core technologies is fundamental, and we're on that mission.

Alex, so if we start with the market tech business, I think that we continue to find a very receptive audience among our clients, as well as new potential clients. We did sign on a new client in the first quarter. We've renewed several contracts. We've upgraded several of our contracts. That's why we had such good order intake in the second quarter. And we continue to see very good opportunity in our core market tech business, in addition to the SMARTS trade system, which, frankly, has tremendous traction, is an award-winning solution and is -- we continue to see a very, very robust pipeline of sales opportunities there. So I don't think Brexit is going to have an impact on either of those businesses in any meaningful way. And then if we turn over to Corporate Solutions, Corporate Solutions continues to have a variety, frankly, of sales environments in it because it's a wide range of products. But in terms of the need for, for instance, board portal technology and more intelligent PR distribution and intelligent solutions, that continues to be an area of very good growth for us. In terms of the Investor Relations products, I would say it depends on the sector. So we continue to see weakness in the energy sector, but strength in some of the biotech and the technology sectors. And again, Brexit doesn't really have any impact on that business either. So I hope that answers your question."

It's the core of what we do and we pay a lot of attention to it. So as we get larger and do different things, it's important to recognize, we will not do that unless we execute quite successfully in all our chosen businesses, and Cash Equities is really first among equals. So with respect to what's happening, as you recollect, we attempted of our own accord to do a basic access fee pilot. And we picked certain stocks, and we thought this was a good thing to do, because when you think about the passage of Reg NMS and the $0.30 was pegged as the limit for access fee, that may or may not have been the right number at that point in time, but it cannot be the right number a decade later. And we have a belief that, that number is too high, so we're in full support of the commission moving forward with that. On the other side of the equation, we believe in rebates. We believe in the maker-taker model, but we also do not believe that the maker fee should be so high that it creates activity in and of itself. It should be there to provide incentive for somebody to reveal their hand first. So to the extent we shrink the access fee and the maker rebate declines, I think that could be a good thing for the market. So first and foremost, we believe that high-quality markets are good for Nasdaq and good for us, and we fully support what, hopefully, will happen in a faster pace with the commission. And we certainly think that, as I said before, if the market quality is better, then an organization like Nasdaq is better served."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review another quarter in which Nasdaq set several financial highs as well as discuss progress on our key initiatives and our investments. What is interesting and satisfying to",2598,"Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review another quarter in which Nasdaq set several financial highs as well as discuss progress on our key initiatives and our investments. 
What is interesting and satisfying to me about this quarter is the balanced model we have created and the strategy which focuses first and foremost on serving our clients' needs, and this continues to deliver. As we have proven quarter after quarter, when we serve our clients well, we are privileged to be able to both invest in our future and serve our shareholders well. A principal way we achieve this is our focus on technology leadership in which we can lever our expertise, our relative advantages in a manner that benefits clients and creates real opportunities for growth across our businesses. I will focus my remarks today on these central points and how they manifest in our results and drive our efforts as a financial technology company. 
During the quarter, Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $585 million, non-GAAP operating income of $268 million and non-GAAP net income of $154 million, which set all-time highs, while non-GAAP EPS of $0.91 tied our record high. When you look at the quarter, to me, what is most interesting about our performance, is our continued consistent march in generating organic growth across our non-transaction business segments. Despite lower volumes in the transactional environment, the diversity, resiliency and the complementary nature of our model continues to drive us forward. 
Just to highlight for everyone on this call, again, regarding the significance that our model plays in our results. Post the ISE acquisition, over 75% of our net revenues during the third quarter of 2016 came from subscription and recurring revenues, a record $441 million. Quite a remarkable testament to the evolution of this franchise. 
During the quarter, we saw a 5% organic net revenue growth across the non-trading segments, which provide the vast majority of the subscription and recurring revenues, with the biggest contribution to our growth coming from the Technology Solutions segment, with 10% organic growth, truly outstanding. 
In addition to strong organic growth progress, we also continued to successfully integrate the 4 acquisitions made in 2016, which are right down the center of our bowling alley. We've already begin to deliver significant accretion to our shareholders from these acquisitions. I will come back to that in more detail later in my remarks. 
As I mentioned, we are maniacally focused on the client, their problems and pain points and what we can do to solve them and unlock new opportunities. 
So now, I want to turn and highlight on how this focus is responsible for generating opportunities in our non-transaction businesses and driving the growth we saw during the quarter. 
As I pointed out early on, one of the great advantages Nasdaq has is in technology leadership, which provides us with a variety of options for responding to our clients' complex challenges and offering new and better solutions. Clearly, one of the best examples of this in action is in our Market Technology business, where over the past several years, we have shifted our strategy from a product-centric approach to a more holistic solutions approach. The investments we have made to strengthen our SMARTS surveillance, post-trade and risk and compliance offerings have resulted in strong growth, and we continue to see strong uptick across these businesses during the third quarter, as our clients continue to turn to us for these mission-critical solutions. 
On the surveillance side, we clearly are the beneficiary of industry trends towards more transparency and regulation, especially in Europe, where the Market Abuse Regulation, MAR, came into play at the beginning of July of this year. 
Importantly, we see also other regions are continuing to bolster the regulatory requirements with regard to surveillance and compliance, and also that the requirements on market participants are extending beyond the sell side to impact the buy side directly, something we've worked very hard to position the franchise for new buy-side SMARTS offering. 
Certainly fundamental to our approach in the Market Technology business has been the introduction of the Nasdaq financial framework, we announced this in May of this year. This financial framework is truly a game-changer. It provides a unifying framework for all our products and importantly allows us to deploy innovative capabilities, such as the blockchain. This is a leading example how we are in lockstep in an integrated manner with the balance of our products as we integrate this Nasdaq financial framework. 
Staying within our Technology Solutions segment for a moment, I want to highlight the progress we made in our Corporate Solutions business during the quarter. When we look at Corporate Solutions, we have been on a mission to add greater levels of value for our clients through product enhancements, new technology and scale. Key to our efforts are the integration efforts of the Marketwired and Boardvantage businesses and our ongoing focus to provide our clients with more robust solutions like IR Insight. We have migrated 80% of our legacy platforms client base, with over 3,800 users, on the new platform to date. While we still have more work left to do, we do believe we have turned an important corner in making this business both more effective and, now, efficient. This is very encouraging and certainly indicative of the dedication by this very talented team to our clients and speaks well of our ability to deliver in the quarters to come. 
Now clearly, one of the businesses that benefits from our success in Corporate Solutions is our Listing Services business. Growth in Listing Services during the quarter continued to be impressive. In fact, I would say that our Listing franchise has never been stronger. This is evident in both our U.S. and Nordic franchises. 
In the U.S., I'm very pleased to report our competitive position continues to increase. Year-to-date, we've achieved an outstanding 74% win rate in IPOs, welcoming Nutanix, The Trade Desk and Talent in the third quarter. Additionally, in October this year, the largest energy IPO of the year listed with Nasdaq, Extraction Oil and Gas. 
In switches, we welcome 16 companies thus far in 2016 with a combined market capitalization of $42 billion from our competitor, bringing our total switch market cap to $850 billion, $1 trillion is not far away since regulatory changes opened this channel up in 2002. 
In ETP listings, we've grown our issue account 48% year-over-year. 
The Nordics, in many ways, is even more impressive. We're very proud of the [indiscernible] companies which continue to choose Nasdaq as their listing home. There are 57 new company listings to date through September 30, the most of any European financial center. For the first time in my memory, the Nordics have outraised or outlisted London, certainly record performance. And this does follow a great year last year, where we had 91 listings. 
The Nordic market also continues to gain attention from companies domiciled outside the Nordics. When you look at this together, it is evident that the platform we have built that addresses not only capital-raising needs, but also provides companies with mission-critical solutions and intelligent solutions that supports our companies through their entire life as a public company is resonating in the marketplace. 
While the non-transactional businesses continued its very consistent healthy expansion, it should never be forgotten. There are suite of leading trading marketplaces are absolutely fundamental to our strategy. To that effect, looking into our most foundational trading business, U.S. Equities, we had a bit of a mix trend in terms of share and capture in the third quarter. I am pleased to report that average capture, in particular in U.S. equities, showed sequential improvement in the third quarter, but market share was marginally lower. The biggest driver of changes was industry mix. In particular, more off exchange trading, in particular in Tape C, or Nasdaq listed securities, where we are obviously heavily overweight. In this relatively low volatility, low volume environment, we tend to see lower market share, but this is somewhat mitigated by a tendency to see an increase in capture. In addition, we tend to see increased revenue from off exchange Trade Reporting Facility, the TRF. Our TRF serves over 90% of this market, which is currently around 35% to 40%. So those are mitigants to the decrease in the volatility and the volume in the market. 
Now when you look at our performance, we continue to enjoy very strong lead in Nasdaq Listed Tape C securities, when the third quarter, for example, we matched 28% of overall volumes and we represented 64% of volumes, including our TRF off exchange reporting services, which leaves only a combined 36% share for every other SEC-regulated exchange for Tape C. 
We continue to see good opportunity to improve our share in the coming periods, especially given that our competitive position relative to other exchanges remains strong and we have important innovations in the pipeline such as our Extended Life Order or ELO. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have completed 4 acquisitions this year, and what's most impressive is our teams have done an outstanding job in incorporating he talent, resources and technologies these companies bring to Nasdaq. Strategically, these acquisitions play to our core strengths or down the center of our bowling alleys, as I like to say. They maximize our chance for success. This is the first full quarter with all 4 of the acquisitions under the Nasdaq umbrella, and they're already delivering meaningful accretion to shareholders. Let me share with you some of the highlights on our progress. 
We closed the transaction of the International Securities Exchange, ISE, in June. This was significantly ahead of schedule, and since that time, we have been executing on our objective that ISE lever the best technologies and features from both Nasdaq and ISE to serve our clients. Our continued focus on our clients throughout this process is important to us, and I'm pleased that we've continued to earn from these customers market share at industry-leading levels within a point or 2 of the roughly 40% share that Nasdaq and ISE separately totaled in the periods prior to the combination. 
In addition, we've been able to realize $15 million in run rate synergies for both ISE and Nasdaq's CXC at the end of the third quarter, and these acquisitions our accreting to our shareholders ahead of schedule. 
In our Corporate Solutions business, we closed Marketwired and Boardvantage in the first and second quarters, respectively. We continue to make strong progress integrating these businesses into our offering. These acquisitions are very appealing in that they both significantly expand our base of corporate customers, putting our total corporate customer base to approximately 18,000 clients, and as we integrate them, will enable us to accelerate the depth and the breadth and speed at which we innovate and bring exciting new products to PR distribution, governance and board portal space. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress made so far this year. There is still work to be done, but as I said, we have turned the corner in terms of how we operate the business, and we are very well positioned to deliver meaningful organic growth in the future. 
As you can see by the examples I have highlighted, our model, driven by a diverse mix of businesses, provides us with the flexibility and opportunity to both explore and execute on a variety of initiatives. To give you an example, year to date, we have seen organic growth, coupled with strong operational focus on expenses, synergy realization and sound capital deployment and returns generated 9 -- 8% non-GAAP EPS growth in the first 9 months of 2016, in addition to significant growth in our dividend. This EPS and dividend growth in turn form the foundation for an impressive 29% total shareholder return in a 12-month period ending September 30. 
Now certainly, when it comes to how we look at investing in our future, organic growth is our first priority and our preference. We have a robust process from vetting growth constants internally at Nasdaq through our R&D program and have a strong track record to date with our organic initiatives, some of which I will highlight now. 
Clearly, one of the more outstanding initiatives we have undertaken and something we are very proud of is our launch of NFX in 2015. The increasing traction NFX has seen in the energy market over the past year represents a positive vote by market participants and our clients in a more efficient, cost-effective and responsible alternative was and is needed. To highlight our progress, we set the following records in September: Monthly average daily volume was 151,000 contracts. We set no Brent and WTI volume marks each over 70K. Open interest reached a new high before the September roll of 1.2 million contracts, truly impressive. 
So perhaps, more importantly, as we look forward, our client on boarding backlog, including merchants and utility and users, is at a record level. Good days to come. So while we don't consider the NFX has achieved success yet and certainly isn't guaranteed to do so, we can see clearly how continued growth in the coming periods for establishment firmly as a very important and valuable asset. 
Another significant investment we have made which has fulfilled a previously untapped need in the marketplace is our effort to transform the private market. Overall, we are pleased with our progress with a 175% year-over-year increase in the number of liquidity events facilitated. This is a great example of how we are exploring ways to apply disruptive technology, like the blockchain and market expertise, to support our clients. Our future depends on how well we see around the corners and apply technology in innovative ways to the benefit of our clients. To this end, we currently have a number of use cases in our pipeline across all of our businesses, and we're excited about the opportunities that leveraging these technologies represent for our clients and our businesses. For example, in September, a new data product suite called Nasdaq Trading Insights, designed to help traders better understand how they perform in the market, how the market behaves and how they can adjust their strategies to be more successful. It combines proprietary data with advanced analytics and machine learning to provide insights. It's the first commercial solution to come out of our Information Services innovation lab, which brings together inside and outside technologies, data scientists, software engineers and business experts. It's a great example the kinds of solutions that we're developing today that will harness disruptive technologies and the kind of innovation that you will certainly see more of in Nasdaq -- from Nasdaq in the months to come. 
In closing, I've talked a lot today about the progress we're making to serve our clients through strategic acquisitions, organic growth initiatives and through the effective use of capital, but in reality, we are -- we view our job as much, much simpler than that. Our job is to listen to our clients and respond to them and to market stimuli, and this quarter's really a testament to our ability to do that effectively on a multitude of levels across this franchise. I have no doubt that the strength of our model, coupled with our ability to apply technology to benefit our clients, will certainly drive this franchise forward for the remainder of this year and into the future. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Michael to review the financial details."

My commentary this morning will focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments through our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com. I'll start by reviewing third quarter revenue performance relative to the prior year quarter as shown on Page 5 of the presentation and organic growth from Page 6. 
The 11% or $56 million increase in reported net revenue of $585 million consisted of $58 million in net revenues from our 2016 acquisitions of ISE Marketwired, Boardvantage and Nasdaq CXC and organic growth in the non-trading segments of $17 million or 5%. This is partially offset by an organic decrease in Market Services net revenues of $20 million or negative 10%, resulting principally from the exceptionally strong multiyear highs in industry volume in the prior year period. 
I'm not going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be through the prior year period unless otherwise noted. 
Information Services on Page 7 saw $2 million in organic revenue growth and a $3 million increase related to the ISE and Nasdaq CXC acquisitions. Data Product revenues increased 6%, including organic growth and proprietary data product revenue, the inclusion of revenues associated with the ISE and the Nasdaq CXC acquisitions as well as higher audit collections. 
Index Licensing and Services revenue saw a $1 million decline, primarily due to a decrease in the value of underlying assets associated with non-ETP Nasdaq-licensed products and lower fees on derivative products that license Nasdaq indices due to lower volumes. 
The operating income margin declined modestly in the third quarter to 71% from 73% in the prior year, due principally to certain temporary expenses, including those associated with new product initiatives. 
Technology Solutions revenue, as shown on Page 8, increased $36 million, reflecting a $22 million contribution from the acquisitions of Boardvantage and Marketwired and a $13 million or 10% organic increase. The operating income margin was 18%, up from 15% in the prior year period. 
Corporate Solutions revenues increased due to the impact of the 2 acquisitions. Organic revenues were unchanged, which is an improvement from modest declines in recent quarters. 
Market Technology revenue increased $14 million or 24%, primarily due to increased revenues of software licensing and support contracts as well as surveillance products. New order intake was $49 million in the third quarter and the prior -- and the period end backlog finished at $738 million unchanged from the prior year. 
Listing Services on Page 9 saw a $2 million or 3% organic increase in revenues driven primarily by an increase in Nordic listing revenue due to new company listings. 
Market Services net revenues on Page 10 saw a $33 million increase from the acquisitions of ISE and Nasdaq CXC, partially offset by a $20 million organic decline due mostly to the tough industry volume comparable in the prior year period, netting to a $13 million increase. Market Services operating income margin totaled 54% versus 55% in the prior year period. 
Equity Derivatives Trading and Clearing net revenues increased 31%, primarily due to the ISE acquisition and higher U.S. market share, legacy Nasdaq markets, partially offset by lower industry trading volumes. 
Cash equity trading net revenues decreased 12%, primarily due to lower match market share, industry volumes and U.S. average capture, partially offset by the inclusion of revenues from Nasdaq CXC. 
Fixed Income and Commodities Trading and Clearing net revenues decreased 22% from the prior year, due primarily to decline in U.S. fixed income and commodities revenues as well as the impact of trading incentives on NFX revenues. 
And you'll note that we've renamed Access and Broker Services to Trade Management Services to better reflect the broader nature and scope of services these revenues represent. And revenues here increased 17% [indiscernible] inclusion of revenue from ISE as well as increased demand for connectivity solutions. 
Turning to Page 11 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $41 million. This increase included $29 million in expenses from our acquisitions and $13 million or 5% in organic growth, excluding $45 [ph] million in the quarter of acquisition synergy benefits. Bearing in mind that q-over-q expense comparisons often have significant volatility due to things like changes in the performance-based compensation accruals or nonrecurring items that don't meet the qualifications for non-GAAP exclusion, I note through the first 9 months of 2016, organic expense growth has been approximately 3%, in line with the same organic expense growth rate we saw in the full year 2015 period. 
Turning to Slide 12. Our revised 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance has been narrowed to $1.22 billion to $1.24 billion or a 4Q range of $323 million to $343 million. This is above the 3Q '16 level, but please keep in mind that there are typically seasonal differences in the 3Q and 4Q expense run rates. For example, the third quarter typically features marketing, professional -- lower marketing, professional, services and travel expenses and some seasonal benefits in compensation. 
Non-GAAP operating income increased 6% in the third quarter of 2016, and decreased 6% on an organic basis. Net interest expense was $36 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $9 million versus the prior year period, reflecting the additional interest expense from our recent bond offerings. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for 3Q '16 was 34.2% and within our unchanged 33% to 35% full year guidance. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for 3Q '16 was $154 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared to $151 million or $0.88 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015. 
Now moving on to cash flow and capital. Please turn to Slide 16. We repurchased $55 million in stock during the third quarter of 2016, bringing our total buybacks to $100 million in the first 9 months of 2016. As of September 30, 2017 there is $429 million remaining on the Board repurchase authorization. Through dividends and repurchases, Nasdaq returned nearly $250 million in capital to shareholders year-to-date in 2016. 
And finally, while we don't have Ron on the call with us today, I'm sure he is listening, and I just want to thank him for the great team that I've inherited and for the immense support that he's provided me as I've transitioned to my role here at Nasdaq. And with that, I thank you for your time and I turn it back over to Bob."

Remember, we receive fees both in end users as well as in distribution fees and machine usage of our fees. So we have the ability more internally to have a stable revenue stream associated with over all industry use of our data. We continue to see very good demand for our new Nasdaq basic fees that are not new, but it's been around less time than others. And we continue to see growth there. And we also, interestingly, have seen increased demand i n sales of our data into Asia, and we have put a salesperson into the Asian region, and it's been a nice year in terms of new opportunities that have come from Asia. So I think that we are continuing to find that there is healthy demand for our service. It's relatively stable. And within new trading insights products, we continue to find opportunities to find new insights in our data that we can sell to the clients. We launched that product in September. We already have several firms using it, testing it. And one firm already said yes, it looks great. And they're not buying it.

So while we continue to see strong sales as well as good opportunities to expand what we provide to our clients, and we are investing in new capabilities, for instance we recently launched a GRC module for that, we are moving that also to more of a recurring revenue model from a perpetual license model, and so that's been going through a little of a revenue shift then we expect that to come out of that in the next couple of years so that we can continue to see growth in that business as well."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review another quarter in which Nasdaq set several financial highs as well as discuss progress on our key initiatives and our investments.What is interesting and satisfying to",2595,"Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review another quarter in which Nasdaq set several financial highs as well as discuss progress on our key initiatives and our investments.
What is interesting and satisfying to me about this quarter is the balanced model we have created and a strategy which focuses first and foremost on serving our clients' needs and this continues to deliver. As we have proven quarter after quarter, when we serve our clients well, we are privileged to be able to both invest in our future and serve our shareholders well. A principal way we achieve this is our focus on technology leadership in which we can lever our expertise, our relative advantages in a manner that benefits clients and creates real opportunities for growth across our businesses. I will focus my remarks today on these central points and how they manifest in our results and drive our efforts as a financial technology company.
During the quarter, Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $585 million, non-GAAP operating income of $268 million and non-GAAP net income of $154 million, which set all-time highs, while non-GAAP EPS of $0.91 tied our record high. When you look at the quarter, to me, what is most interesting about our performance is our continued consistent march in generating organic growth across our non-transaction business segments. Despite lower volumes in the transactional environment, the diversity, resiliency and the complementary nature of our model continues to drive us forward.
Just to highlight for everyone on this call, again, regarding the significance that our model plays in our results, post the ISE acquisition, over 75% of our net revenues during the third quarter of 2016 came from subscription and recurring revenues, a record $441 million. Quite a remarkable testament to the evolution of this franchise.
During the quarter, we saw a 5% organic net revenue growth across the non-trading segments, which provide the vast majority of the subscription and recurring revenues, with the biggest contribution to our growth coming from the Technology Solutions segment, with 10% organic growth, truly outstanding.
In addition to strong organic growth progress, we also continued to successfully integrate the 4 acquisitions made in 2016, which are right down the center of our bowling alley. We've already begin to deliver significant accretion to our shareholders from these acquisitions. I will come back to that in more detail later in my remarks.
As I mentioned, we are maniacally focused on the client, their problems and pain points and what we can do to solve them and unlock new opportunities.
So now, I want to turn and highlight on how this focus is responsible for generating opportunities in our non-transaction businesses and driving the growth we saw during the quarter.
As I pointed out early on, one of the great advantages Nasdaq has is in technology leadership, which provides us with a variety of options for responding to our clients' complex challenges and offering new and better solutions. Clearly, one of the best examples of this in action is in our Market Technology business, where over the past several years, we have shifted our strategy from a product-centric approach to a more holistic solutions approach. The investments we have made to strengthen our SMARTS surveillance, post-trade and risk and compliance offerings have resulted in strong growth, and we continue to see strong uptick across these businesses during the third quarter, as our clients continue to turn to us for these mission-critical solutions.
On the surveillance side, we clearly are the beneficiary of industry trends towards more transparency and regulation, especially in Europe, where the Market Abuse Regulation, MAR, came into play at the beginning of July of this year.
Importantly, we see also other regions are continuing to bolster the regulatory requirements with regard to surveillance and compliance, and also that the requirements on market participants are extending beyond the sell side to impact the buy side directly, something we've worked very hard to position the franchise for the new buy-side SMARTS offering.
Certainly fundamental to our approach in the Market Technology business has been the introduction of the Nasdaq Financial Framework. We announced this in May of this year. This financial framework is truly a game-changer. It provides a unifying framework for all of our products and importantly, allows us to deploy innovative capabilities, such as the blockchain. This is a leading example how we are in lockstep in an integrated manner with the balance of our products as we integrate this Nasdaq Financial Framework.
Staying within our Technology Solutions segment for a moment, I want to highlight the progress we made in our Corporate Solutions business during the quarter. When we look at Corporate Solutions, we have been on a mission to add greater levels of value for our clients through product enhancements, new technology and scale. Key to our efforts are the integration efforts of the Marketwired and Boardvantage businesses and our ongoing focus to provide our clients with more robust solutions, like IR Insight. We have migrated 80% of our legacy platforms client base, with over 3,800 users, on the new platform to date. While we still have more work left to do, we do believe we have turned an important corner in making this business both more effective and, now, efficient. This is very encouraging and, certainly, indicative of the dedication by this very talented team to our clients and speaks well of our ability to deliver in the quarters to come.
Now clearly, one of the businesses that benefits from our success in Corporate Solutions is our Listing Services business. Growth in Listing Services during the quarter continued to be impressive. In fact, I would say that our Listing franchise has never been stronger. This is evident in both our U.S. and Nordic franchises.
In the U.S., I'm very pleased to report our competitive position continues to increase. Year-to-date, we've achieved an outstanding 74% win rate in IPOs, welcoming Nutanix, The Trade Desk and Talent in the third quarter. Additionally, in October this year, the largest energy IPO of the year listed with Nasdaq, Extraction Oil & Gas.
In switches, we welcome 16 companies thus far in 2016 with a combined market capitalization of $42 billion from our competitor, bringing our total switch market cap to $850 billion, $1 trillion is not far away since regulatory changes opened this channel up in 2002.
In ETP listings, we've grown our issue account 48% year-over-year.
The Nordics, in many ways, is even more impressive. We're very proud of the [indiscernible] companies which continue to choose Nasdaq as their listing home. There are 57 new company listings to date through September 30, the most of any European financial center. For the first time in my memory, the Nordics have outraised or outlisted London, certainly record performance. And this does follow a great year last year, where we had 91 listings.
The Nordic market also continues to gain attention from companies domiciled outside the Nordics. When you look at this together, it is evident that the platform we have built that addresses not only capital-raising needs, but also provides companies with mission-critical solutions and intelligent solutions that support our companies through their entire life as a public company is resonating in the marketplace.
While the non-transactional businesses continued a very consistent healthy expansion, it should never be forgotten that our suite of leading trading marketplaces are absolutely fundamental to our strategy. To that effect, looking into our most foundational trading business, U.S. equities, we had a bit of a mix trend in terms of share and capture in the third quarter. I am pleased to report that average capture, in particular in U.S. equities, showed sequential improvement in the third quarter, but market share was marginally lower. The biggest driver of changes was industry mix. In particular, more off-exchange trading, in particular in Tape C or Nasdaq-listed securities, where we are obviously heavily overweight. In this relatively low volatility, low-volume environment, we tend to see lower market share, but this is somewhat mitigated by a tendency to see an increase in capture. In addition, we tend to see increased revenue from off-exchange Trade Reporting Facility, the TRF. Our TRF serves over 90% of this market, which is currently around 35% to 40%. So those are mitigants to the decrease in the volatility and the volume in the market.
Now when you look at our performance, we continue to enjoy very strong lead in Nasdaq-listed Tape C securities, where in the third quarter, for example, we matched 28% of overall volumes, and we represented 64% of volumes, including our TRF off-exchange trade reporting services, which leaves only a combined 36% share for every other SEC-regulated exchange for Tape C.
We continue to see good opportunity to improve our share in the coming periods, especially given that our competitive position relative to other exchanges remains strong, and we have important innovations in the pipeline such as our Extended Life Order or ELO.
As I mentioned earlier, we have completed 4 acquisitions this year, and what's most impressive is that our teams have done an outstanding job in incorporating the talent, resources and technologies these companies bring to Nasdaq. Strategically, these acquisitions play to our core strengths or down the center of our bowling alleys, as I like to say. They maximize our chance for success. This is the first full quarter with all 4 of the acquisitions under the Nasdaq umbrella, and they're already delivering meaningful accretion to our shareholders.
Let me share with you some of the highlights on our progress. We closed the transaction of the International Securities Exchange, ISE, in June. This was significantly ahead of schedule, and since that time, we have been executing on our objective that ISE lever the best technologies and features from both Nasdaq and ISE to serve our clients. Our continued focus on our clients throughout this process is important to us, and I'm pleased that we've continued to earn from these customers market share at industry-leading levels within a point or 2 of the roughly 40% share that Nasdaq and ISE separately totaled in the periods prior to the combination.
In addition, we've been able to realize $15 million in run rate synergies for both ISE and Nasdaq's CXC at the end of the third quarter, and these acquisitions our accreting to our shareholders ahead of schedule.
In our Corporate Solutions business, we closed Marketwired and Boardvantage in the first and second quarters, respectively. We continue to make strong progress integrating these businesses into our offering. These acquisitions are very appealing in that they both significantly expand our base of corporate customers, putting our total corporate customer base to approximately 18,000 clients, and as we integrate them, will enable us to accelerate the depth and the breadth and speed at which we innovate and bring exciting new products to PR distribution, governance and board portal space.
Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress made so far this year. There is still work to be done, but as I said, we have turned the corner in terms of how we operate the business, and we are very well positioned to deliver meaningful organic growth in the future.
As you can see by the examples I have highlighted, our model, driven by a diverse mix of businesses, provides us with the flexibility and opportunity to both explore and execute on a variety of initiatives. To give you an example, year-to-date, we have seen organic growth, coupled with strong operational focus on expenses, synergy realization and sound capital deployment and returns generated 9 -- 8% non-GAAP EPS growth in the first 9 months of 2016, in addition to significant growth in our dividend. This EPS and dividend growth in turn form the foundation for an impressive 29% total shareholder return in a 12-month period ending September 30.
Now certainly, when it comes to how we look at investing in our future, organic growth is our first priority and our preference. We have a robust process from vetting growth constants internally at Nasdaq through our R&D program and have a strong track record to date with our organic initiatives, some of which I will highlight now.
Clearly, one of the more outstanding initiatives we have undertaken and something we are very proud of is our launch of NFX in 2015. The increasing traction NFX has seen in the energy market over the past year represents a positive vote by market participants and our clients in a more efficient, cost-effective and responsible alternative was and is needed. To highlight our progress, we set the following records in September: Monthly average daily volume was 151,000 contracts. We set no Brent and WTI volume marks each over 70k. Open interest reached a new high before the September roll of 1.2 million contracts, truly impressive.
So perhaps, more importantly, as we look forward, our client onboarding backlog, including merchants and utility end-users, is at a record level. Good days to come. So while we don't consider that NFX has achieved success yet and certainly isn't guaranteed to do so, we can see clearly how continued growth in the coming periods could establish it firmly as a very important and valuable asset.
Another significant investment we have made which has fulfilled a previously untapped need in the marketplace is our effort to transform the private market. Overall, we are pleased with our progress with a 175% year-over-year increase in the number of liquidity events facilitated. This is a great example of how we are exploring ways to apply disruptive technology, like the blockchain and market expertise, to support our clients. Our future depends on how well we see around the corners and apply technology in innovative ways to the benefit of our clients. To this end, we currently have a number of use cases in our pipeline across all of our businesses, and we're excited about the opportunities that leveraging these technologies represent for our clients and our businesses. For example, in September, a new data product suite called Nasdaq Trading Insights, designed to help traders better understand how they perform in the market, how the market behaves and how they can adjust their strategies to be more successful. It combines proprietary data with advanced analytics and machine learning to provide insights and is the first commercial solution to come out of our Information Services innovation lab, which brings together inside and outside technologies, data scientists, software engineers and business experts. It's a great example the kinds of solutions that we're developing today that will harness disruptive technologies and the kind of innovation that you will certainly see more of in Nasdaq, from Nasdaq in the months to come.
In closing, I've talked a lot today about the progress we're making to serve our clients through strategic acquisitions, organic growth initiatives and through the effective use of capital, but in reality, we are -- we view our job as much, much simpler than that. Our job is to listen to our clients and respond to them and to market stimuli, and this quarter's really a testament to our ability to do that effectively on a multitude of levels across this franchise. I have no doubt that the strength of our model, coupled with our ability to apply technology to benefit our clients, will certainly drive this franchise forward for the remainder of this year and into the future.
Now I'll turn the call over to Michael to review the financial details."

My commentary this morning will focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments through our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com.
I'll start by reviewing third quarter revenue performance relative to the prior year quarter as shown on Page 5 of the presentation and organic growth from Page 6.
The 11% or $56 million increase in reported net revenue of $585 million consisted of $58 million in net revenues from our 2016 acquisitions of ISE Marketwired, Boardvantage and Nasdaq CXC, and organic growth in the non-trading segments of $17 million or 5%. This was partially offset by an organic decrease in Market Services net revenues of $20 million or negative 10%, resulting principally from the exceptionally strong multiyear highs in industry volume in the prior year period.
I'm not going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be through the prior year period unless otherwise noted.
Information Services, on Page 7, saw $2 million in organic revenue growth and a $3 million increase related to the ISE and Nasdaq CXC acquisitions. Data Product revenues increased 6%, including organic growth in proprietary data product revenue, the inclusion of revenue associated with the ISE and the Nasdaq CXC acquisitions as well as higher audit collections.
Index Licensing and Services revenue saw a $1 million decline, primarily due to a decrease in the value of underlying assets associated with non-ETP Nasdaq-licensed products and lower fees on derivative products that license Nasdaq indices due to lower volumes.
The operating income margin declined modestly in the third quarter to 71% from 73% in the prior year, due principally to certain temporary expenses, including those associated with new product initiatives.
Technology Solutions revenue, as shown on Page 8, increased $36 million, reflecting a $22 million contribution from the acquisitions of Boardvantage and Marketwired and a $13 million or 10% organic increase. The operating income margin was 18%, up from 15% in the prior year period.
Corporate Solutions revenues increased due to the impact of the 2 acquisitions. Organic revenues were unchanged, which is an improvement from modest declines in recent quarters.
Market Technology revenue increased $14 million or 24%, primarily due to increased revenues from software licensing and support contracts as well as surveillance products. New order intake was $49 million in the third quarter and the prior -- and the period end backlog finished at $738 million, unchanged from the prior year.
Listing Services, on Page 9, saw a $2 million or 3% organic increase in revenues, driven primarily by an increase in Nordic-listing revenue due to new company listings.
Market Services net revenues, on Page 10, saw a $33 million increase from the acquisitions of ISE and Nasdaq CXC, partially offset by a $20 million organic decline due mostly to the tough industry volume comparable in the prior year period, netting to a $13 million increase. Market Services operating income margin totaled 54% versus 55% in the prior year period.
Equity Derivatives trading and clearing net revenues increased 31%, primarily due to the ISE acquisition and higher U.S. market share and legacy Nasdaq markets, partially offset by lower industry trading volumes.
Cash equity trading net revenues decreased 12%, primarily due to lower match market share, industry volumes and U.S. average capture, partially offset by the inclusion of revenues from Nasdaq CXC.
Fixed Income and Commodities Trading and Clearing net revenues decreased 22% from the prior year, due primarily to decline in U.S. fixed income and commodities revenues as well as the impact of trading incentives on NFX revenues.
And you'll note that we've renamed Access and Broker Services to Trade Management Services to better reflect the broader nature and scope of services these revenues represent. And revenues here increased 17% due to the inclusion of revenue from ISE as well as increased demand for connectivity solutions.
Turning to Page 11 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $41 million. This increase included $29 million in expenses from our acquisitions and $13 million or 5% in organic growth, excluding $4 to $5 million in the quarter of acquisition-synergy benefits. Bearing in mind that q-over-q expense comparisons often have significant volatility due to things like changes in the performance-based compensation accruals or nonrecurring items that don't meet the qualifications for a non-GAAP exclusion, I note through the first 9 months of 2016, organic expense growth has been approximately 3%, in line with the same organic expense growth rate we saw in the full year of 2015 period.
Turning to Slide 12. Our revised 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance has been narrowed to $1.22 billion to $1.24 billion or a 4Q range of $323 million to $343 million. This is above the 3Q '16 level, but please keep in mind that there are typically seasonal differences in the 3Q and 4Q expense run rates. For example, the third quarter typically features marketing, professional -- lower marketing, professional, services and travel expenses and some seasonal benefits in compensation.
Non-GAAP operating income increased 6% in the third quarter of 2016, and decreased 6% on an organic basis. Net interest expense was $36 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $9 million versus the prior year period, reflecting the additional interest expense from our recent bond offerings. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for 3Q '16 was 34.2% and within our unchanged 33% to 35% full year guidance. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for 3Q '16 was $154 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared to $151 million or $0.88 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015.
Now moving on to cash flow and capital. Please turn to Slide 16. We repurchased $55 million in stock during the third quarter of 2016, bringing our total buybacks to $100 million in the first 9 months of 2016. As of September 30, 2016 there is $429 million remaining on the Board repurchase authorization. Through dividends and repurchases, Nasdaq returned nearly $250 million in capital to shareholders year-to-date in 2016.
And finally, while we don't have Ron on the call with us today, I'm sure he is listening, and I just want to thank him for the great team that I've inherited and for the immense support that he's provided me as I've transitioned into my role here at Nasdaq. And with that, I thank you for your time, and I turn it back over to Bob."

So I would direct you to look at the combined market share, and I made reference to that in my comments there. I'd also make -- mention the fact that we certainly have seen with the OCC changes, fewer dividend trades, strategy trades. So I think that has had a one-time impact on the market share going forward.

I think it will certainly provide them synergy opportunities, and I think it represents a return to their investors. We think strategically, it doesn't change much. We're tough competitors with both CBOE and Bats today and we think that will continue there. So we're happy, obviously, they have Bats and CBOE in a public forum and represent a rational competitor, and we're running an efficient market place so the way we look at it, the competition against different players where efficiency is important is something we welcome. And we also know, strategically, we have a scale, so we have the ability to lever more flow against our highly efficient platforms. So we feel good about that. So the options market is something we believe in. We think it's going through a down cycle with respect to overall volume trends, but we see that growing into the future. And as previously highlighted, we think complex is going to be an increasingly important part of the marketplace. And certainly, our job with ISE is to get through the transition as quickly as we can. And as I've said, we've made great progress on it. There are a lot of work to do, but we have got a very talented team focused on it, and I think you'll see us achieve that in a rapid pace."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review another quarter in which Nasdaq set several financial highs as well as discuss progress on our key initiatives and our investments.What is interesting and satisfying to",2600,"Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review another quarter in which Nasdaq set several financial highs as well as discuss progress on our key initiatives and our investments.
What is interesting and satisfying to me about this quarter is the balanced model we have created and a strategy which focuses first and foremost on serving our clients' needs and this continues to deliver. As we have proven quarter after quarter, when we serve our clients well, we are privileged to be able to both invest in our future and serve our shareholders well. A principal way we achieve this is our focus on technology leadership in which we can lever our expertise, our relative advantages in a manner that benefits clients and creates real opportunities for growth across our businesses. I will focus my remarks today on these central points and how they manifest in our results and drive our efforts as a financial technology company.
During the quarter, Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $585 million, non-GAAP operating income of $268 million and non-GAAP net income of $154 million, which set all-time highs, while non-GAAP EPS of $0.91 tied our record high. When you look at the quarter, to me, what is most interesting about our performance is our continued consistent march in generating organic growth across our non-transaction business segments. Despite lower volumes in the transactional environment, the diversity, resiliency and the complementary nature of our model continues to drive us forward.
Just to highlight for everyone on this call, again, regarding the significance that our model plays in our results, post the ISE acquisition, over 75% of our net revenues during the third quarter of 2016 came from subscription and recurring revenues, a record $441 million. Quite a remarkable testament to the evolution of this franchise.
During the quarter, we saw a 5% organic net revenue growth across the non-trading segments, which provide the vast majority of the subscription and recurring revenues, with the biggest contribution to our growth coming from the Technology Solutions segment, with 10% organic growth, truly outstanding.
In addition to strong organic growth progress, we also continued to successfully integrate the 4 acquisitions made in 2016, which are right down the center of our bowling alley. We've already begin to deliver significant accretion to our shareholders from these acquisitions. I will come back to that in more detail later in my remarks.
As I mentioned, we are maniacally focused on the client, their problems and pain points and what we can do to solve them and unlock new opportunities.
So now, I want to turn and highlight on how this focus is responsible for generating opportunities in our non-transaction businesses and driving the growth we saw during the quarter.
As I pointed out early on, one of the great advantages Nasdaq has is in technology leadership, which provides us with a variety of options for responding to our clients' complex challenges and offering new and better solutions. Clearly, one of the best examples of this in action is in our Market Technology business, where over the past several years, we have shifted our strategy from a product-centric approach to a more holistic solutions approach. The investments we have made to strengthen our SMARTS surveillance, post-trade and risk and compliance offerings have resulted in strong growth, and we continue to see strong uptick across these businesses during the third quarter, as our clients continue to turn to us for these mission-critical solutions.
On the surveillance side, we clearly are the beneficiary of industry trends towards more transparency and regulation, especially in Europe, where the Market Abuse Regulation, MAR, came into play at the beginning of July of this year.
Importantly, we see also other regions are continuing to bolster the regulatory requirements with regard to surveillance and compliance, and also that the requirements on market participants are extending beyond the sell side to impact the buy side directly, something we've worked very hard to position the franchise for the new buy-side SMARTS offering.
Certainly fundamental to our approach in the Market Technology business has been the introduction of the Nasdaq Financial Framework. We announced this in May of this year. This financial framework is truly a game-changer. It provides a unifying framework for all of our products and importantly, allows us to deploy innovative capabilities, such as the blockchain. This is a leading example how we are in lockstep in an integrated manner with the balance of our products as we integrate this Nasdaq Financial Framework.
Staying within our Technology Solutions segment for a moment, I want to highlight the progress we made in our Corporate Solutions business during the quarter. When we look at Corporate Solutions, we have been on a mission to add greater levels of value for our clients through product enhancements, new technology and scale. Key to our efforts are the integration efforts of the Marketwired and Boardvantage businesses and our ongoing focus to provide our clients with more robust solutions, like IR Insight. We have migrated 80% of our legacy platforms client base, with over 3,800 users, on the new platform to date. While we still have more work left to do, we do believe we have turned an important corner in making this business both more effective and, now, efficient. This is very encouraging and, certainly, indicative of the dedication by this very talented team to our clients and speaks well of our ability to deliver in the quarters to come.
Now clearly, one of the businesses that benefits from our success in Corporate Solutions is our Listing Services business. Growth in Listing Services during the quarter continued to be impressive. In fact, I would say that our Listing franchise has never been stronger. This is evident in both our U.S. and Nordic franchises.
In the U.S., I'm very pleased to report our competitive position continues to increase. Year-to-date, we've achieved an outstanding 74% win rate in IPOs, welcoming Nutanix, The Trade Desk and Talent in the third quarter. Additionally, in October this year, the largest energy IPO of the year listed with Nasdaq, Extraction Oil & Gas.
In switches, we welcome 16 companies thus far in 2016 with a combined market capitalization of $42 billion from our competitor, bringing our total switch market cap to $850 billion, $1 trillion is not far away since regulatory changes opened this channel up in 2002.
In ETP listings, we've grown our issue account 48% year-over-year.
The Nordics, in many ways, is even more impressive. We're very proud of the entrepreneurial companies which continue to choose Nasdaq as their listing home. There are 57 new company listings to date through September 30, the most of any European financial center. For the first time in my memory, the Nordics have out-raised or out-listed London, certainly record performance. And this does follow a great year last year, where we had 91 listings.
The Nordic market also continues to gain attention from companies domiciled outside the Nordics. When you look at this together, it is evident that the platform we have built that addresses not only capital-raising needs, but also provides companies with mission-critical solutions and intelligent solutions that support our companies through their entire life as a public company is resonating in the marketplace.
While the non-transactional businesses continued a very consistent healthy expansion, it should never be forgotten that our suite of leading trading marketplaces are absolutely fundamental to our strategy. To that effect, looking into our most foundational trading business, U.S. equities, we had a bit of a mix trend in terms of share and capture in the third quarter. I am pleased to report that average capture, in particular in U.S. equities, showed sequential improvement in the third quarter, but market share was marginally lower. The biggest driver of changes was industry mix. In particular, more off-exchange trading, in particular in Tape C or Nasdaq-listed securities, where we are obviously heavily overweight. In this relatively low volatility, low-volume environment, we tend to see lower market share, but this is somewhat mitigated by a tendency to see an increase in capture. In addition, we tend to see increased revenue from our off-exchange Trade Reporting Facility, the TRF. Our TRF serves over 90% of this market, which is currently around 35% to 40%. So those are mitigants to the decrease in the volatility and the volume in the market.
Now when you look at our performance, we continue to enjoy a very strong lead in Nasdaq-listed Tape C securities, where in the third quarter, for example, we matched 28% of overall volumes, and we represented 64% of volumes, including our TRF off-exchange trade reporting services, which leaves only a combined 36% share for every other SEC-regulated exchange for Tape C.
We continue to see good opportunity to improve our share in the coming periods, especially given that our competitive position relative to other exchanges remains strong, and we have important innovations in the pipeline such as our Extended Life Order or ELO.
As I mentioned earlier, we have completed 4 acquisitions this year, and what's most impressive is that our teams have done an outstanding job in incorporating the talent, resources and technologies these companies bring to Nasdaq. Strategically, these acquisitions play to our core strengths or down the center of our bowling alleys, as I like to say. They maximize our chance for success. This is the first full quarter with all 4 of the acquisitions under the Nasdaq umbrella, and they're already delivering meaningful accretion to our shareholders.
Let me share with you some of the highlights on our progress. We closed the transaction of the International Securities Exchange, ISE, in June. This was significantly ahead of schedule, and since that time, we have been executing on our objective that ISE lever the best technologies and features from both Nasdaq and ISE to serve our clients. Our continued focus on our clients throughout this process is important to us, and I'm pleased that we've continued to earn from these customers market share at industry-leading levels within a point or 2 of the roughly 40% share that Nasdaq and ISE separately totaled in the periods prior to the combination.
In addition, we've been able to realize $15 million in run rate synergies for both ISE and Nasdaq's CXC at the end of the third quarter, and these acquisitions our accreting to our shareholders ahead of schedule.
In our Corporate Solutions business, we closed Marketwired and Boardvantage in the first and second quarters, respectively. We continue to make strong progress integrating these businesses into our offering. These acquisitions are very appealing in that they both significantly expand our base of corporate customers, putting our total corporate customer base to approximately 18,000 clients, and as we integrate them, will enable us to accelerate the depth and the breadth and speed at which we innovate and bring exciting new products to PR distribution, governance and board portal space.
Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress made so far this year. There is still work to be done, but as I said, we have turned the corner in terms of how we operate the business, and we are very well positioned to deliver meaningful organic growth in the future.
As you can see by the examples I have highlighted, our model, driven by a diverse mix of businesses, provides us with the flexibility and opportunity to both explore and execute on a variety of initiatives. To give you an example, year-to-date, we have seen organic growth, coupled with strong operational focus on expenses, synergy realization and sound capital deployment and returns generated 9 -- 8% non-GAAP EPS growth in the first 9 months of 2016, in addition to significant growth in our dividend. This EPS and dividend growth in turn form the foundation for an impressive 29% total shareholder return in a 12-month period ending September 30.
Now certainly, when it comes to how we look at investing in our future, organic growth is our first priority and our preference. We have a robust process from vetting growth constants internally at Nasdaq through our R&D program and have a strong track record to date with our organic initiatives, some of which I will highlight now.
Clearly, one of the more outstanding initiatives we have undertaken and something we are very proud of is our launch of NFX in 2015. The increasing traction NFX has seen in the energy market over the past year represents a positive vote by market participants and our clients in a more efficient, cost-effective and responsible alternative was and is needed. To highlight our progress, we set the following records in September. Monthly average daily volume was 151,000 contracts. We set no Brent and WTI volume marks, each over 70k. Open interest reached a new high before the September roll of 1.2 million contracts, truly impressive.
So perhaps, more importantly, as we look forward, our client onboarding backlog, including merchants and utility end-users, is at a record level. Good days to come. So while we don't consider that NFX has achieved success yet and certainly isn't guaranteed to do so, we can see clearly how continued growth in the coming periods could establish it firmly as a very important and valuable asset.
Another significant investment we have made which has fulfilled a previously untapped need in the marketplace is our effort to transform the private market. Overall, we are pleased with our progress with a 175% year-over-year increase in the number of liquidity events facilitated. This is a great example of how we are exploring ways to apply disruptive technology, like the blockchain and market expertise, to support our clients. Our future depends on how well we see around the corners and apply technology in innovative ways to the benefit of our clients. To this end, we currently have a number of use cases in our pipeline across all of our businesses, and we're excited about the opportunities that leveraging these technologies represent for our clients and our businesses. For example, in September, a new data product suite called Nasdaq Trading Insights, designed to help traders better understand how they perform in the market, how the market behaves and how they can adjust their strategies to be more successful. It combines proprietary data with advanced analytics and machine learning to provide insights and is the first commercial solution to come out of our Information Services innovation lab, which brings together inside and outside technologies, data scientists, software engineers and business experts. It is a great example of the kinds of solutions that we are developing today that will harness disruptive technologies and the kind of innovation that you will certainly see more of in Nasdaq, from Nasdaq in the months to come.
In closing, I've talked a lot today about the progress we're making to serve our clients through strategic acquisitions, organic growth initiatives and through the effective use of capital, but in reality, we are -- we view our job as much, much simpler than that. Our job is to listen to our clients and respond to them and to market stimuli, and this quarter's really a testament to our ability to do that effectively on a multitude of levels across this franchise. I have no doubt that the strength of our model, coupled with our ability to apply technology to benefit our clients, will certainly drive this franchise forward for the remainder of this year and into the future.
Now I'll turn the call over to Michael to review the financial details."

My commentary this morning will focus on our non-GAAP results.

My commentary this morning will focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments through our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com.
I'll start by reviewing third quarter revenue performance relative to the prior year quarter as shown on Page 5 of the presentation and organic growth from Page 6.
The 11% or $56 million increase in reported net revenue of $585 million consisted of $58 million in net revenues from our 2016 acquisitions of ISE, Marketwired, Boardvantage and Nasdaq CXC, and organic growth in the non-trading segments of $17 million or 5%. This was partially offset by an organic decrease in Market Services net revenues of $20 million or negative 10%, resulting principally from the exceptionally strong multiyear highs in industry volume in the prior year period.
I'm not going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be through the prior year period unless otherwise noted.
Information Services, on Page 7, saw $2 million in organic revenue growth and a $3 million increase related to the ISE and Nasdaq CXC acquisitions. Data Product revenues increased 6%, including organic growth in proprietary data product revenue, the inclusion of revenue associated with the ISE and the Nasdaq CXC acquisitions as well as higher audit collections.
Index Licensing and Services revenue saw a $1 million decline, primarily due to a decrease in the value of underlying assets associated with non-ETP Nasdaq-licensed products and lower fees on derivative products that license Nasdaq indices due to lower volumes.
The operating income margin declined modestly in the third quarter to 71% from 73% in the prior year, due principally to certain temporary expenses, including those associated with new product initiatives.
Technology Solutions revenue, as shown on Page 8, increased $36 million, reflecting a $22 million contribution from the acquisitions of Boardvantage and Marketwired and a $13 million or 10% organic increase. The operating income margin was 18%, up from 15% in the prior year period.
Corporate Solutions revenues increased due to the impact of the 2 acquisitions. Organic revenues were unchanged, which is an improvement from modest declines in recent quarters.
Market Technology revenue increased $14 million or 24%, primarily due to increased revenues from software licensing and support contracts as well as surveillance products. New order intake was $49 million in the third quarter and the prior -- and the period end backlog finished at $738 million, unchanged from the prior year.
Listing Services, on Page 9, saw a $2 million or 3% organic increase in revenues, driven primarily by an increase in Nordic-listing revenue due to new company listings.
Market Services net revenues, on Page 10, saw a $33 million increase from the acquisitions of ISE and Nasdaq CXC, partially offset by a $20 million organic decline due mostly to the tough industry volume comparable in the prior year period, netting to a $13 million increase. Market Services operating income margin totaled 54% versus 55% in the prior year period.
Equity Derivatives trading and clearing net revenues increased 31%, primarily due to the ISE acquisition and higher U.S. market share and legacy Nasdaq markets, partially offset by lower industry trading volumes.
Cash equity trading net revenues decreased 12%, primarily due to lower match market share, industry volumes and U.S. average capture, partially offset by the inclusion of revenues from Nasdaq CXC.
Fixed Income and Commodities Trading and Clearing net revenues decreased 22% from the prior year, due primarily to declines in U.S. fixed income and commodities revenues as well as the impact of trading incentives on NFX revenues.
And you'll note that we've renamed Access and Broker Services to Trade Management Services to better reflect the broader nature and scope of services these revenues represent. And revenues here increased 17% due to the inclusion of revenue from ISE as well as increased demand for connectivity solutions.
Turning to Page 11 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $41 million. This increase included $29 million in expenses from our acquisitions and $13 million or 5% in organic growth, excluding $4 to $5 million in the quarter of acquisition-synergy benefits. Bearing in mind that q-over-q expense comparisons often have significant volatility due to things like changes in the performance-based compensation accruals or nonrecurring items that don't meet the qualifications for a non-GAAP exclusion, I note through the first 9 months of 2016, organic expense growth has been approximately 3%, in line with the same organic expense growth rate we saw in the full year of 2015 period.
Turning to Slide 12. Our revised 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance has been narrowed to $1.22 billion to $1.24 billion or a 4Q range of $323 million to $343 million. This is above the 3Q '16 level, but please keep in mind that there are typically seasonal differences in the 3Q and 4Q expense run rates. For example, the third quarter typically features marketing, professional -- lower marketing, professional, services and travel expenses and some seasonal benefits in compensation.
Non-GAAP operating income increased 6% in the third quarter of 2016, and decreased 6% on an organic basis. Net interest expense was $36 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $9 million versus the prior year period, reflecting the additional interest expense from our recent bond offerings. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for 3Q '16 was 34.2% and within our unchanged 33% to 35% full year guidance. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for 3Q '16 was $154 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared to $151 million or $0.88 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015.
Now moving on to cash flow and capital. Please turn to Slide 16. We repurchased $55 million in stock during the third quarter of 2016, bringing our total buybacks to $100 million in the first 9 months of 2016. As of September 30, 2016 there is $429 million remaining on the Board repurchase authorization. Through dividends and repurchases, Nasdaq returned nearly $250 million in capital to shareholders year-to-date in 2016.
And finally, while we don't have Ron on the call with us today, I'm sure he is listening, and I just want to thank him for the great team that I've inherited and for the immense support that he's provided me as I've transitioned into my role here at Nasdaq. And with that, I thank you for your time, and I turn it back over to Bob."

So I would direct you to look at the combined market share, and I made reference to that in my comments there. I'd also make -- mention the fact that we certainly have seen with the OCC changes, fewer dividend trades, strategy trades. So I think that has had a one-time impact on the market share going forward. And in terms of where we are, we certainly believe that complex order flow is an increasing part of the market going forward, and we have the leading position.

It seems like the upgrade definitely has implications for the industry from an SIP perspective, but then also the read from some of the industry folks, it seems like they're starting to take a little bit more issue with some of the premium charges associated with things like Ultra longer term as market data cost is higher for them.

So it's important for us not to just be engaged with happy meetings, but the customers had to put real skin in the game to launch this thing, and they've done that and they've come through. So as we stand here today, our progress is certainly more significant than we would have planned for at this point in time. And as I mentioned in my comments, the onboarding of new customers is at a record level. What I didn't mention is, we have additional large industry participants who want to become part of the partnership, and I think the partnership will expand to allow them in. So we're living in happy times where there's a lot of inbound. So our success today is very strong. The inbound, as a forward indicator, would say there's more success to come. But we remain quite focused, and we know that while we've had great success, we need to get higher level of success in order to have what I call definable asset. So I would say this, Brian, there is zero, I mean zero thought with respect to the last part of your comment, of us thinking about curtailing it.

And we also referenced the fact that there are, in fact, dark pool capabilities that we can lever in this space. I'd also make the general longer-term comment, Mary Jo White's comments with respect to implementing a right ATS kind of regime in the treasury market would be seen, I think, is a positive for our efforts in the space. So we like our internal efforts between the 2 things we have in place today. And we like the general direction of the industry. And I think John will continue to add value and, certainly, will, I think, augment and hopefully improve the strategy going forward."

We pay attention to many things. And obviously, 90-something percent, or 98% of the things we think about don't happen. We were fortunate that the, really 5 deals, including Second Market, after looking at them for a long period of time, came into play. And we were able to then execute and you can see the results on our efforts today, and those results will have a more material impact as we go forward into 2017. I think we still live in a time where valuations tend to be higher than they should be. You have a number of companies who want to be bought at growth company valuations when in fact they're not growing. So we do not stomach that kind of disconnect, and we pay attention.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review another quarter in which Nasdaq set several financial highs as well as discuss progress on our key initiatives and our investments.What is interesting and satisfying to",2600,"Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to review another quarter in which Nasdaq set several financial highs as well as discuss progress on our key initiatives and our investments.
What is interesting and satisfying to me about this quarter is the balanced model we have created and a strategy which focuses first and foremost on serving our clients' needs and this continues to deliver. As we have proven quarter after quarter, when we serve our clients well, we are privileged to be able to both invest in our future and serve our shareholders well. A principal way we achieve this is our focus on technology leadership in which we can lever our expertise, our relative advantages in a manner that benefits clients and creates real opportunities for growth across our businesses. I will focus my remarks today on these central points and how they manifest in our results and drive our efforts as a financial technology company.
During the quarter, Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $585 million, non-GAAP operating income of $268 million and non-GAAP net income of $154 million, which set all-time highs, while non-GAAP EPS of $0.91 tied our record high. When you look at the quarter, to me, what is most interesting about our performance is our continued consistent march in generating organic growth across our non-transaction business segments. Despite lower volumes in the transactional environment, the diversity, resiliency and the complementary nature of our model continues to drive us forward.
Just to highlight for everyone on this call, again, regarding the significance that our model plays in our results, post the ISE acquisition, over 75% of our net revenues during the third quarter of 2016 came from subscription and recurring revenues, a record $441 million. Quite a remarkable testament to the evolution of this franchise.
During the quarter, we saw a 5% organic net revenue growth across the non-trading segments, which provide the vast majority of the subscription and recurring revenues, with the biggest contribution to our growth coming from the Technology Solutions segment, with 10% organic growth, truly outstanding.
In addition to strong organic growth progress, we also continued to successfully integrate the 4 acquisitions made in 2016, which are right down the center of our bowling alley. We've already begin to deliver significant accretion to our shareholders from these acquisitions. I will come back to that in more detail later in my remarks.
As I mentioned, we are maniacally focused on the client, their problems and pain points and what we can do to solve them and unlock new opportunities.
So now, I want to turn and highlight on how this focus is responsible for generating opportunities in our non-transaction businesses and driving the growth we saw during the quarter.
As I pointed out early on, one of the great advantages Nasdaq has is in technology leadership, which provides us with a variety of options for responding to our clients' complex challenges and offering new and better solutions. Clearly, one of the best examples of this in action is in our Market Technology business, where over the past several years, we have shifted our strategy from a product-centric approach to a more holistic solutions approach. The investments we have made to strengthen our SMARTS surveillance, post-trade and risk and compliance offerings have resulted in strong growth, and we continue to see strong uptick across these businesses during the third quarter, as our clients continue to turn to us for these mission-critical solutions.
On the surveillance side, we clearly are the beneficiary of industry trends towards more transparency and regulation, especially in Europe, where the Market Abuse Regulation, MAR, came into play at the beginning of July of this year.
Importantly, we see also other regions are continuing to bolster the regulatory requirements with regard to surveillance and compliance, and also that the requirements on market participants are extending beyond the sell side to impact the buy side directly, something we've worked very hard to position the franchise for the new buy-side SMARTS offering.
Certainly fundamental to our approach in the Market Technology business has been the introduction of the Nasdaq Financial Framework. We announced this in May of this year. This financial framework is truly a game-changer. It provides a unifying framework for all of our products and importantly, allows us to deploy innovative capabilities, such as the blockchain. This is a leading example how we are in lockstep in an integrated manner with the balance of our products as we integrate this Nasdaq Financial Framework.
Staying within our Technology Solutions segment for a moment, I want to highlight the progress we made in our Corporate Solutions business during the quarter. When we look at Corporate Solutions, we have been on a mission to add greater levels of value for our clients through product enhancements, new technology and scale. Key to our efforts are the integration efforts of the Marketwired and Boardvantage businesses and our ongoing focus to provide our clients with more robust solutions, like IR Insight. We have migrated 80% of our legacy platforms client base, with over 3,800 users, on the new platform to date. While we still have more work left to do, we do believe we have turned an important corner in making this business both more effective and, now, efficient. This is very encouraging and, certainly, indicative of the dedication by this very talented team to our clients and speaks well of our ability to deliver in the quarters to come.
Now clearly, one of the businesses that benefits from our success in Corporate Solutions is our Listing Services business. Growth in Listing Services during the quarter continued to be impressive. In fact, I would say that our Listing franchise has never been stronger. This is evident in both our U.S. and Nordic franchises.
In the U.S., I'm very pleased to report our competitive position continues to increase. Year-to-date, we've achieved an outstanding 74% win rate in IPOs, welcoming Nutanix, The Trade Desk and Talent in the third quarter. Additionally, in October this year, the largest energy IPO of the year listed with Nasdaq, Extraction Oil & Gas.
In switches, we welcome 16 companies thus far in 2016 with a combined market capitalization of $42 billion from our competitor, bringing our total switch market cap to $850 billion, $1 trillion is not far away since regulatory changes opened this channel up in 2002.
In ETP listings, we've grown our issue account 48% year-over-year.
The Nordics, in many ways, is even more impressive. We're very proud of the entrepreneurial companies which continue to choose Nasdaq as their listing home. There are 57 new company listings to date through September 30, the most of any European financial center. For the first time in my memory, the Nordics have out-raised or out-listed London, certainly record performance. And this does follow a great year last year, where we had 91 listings.
The Nordic market also continues to gain attention from companies domiciled outside the Nordics. When you look at this together, it is evident that the platform we have built that addresses not only capital-raising needs, but also provides companies with mission-critical solutions and intelligent solutions that support our companies through their entire life as a public company is resonating in the marketplace.
While the non-transactional businesses continued a very consistent healthy expansion, it should never be forgotten that our suite of leading trading marketplaces are absolutely fundamental to our strategy. To that effect, looking into our most foundational trading business, U.S. equities, we had a bit of a mix trend in terms of share and capture in the third quarter. I am pleased to report that average capture, in particular in U.S. equities, showed sequential improvement in the third quarter, but market share was marginally lower. The biggest driver of changes was industry mix. In particular, more off-exchange trading, in particular in Tape C or Nasdaq-listed securities, where we are obviously heavily overweight. In this relatively low volatility, low-volume environment, we tend to see lower market share, but this is somewhat mitigated by a tendency to see an increase in capture. In addition, we tend to see increased revenue from our off-exchange Trade Reporting Facility, the TRF. Our TRF serves over 90% of this market, which is currently around 35% to 40%. So those are mitigants to the decrease in the volatility and the volume in the market.
Now when you look at our performance, we continue to enjoy a very strong lead in Nasdaq-listed Tape C securities, where in the third quarter, for example, we matched 28% of overall volumes, and we represented 64% of volumes, including our TRF off-exchange trade reporting services, which leaves only a combined 36% share for every other SEC-regulated exchange for Tape C.
We continue to see good opportunity to improve our share in the coming periods, especially given that our competitive position relative to other exchanges remains strong, and we have important innovations in the pipeline such as our Extended Life Order or ELO.
As I mentioned earlier, we have completed 4 acquisitions this year, and what's most impressive is that our teams have done an outstanding job in incorporating the talent, resources and technologies these companies bring to Nasdaq. Strategically, these acquisitions play to our core strengths or down the center of our bowling alleys, as I like to say. They maximize our chance for success. This is the first full quarter with all 4 of the acquisitions under the Nasdaq umbrella, and they're already delivering meaningful accretion to our shareholders.
Let me share with you some of the highlights on our progress. We closed the transaction of the International Securities Exchange, ISE, in June. This was significantly ahead of schedule, and since that time, we have been executing on our objective that ISE lever the best technologies and features from both Nasdaq and ISE to serve our clients. Our continued focus on our clients throughout this process is important to us, and I'm pleased that we've continued to earn from these customers market share at industry-leading levels within a point or 2 of the roughly 40% share that Nasdaq and ISE separately totaled in the periods prior to the combination.
In addition, we've been able to realize $15 million in run rate synergies for both ISE and Nasdaq's CXC at the end of the third quarter, and these acquisitions our accreting to our shareholders ahead of schedule.
In our Corporate Solutions business, we closed Marketwired and Boardvantage in the first and second quarters, respectively. We continue to make strong progress integrating these businesses into our offering. These acquisitions are very appealing in that they both significantly expand our base of corporate customers, putting our total corporate customer base to approximately 18,000 clients, and as we integrate them, will enable us to accelerate the depth and the breadth and speed at which we innovate and bring exciting new products to PR distribution, governance and board portal space.
Overall, I'm very pleased with the progress made so far this year. There is still work to be done, but as I said, we have turned the corner in terms of how we operate the business, and we are very well positioned to deliver meaningful organic growth in the future.
As you can see by the examples I have highlighted, our model, driven by a diverse mix of businesses, provides us with the flexibility and opportunity to both explore and execute on a variety of initiatives. To give you an example, year-to-date, we have seen organic growth, coupled with strong operational focus on expenses, synergy realization and sound capital deployment and returns generated 9 -- 8% non-GAAP EPS growth in the first 9 months of 2016, in addition to significant growth in our dividend. This EPS and dividend growth in turn form the foundation for an impressive 29% total shareholder return in a 12-month period ending September 30.
Now certainly, when it comes to how we look at investing in our future, organic growth is our first priority and our preference. We have a robust process from vetting growth constants internally at Nasdaq through our R&D program and have a strong track record to date with our organic initiatives, some of which I will highlight now.
Clearly, one of the more outstanding initiatives we have undertaken and something we are very proud of is our launch of NFX in 2015. The increasing traction NFX has seen in the energy market over the past year represents a positive vote by market participants and our clients in a more efficient, cost-effective and responsible alternative was and is needed. To highlight our progress, we set the following records in September. Monthly average daily volume was 151,000 contracts. We set no Brent and WTI volume marks, each over 70k. Open interest reached a new high before the September roll of 1.2 million contracts, truly impressive.
So perhaps, more importantly, as we look forward, our client onboarding backlog, including merchants and utility end-users, is at a record level. Good days to come. So while we don't consider that NFX has achieved success yet and certainly isn't guaranteed to do so, we can see clearly how continued growth in the coming periods could establish it firmly as a very important and valuable asset.
Another significant investment we have made which has fulfilled a previously untapped need in the marketplace is our effort to transform the private market. Overall, we are pleased with our progress with a 175% year-over-year increase in the number of liquidity events facilitated. This is a great example of how we are exploring ways to apply disruptive technology, like the blockchain and market expertise, to support our clients. Our future depends on how well we see around the corners and apply technology in innovative ways to the benefit of our clients. To this end, we currently have a number of use cases in our pipeline across all of our businesses, and we're excited about the opportunities that leveraging these technologies represent for our clients and our businesses. For example, in September, a new data product suite called Nasdaq Trading Insights, designed to help traders better understand how they perform in the market, how the market behaves and how they can adjust their strategies to be more successful. It combines proprietary data with advanced analytics and machine learning to provide insights and is the first commercial solution to come out of our Information Services innovation lab, which brings together inside and outside technologies, data scientists, software engineers and business experts. It is a great example of the kinds of solutions that we are developing today that will harness disruptive technologies and the kind of innovation that you will certainly see more of in Nasdaq, from Nasdaq in the months to come.
In closing, I've talked a lot today about the progress we're making to serve our clients through strategic acquisitions, organic growth initiatives and through the effective use of capital, but in reality, we are -- we view our job as much, much simpler than that. Our job is to listen to our clients and respond to them and to market stimuli, and this quarter's really a testament to our ability to do that effectively on a multitude of levels across this franchise. I have no doubt that the strength of our model, coupled with our ability to apply technology to benefit our clients, will certainly drive this franchise forward for the remainder of this year and into the future.
Now I'll turn the call over to Michael to review the financial details."

My commentary this morning will focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments through our press release and in t",1096,"Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. My commentary this morning will focus on our non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments through our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com.
I'll start by reviewing third quarter revenue performance relative to the prior year quarter as shown on Page 5 of the presentation and organic growth from Page 6.
The 11% or $56 million increase in reported net revenue of $585 million consisted of $58 million in net revenues from our 2016 acquisitions of ISE, Marketwired, Boardvantage and Nasdaq CXC, and organic growth in the non-trading segments of $17 million or 5%. This was partially offset by an organic decrease in Market Services net revenues of $20 million or negative 10%, resulting principally from the exceptionally strong multiyear highs in industry volume in the prior year period.
I'm not going to go over some highlights within each of our reporting segments. All comparisons will be through the prior year period unless otherwise noted.
Information Services, on Page 7, saw $2 million in organic revenue growth and a $3 million increase related to the ISE and Nasdaq CXC acquisitions. Data Product revenues increased 6%, including organic growth in proprietary data product revenue, the inclusion of revenue associated with the ISE and the Nasdaq CXC acquisitions as well as higher audit collections.
Index Licensing and Services revenue saw a $1 million decline, primarily due to a decrease in the value of underlying assets associated with non-ETP Nasdaq-licensed products and lower fees on derivative products that license Nasdaq indices due to lower volumes.
The operating income margin declined modestly in the third quarter to 71% from 73% in the prior year, due principally to certain temporary expenses, including those associated with new product initiatives.
Technology Solutions revenue, as shown on Page 8, increased $36 million, reflecting a $22 million contribution from the acquisitions of Boardvantage and Marketwired and a $13 million or 10% organic increase. The operating income margin was 18%, up from 15% in the prior year period.
Corporate Solutions revenues increased due to the impact of the 2 acquisitions. Organic revenues were unchanged, which is an improvement from modest declines in recent quarters.
Market Technology revenue increased $14 million or 24%, primarily due to increased revenues from software licensing and support contracts as well as surveillance products. New order intake was $49 million in the third quarter and the prior -- and the period end backlog finished at $738 million, unchanged from the prior year.
Listing Services, on Page 9, saw a $2 million or 3% organic increase in revenues, driven primarily by an increase in Nordic-listing revenue due to new company listings.
Market Services net revenues, on Page 10, saw a $33 million increase from the acquisitions of ISE and Nasdaq CXC, partially offset by a $20 million organic decline due mostly to the tough industry volume comparable in the prior year period, netting to a $13 million increase. Market Services operating income margin totaled 54% versus 55% in the prior year period.
Equity Derivatives trading and clearing net revenues increased 31%, primarily due to the ISE acquisition and higher U.S. market share and legacy Nasdaq markets, partially offset by lower industry trading volumes.
Cash equity trading net revenues decreased 12%, primarily due to lower match market share, industry volumes and U.S. average capture, partially offset by the inclusion of revenues from Nasdaq CXC.
Fixed Income and Commodities Trading and Clearing net revenues decreased 22% from the prior year, due primarily to declines in U.S. fixed income and commodities revenues as well as the impact of trading incentives on NFX revenues.
And you'll note that we've renamed Access and Broker Services to Trade Management Services to better reflect the broader nature and scope of services these revenues represent. And revenues here increased 17% due to the inclusion of revenue from ISE as well as increased demand for connectivity solutions.
Turning to Page 11 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $41 million. This increase included $29 million in expenses from our acquisitions and $13 million or 5% in organic growth, excluding $4 to $5 million in the quarter of acquisition-synergy benefits. Bearing in mind that q-over-q expense comparisons often have significant volatility due to things like changes in the performance-based compensation accruals or nonrecurring items that don't meet the qualifications for a non-GAAP exclusion, I note through the first 9 months of 2016, organic expense growth has been approximately 3%, in line with the same organic expense growth rate we saw in the full year of 2015 period.
Turning to Slide 12. Our revised 2016 non-GAAP operating expense guidance has been narrowed to $1.22 billion to $1.24 billion or a 4Q range of $323 million to $343 million. This is above the 3Q '16 level, but please keep in mind that there are typically seasonal differences in the 3Q and 4Q expense run rates. For example, the third quarter typically features marketing, professional -- lower marketing, professional, services and travel expenses and some seasonal benefits in compensation.
Non-GAAP operating income increased 6% in the third quarter of 2016, and decreased 6% on an organic basis. Net interest expense was $36 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $9 million versus the prior year period, reflecting the additional interest expense from our recent bond offerings. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for 3Q '16 was 34.2% and within our unchanged 33% to 35% full year guidance. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for 3Q '16 was $154 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared to $151 million or $0.88 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2015.
Now moving on to cash flow and capital. Please turn to Slide 16. We repurchased $55 million in stock during the third quarter of 2016, bringing our total buybacks to $100 million in the first 9 months of 2016. As of September 30, 2016 there is $429 million remaining on the Board repurchase authorization. Through dividends and repurchases, Nasdaq returned nearly $250 million in capital to shareholders year-to-date in 2016.
And finally, while we don't have Ron on the call with us today, I'm sure he is listening, and I just want to thank him for the great team that I've inherited and for the immense support that he's provided me as I've transitioned into my role here at Nasdaq. And with that, I thank you for your time, and I turn it back over to Bob."

One is, I said on the prior call, we're managing the market share on a consolidated basis. We have a number of licenses. They're all important to us, and we'll definitely take certain actions, which have to have a positive impact on one of the licenses, and a partially negative on the other. So I would direct you to look at the combined market share, and I made reference to that in my comments there. I'd also make -- mention the fact that we certainly have seen with the OCC changes, fewer dividend trades, strategy trades. So I think that has had a one-time impact on the market share going forward. And in terms of where we are, we certainly believe that complex order flow is an increasing part of the market going forward, and we have the leading position. We are going to continue to invest in that, and we feel we will benefit from that trend line."

I think it will certainly provide them synergy opportunities, and I think it represents a return to their investors. We think strategically, it doesn't change much. We're tough competitors with both CBOE and Bats today and we think that will continue there. So we're happy, obviously, they have Bats and CBOE in a public forum and represent a rational competitor, and we run an efficient market place so the way we look at it, the competition against different players where efficiency is important is something we welcome. And we also know, strategically, we have a scale, so we have the ability to lever more flow against our highly efficient platforms. So we feel good about that. So the options market is something we believe in. We think it's going through a down cycle with respect to overall volume trends, but we see that growing into the future. And as previously highlighted, we think complex is going to be an increasingly important part of the marketplace. And certainly, our job with ISE is to get through the transition as quickly as we can. And as I've said, we've made great progress on it. There are a lot of work to do, but we have got a very talented team focused on it, and I think you'll see us achieve that in a rapid pace."

And so we responded to that, and we have been down the road before. So it's important for us not to just be engaged with happy meetings, but the customers had to put real skin in the game to launch this thing, and they've done that and they've come through. So as we stand here today, our progress is certainly more significant than we would have planned for at this point in time. And as I mentioned in my comments, the onboarding of new customers is at a record level. What I didn't mention is, we have additional large industry participants who want to become part of the partnership, and I think the partnership will expand to allow them in. So we're living in happy times where there's a lot of inbound. So our success today is very strong. The inbound, as a forward indicator, would say there's more success to come. But we remain quite focused, and we know that while we've had great success, we need to get higher level of success in order to have what I call definable asset.

So the Index business, we've had a nice recovery of AUM from the beginning of the year where we had a major dip as a result of some of the market volatility. So our AUM generally is kind of a little bit above where it was at the beginning of the year, so we're pleased with that and so we've seen recovery there. The futures volumes were off a little bit in the quarter versus prior-year quarter because there was a lot more volatility in volumes in the third quarter of last year, and that has created some downward pressure in the revenue. And so, therefore, it's essentially flat year-over-year quarter."

If we look across the GRC space, most notably starting with surveillance, I completely agree with Bob, and there are a couple of new things we have done. We made a minority investment in a machine-intelligence company called Digital Reasoning, which has national language processing capabilities, specific to the compliance space for brokers. And we are working with Digital Reasoning and with broker clients to create a holistic solution that matches up e-commerce compliance with the surveillance technology so that's a new capability we'll be delivering into 2017 and a growth area for us and investment area for us. And then additionally, we continue to look at how we can get bigger across the spectrum of trade surveillance, trade supervision and compliance, and we continue to work with our broker clients to understand where their biggest pain points and how can our technology continue to serve them well, and we see a long runway of opportunity there. With regard to the corporate GRC business, which is really more enterprise risk management, operational risk management, we call that BWise, that's been going through revenue shift. So while we continue to see strong sales as well as good opportunities to expand what we provide to our clients, and we are investing in new capabilities, for instance we recently launched an ITGRC module for that. We are moving that also to more of a recurring revenue model from a perpetual license model, and so that's been going through a little of a revenue shift, and we expect that to come out of that in the next couple of years so that we can continue to see growth in that business as well."
