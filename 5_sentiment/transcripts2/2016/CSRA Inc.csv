On behalf of the 19,000 employees of CSRA, I want to thank you for taking time to participate on this call and for your interest in CSRA. I am proud of the accomplishments of our entire team in our first quarter",1037,"Thanks, Stuart. Good afternoon, everybody. On behalf of the 19,000 employees of CSRA, I want to thank you for taking time to participate on this call and for your interest in CSRA. I am proud of the accomplishments of our entire team in our first quarter as a publicly traded firm. As we stood up a standalone company after our spin-off  from CSC, completed our merger with SRA, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange and work really aggressively to realize the synergies of our deal, both creating new business opportunities and increasing earnings. All while keeping our focus on serving our federal government customers, as they implement critical IT and mission solutions for our nation.
Our third quarter results support our overall investment thesis and build a strong foundation for our long-term earnings model. 
Specifically, I want to take away 3 key messages from the quarterly results: First, our revenue is little wide, we believe we are set up well to turn towards sustainable organic revenue growth. Second, EPS was very strong as we maintained our industry-leading profitability and aggressively delivered synergy savings from our SRA merger. And third, taking advantage of our strong cash flow model, we initiated share repurchase and dividend programs to deploy capital to generate additional shareholder returns.
Now I will explore each of these areas in a little bit more detail.
Key takeaway #1. As I said, revenue was slightly below our expectations, but it was consistent with our performance in the first half of the year or down about 5% year-over-year. Entering the quarter, we believed there was a reasonable chance that we'd reach resolution on the Maryland Medicaid Enterprise Restructuring Project or MERP. Although we do expect to accord a gain at some point in the future, we have now taken it out of our projections. That said, our long-term outlook on revenue is very positive. At the midpoint of our guidance, fourth quarter revenues would be up 3% sequentially, building a very strong foundation headed into the new fiscal year.  We're not ready to call the precise moment of the upturn, but we believe we are testing our floor. Several factors give us conviction around this view.
Most important, CSRA booking trends are robustly positive. In the third quarter, we booked more than $1.8 billion in contract awards and as far as I can tell, our third quarter book-to-bill ratio of 1.4x leads our industry. This marks our fourth consecutive quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1x or greater.
Given the variability in the timing of awards, we believe that the trailing 12 months bookings is the best leading indicator for growth and ours was 1.3x with about 1/3 of that being new business.
With these wins, we're building backlog and revenue momentum. Our combined backlog was up 6% year-over-year.
Furthermore, the market climate should support our return to growth. Our customers are operating with appropriated budgets that show growth. Yesterday, President, Obama, submitted his budget request for government fiscal year 2017 that begins on October the 1st. The submission was consistent with the 2-year budget framework approved this past fall and we expect a stable budget environment into the fall of 2017.
Despite the backdrop of a presidential election coming up, government spending should be fairly predictable. All of the supports are fundamental long-term view of revenue growth that we laid out in November. We expect over the long-term to grow revenue at an average rate of about 2% to 3% as the industry returns to growth and we take market share.
Key takeaway #2. The company is committed to controlling well what we can and delivering EPS growth. Based on strong contract performance and rock solid execution on our synergy case, we increased our industry-leading margins to drive earnings ahead of plan. 
Frankly, the compatibility of the 2 legacy companies is allowing us to realize our synergies earlier than expected. We've already achieved our original goal of taking out $80 million of annual cost and even the most of the savings will be reflected in future reporting periods, third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was above our target range of 16% to 17%.
We will continue to drive additional savings as we consolidate systems and streamline our processes as part of integration. But fundamentally, we now have the team in place that will move us forward.
We will continue to prioritize the delivery of EBITDA over cost plus revenue, which is just a part of our DNA.
Tying my first 2 points together as we are trimming our infrastructure to create the most efficient government service provider, we are continuing to prioritize our investments to business development. We are driving our bids to middle volume higher and we expect to maintain positive new business awards.
The fourth quarter's already off to a great start with major takeaway wins, including the $252 million infrastructure support contract with the Security and Exchange Commission. The cost synergies help support our investment in growth while improving our leading margins.
With strong bookings and margins, we reiterate our expectation of an average of 8% to 10% EPS growth over the next 3 years. 
And finally, key takeaway #3.
One of the principal responsibilities of the CEO in board is to deploy capital effectively. We articulated our balanced capital allocation model at our November Investor Day and we are committed both to paying down debt to enhance our financial flexibility and operating the business as well as to returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
When we see that our valuation is compelling, we will act decisively, both within our formal training program and opportunistically when we are able. 
In the third quarter, we bought back $37 million of our stock and a little more than 2 months we've returned $66 million to our shareholders. CSRA generates tremendous free cash flow and we intend to use that to support total shareholder returns.
In summary, we are delivering growing bottom line results, prudently deploying capital for our shareholders and winning new contracts at a rate that should provide good topline growth for us in the coming years.
Now Dave will go through the financials in detail and provide our forward outlook."

I'm pleased with our third quarter results, especially how well our team managed our costs while executing a very complex transaction. There are quite a few moving parts to the story, so let me talk to every thing very deliberately and provide you with a clear view of our underlying performance.
Turning to Slide 5. In my remarks, I will refer to the pro forma adjusted results disclosed in our press release. These figures assume the CSC spin and SRA merger occurred at the beginning of the period and they exclude costs directly associated with either the spin or merger transaction or the ongoing integration process.
We belief the pro forma adjusted results provide useful insight into the current CSRA run rate and therefore, provide an important baseline for comparing past and future performance.
Our press release provides all appropriate reconciliations from pro forma adjusted results to GAAP results.
To be as transparent as possible, we'll also specifically call out items that may differ across our peer set, especially as they relate to free cash flow, which we believe is a critical valuation metric. 
Following this call, Stuart and I will be happy to discuss the financial figures in more detail. Let's walk through the Q3 income statement from top to bottom. Pro forma revenue was $1.27 billion, down 5.1% from the same period a year ago. 
On a pro forma basis, our civil segment, which includes health, home land security and other federal civilian agencies, was up 2% year-over-year.
New program starts and expansions, primarily in health, more than offset reductions in material purchases on several Federal civilian contracts.
Conversely, our defense and intelligence segment was down 13% year-over-year. A major source of this decline was our army logistics modernization program, which is transitioning to a maintenance phase after a very successful large-scale software deployment. In addition, lower material purchases on Navy contracts, the sale of the Wilkin business, and the wind down of Army OCO work outweigh the ramp up on new intelligence programs.
As typical for December quarter, we experienced seasonally high leave taking due to the holidays, which reduced revenue compared with the September quarter. The first 3 quarters of FY '16 have all been down 4% to 5% compared to FY '15. We're guiding sequential pro forma revenue growth in Q4 and we're optimistic that these year-over-year declines will begin to moderate, particularly in light of our excellent bookings performance so far this year.
Our contract mix is one of the key drivers of our margin differentiation and it was essentially unchanged in Q3. As a percentage of total revenue, our contracts were 44% fixed price, 20% time and materials and 36% cost-plus.
Q3 pro forma adjusted EBITDA was $224 million, as our EBITDA margin improved to 17.7%, driven by both of our operating segments, the strength and profitability reflects outstanding execution across our contact base and includes profit pickups on a few of our large fixed price contracts. Net favorable adjustments in our Estimate Set Completion or EACs for fixed price contracts were $19 million in Q3, several million dollars higher than we do expect in a normalized period going forward.
Our margin performance also reflects strong direct labor content, the initial effects of our merger cost synergy program and a change in the estimation method of pension income.
Our Q3 pro forma adjusted EBITDA includes $4 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $28 million of net pension-related income. Our frozen pension plan regularly generates income from the return on planned assets, offset by expenses associated with planned obligations.
Like many companies in recent quarters, we elected in Q3 to change how we calculate the service and interest to cost components of pension income using the full yield curve instead of a single point on the curve. This approach should improve the core relation between projected benefit cash flows and yield curve spot rates and provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs.
The estimation method change was the primary driver for increased quarterly pro forma pension income of about $7 million compared with prior quarters in FY '16. And we expect to maintain this new run rate until the next measurement period this spring.
As Larry indicated, we've already achieved our original target of $80 million from SRA merger cost synergies, which should generate $50 million of annual EBITDA benefit after the effect of cost-plus contracts.
We plan to drive additional cost synergies over the next several months, further bolstering our long-term plan to maintain adjusted EBITDA margins in excess of 16%.
This margin rate is sustainably above our peers based on our greater mix of fixed price and TNM contracts, our pension income, our capital investments on key programs and our ability to drive lower direct and indirect costs.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $50 million on a pro forma adjusted basis in Q3. This excludes the amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog and intangible asset valued at $65 million, that is being amortized over 1 year. As a result, our GAAP amortization expense will be approximately $5.5 million higher per month than our adjusted amortization expense from December 2015 to November 2016  Compared to 8-K, we filed on Christmas eve, the funded contract backlog asset is slightly lower based on a few minor updates in the purchase price accounting. Of course, these changes to depreciation and amortization are noncash items.
Interest expense totaled $29 million on a pro forma adjusted basis in Q3. This figure applies the effects of our post-spin and post-merger capital structure for the full quarter, including the interest on our term loans, revolving line of credit debt and capital leases as well as the deferred financing costs and original issue discount on the debt.
To calculate pro forma adjusted earnings, we applied our expected long-term effective tax rate of 39%. Our Q3 diluted share count was $165 million, down from our prior SEC filings due to the final share count calculations for a very complex transaction and the share repurchase program we initiated in December. 
Pro forma adjusted earnings per share in Q3 were $0.48. The additional pension income associated with the change in estimation method and the lowered share count added about $0.04 to our earnings per share in the quarter. Even excluding those benefits, we're very pleased with our ability to drive margins and earnings in a seasonally low quarter.
Turning to Slide 6 and the balance sheet as of January 1, 2016. We finished the quarter with $204 million of cash, $200 million of drawn revolver, $140 million of capital leases and $2.8 billion of term loan debt. 
With the steady cash flows, our business has generated historically, and with $500 million of undrawn revolver capacity, we're pleased with the liquidity and flexibility that this capital structure affords us. And with an average interest rate currently around 3%, the cost of debt is very manageable. We'll look to lock in a fixed rate on a portion of our debt through our hedging portion this quarter.
The other balance sheet item I'll note is the net pension liability of approximately $468 million, the vast majority of which is included in the other long-term liabilities line.
This figure, which is calculated based on GAAP guidelines applies a very low discount rate to the planned obligations given that interest rates remain historically low. 
Based on the IRS calculation methodology, which uses different actuarial and interest rate assumptions, our plan remains an overfunded position and we do not expect to be required by IRS guidelines to make any material cash contributions to the plan in the next several years.
The third quarter cash flow statement reflects a number of one-time items related to the spinoff and merger transactions. First, we received funding from CSC prior to the spinoff to bring CS gov's cash balance to $300 million. 
Then on the dates of the spinoff and merger, we received the $3 billion of new debt financing and used it to pay off SRA's existing debt and hedges, distribute the cash portion of mergers consideration to SRA shareholders, fund the special dividend to CSC shareholders and pay SRA's transaction-related expenses. Since then, we've made a number of other payments related to the spinoff and merger. We paid $30 million to CSC for the first of 5 annual maintenance payments under the intellectual property agreement that governance our proprietary information sharing. And in December, we paid transaction fees to investment banks and other advisory firms in excess of $20 million.
On the working capital side, accounts receivable increased by about $20 million compared to their usual run rate due to a normal seasonal slowdown in payments. Day sales outstanding for the quarter were 55 days. Our DSO should decline over the next few quarters due to seasonality and merger-related improvements.
In all, the third quarter was unique from a cash flow perspective the foundation for a solid capital structure going forward. As these one-time adjustments paid, we will focus on free cash flow, which is the lifeblood of the business. In general, we expect to generate free cash flow above net income as DNA exceeds CapEx by more than the noncash pension income.
We noted in our November Investor Day presentation that we would use a portion of our future free cash flows for shareholder returns in the form of both dividends and share buybacks. To that end, on our first day as a public company, our Board of Directors established a $0.10 per share quarterly dividend, which was paid in January and authorized a $400 million share repurchase program effective immediately and ending in March 2019.
We intent to deploy cash to buy back shares over time when we believe our stock is undervalued and our balance sheet is well-suited to fund the payments.
We kicked off the program with $37 million of share repurchases during December and another $13 million in January.
Turning to our forward guidance on Slide 7. Our plan in future periods is to provide annual guidance in the fourth quarter earnings report of the prior fiscal year and to update that guidance on subsequent calls as needed. We're providing Q4 guidance on this call to provide an extra degree of clarity given the complexity of our historic pro forma numbers, but we will shift to annual guidance in the future.
We project that our fourth quarter 2016 revenue will be between $1.28 billion and $1.33 billion, which equates to a year-over-year pro forma revenue growth rate range of minus 5% to minus 1%. We don't currently expect the Q4 revenue should have any material adjustments, so this guidance is a GAAP figure.
We project that our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA will be between $214 million and $226 million, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share will be between $0.45 and $0.49. 
These guidance ranges reflect gradual improvement from our Q3 revenue performance, driven in part by seasonal changes in leave taking and the conversion of revenue on new contract awards we received in the first 3 quarters of FY '16.
We also anticipate that our ongoing cost synergy program will incrementally improve SG&A performance in Q4.
Our guidance takes into consideration the effect of the recent major snowstorm on the East Coast, which closed government offices for a number of days, but we've attempted to mitigate that impact through teleworking and flextime programs.
Our Q4 revenue guidance also includes the impact of our lowered cost structure on cost-plus contracts as we realized synergies.
This approach is fundamental to how we make business decisions. We intend to profit dollars even at the expense of cost-plus revenue.
Although not in our adjusted EBITDA or EPS guidance, integration-related cost will diminish materially in the fourth quarter. FY '17 integration cost should be even smaller, primarily related to our ongoing IT system integration projects.
Looking ahead to FY '17, we anticipate better year-over-year revenue growth than we've had in FY '16, driven by the strength of our book-to-bill ratio this year and the backlog growth that has resulted from it.
Although cost-plus revenue will continue to be suppressed slightly by expense reductions, our earnings will benefit from the full year effect of merger synergy initiatives, which will hope to offset the pricing pressures to which we become accustomed in recent years.
On the cash flow side, we expect to generate free cash flow in excess of net income consistent with our model and we will look to pay down a portion of our debt and provide shareholder returns.
We also affirm our long-term model of an average compound annual growth rate in revenue of 2% to 3% and EPS of 8% to 10%. Combined with a meaningful dividend, we believe CSRA will be an attractive investor for our long-term shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it back to you Larry for some additional comments."

Let me start w",961,"Thanks, Dave. Before turning to your questions, I want to take this opportunity on our first quarterly call to briefly lay out our strategy and differentiators to give you an understanding of who we are and where we're taken this company. 
Let me start with how we came into being. I'm now on Slide 8.
 
Splitting off of the U.S. public sector business from CSC allowed us to tune our messaging, our benefits and our go-to-market approach and focused it on our Federal marketplace. It also allowed us to think about capital allocation differently, which enabled us to merge with SRA as part of our go public process.
SRA was the perfect fit for us and is an integral part of CSRA contributing richly to our culture and leadership team. SRA brought us broader access across the entire federal community with especially deep relationships and access in the health and federal civilian markets as well as complementary contracts in the defense and intelligence communities. 
Most important is what the legacy and SRA businesses share. We share our passion for mission, a dedication in next-generation IT and a firm commitment to cost discipline. Both legacy companies are dedicated to a culture and values around honesty with all of our stakeholders and service and support of our customers.
This cultural compatibility is easing the integration process and our combined team is leading forward together taking advantages of combined capabilities and customer access to identify and to pursue newly addressable opportunities.
As shown on Slide 9, IC CSRA as the premier pure play provider of IT services to the U.S. public sector. And together, we will deliver innovations, efficiencies and tailored offerings to our customers, distinct long-term investment opportunities and added value creation to our investors, scale to our strategic partners and targeted skills development and stronger career opportunities to our employees.
With more than 3 quarters of our work in IT, we are the company best positioned to combine deep domain expertise with the ability to lead our public sector customers into their digital future.
The U.S. federal government is in the process of transforming its IT infrastructure and software systems with mandates such as data center consolidation and cloud first in order to increase efficiency and reduce expenses.
Federal CIOs expect relatively flat IT budgets over the next few years with reductions in hardware spending based on virtualization and cloud initiatives.
The capabilities we provide address the priority areas of IT investment for the federal government, including cloud, cybersecurity, data analytics, agile-based software development methodologies and the inevitable modernization of the government's applications with the for Software-as-a-Service and to mobile devices.
For the federal government as a whole, next-generation technology offerings such as Big Data and cloud should show double-digit annual growth over the next 3 years.
Now turning to Slide 10. Several wins and program expansions demonstrate the strength of our go-to-market strategy. 
First, at the Department of Homeland Security, we extended our work in support of the agencies data center 1 for 4.5 years and added nearly $1 billion of ceiling. John and his team developed creative solutions and contracting approaches to create an efficient and flexible contract focused on the as a service consumption-based model with access to our CSRA private cloud within the governments for walls.
Under the new contract, any DHS component can purchase a wider ray of managed services, private cloud offerings, hardware and software, network and security infrastructure, app support and of course, project management.
This contract will help DHS evolve with technology and mission needs, while meeting their highest levels of security and giving them a trusted and stable foundation to transition a next-generation IT.
Second, we are beginning to ramp up the FAA  cloud services contract, one of the largest cloud development opportunities in the federal market. I'm incredibly proud Peter and our team, which led all of our agile developers to respond to a high visibility short fuse requirement to development and deploy a new application designed to register small unmanned aircraft systems or drones, it was in anticipation of a surge in drone purchases during the most recent holiday season. And in just 6 weeks, we stood up an easy-to-use cloud-based system to register the drones, accept payment by credit card and print registration certificates.
Now we couldn't have done it without great partners. The Amazon Web services cloud-based system linked together cutting-edge technology partners like Stripe and we can support over 1.5 million registrations per hour. This effort has built tremendous credibility for CSRA with the customer and with our partners and it provides a performance qualifications as we bid new cloud native applications.
Third, led by we won the of our work for the administrative office of the U.S. courts. Our customer expanded our scope to a potential value of $150 million over 5 years. We will provide full software development lifecycle expertise for a variety of applications, supporting probation and pretrial services and electronic court filings and we will transition all application development to the scale the agile framework and make use of methodologies.
Finally, our largest new win in the quarter came from the Department of Veterans Affairs. This was a legacy SRA win spearheaded by Mark who heads up our VA business. On this 5-year $233 million quarter, we're helping the VA move to paperless claims processing to enable quicker processing of disability benefits for our vets. This is our first VA wide program and it really provides us a natural entrée into the claims processing.
Now these examples and many more like them convince me that CSRA will be able to meet our long-term financial goals, while helping our critical customers handle emerging problems of national significance.

When you look at the midpoint of our guidance for the fourth quarter, we're up a little from Q3 and it really its the result of that natural tension, where we're working off some of our current book of business, but creating new revenue from engine. The logistics modernization program, yes, we're absolutely transitioning from very successful development program to O&M. We think the slope of decline is softened a little bit, but we absolutely have to replace that with new work. BT is absolutely demonstrating the ability to complete win and the book-to-bill is showing it. So we think that the growth on our horizon, I just can't call the quarter  in FY '17 when it will happen and we're busy work in the FY '17 plan and plans to do guidance on FY '17 at the next earnings call. On A macro level solid budget picture, the present budget was more positive than I expected. And it just watching the reaction of people wanting to add on to it and whether it's for or the Democratic senators thinking about the Fed the investment  in cyber, the investment  in repairing legacy IT. So I thought the budget picture was very positive. Now that's intention with kind of the slow adoption rate of our federal customers for next-gen IT.  They measure twice, they ones, they put their toe in the water and it's not nearly the adoption rate that we see in the commercial side, but it also doesn't have the cannibalization rate. So fundamentally, we've got a timing issue. It's not a matter of if we growth, it's matter of when and you could -- you know Dave and I are naturally conservative as a newly public company and we really looking forward to like giving you color on this at the next earnings call."

I think we'll stop getting into a lot of detail numbers around that, but when it comes to '17 and offer more insights on that in more detail on the next earnings call. With that said, we can give you some useful contexts I think. As we look at the re-complete picture for the year, I'd call it a fairly typical picture Our average contract length is around 5 years and that would indicate that in a typical year roughly 20% would be up for As we look at '17, it's reasonable to expect that to be one of those pretty typical year. So obviously it's incumbent on us to win the vast majority of those and sustain our business space that way. You've touched on a point that is clearly relevant. We have many large contracts, top 25 contracts or about half of our business and those are in all different phases of their life cycle. So we've talked about logistics, modernization for the Army, which is a maturing contract that will likely decline in FY '17 from '16. I wouldn't say there are any that are in that exact phase of their life cycle, but we have several other that have been really outstanding performers this year in terms of both organic growth in delivering a new and creative ways for their customers as well as you could see in today's results, their bottom line performance and really outstanding profitability. So as we look at '17, obviously, our job is to do 2 things in that front. One, to deliver another year of sustained organic growth on those programs and to find new ways to deliver for those customers and also to win as much new work as possible to fill a gap created by logistics modernization other programs in that phase. So hopefully that gives you a sense for it, it's not an atypical year, and it's one that we look forward to providing more specific guidance on the next call."

So the 17.7% you mentioned EBITDA margin in Q3 included a few things that are worth noting as we did to a degree in our scripted comments. First, there was about 60 basis points of benefit from the higher pension income related to the change in calculation methodology there. In the quarter, we had a relatively small volume of cost synergies that impacted the quarter given the timing of the transaction. We'll have a few more of those impacting this quarter as we said given that we now achieved the initial target for synergies. The EAC costs adjustments and overall contract profitability was really outstanding element of the quarter, just fantastic execution on our programs and particularly on some of the large fixed price contracts. So those were $19 million worth of EAC adjustments. With that said, that's not $19 million worth of one-time items certainly, we were a business of large fixed price contracts among other contract firms, and we've had a fairly strong flow of favorable EAC adjustments given improvements in contract delivery efficiency over the last couple of years. But 19% is not a level we'd feel comfortable projecting to every future quarter by any stretch. So we've talked about several million dollars of lower expectation as we look at Q4 and beyond for those types of adjustments on fixed price contracts. The other element  I mentioned is, we had relatively few ODC and direct material buyers in the quarter. It was a quarter of strong revenue content compared to prior quarters and prior years. If we have more of those, obviously, revenue would benefit, the margin would come down just a bit."

On behalf of the 19,000 employees of CSRA, I want to thank you for taking the time to participate on this call and for your interest in CSRA.I'm proud of the accomplishments of our entire team in our first quar",1042,"Thanks, Stuart. Good afternoon, everybody. On behalf of the 19,000 employees of CSRA, I want to thank you for taking the time to participate on this call and for your interest in CSRA.
I'm proud of the accomplishments of our entire team in our first quarter as a publicly traded firm. As we stood up a stand-alone company after our spin-off from CSC, completed our merger with SRA, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange and work really aggressively to realize the synergies of our deal, both creating new business opportunities and increasing earnings, all while keeping our focus on serving our federal government customers as they implement critical IT and mission solutions for our nation.
Our third quarter results support our overall investment thesis and build a strong foundation for our long-term earnings model.
Specifically, I want you to take away 3 key messages from the quarterly results: first, although revenue was a little light, we believe we are set up well to turn towards sustainable organic revenue growth; second, EPS was very strong as we maintained our industry-leading profitability and aggressively delivered synergy savings from our SRA merger; and third, taking advantage of our strong cash flow model, we initiated share repurchase and dividend programs to deploy capital to generate additional shareholder returns. Now I'll explore each of these areas in a little bit more detail.
Key takeaway number one. As I said, revenue was slightly below our expectations, but it was consistent with our performance in the first half of the year or down about 5% year-over-year. Entering the quarter, we believed there was a reasonable chance that we'd reach resolution on the Maryland Medicaid Enterprise Restructuring Project or MERP. Although we do expect to record a gain at some point in the future, we have now taken it out of our projections. That said, our long-term outlook on revenue is very positive. At the midpoint of our guidance, fourth quarter revenues would be up 3% sequentially, building a very strong foundation headed into the new fiscal year.  We're not ready to call the precise moment of the upturn, but we believe we are testing our floor. Several factors give us conviction around this view.
Most important, CSRA booking trends are robustly positive. In the third quarter, we booked more than $1.8 billion in contract awards. And as far as I can tell, our third quarter book-to-bill ratio of 1.4x leads our industry. This marks our fourth consecutive quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1x or greater. Given the variability in the timing of awards, we believe that the trailing 12 months bookings is the best leading indicator for growth, and ours was 1.3x, with about 1/3 of that being new business. With these wins, we are building backlog and revenue momentum. Our combined backlog was up 6% year-over-year.
Furthermore, the market climate should support a return to growth. Our customers are operating with appropriated budgets that show growth. Yesterday, President Obama, submitted his budget request for government fiscal year 2017 that begins on October 1. The submission was consistent with the 2-year budget framework approved this past fall, and we expect a stable budget environment into the fall of 2017.
Despite the backdrop of a presidential election coming up, government spending should be fairly predictable. All of this supports our fundamental long-term view of revenue growth that we laid out in November. We expect over the long term to grow revenue at an average rate of about 2% to 3% as the industry returns to growth and we take market share.
Key takeaway number two. The company is committed to controlling well what we can and delivering EPS growth. Based on strong contract performance and rock-solid execution on our synergy case, we increased our industry-leading margins to drive earnings ahead of plan.
Frankly, the compatibility of the 2 legacy companies is allowing us to realize our synergies earlier than expected. We have already achieved our original goal of taking out $80 million of annual cost. And even though most of the savings will be reflected in future reporting periods, third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was above our target range of 16% to 17%.
We will continue to drive additional savings as we consolidate systems and streamline our processes as part of integration. But fundamentally, we now have the team in place that will move us forward. We will continue to prioritize the delivery of EBITDA over cost-plus revenue, which is just a part of our DNA.
Tying my first 2 points together, as we are trimming our infrastructure to create the most efficient government service provider, we are continuing to prioritize our investments to business development. We are driving our bid submittal volume higher, and we expect to maintain positive new business awards.
The fourth quarter is already off to a great start with major takeaway wins, including the $252 million infrastructure support contract with the Security and Exchange Commission. The cost synergies help support our investment in growth while improving our leading margins. With strong bookings and margins, we reiterate our expectation of an average of 8% to 10% EPS growth over the next 3 years.
And finally, key takeaway number three. One of the principal responsibilities of the CEO and board is to deploy capital effectively. We articulated our balanced capital allocation model at our November Investor Day, and we are committed both to paying down debt to enhance our financial flexibility in operating the business as well as to returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
When we see that our valuation is compelling, we will act decisively, both within our formal trading program and opportunistically when we are able. In the third quarter, we bought back $37 million of our stock. In a little more than 2 months, we've returned $66 million to our shareholders. CSRA generates tremendous free cash flow, and we intend to use that to support total shareholder returns.
In summary, we are delivering growing bottom line results, prudently deploying capital for our shareholders and winning new contracts at a rate that should provide good top line growth for us in the coming years.
Now Dave will go through the financials in detail and provide our forward outlook."

I'm pleased with our third quarter results, especially how well our team managed our costs while executing a very complex transaction.

I'm pleased with our third quarter results, especially how well our team managed our costs while executing a very complex transaction. There are quite a few moving parts to the story, so let me talk through everything very deliberately and provide you with a clear view of our underlying performance.
Turning to Slide 5. In my remarks, I'll refer to the pro forma adjusted results disclosed in our press release. These figures assume the CSC spin and the SRA merger occurred at the beginning of the period, and they exclude costs directly associated with either the spin or merger transaction or the ongoing integration process.
We believe the pro forma adjusted results provide useful insight into the current CSRA run rate and therefore, provide an important baseline for comparing to past and future performance. Our press release provides all appropriate reconciliations from pro forma adjusted results to GAAP results.
To be as transparent as possible, we'll also specifically call out items that may differ across our peer set, especially as they relate to free cash flow, which we believe is a critical valuation metric. Following this call, Stuart and I will be happy to discuss the financial figures in more detail.
Let's walk through the Q3 income statement from top to bottom. Pro forma revenue was $1.27 billion, down 5.1% from the same period a year ago. On a pro forma basis, our Civil segment, which includes health, homeland security and other federal civilian agencies, was up 2% year-over-year. New program starts and expansions, primarily in health, more than offset reductions in material purchases on several federal civilian contracts.
Conversely, our Defense and Intelligence segment was down 13% year-over-year. A major source of this decline was our Army Logistics Modernization Program, which is transitioning to a maintenance phase after a very successful large-scale software deployment. In addition, lower material purchases on Navy contracts, the sale of the Welkin business and the wind down of Army OCO work outweighed the ramp-up on new intelligence programs.
As is typical for the December quarter, we experienced seasonally high leave taking due to the holidays, which reduced revenue compared with the September quarter. The first 3 quarters of FY '16 have all been down 4% to 5% compared to FY '15. We're guiding sequential pro forma revenue growth in Q4, and we're optimistic that these year-over-year declines will begin to moderate, particularly in light of our excellent bookings performance so far this year.
Our contract mix is one of the key drivers of our margin differentiation and it was essentially unchanged in Q3. As a percentage of total revenue, our contracts were 44% fixed price, 20% time and materials and 36% cost-plus.
Q3 pro forma adjusted EBITDA was $224 million, as our EBITDA margin improved to 17.7%, driven by both of our operating segments. This strength in profitability reflects outstanding execution across our contact base and includes profit pickups on a few of our large fixed-price contracts. Net favorable adjustments in our estimates at completion or EACs for fixed-price contracts were $19 million in Q3, several million dollars higher than we'd expect in a normalized period going forward. Our margin performance also reflects strong direct labor content, the initial effects of our merger cost synergy program and a change in the estimation method of pension income.
Our Q3 pro forma adjusted EBITDA includes $4 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $28 million of net pension-related income. Our frozen pension plan regularly generates income from the return on plan assets, offset by expenses associated with plan obligations.
Like many companies in recent quarters, we elected in Q3 to change how we calculate the service and interest costs components of pension income, using the full yield curve instead of a single point on the curve. This approach should improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and yield curve spot rates and provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs.
The estimation method change was the primary driver for increased quarterly pro forma pension income of about $7 million compared with prior quarters in FY '16. And we expect to maintain this new run rate until the next measurement period this spring.
As Larry indicated, we've already achieved our original target of $80 million from SRA merger cost synergies, which should generate $50 million of annual EBITDA benefit after the effect of cost-plus contracts. We plan to drive additional cost synergies over the next several months, further bolstering our long-term plan to maintain adjusted EBITDA margins in excess of 16%.
This margin rate is sustainably above our peers based on our greater mix of fixed-price and T&M contracts, our pension income, our capital investments on key programs and our ability to drive lower direct and indirect costs.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $50 million on a pro forma adjusted basis in Q3. This excludes the amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog, an intangible asset valued at $65 million that is being amortized over 1 year. As a result, our GAAP amortization expense will be approximately $5.5 million higher per month than our adjusted amortization expense from December 2015 to November 2016. Compared to the 8-K, we filed on Christmas eve, the funded contract backlog asset is slightly lower based on a few minor updates in the purchase price accounting. Of course, these changes to depreciation and amortization are noncash items.
Interest expense totaled $29 million on a pro forma adjusted basis in Q3. This figure applies the effects of our post-spin and post-merger capital structure for the full quarter, including the interest on our term loans, revolving line of credit debt and capital leases as well as the deferred financing costs and original issue discount on the debt.
To calculate pro forma adjusted earnings, we applied our expected long-term effective tax rate of 39%. Our Q3 diluted share count was 165 million, down from our prior SEC filings due to the final share count calculations for a very complex transaction and the share repurchase program we initiated in December.
Pro forma adjusted earnings per share in Q3 were $0.48. The additional pension income associated with the change in estimation method and the lower share count added about $0.04 to our earnings per share in the quarter. Even excluding those benefits, we're very pleased with our ability to drive margins and earnings in a seasonally low quarter.
Turning to Slide 6 and the balance sheet as of January 1, 2016. We finished the quarter with $204 million of cash, $200 million of drawn revolver, $140 million of capital leases and $2.8 billion of term loan debt.
With the steady cash flow our business has generated historically and with $500 million of undrawn revolver capacity, we're pleased with the liquidity and flexibility that this capital structure affords us. And with an average interest rate currently around 3%, the cost of debt is very manageable. We will look to lock in a fixed rate on a portion of our debt through a hedging program this quarter.
The other balance sheet item I'll note is the net pension liability of approximately $468 million, the vast majority of which is included in the other long-term liabilities line. This figure, which is calculated based on GAAP guidelines applies a very low discount rate to the plan obligations given that interest rates remain historically low. Based on the IRS calculation methodology, which uses different actuarial and interest rate assumptions, our plan remains in an overfunded position, and we do not expect to be required by IRS guidelines to make any material cash contributions to the plan in the next several years.
The third quarter cash flow statement reflects a number of onetime items related to the spin-off and merger transactions. First, we received funding from CSC prior to the spin-off to bring CSGov's cash balance to $300 million.
Then on the dates of the spin-off and merger, we received the $3 billion of new debt financing and used it to pay off SRA's existing debt and hedges, distribute the cash portion of merger consideration to SRA shareholders, fund the special dividend to CSC shareholders and pay SRA's transaction-related expenses. Since then, we have made a number of other payments related to the spin-off and merger. We paid $30 million to CSC for the first of 5 annual maintenance payments under the intellectual property agreement that governs our proprietary information sharing. And in December, we paid transaction fees to investment banks and other advisory firms in excess of $20 million.
On the working capital side, accounts receivable increased by about $20 million compared to their usual run rate due to a normal seasonal slowdown in payments. Day sales outstanding for the quarter were 55 days. Our DSO should decline over the next few quarters due to seasonality and merger-related improvements.
In all, the third quarter was unique from a cash flow perspective, but formed the foundation for a solid capital structure going forward. As these onetime adjustments fade, we will focus on free cash flow, which is the lifeblood of the business. In general, we expect to generate free cash flow above net income as D&A exceeds CapEx by more than the noncash pension income.
We noted in our November Investor Day presentation that we would use a portion of our future free cash flows for shareholder returns in the form of both dividends and share buybacks. To that end, on our first day as a public company, our Board of Directors established a $0.10 per share quarterly dividend, which was paid in January and authorized a $400 million share repurchase program effective immediately and ending in March 2019. We intend to deploy cash to buy back shares over time when we believe our stock is undervalued and our balance sheet is well-suited to fund the payments. We kicked off the program with $37 million of share repurchases during December and another $13 million in January.
Turning to our forward guidance on Slide 7. Our plan in future periods is to provide annual guidance in the fourth quarter earnings report of the prior fiscal year and to update that guidance on subsequent calls as needed. We are providing Q4 guidance on this call to provide an extra degree of clarity given the complexity of our historical pro forma numbers, but we'll shift to annual guidance in the future.
We project that our fourth quarter 2016 revenue will be between $1.28 billion and $1.33 billion, which equates to a year-over-year pro forma revenue growth rate range of minus 5% to minus 1%. We don't currently expect that Q4 revenue should have any material adjustments, so this guidance is a GAAP figure.
We project that our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA will be between $214 million and $226 million, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share will be between $0.45 and $0.49.
These guidance ranges reflect gradual improvement from our Q3 revenue performance, driven in part by seasonal changes in leave taking and the conversion of revenue on new contract awards we've received in the first 3 quarters of FY '16. We also anticipate that our ongoing cost synergy program will incrementally improve SG&A performance in Q4.
Our guidance takes into consideration the effect of the recent major snowstorm on the East Coast, which closed government offices for a number of days, but we've attempted to mitigate that impact through teleworking and flextime programs.
Our Q4 revenue guidance also includes the impact of our lowered cost structure on cost-plus contracts as we realize synergies. This approach is fundamental to how we make business decisions. We intend to zealously guard profit dollars even at the expense of cost-plus revenue.
Although not in our adjusted EBITDA or EPS guidance, integration-related costs will diminish materially in the fourth quarter. FY '17 integration costs should be even smaller, primarily related to our ongoing IT system integration projects.
Looking ahead to FY '17, we anticipate better year-over-year revenue growth than we've had in FY '16, driven by the strength of our book-to-bill ratio this year and the backlog growth that has resulted from it.
Although cost-plus revenue will continue to be suppressed slightly by expense reductions, our earnings will benefit from the full year effect of our merger synergy initiatives, which will help to offset the pricing pressures to which we've become accustomed in recent years.
On the cash flow side, we expect to generate free cash flow in excess of net income consistent with our model, and we will look to pay down a portion of our debt and provide shareholder returns.
We also affirm our long-term model of an average compound annual growth rate in revenue of 2% to 3% and EPS of 8% to 10%. Combined with a meaningful dividend, we believe CSRA will be an attractive investment for our long-term shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it back to you Larry for some additional comments."

Let me start wi",973,"Thanks, Dave. Before turning to your questions, I want to take this opportunity on our first quarterly call to briefly lay out our strategy and differentiators to give you an understanding of who we are and where we're taking this company. Let me start with how we came into being. I'm now on Slide 8.
Splitting off with the U.S. public sector business from CSC allowed us to tune our messaging, our benefits and our go-to-market approach and focused it on our federal marketplace. It also allowed us to think about capital allocation differently, which enabled us to merge with SRA as part of our go-public process.
SRA was the perfect fit for us and is an integral part of CSRA, contributing richly to our culture and leadership team. SRA brought us broader access across the entire federal community with especially deep relationships and access in the health and federal civilian markets as well as complementary contracts in the defense and intelligence communities.
Most important is what the legacy CSGov and SRA businesses share. We share our passion for mission, a dedication in next-generation IT and a firm commitment to cost discipline. Both legacy companies are dedicated to a culture and values around honesty with all of our stakeholders and service in support of our customers.
This cultural compatibility is easing the integration process and our combined team is leaning forward together, taking advantages of combined capabilities and customer access to identify and to pursue newly addressable opportunities.
As shown on Slide 9, I see CSRA as the premier pure play provider of IT services to the U.S. public sector. And together, we will deliver innovations, efficiencies and tailored offerings to our customers, distinct long-term investment opportunities and added value creation to our investors, scale to our strategic partners and targeted skills development and stronger career opportunities to our employees.
With more than 3/4 of our work in IT, we are the company best positioned to combine deep domain expertise with the ability to lead our public sector customers into their digital future.
The U.S. federal government is in the process of transforming its IT infrastructure and software systems, with mandates such as data center consolidation and cloud first in order to increase efficiency and reduce expenses. Federal CIOs expect relatively flat IT budgets over the next few years, with reductions in hardware spending based on virtualization and cloud initiatives.
The capabilities we provide address the priority areas of IT investment for the federal government, including cloud, cybersecurity, data analytics, agile-based software development methodologies and the inevitable modernization of the government's applications with a bias for software-as-a-service and to mobile devices.
For the federal government as a whole, next-generation technology offerings such as big data and cloud should show double-digit annual growth over the next 3 years.
Now turning to Slide 10. Several wins and program expansions demonstrate the strength of our go-to-market strategy.
First, at the Department of Homeland Security, we extended our work in support of the agency's Data Center 1 for 4.5 years and added nearly $1 billion of ceiling. [indiscernible] and his team developed creative solutions and contracting approaches to create an efficient and flexible contract focused on the as-a-service consumption-based model with access to our CSRA private cloud within the government's 4 walls.
Under the new contract, any DHS component can purchase a wide array of managed services, private cloud offerings, hardware and software, network and security infrastructure, app support and of course, project management.
This contract will help DHS evolve with technology and mission needs, while meeting their highest levels of security and giving them a trusted and stable foundation to transition to next-generation IT.
Second, we are beginning to ramp up the FAA cloud services contract, one of the largest cloud development opportunities in the federal market. I'm incredibly proud of Peter O'Donoghue [ph] and our team, which led all of our agile developers to respond to a high visibility short fuse requirement to development and deploy a new application designed to register small unmanned aircraft systems or drones. It was in anticipation of a surge in drone purchases during the most recent holiday season. And in just 6 weeks, we stood up an easy-to-use cloud-based system to register the drones, accept payment by credit card and print registration certificates.
Now we couldn't have done it without great partners. The Amazon Web Services cloud-based system linked together cutting-edge technology partners like Stripe, Stormpath and New Relic, and we can support over 1.5 million registrations per hour. This effort has built tremendous credibility for CSRA with the customer and with our partners, and it provides superb past performance qualifications as we bid new cloud-native applications.
Third, led by Ben Geesaman [ph], we won the recompete of our work for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Our customer expanded our scope to a potential value of $115 million over 5 years. We will provide full software development life cycle expertise for a variety of applications, supporting probation and pretrial services and electronic court filings, and we will transition all application development to the Scaled Agile Framework and make use of DevOp methodologies.
Finally, our largest new win in the quarter came from the Department of Veterans Affairs. This was a legacy SRA win spearheaded by Mark Cardarelli [ph], who Heads up our VA business. On this 5-year $233 million task order, we're helping the VA move to paperless claims processing to enable quicker processing of disability benefits for our vets. This is our first VA-wide program and it really provides us a natural entrée into claims processing.
Now these examples and many more like them convince me that CSRA will be able to meet our long-term financial goals, while helping our critical customers handle emerging problems of national significance.

When you look at the midpoint of our guidance for the fourth quarter, we're up a little from Q3. And it really is, it's the result of that natural tension, where we're working off some of our current book of business, but creating new revenue from the BD engine. The Logistics Modernization Program, yes, we're absolutely transitioning from very successful development program to O&M. We think the slope of decline has softened a little bit, but we absolutely have to replace that with new, new work. BD is absolutely demonstrating the ability to compete, win and the book-to-bill was showing it. So we think that particularly to growth on our horizon, I just can't call the quarter in FY '17 when it will happen, and we're busy working the FY '17 plan and plan to do guidance on FY '17 at the next earnings call. On a macro level, wow, it's a solid budget picture. The President's budget was more positive than I expected. And just watching the reaction of people wanting to add on to it. And whether it's for OCO or the Democratic senators thinking about the fed SIB side, the investment in cyber, the investment in repairing legacy IT. So I thought the budget picture was very positive. Now that's in tension with kind of the slow adoption rate of our federal customers for next-gen IT. They measure twice. They cut once. They put their toe in the water. And it's not nearly the adoption rate that we see in the commercial side, but it also doesn't have the cannibalization rate. So fundamentally, we got a timing issue. It's not a matter of if we pivot to growth, it's a matter of when. And you could -- you know Dave and I are naturally conservative as a newly public company, and we really look forward to like giving you color on this at the next earnings call."

I think we'll stop short of getting into a lot of detailed numbers around that when it comes to '17 and offer more insights on that and more detail on the next earnings call. With that said, we can give you some useful context, I think. As we look at the recompete picture for the year, I'd call it a fairly typical recompete picture. Our average contract length is around 5 years, and that would indicate that in a typical year roughly 20% would be up for recompete. As we look at '17, it's reasonable to expect that to be one of those pretty typical years. So obviously, it's incumbent on us to win the vast majority of those and sustain our business base that way. You touched on a point that is clearly relevant. We have many large contracts. Top 25 contracts are about half of our business. And those are in all different phases of their life cycle. So we've talked about logistics modernization for the Army, which is a maturing contract that will likely decline in FY '17 from '16. I wouldn't say there are any that are in that exact phase of their life cycle, but we have several other that have been really outstanding performers this year in terms of both organic growth and delivering in new and creative ways for their customers as well as you could see in today's results, their bottom line performance and really outstanding profitability. So as we look at '17, obviously, our job is to do 2 things in that front. One, to deliver another year of sustained organic growth on those programs and to find new ways to deliver for those customers and also to win as much new work as possible to fill the gap created by logistics modernization and other programs in that phase. So hopefully, that gives you a sense for it. It's not an atypical year, and it's one that we look forward to providing more specific guidance on, on the next call."

So the 17.7% you mentioned of EBITDA margin in Q3 included a few things that are worth noting as we did to a degree in our scripted comments. First, there were about 60 basis points of benefit from the higher pension income related to the change in calculation methodology there. In the quarter, we had a relatively small volume of cost synergies that impacted the quarter given the timing of the transaction. We'll have a few more of those impacting this quarter as we said given that we've now achieved the initial target for synergies. The EAC cost adjustments and overall contract profitability was really a outstanding element of the quarter, just fantastic execution on our programs and particularly on some of the large fixed-price contracts. So those were $19 million worth of EAC adjustments. With that said, that's not $19 million worth of onetime items. Certainly, we are a business of large fixed-price contracts among other contract forms, and we've had a fairly strong flow of favorable EAC adjustments given improvements in contract delivery efficiency over the last couple of years. But $19 million is not a level we'd feel comfortable projecting to every future quarter by any stretch. So we talked about several million dollars of lower expectation as we look at Q4 and beyond for those types of adjustments on fixed-price contracts. The other element I'd mention is we had relatively few ODC and direct material buys in the quarter. It was a quarter of strong revenue content compared to prior quarters and prior years. If we have more of those, obviously, revenue would benefit, the margin would come down just a bit."

What we can say is, compared to a typical year where from Q3 to Q4 there would be a nice seasonal uplift given less leave taking in Q4 than we experience over the holidays in Q3, the positive impact this Q4 will be muted slightly by the snow days. Exactly how much or whether we have more snow days between now and March 31 is obviously tough to estimate."

On behalf of the 19,000 employees of CSRA, I want to thank you for taking the time to participate on this call and for your interest in CSRA.I'm proud of the accomplishments of our entire team in our first quar",1039,"Thanks, Stuart. Good afternoon, everybody. On behalf of the 19,000 employees of CSRA, I want to thank you for taking the time to participate on this call and for your interest in CSRA.
I'm proud of the accomplishments of our entire team in our first quarter as a publicly traded firm. As we stood up a stand-alone company after our spin-off from CSC, completed our merger with SRA, began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and worked really aggressively to realize the synergies of our deal, both creating new business opportunities and increasing earnings, all while keeping our focus on serving our federal government customers as they implement critical IT and mission solutions for our nation.
Our third quarter results support our overall investment thesis and build a strong foundation for our long-term earnings model.
Specifically, I want you to take away 3 key messages from the quarterly results: first, although revenue was a little light, we believe we are set up well to turn towards sustainable organic revenue growth; second, EPS was very strong as we maintained our industry-leading profitability and aggressively delivered synergy savings from our SRA merger; and third, taking advantage of our strong cash flow model, we initiated share repurchase and dividend programs to deploy capital to generate additional shareholder returns. Now I'll explore each of these areas in a little bit more detail.
Key Takeaway #1. As I said, revenue was slightly below our expectations, but it was consistent with our performance in the first half of the year or down about 5% year-over-year. Entering the quarter, we believed there was a reasonable chance that we'd reach resolution on the Maryland Medicaid Enterprise Restructuring Project, or MERP. Although we do expect to record a gain at some point in the future, we have now taken it out of our projections. That said, our long-term outlook on revenue is very positive. At the midpoint of our guidance, fourth quarter revenues would be up 3% sequentially, building a very strong foundation headed into the new fiscal year.  We're not ready to call the precise moment of the upturn, but we believe we are testing our floor. Several factors give us conviction around this view.
Most important, CSRA booking trends are robustly positive. In the third quarter, we booked more than $1.8 billion in contract awards. And as far as I can tell, our third quarter book-to-bill ratio of 1.4x leads our industry. This marks our fourth consecutive quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1x or greater. Given the variability in the timing of awards, we believe that the trailing 12 months bookings is the best leading indicator for growth, and ours was 1.3x, with about 1/3 of that being new business. With these wins, we are building backlog and revenue momentum. Our combined backlog was up 6% year-over-year.
Furthermore, the market climate should support a return to growth. Our customers are operating with appropriated budgets that show growth. Yesterday, President Obama, submitted his budget request for government fiscal year 2017 that begins on October 1. The submission was consistent with the 2-year budget framework approved this past fall, and we expect a stable budget environment into the fall of 2017.
Despite the backdrop of a presidential election coming up, government spending should be fairly predictable. All of this supports our fundamental long-term view of revenue growth that we laid out in November. We expect over the long term to grow revenue at an average rate of about 2% to 3% as the industry returns to growth and we take market share.
Key Takeaway #2. The company is committed to controlling well what we can and delivering EPS growth. Based on strong contract performance and rock-solid execution on our synergy case, we increased our industry-leading margins to drive earnings ahead of plan.
Frankly, the compatibility of the 2 legacy companies is allowing us to realize our synergies earlier than expected. We have already achieved our original goal of taking out $80 million of annual cost. And even though most of the savings will be reflected in future reporting periods, third quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was above our target range of 16% to 17%.
We will continue to drive additional savings as we consolidate systems and streamline our processes as part of integration. But fundamentally, we now have the team in place that will move us forward. We will continue to prioritize the delivery of EBITDA over cost-plus revenue, which is just a part of our DNA.
Tying my first 2 points together, as we are trimming our infrastructure to create the most efficient government service provider, we are continuing to prioritize our investments to business development. We are driving our bid submittal volume higher, and we expect to maintain positive new business awards.
The fourth quarter is already off to a great start with major takeaway wins, including the $252 million infrastructure support contract with the Security and Exchange Commission. The cost synergies help support our investment in growth while improving our leading margins. With strong bookings and margins, we reiterate our expectation of an average of 8% to 10% EPS growth over the next 3 years.
And finally, Key Takeaway #3. One of the principal responsibilities of the CEO and board is to deploy capital effectively. We articulated our balanced capital allocation model at our November Investor Day, and we are committed both to paying down debt to enhance our financial flexibility in operating the business as well as to returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
When we see that our valuation is compelling, we will act decisively, both within our formal trading program and opportunistically when we are able. In the third quarter, we bought back $37 million of our stock. In a little more than 2 months, we've returned $66 million to our shareholders. CSRA generates tremendous free cash flow, and we intend to use that to support total shareholder returns.
In summary, we are delivering growing bottom line results, prudently deploying capital for our shareholders and winning new contracts at a rate that should provide good top line growth for us in the coming years.
Now Dave will go through the financials in detail and provide our forward outlook."
301669938,321842403,931116,"CSRA Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2016",2016-02-10,"Earnings Calls","CSRA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone.

I'm pleased with our third quarter results, especially how well our team managed our costs while executing a very complex transaction. There are quite a few moving parts to the story, so let me talk through everything very deliberately and provide you with a clear view of our underlying performance.
Turning to Slide 5. In my remarks, I'll refer to the pro forma adjusted results disclosed in our press release. These figures assume the CSC spin and the SRA merger occurred at the beginning of the period, and they exclude costs directly associated with either the spin or merger transaction or the ongoing integration process.
We believe the pro forma adjusted results provide useful insight into the current CSRA run rate and therefore, provide an important baseline for comparing to past and future performance. Our press release provides all appropriate reconciliations from pro forma adjusted results to GAAP results.
To be as transparent as possible, we'll also specifically call out items that may differ across our peer set, especially as they relate to free cash flow, which we believe is a critical valuation metric. Following this call, Stuart and I will be happy to discuss the financial figures in more detail.
Let's walk through the Q3 income statement from top to bottom. Pro forma revenue was $1.27 billion, down 5.1% from the same period a year ago. On a pro forma basis, our Civil segment, which includes health, homeland security and other federal civilian agencies, was up 2% year-over-year. New program starts and expansions, primarily in health, more than offset reductions in material purchases on several federal civilian contracts.
Conversely, our Defense and Intelligence segment was down 13% year-over-year. A major source of this decline was our Army Logistics Modernization Program, which is transitioning to a maintenance phase after a very successful large-scale software deployment. In addition, lower material purchases on Navy contracts, the sale of the Welkin business and the wind down of Army OCO work outweighed the ramp-up on new intelligence programs.
As is typical for the December quarter, we experienced seasonally high leave-taking due to the holidays, which reduced revenue compared with the September quarter. The first 3 quarters of FY '16 have all been down 4% to 5% compared to FY '15. We're guiding sequential pro forma revenue growth in Q4, and we're optimistic that these year-over-year declines will begin to moderate, particularly in light of our excellent bookings performance so far this year.
Our contract mix is one of the key drivers of our margin differentiation and it was essentially unchanged in Q3. As a percentage of total revenue, our contracts were 44% fixed price, 20% time and materials and 36% cost-plus.
Q3 pro forma adjusted EBITDA was $224 million, as our EBITDA margin improved to 17.7%, driven by both of our operating segments. This strength in profitability reflects outstanding execution across our contact base and includes profit pickups on a few of our large fixed-price contracts. Net favorable adjustments in our estimates at completion or EACs for fixed-price contracts were $19 million in Q3, several million dollars higher than we'd expect in a normalized period going forward. Our margin performance also reflects strong direct labor content, the initial effects of our merger cost synergy program and a change in the estimation method of pension income.
Our Q3 pro forma adjusted EBITDA includes $4 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $28 million of net pension-related income. Our frozen pension plan regularly generates income from the return on plan assets, offset by expenses associated with plan obligations.
Like many companies in recent quarters, we elected in Q3 to change how we calculate the service and interest costs components of pension income, using the full yield curve instead of a single point on the curve. This approach should improve the correlation between projected benefit cash flows and yield curve spot rates and provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs.
The estimation method change was the primary driver for increased quarterly pro forma pension income of about $7 million compared with prior quarters in FY '16. And we expect to maintain this new run rate until the next measurement period this spring.
As Larry indicated, we've already achieved our original target of $80 million from SRA merger cost synergies, which should generate $50 million of annual EBITDA benefit after the effects of cost-plus contracts. We plan to drive additional cost synergies over the next several months, further bolstering our long-term plan to maintain adjusted EBITDA margins in excess of 16%.
This margin rate is sustainably above our peers based on our greater mix of fixed-price and T&M contracts, our pension income, our capital investments on key programs and our ability to drive lower direct and indirect costs.
Depreciation and amortization totaled $50 million on a pro forma adjusted basis in Q3. This excludes the amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog, an intangible asset valued at $65 million that is being amortized over 1 year. As a result, our GAAP amortization expense will be approximately $5.5 million higher per month than our adjusted amortization expense from December 2015 to November 2016. Compared to the 8-K, we filed on Christmas eve, the funded contract backlog asset is slightly lower based on a few minor updates in the purchase price accounting. Of course, these changes to depreciation and amortization are noncash items.
Interest expense totaled $29 million on a pro forma adjusted basis in Q3. This figure applies the effects of our post-spin and post-merger capital structure for the full quarter, including the interest on our term loans, revolving line of credit debt and capital leases as well as the deferred financing costs and original issue discount on the debt.
To calculate pro forma adjusted earnings, we applied our expected long-term effective tax rate of 39%. Our Q3 diluted share count was 165 million, down from our prior SEC filings due to the final share count calculations for a very complex transaction and the share repurchase program we initiated in December.
Pro forma adjusted earnings per share in Q3 were $0.48. The additional pension income associated with the change in estimation method and the lower share count added about $0.04 to our earnings per share in the quarter. Even excluding those benefits, we're very pleased with our ability to drive margins and earnings in a seasonally low quarter.
Turning to Slide 6 and the balance sheet as of January 1, 2016. We finished the quarter with $204 million of cash, $200 million of drawn revolver, $140 million of capital leases and $2.8 billion of term loan debt.
With the steady cash flow our business has generated historically and with $500 million of undrawn revolver capacity, we're pleased with the liquidity and flexibility that this capital structure affords us. And with an average interest rate currently around 3%, the cost of debt is very manageable. We will look to lock in a fixed rate on a portion of our debt through a hedging program this quarter.
The other balance sheet item I'll note is the net pension liability of approximately $468 million, the vast majority of which is included in the other long-term liabilities line. This figure, which is calculated based on GAAP guidelines applies a very low discount rate to the plan obligations given that interest rates remain historically low. Based on the IRS calculation methodology, which uses different actuarial and interest rate assumptions, our plan remains in an overfunded position, and we do not expect to be required by IRS guidelines to make any material cash contributions to the plan in the next several years.
The third quarter cash flow statement reflects a number of onetime items related to the spin-off and merger transactions. First, we received funding from CSC prior to the spin-off to bring CSGov's cash balance to $300 million.
Then on the dates of the spin-off and merger, we received the $3 billion of new debt financing and used it to pay off SRA's existing debt and hedges, distribute the cash portion of merger consideration to SRA shareholders, fund the special dividend to CSC shareholders and pay SRA's transaction-related expenses. Since then, we have made a number of other payments related to the spin-off and merger. We paid $30 million to CSC for the first of 5 annual maintenance payments under the intellectual property agreement that governs our proprietary information sharing. And in December, we paid transaction fees to investment banks and other advisory firms in excess of $20 million.
On the working capital side, accounts receivable increased by about $20 million compared to their usual run rate due to a normal seasonal slowdown in payments. Day sales outstanding for the quarter were 55 days. Our DSO should decline over the next few quarters due to seasonality and merger-related improvements.
In all, the third quarter was unique from a cash flow perspective, but formed the foundation for a solid capital structure going forward. As these onetime adjustments fade, we will focus on free cash flow, which is the lifeblood of the business. In general, we expect to generate free cash flow above net income as D&A exceeds CapEx by more than the noncash pension income.
We noted in our November Investor Day presentation that we would use a portion of our future free cash flows for shareholder returns in the form of both dividends and share buybacks. To that end, on our first day as a public company, our Board of Directors established a $0.10 per share quarterly dividend, which was paid in January and authorized a $400 million share repurchase program effective immediately and ending in March 2019. We intend to deploy cash to buy back shares over time when we believe our stock is undervalued and our balance sheet is well-suited to fund the payments. We kicked off the program with $37 million of share repurchases during December and another $13 million in January.
Turning to our forward guidance on Slide 7. Our plan in future periods is to provide annual guidance in the fourth quarter earnings report of the prior fiscal year and to update that guidance on subsequent calls as needed. We are providing Q4 guidance on this call to provide an extra degree of clarity given the complexity of our historical pro forma numbers, but we'll shift to annual guidance in the future.
We project that our fourth quarter 2016 revenue will be between $1.28 billion and $1.33 billion, which equates to a year-over-year pro forma revenue growth rate range of minus 5% to minus 1%. We don't currently expect that Q4 revenue should have any material adjustments, so this guidance is a GAAP figure.
We project that our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA will be between $214 million and $226 million, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share will be between $0.45 and $0.49.
These guidance ranges reflect gradual improvement from our Q3 revenue performance, driven in part by seasonal changes in leave taking and the conversion of revenue on new contract awards we've received in the first 3 quarters of FY '16. We also anticipate that our ongoing cost synergy program will incrementally improve SG&A performance in Q4.
Our guidance takes into consideration the effect of the recent major snowstorm on the East Coast, which closed government offices for a number of days, but we've attempted to mitigate that impact through teleworking and flextime programs.
Our Q4 revenue guidance also includes the impact of our lowered cost structure on cost-plus contracts as we realize synergies. This approach is fundamental to how we make business decisions. We intend to zealously guard profit dollars even at the expense of cost-plus revenue.
Although not in our adjusted EBITDA or EPS guidance, integration-related costs will diminish materially in the fourth quarter. FY '17 integration costs should be even smaller, primarily related to our ongoing IT system integration projects.
Looking ahead to FY '17, we anticipate better year-over-year revenue growth than we've had in FY '16, driven by the strength of our book-to-bill ratio this year and the backlog growth that has resulted from it.
Although cost-plus revenue will continue to be suppressed slightly by expense reductions, our earnings will benefit from the full year effect of our merger synergy initiatives, which will help to offset the pricing pressures to which we've become accustomed in recent years.
On the cash flow side, we expect to generate free cash flow in excess of net income consistent with our model, and we will look to pay down a portion of our debt and provide shareholder returns.
We also affirm our long-term model of an average compound annual growth rate in revenue of 2% to 3% and EPS of 8% to 10%. Combined with a meaningful dividend, we believe CSRA will be an attractive investment for our long-term shareholders.
With that, I'll turn it back to you Larry for some additional comments."

Let me start wi",973,"Thanks, Dave. Before turning to your questions, I want to take this opportunity on our first quarterly call to briefly lay out our strategy and differentiators to give you an understanding of who we are and where we're taking this company. Let me start with how we came into being. I'm now on Slide 8.
Splitting off with the U.S. public sector business from CSC allowed us to tune our messaging, our benefits and our go-to-market approach and focused it on our federal marketplace. It also allowed us to think about capital allocation differently, which enabled us to merge with SRA as part of our go-public process.
SRA was the perfect fit for us and is an integral part of CSRA, contributing richly to our culture and leadership team. SRA brought us broader access across the entire federal community with especially deep relationships and access in the health and federal civilian markets as well as complementary contracts in the defense and intelligence communities.
Most important is what the legacy CSGov and SRA businesses share. We share our passion for mission, a dedication in next-generation IT and a firm commitment to cost discipline. Both legacy companies are dedicated to a culture and values around honesty with all of our stakeholders and service in support of our customers.
This cultural compatibility is easing the integration process and our combined team is leaning forward together, taking advantages of combined capabilities and customer access to identify and to pursue newly addressable opportunities.
As shown on Slide 9, I see CSRA as the premier pure play provider of IT services to the U.S. public sector. And together, we will deliver innovations, efficiencies and tailored offerings to our customers, distinct long-term investment opportunities and added value creation to our investors, scaled to our strategic partners and targeted skills development and stronger career opportunities to our employees.
With more than 3/4 of our work in IT, we are the company best positioned to combine deep domain expertise with the ability to lead our public sector customers into their digital future.
The U.S. federal government is in the process of transforming its IT infrastructure and software systems, with mandates such as data center consolidation and cloud first in order to increase efficiency and reduce expenses. Federal CIOs expect relatively flat IT budgets over the next few years, with reductions in hardware spending based on virtualization and cloud initiatives.
The capabilities we provide address the priority areas of IT investment for the federal government, including cloud, cybersecurity, data analytics, agile-based software development methodologies and the inevitable modernization of the government's applications with a bias for software-as-a-service and to mobile devices.
For the federal government as a whole, next-generation technology offerings such as big data and cloud should show double-digit annual growth over the next 3 years.
Now turning to Slide 10. Several wins and program expansions demonstrate the strength of our go-to-market strategy.
First, at the Department of Homeland Security, we extended our work in support of the agency's Data Center 1 for 4.5 years and added nearly $1 billion of ceiling. [indiscernible] and his team developed creative solutions and contracting approaches to create an efficient and flexible contract focused on the as-a-service consumption-based model with access to our CSRA private cloud within the government's 4 walls.
Under the new contract, any DHS component can purchase a wide array of managed services, private cloud offerings, hardware and software, network and security infrastructure, app support and of course, project management.
This contract will help DHS evolve with technology and mission needs, while meeting their highest levels of security and giving them a trusted and stable foundation to transition to next-generation IT.
Second, we are beginning to ramp up the FAA cloud services contract, one of the largest cloud development opportunities in the federal market. I'm incredibly proud of Peter O'Donoghue [ph] and our team, which led all of our agile developers to respond to a high visibility short fuse requirement to development and deploy a new application designed to register small unmanned aircraft systems or drones. It was in anticipation of a surge in drone purchases during the most recent holiday season. And in just 6 weeks, we stood up an easy-to-use cloud-based system to register the drones, accept payment by credit card and print registration certificates.
Now we couldn't have done it without great partners. The Amazon Web Services cloud-based system linked together cutting-edge technology partners like Stripe, Stormpath and New Relic, and we can support over 1.5 million registrations per hour. This effort has built tremendous credibility for CSRA with the customer and with our partners, and it provides superb past performance qualifications as we bid new cloud-native applications.
Third, led by Ben Geesaman [ph], we won the recompete of our work for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. Our customer expanded our scope to a potential value of $115 million over 5 years. We will provide full software development life cycle expertise for a variety of applications, supporting probation and pretrial services and electronic court filings, and we will transition all application development to the Scaled Agile Framework and make use of DevOp methodologies.
Finally, our largest new win in the quarter came from the Department of Veterans Affairs. This was a legacy SRA win, spearheaded by Mark Cardarelli [ph], who Heads up our VA business. On this 5-year $233 million task order, we're helping the VA move to paperless claims processing to enable quicker processing of disability benefits for our vets. This is our first VA-wide program and it really provides us a natural entrée into claims processing.
Now these examples, and many more like them, convince me that CSRA will be able to meet our long-term financial goals, while helping our critical customers handle emerging problems of national significance.

When you look at the midpoint of our guidance for the fourth quarter, we're up a little from Q3. And it really is, it's the result of that natural tension, where we're working off some of our current book of business, but creating new revenue from the BD engine. The Logistics Modernization Program, yes, we're absolutely transitioning from very successful development program to O&M. We think the slope of decline has softened a little bit, but we absolutely have to replace that with new, new work. BD is absolutely demonstrating the ability to compete, win and the book-to-bill was showing it. So we think that particularly to growth on our horizon, I just can't call the quarter in FY '17 when it will happen. And we're busy working the FY '17 plan and plan to do guidance on FY '17 at the next earnings call. On a macro level, wow, it's a solid budget picture. The President's budget was more positive than I expected. And just watching the reaction of people wanting to add on to it. And whether it's for OCO or the Democratic senators thinking about the fed SIB side, the investment in cyber, the investment in repairing legacy IT. So I thought the budget picture was very positive. Now that's in tension with kind of the slow adoption rate of our federal customers for next-gen IT. They measure twice. They cut once. They put their toe in the water. And it's not nearly the adoption rate that we see in the commercial side, but it also doesn't have the cannibalization rate. So fundamentally, we got a timing issue. It's not a matter of if we pivot to growth, it's a matter of when. And you could -- you know Dave and I are naturally conservative as a newly public company, and we really look forward to like giving you color on this at the next earnings call."

I think we'll stop short of getting into a lot of detailed numbers around that when it comes to '17 and offer more insights on that and more detail on the next earnings call. With that said, we can give you some useful context, I think. As we look at the recompete picture for the year, I'd call it a fairly typical recompete picture. Our average contract length is around 5 years, and that would indicate that in a typical year roughly 20% would be up for recompete. As we look at '17, it's reasonable to expect that to be one of those pretty typical years. So obviously, it's incumbent on us to win the vast majority of those and sustain our business base that way. You touched on a point that is clearly relevant. We have many large contracts. Top 25 contracts are about half of our business. And those are in all different phases of their life cycle. So we've talked about logistics modernization for the Army, which is a maturing contract that will likely decline in FY '17 from '16. I wouldn't say there are any that are in that exact phase of their life cycle, but we have several other that have been really outstanding performers this year in terms of both organic growth and delivering in new and creative ways for their customers, as well as you could see in today's results, their bottom line performance and really outstanding profitability. So as we look at '17, obviously, our job is to do 2 things in that front: one, to deliver another year of sustained organic growth on those programs and to find new ways to deliver for those customers; and also to win as much new work as possible to fill the gap created by logistics modernization and other programs in that phase. So hopefully, that gives you a sense for it. It's not an atypical year, and it's one that we look forward to providing more specific guidance on, on the next call."

So the 17.7% you mentioned of EBITDA margin in Q3 included a few things that are worth noting as we did to a degree in our scripted comments. First, there were about 60 basis points of benefit from the higher pension income related to the change in calculation methodology there. In the quarter, we had a relatively small volume of cost synergies that impacted the quarter given the timing of the transaction. We'll have a few more of those impacting this quarter as we said given that we've now achieved the initial target for synergies. The EAC cost adjustments and overall contract profitability was really a outstanding element of the quarter, just fantastic execution on our programs and particularly on some of the large fixed-price contracts. So those were $19 million worth of EAC adjustments. With that said, that's not $19 million worth of onetime items. Certainly, we are a business of large fixed-price contracts among other contract forms, and we've had a fairly strong flow of favorable EAC adjustments given improvements in contract delivery efficiency over the last couple of years. But $19 million is not a level we'd feel comfortable projecting to every future quarter by any stretch. So we talked about several million dollars of lower expectation as we look at Q4 and beyond for those types of adjustments on fixed-price contracts. The other element I'd mention is we had relatively few ODC and direct material buys in the quarter. It was a quarter of strong revenue content compared to prior quarters and prior years. If we have more of those, obviously, revenue would benefit, the margin would come down just a bit."

We're pleased to report another strong quarter of profitability, cash flow and business development performance.

We're pleased to report another strong quarter of profitability, cash flow and business development performance. With about 6 months as a public company under our belts, merger integration is mostly behind us, and we've dramatically exceeded our cost synergy targets. 
We're now solidly focused on execution and our Q4 results demonstrate the strength of our position in the market. 
Since our last call, we've spent time on the road introducing the company to investors and we've gained additional research coverage, so we'll trim the commentary a bit to leave plenty of time for your questions. 
As I review our performance, 3 key points standout: first, our Q4 profit and cash flow, we're well ahead of our expectations, bolstering the investment thesis that we've laid out previously; second, our guidance for FY '17 demonstrates our relentless focus on efficiency to drive earnings, while lingering revenue headwinds abate; and third, our long-term growth model is very much intact. 
Now I'll explore each of these thoughts in a little bit more detail. First, on the quarterly results. Revenue and earnings were both up sequentially and all of our key metrics were within or above the guidance that we gave on last call. 
The number one question we get from investors is, can you sustain your margins and today's results provide additional evidence that the answer is yes. Our EBITDA margin of 17.4% leads the industry. The compatibility of our 2 legacy companies, compatibility and values like honesty and service, compatibility with our cultural affinity where the best idea wins, compatibility with a commitment to mission next-Gen IT and cost control, this compatibility has allowed us to move quickly and integration and as we come together, we've identified additional ways to operate more efficiently. 
Our expanded base of fixed-price contracts incentivizes us to drive down cost continually and responsibly. Our efficiencies create a near-term revenue headwind, but are highly accretive to earnings. 
During the quarter, we also posted strong bookings, which build the foundation for future revenue growth. 
Our book-to-bill of 1.0x for the quarter and 1.3x for the year demonstrates that we can compete fiercely in the federal IT marketplace. Almost half of the bookings in the quarter were new business, including our $252 million tenure award with the Security and Exchange Commission. 
In addition, we generated excellent free cash flow in the quarter and stuck to our balanced capital allocation model. Free cash flow was $167 million, which is double our net income and a result of our dedication to cash collections and cash management. 
We paid down significant debt, paid a quarterly dividend and repurchased our shares just as we said that we do when we approach the public market for the first time. 
Second, on the guidance for FY '17. We'll continue to carefully manage our margins to generate earnings growth. With pension income comparable to Q3 and Q4, our adjusted EBITDA range would be $886 million to $921 million and adjusted EPS would be $0.97 million to $2.10 million. 
This equates to year-over-year EPS growth of 4% at the midpoint and 7% at the high-end of the range. Dave  will update in just a minute the changes to the pension income that will modify these numbers. 
We expect revenue of $5 billion to $5.2 billion. At the midpoint, revenue would be 2% lower than in FY '16. More than half of the revenue reduction comes from the impact of our aggressive cost reductions on cost reimbursable contracts. 
This cost discipline is part of our DNA and we'll drive earnings in cash for our shareholders, as shown by the earnings growth in our FY '17 guidance. 
Within the last month, we had a few of our new wins protested, and we do not know when these will be completed. Therefore, we've taken them out of our guidance. Our new wins over the last year have been strong, and we're confident that the book-to-bill ratios above 1 will lead to growth, which brings me to my third point on our long-term model. We're committed to 2% to 3% revenue growth and 8% to 10% EPS growth annually over the long term. 
Our win rates and win volumes are testament to the relevance and competitiveness of our offerings. 
Our backlog is now $15.1 billion, which is about 3x annual revenue. Backlog is up 5% year-over-year and ultimately, revenue will grow in line with backlog. 
We have $6 billion in submitted proposals of waiting decisions, and we expect to submit more than $10 billion of proposals in the first half of the year. 
More broadly, our market is slowly returning to growth, and our customers are increasingly adopting next-generation IT. These trends give us further confidence in the direction we're taking the business as we aim to execute at the intersection of growing vertical markets and compelling technology offerings. 
In the process, you could rely on this management team to continue to take aggressive cost actions and freeing up the right resources to prudently invest in growth. 
Now Dave will provide a bit more detail on the financial results and our forward outlook."
301669938,331912029,992212,"CSRA Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, May 25, 2016",2016-05-25,"Earnings Calls","CSRA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. I share Larry's view that fourth quarter results were very strong. We maintained our focus on margins and cash collections, while solidifying our team and our operations. Turning to Slide 5 are primarily addr",1608,"Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. I share Larry's view that fourth quarter results were very strong. We maintained our focus on margins and cash collections, while solidifying our team and our operations. 
Turning to Slide 5 are primarily address pro forma and adjusted results. For prior periods, our pro forma results assumed CSC spin and SRA merger that already occurred and for all periods, we exclude cost directly associated with either the spin or merger transactions or the ongoing integration. 
We believe pro forma adjusted figures provide an important baseline for comparing the past and future performance. Our press release provides all appropriate reconciliations from pro forma adjusted results to GAAP results. 
Revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.29 billion, up 1.5% sequentially and down 4.4% from $1.35 billion of pro forma revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. 
The uptick in revenue compared to last quarter resulted from the normal pattern of lower leave taking  in our fourth quarter than in our third. 
On a pro forma basis, our Civil segment, which includes health, homeland security and other federal civilian agencies, was down 1% year-over-year. our Defense and Intelligence segment was down 8% year-over-year. One source of this decline was at Army Logistics Modernization Program, which is transitioning to a maintenance phase after a very successful large-scale software deployment. 
In addition, lower material purchases on Navy contracts, the sale of our business and the wind down of Army OCO work outweigh the ramp up of valuable new intelligence programs. Contract mix remained a key driver of profitability in Q4, as our mix continued its trend towards fixed price. 
As a percentage of total revenue, our contracts in the quarter were 45% fixed price, 21% time and materials and 35% cost-plus. 
Keying in on the income adjustments. We incurred a GAAP noncash expense of $203 million from the annual mark-to-market process for our pension programs, which is split about 97% in cost of services and 3% in SG&A. 
The noncash expense was a result of the continued low interest rate environment and the return on plan assets running below our long-term assumption. 
The mark-to-market remeasurement is part of our standard year-end process. We're not expecting another remeasurement gain or loss until next Q4. We also incurred merger and integration costs of $27 million in the quarter. 
With that in mind, you can really see the impact of our synergy savings. Pro forma SG&A was $44 million in the quarter compared to $62 million in Q3, and we expected to continue to decline in FY '17. 
More than half of the cost synergies are in cost of services. So in total, we're already generating savings of over $150 million on an annual run rate basis. 
We make tough choices quickly, which have enabled us to grow earnings, invest in growth and move forward as a team. 
As a result of these savings, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $225 million, near the high-end of our guidance. Adjusted EBITDA was up 8% from the same period a year ago, as EBITDA margin increased from 15.5% to 17.4%. 
Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA excludes $2 million of stock-based compensation expense and includes $28 million of net pension related income. 
Pro forma depreciation and amortization expense was $49 million, which excludes the $16 million GAAP intangibles amortization expense associated with SRAs funded contract backlog. 
Interest expense was $29 million in the quarter. 
Late in Q4, we hedged about half of our term loan debt. So our interest expense will be approximately $6 million higher in FY '17, but we'll have greater certainty and stability if interest rates rise from their historically low levels. 
Our comparability across periods, pro forma earnings per share are calculated assuming an effective tax rate of 39%, the company's estimated long-term rate. Pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.50, above the high-end of the guidance that we provided last call. 
EPS for the quarter was up 32% from $0.38 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and up 4% from last quarter. 
Diluted share count for the quarter was $164 million. The pro forma metrics for the fiscal year show the same basic patterns with the same underlying drivers, as the quarterly results. Revenue was $5.2 billion, which was down 4.5% from $5.4 billion in fiscal year 2015. Adjusted EBITDA was $894 million, which was up 3.4% from $865 million in fiscal year 2015, as adjusted EBITDA margins increased from 15.9% to 17.2%. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year were $1.96, which was up 14% from $1.72 in fiscal year 2015. 
Turning to Slide 6. We believe free cash flow should ultimately drive valuation. And it's an important metric in setting incentive compensation. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $167 million or 2.1x adjusted net income, well beyond our normal model of a little better than net income, as a result of sequential working capital improvements. 
During the quarter, the company deployed $117 million to pay down debt, $13 million to repurchase shares and $16 million in dividends, consistent with our balance capital deployment approach. 
Day sales outstanding were 52 days as of the quarter end, an improvement of 12 days from the end of the prior fiscal year and 3 days sequentially. 
Our ongoing program to sell our receivables lower DSO by about 13 days. Through this program, we're able to enhance our liquidity in a very reasonable cost because of the positive relationships that we have with our creditworthy government customers. 
As of April 1, 2016, the company had $130 million in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. 
On the debt side, we had $50 million of drawn revolver, $2.8 billion of term loan debt and $151 million of capital leases at quarter end. 
We expect to make at least another $40 million in debt payments in the first quarter of FY '17, consistent with our term loan agreements. Our steady cash flows and $650 million of undrawn revolver capacity provide substantial liquidity and flexibility to manage the business, pay down debt, return cash to shareholders and make accretive acquisitions. 
Turning to our forward guidance on Slide 7. We project that our FY 2017 revenue will be between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, which equates to year-over-year pro forma revenue growth rate range of minus 4% to flat, indicating progress from the rate of decline we experienced in FY '16. 
We project that our adjusted EBITDA will be between $870 million and $905 million. And our adjusted diluted earnings per share will be between $1.91 and $2.04. 
This earnings guidance includes a reduction in projected noncash pension income of $16 million. As Larry noted, absent this change, guidance would have been $886 million to $921 million for EBITDA and $1.97 to $2.10 for EPS. 
Finally, we're introducing free cash flow guidance of between $300 million and $350 million. At its midpoint, this would be slightly above our expectation for adjusted net income. 
Now let me provide a little more color on some of the individual metrics, starting with revenue. We told investors that in a typical year, we'll have 5% to 10% of our business that we need to replace. 
In FY '17, a few contract headwinds push us slightly above that range, in addition to the wind down of our Army Logistics Modernization Program we'll face tough compares on a few large contracts that had outstanding performance last year and will return to more normal levels this year. 
Our 3 largest movers, LMP, a loss DHS recompete and the New York Health Insurance Exchange contract, together decreased overall revenue by about 4%. This was part of the natural churn of our business. 
On top of the contract headwinds, the effective cost take out on our cost plus contracts reduces revenue by more than a point as well. 
As for tailwinds, we have had outstanding contract award activity over the past year. Recent new business awards, including those of the SEC, VA, Department of Justice and Key Intelligence Agencies should add about 5% to our FY '17 revenue. 
2 other new business awards that would have added another 1% to 2% were reversed on protest within the past month. 
In total, maintaining our strong level of new business wins should get us to the midpoint of our range, and we could move higher or lower based on better win performance for unexpected delays. 
On the earnings side, we're guiding to an EBITDA margin of about 17.5%, higher than our original target from the spin of 16% to 17%. We have some tough year-over-year compares with contract profitability and interest expense hedges will cost about $6 million in FY '17, but we'll be able to sustain the excellent margins we posted. 
Over the last 2 quarters given higher-than-expected synergy execution and our usual strength in contract profitability. Our guidance for the fiscal year includes a pension income forecast of $96 million based on the fourth quarter pension remeasurement. 
For the last half of FY '16, pension income was running at an annual rate of $112 million. Thus the change in pension reduced our EBITDA guidance for the year by $16 million and our EPS guidance by $0.06. 
To give you a picture of how the guidance will track over the fiscal year, many of the contract headwinds we've discussed are present in the first half of the fiscal year. We expect to build from there, as recent and expected new business wins ramp and are reflected in the second half results. 
With that, I'll turn it back to you, Larry, for some additional comments."

Before turning your questions, I want to spend a few more moments discussing our return to growth. 
We recognized that revenue growth is key to the long-term success of our business. And our recent business development results are very positive. 
I'm now on Slide 8. A second half of book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x normally our lowest awards quarters is really great news. Looking at the quarter in detail, supports our long-term growth picture. Of our $1.3 billion awards, 48% were for new works and our win rate on new work was 36%, which is well above our long-term target. 
Throughout  the company, we have great examples of building brilliant teams to attack the market, and I'd like to highlight 3 of them from the fourth quarter. First, as I said, we won a new 10-year $252 million contract to reshape and operate the IT infrastructure for the Securities and Exchange Commission. Project Manager, Brian Polk, led the winning team. We developed a compelling organizational change management plan and approach to mitigate the contract and migrate it from staff augmentation to fixed price managed services. We'll be providing next-gen IT support to 6,000 users at SEC headquarters and to 11 regional offices around the country. 
Second, under and energetic team leadership, we submitted our initial proposal, which is the primary recompete of our largest contract groundbreaker. We bid as part of the Eagle Alliance, a joint venture between CSRA and North with heavy participation from our next generation alliance partners. The massive bid submission is only the first of several submissions with an expected award in the spring or summer of calendar 2017. 
Third, we won a $54 million recompete of our stimulation work for the Environmental Protection Agency, with Deb Miller as the Project Manager and Proposal Lead. We're using best-in-class technologies, scientific applications and visualization technologies to develop sophisticated environmental models and simulations to provide insight into environmental issues that are too large to replicate in the real world work, like climate change. 
We want to be at the forefront of complex problems that span across agencies and climate changes is one of them. 
These are just a few examples of the early returns we're generating on growth investments. Still, we've not yet turned to growth, so we've decided as a company to take additional aggressive actions around business development as shown on Slide 9. 
First, we continued our step up in growth investments. As we spun out, we've been submitting about $10 billion annually in new business proposals. 
In the fourth quarter, we submitted about $3 billion of proposals for new awards, and we expect to accelerate that pace and reach $16 billion in new submits in FY '17. 
We've also invested in differentiated technical solutions. And that area, we've just been recognized as one off 3 cloud service providers, the others being Amazon Web Services and Microsoft to meet the rigorous security standards to achieve a fed ramp baseline accreditation. 
Our CIO, Jon deserves a lot of credit here. This is a major accomplishment and security enhancement, and it reassures our customers that CSRA is vigilant in providing highly secure government cloud services. 
This is one of the many signs that our strategy to become the leading partner to the U.S. Government, as it transitions the next-generation IT services is on track. 
Second, we changed our organizational structure and personnel. Working with the board and with Dave, I tuned up our organization to be more efficient and focused on growth. 
The new structure is leaner, with the heavy bias towards customer Going from 6 groups down to 4 has created clear lanes to pursue new work. George who is the driving force behind many of the large technology driven takeaway wins at SRA, has stepped up as CSRA's Chief Growth Officer. In addition, to business development, George will oversee our alliance partnerships and our technical solutions unified go-to-market organization. 
Finally, we come to another first in our life as a public company with our first Annual Meeting of Stockholders of CSRA Inc. to be held on August 9, 2016. 
This annual meeting will be a completely virtual meeting of stockholders, which will be conducted via live webcast. 
As a next-gen company, we're embracing the latest technology to provide expanded access, improved communications and of course, cost savings for our stockholders and the company.

We think that momentum that we've built up the new business is really solid and supports our long-term guidance. We wish it was happening today, but it's going to take us several quarters of fighting to continue to win those battles on the competitive landscape to see that growth."

And really, fundamentally, our book-to-bill has been 1 or higher now for, I think,  5 straight quarters. And anytime, we lose, especially, a recompete, we really want to go to the root cause and then see if there is any common themes. And frankly, we got some lessons learned, but they've been one-off as opposed to anything that's systemic. Overall, our recomplete win rate was about 80% for the year in terms of numbers -- I'm sorry, in terms of dollars. And I think like 96% in terms of numbers. And it's a slight downward movement, but it's not precipitous. There were 2, as Dave partially mentioned, recompete losses in the year that drove that 80% number. The first one was the  program at DHS. And clearly. that was a place where the customer wanted to split the program into several smaller contracts that we were in the radius to another large program and other large prime, and we've all got painted as big with the same brush. The awards generally went to smaller companies and my takeaway there is, we've got a really evidence and push our capabilities around next-gen, if we're going to differentiate ourselves as a big prime and really highlight the work we do with Amazon or the work we do with big data analytics get painted with just that SI brush for enterprise work. Web SEM was another one and there, we really think the merger with SRA really would have given us a different set of cards to play with. It was an ERP job and vendor partnerships are just critical, and that's just one of the strengths that legacy CSC brings to the table. SRA just didn't have that ERP experience or that we now have jointly as CSRA. So I think it would be a different outcome if we had been in player earlier."

So we think of our long-term capital deployment levels at about 50%, through a debt reduction 40%, through shareholder returns in 10% M&A. Obviously, that last piece is the most volatile of them even that it's dependent on the specific and strategy copper jennet is in the M&A space. In terms of investments needed  in to -- in terms of reinvestment in the business that's going to be a lower number over time. We typically don't have great capital requirements and around our cloud capabilities, we have a few specific contracts that have some capital requirements, but not necessarily in that space. We don't see that as a major cash need going forward."

So for example, we ramped up ramping up a test as a service capability, where we're repurposing work that's done virtually across the nation and getting a center of excellence in Bossier City. Ramping up the Java developers or ramping up exports, a lot of that is hiring to programs and building critical mass for that technical talent that's needed and really to work with our partners. That central to our move to next-gen IT is less direct investment by us as oppose to we bring the customer knowledge they work cooperatively with an Amazon Web Services  to deliver a next-gen service.

So think of real growth of 3% over the long-term. You are sensing higher single-digit growth for cyber work and double-digit growth for cloud and data analytics. There is a rich debate right now over the President's proposal to have a $3 billion fund, really focused on legacy repair of IT to improve our cyber posture of the federal government. So I keep a steady eye on how that results, as it works this way across the debate. I think there's a hearing with GSA in the CIOs  of government this week or next week. I know they've been working the hill And what I think it underpins is how important cyber is to the nation and that you got to work the fundamental enterprise IT to do it. So I think the trends are positive. But again, it's a very political environment with a lot of polarization on the Hill and Presidential campaign, I think, unprecedented in the noise level. When you asked about the conversion of revenue, remember the process was to build our pipeline, getting to the $16 billion of annual submits, working through the time line of those being awarded and then converting to revenue. So this is the earnings release of where we're stepping up our new submits by -- I don't know 60% with all of the investment around that. As Stuart said, we'll be frontloading a lot of those submits, and we think the awards in our first half, but remember for every one of those, their average life of 5-year contracts, so you also have to mitigate and think of the funnel of your profitability of win. So we expect in '18 to start to see the real impact of that and affecting us positively in growth. But that's the kind of time time you have to think about it moving from pipeline to submits, to awards to that $800 million run rate."

Welcome, everyone, to today's quarterly earnings conference call. Larry Prior, our CEO; and Dave Keffer, our CFO, are here to discuss our financial results, business momentum and forward outlook.
Today's call is being webcast on the Investor Relations portion of our website, where you'll also find the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation slides that we'll be using during today's call.
The information contained in the earnings release and supplemental financial presentation is fundamentally unaudited at this point.
Turning to Slide 2 of the presentation, please note that during this call, we will make forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated results.
For a full discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please refer to our SEC filings, including our Form 10-Q from February and our Form 10-K, which we will file later this week.
In addition, the statements represent our views as of today, and subsequent events may cause our views to change. We may elect to update the forward-looking statements at some point in the future, but we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.
Finally, as shown on Slide 3, we will discuss some non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics, which we believe provide useful information for investors. Unless specifically called out, all statements on the call reference pro forma adjusted figures.
The slide deck for today's call includes an explanation of those adjustments and other reconciliations of the figures to the most comparable GAAP measures.
At this time, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Larry, who will begin on Slide 4."

We're pleased to report another strong quarter of profitability, cash flow and business development performance. With about 6 months as a public company under our belts, merger integration is mostly behind us, and we've dramatically exceeded our cost synergy targets. We're now solidly focused on execution, and our Q4 results demonstrate the strength of our position in the market.
Since our last call, we have spent time on the road introducing the company to investors and we've gained additional research coverage, so we'll trim the commentary a bit to leave plenty of time for your questions.
As I review our performance, 3 key points standout. First, our Q4 profit and cash flow we're well ahead of our expectations, bolstering the investment thesis that we've laid out previously; second, our guidance for FY '17 demonstrates our relentless focus on efficiency to drive earnings while lingering revenue headwinds abate; and third, our long-term growth model is very much intact.
Now I'll explore each of these thoughts in a little bit more detail. First, on the quarterly results. Revenue and earnings were both up sequentially, and all of our key metrics were within or above the guidance that we gave on last call. The number one question we get from investors is, ""Can you sustain your margins?"" And today's results provide additional evidence that the answer is yes.
Our EBITDA margin at 17.4% leads the industry. The compatibility of our 2 legacy companies, compatibility and values like honesty and service, compatibility with our cultural affinity where the best idea wins, compatibility with a commitment to mission next-gen IT and cost control, this compatibility has allowed us to move quickly on integration and as we've come together, we've identified additional ways to operate more efficiently.
Our expanded base of fixed-price contracts incentivizes us to drive down cost continually and responsibly. Our efficiencies create a near-term revenue headwind, but are highly accretive to earnings.
During the quarter, we also posted strong bookings, which build the foundation for future revenue growth. Our book-to-bill of 1.0x for the quarter and 1.3x for the year demonstrates that we can compete fiercely in the federal IT marketplace. Almost half of the bookings in the quarter were for new business, including our $252 million 10-year award with the Security and Exchange Commission.
In addition, we generated excellent free cash flow in the quarter and stuck to our balanced capital allocation model. Free cash flow was $167 million, which is double our net income and a result of our dedication to cash collections and cash management.
We paid down significant debt, paid a quarterly dividend and repurchased our shares just as we said that we'd do when we approached the public market for the first time.
Second, on the guidance for FY '17. We will continue to carefully manage our margins to generate earnings growth. With pension income comparable to Q3 and Q4, our adjusted EBITDA range would be $886 million to $921 million and adjusted EPS would be $1.97 million to $2.10 million. This equates to year-over-year EPS growth of 4% at the midpoint and 7% at the high-end of the range. Dave  will update in just a minute the changes to the pension income that will modify these numbers.
We expect revenue of $5 billion to $5.2 billion. At the midpoint, revenue would be 2% lower than in FY '16. More than half of the revenue reduction comes from the impact of our aggressive cost reductions on cost reimbursable contracts. This cost discipline is part of our DNA and will drive earnings in cash for our shareholders, as shown by the earnings growth in our FY '17 guidance.
Within the last month, we've had a few of our new wins protested and we do not know when these will be concluded. Therefore, we've taken them out of our guidance. Our new wins over the last year have been strong, and we're confident that the book-to-bill ratios above 1 will lead to growth, which brings me to my third point on our long-term model. We are committed to 2% to 3% revenue growth and 8% to 10% EPS growth annually over the long term. Our win rates and win volumes are testament to the relevance and competitiveness of our offerings.
Our backlog is now $15.1 billion, which is about 3x annual revenue. Backlog is up 5% year-over-year and ultimately, revenue will grow in line with backlog. We have $6 billion in submitted proposals awaiting decision, and we expect to submit more than $10 billion of proposals in the first half of the year.
More broadly, our market is slowly returning to growth, and our customers are increasingly adopting next-generation IT. These trends give us further confidence in the direction we're taking the business as we aim to execute at the intersection of growing vertical markets and compelling technology offerings. In the process, you could rely on this management team to continue to take aggressive cost actions in freeing up the right resources to prudently invest in growth.
Now Dave will provide a bit more detail on the financial results and our forward outlook."
301669938,331912029,992334,"CSRA Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, May 25, 2016",2016-05-25,"Earnings Calls","CSRA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. I share Larry's view that fourth quarter results were very strong. We maintained our focus on margins and cash collections, while solidifying our team and our operations.Turning to Slide 5. I'll primarily add",1613,"Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. I share Larry's view that fourth quarter results were very strong. We maintained our focus on margins and cash collections, while solidifying our team and our operations.
Turning to Slide 5. I'll primarily address pro forma and adjusted results. For prior periods, our pro forma results assumed the CSC spin and SRA merger had already occurred. And for all periods, we exclude cost directly associated with either the spin or merger transactions or the ongoing integration. We believe pro forma adjusted figures provide an important baseline for comparing the past and future performance. Our press release provides all appropriate reconciliations from pro forma adjusted results to GAAP results.
Revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.29 billion, up 1.5% sequentially and down 4.4% from $1.35 billion of pro forma revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. The uptick in revenue compared to last quarter resulted from the normal pattern of lower leave taking in our fourth quarter than in our third.
On a pro forma basis, our Civil segment, which includes health, homeland security and other federal civilian agencies, was down 1% year-over-year. Our Defense and Intelligence segment was down 8% year-over-year. One source of this decline was our Army Logistics Modernization Program, which is transitioning to a maintenance phase after a very successful large-scale software deployment. In addition, lower material purchases on Navy contracts, the sale of our Welkin business and the wind down of Army OCO work outweighed the ramp up of valuable new intelligence programs.
Contract mix remained a key driver of profitability in Q4, as our mix continued its trend towards fixed price. As a percentage of total revenue, our contracts in the quarter were 45% fixed price, 21% time and materials and 35% cost-plus.
Keying in on the income adjustments, we incurred a GAAP noncash expense of $203 million from the annual mark-to-market process for our pension programs, which is split about 97% in cost of services and 3% in SG&A. The noncash expense was a result of the continued low interest rate environment and the return on plan assets running below our long-term assumption.
The mark-to-market remeasurement is part of our standard year-end process. We're not expecting another remeasurement gain or loss until next Q4. We also incurred merger and integration costs of $27 million in the quarter.
With that in mind, you can really see the impact of our synergy savings. Pro forma SG&A was $44 million in the quarter compared to $62 million in Q3, and we expect it to continue to decline in FY '17.
More than half of the cost synergies are in cost of services. So in total, we're already generating savings of over $150 million on an annual run rate basis.
We made tough choices quickly, which have enabled us to grow earnings, invest in growth and move forward as a team. As a result of these savings, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $225 million, near the high-end of our guidance. Adjusted EBITDA was up 8% from the same period a year ago, as EBITDA margin increased from 15.5% to 17.4%. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA excludes $2 million of stock-based compensation expense and includes $28 million of net pension-related income.
Pro forma depreciation and amortization expense was $49 million, which excludes the $16 million GAAP intangibles amortization expense associated with SRAs funded contract backlog. Interest expense was $29 million in the quarter.
Late in Q4, we hedged about half of our term loan debt. So our interest expense will be approximately $6 million higher in FY '17, but we will have greater certainty and stability if interest rates rise from their historically low levels.
For comparability across periods, pro forma earnings per share are calculated assuming an effective tax rate of 39%, the company's estimated long-term rate. Pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.50, above the high-end of the guidance that we provided last call. EPS for the quarter was up 32% from $0.38 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and up 4% from last quarter. Diluted share count for the quarter was 164 million.
The pro forma metrics for the fiscal year show the same basic patterns with the same underlying drivers as the quarterly results. Revenue was $5.2 billion, which was down 4.5% from $5.4 billion in fiscal year 2015. Adjusted EBITDA was $894 million, which was up 3.4% from $865 million in fiscal year 2015 as adjusted EBITDA margins increased from 15.9% to 17.2%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year were $1.96, which was up 14% from $1.72 in fiscal year 2015.
Turning to Slide 6. We believe free cash flow should ultimately drive valuation, and it's an important metric in setting incentive compensation. Free cash flow for the quarter was $167 million or 2.1x adjusted net income, well beyond our normal model of a little better than net income as a result of sequential working capital improvements.
During the quarter, the company deployed $170 million to pay down debt, $13 million to repurchase shares and $16 million in dividends, consistent with our balanced capital deployment approach.
Day sales outstanding were 52 days as of the quarter end, an improvement of 12 days from the end of the prior fiscal year and 3 days sequentially. Our ongoing program to sell our receivables lowered DSO by about 13 days. Through this program, we're able to enhance our liquidity at a very reasonable cost because of the positive relationships that we have with our very creditworthy government customers.
As of April 1, 2016, the company had $130 million in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. 
On the debt side, we had $50 million of drawn revolver, $2.8 billion of term loan debt and $151 million of capital leases at quarter end. We expect to make at least another $40 million in debt payments in the first quarter of FY '17, consistent with our term loan agreements.
Our steady cash flows and $650 million of undrawn revolver capacity provide substantial liquidity and flexibility to manage the business, pay down debt, return cash to shareholders and make accretive acquisitions.
Turning to our forward guidance on Slide 7. We project that our FY 2017 revenue will be between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, which equates to a year-over-year pro forma revenue growth rate range of minus 4% to flat, indicating progress from the rate of decline we experienced in FY '16.
We project that our adjusted EBITDA will be between $870 million and $905 million. And our adjusted diluted earnings per share will be between $1.91 and $2.04. This earnings guidance includes a reduction in projected noncash pension income of $16 million. As Larry noted, absent this change, guidance would have been $886 million to $921 million for EBITDA and $1.97 to $2.10 for EPS.
Finally, we're introducing free cash flow guidance of between $300 million and $350 million. At its midpoint, this would be slightly above our expectation for adjusted net income.
Now let me provide a little more color on some of the individual metrics, starting with revenue. We've told investors that in a typical year, we'll have 5% to 10% of our business that we need to replace. In FY '17, a few contract headwinds push us slightly above that range. In addition to the wind down of our Army Logistics Modernization Program, we'll face tough compares on a few large contracts that had outstanding performance last year and will return to more normal levels this year.
Our 3 largest movers: LMP, a loss to DHS recompete and the New York Health Insurance Exchange contract, together, decreased overall revenue by about 4%. This is part of the natural churn of our business. On top of the contract headwinds, the effective cost take out on our cost-plus contracts reduces revenue by more than a point as well.
As for tailwinds, we have had outstanding contract award activity over the past year. Recent new business awards, including those at the SEC, VA, Department of Justice and key intelligence agencies should add about 5% to our FY '17 revenue.
Two other new business awards that would have added another 1% to 2% were reversed on protest within the past month.
In total, maintaining our strong level of new business wins should get us to the midpoint of our range, and we could move higher or lower based on better win performance or unexpected delays.
On the earnings side, we're guiding to an EBITDA margin of about 17.5%, higher than our original target from the spin of 16% to 17%. We have some tough year-over-year compares for contract profitability, and interest expense hedges will cost about $6 million in FY '17. But we'll be able to sustain the excellent margins we've posted over the last 2 quarters, given higher-than-expected synergy execution and our usual strength in contract profitability.
Our guidance for the fiscal year includes a pension income forecast of $96 million based on the fourth quarter pension remeasurement. For the last half of FY '16, pension income was running at an annual rate of $112 million. Thus, the change in pension reduced our EBITDA guidance for the year by $16 million and our EPS guidance by $0.06.
To give you a picture of how the guidance will track over the fiscal year, many of the contract headwinds we've discussed are present in the first half of the fiscal year. We expect to build from there as recent and expected new business wins ramp and are reflected in the second half results.
With that, I'll turn it back to you, Larry, for some additional comments."

Before turning your questions, I want to spend a few more moments discussing our return to growth. 
We recognize that revenue growth is key to the long-term success of our business, and our recent business development results are very positive.
I'm now on Slide 8. A second half book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x in what are normally our lowest awards quarters is really great news. Looking at the quarter in detail supports a long-term growth picture. Of our $1.3 billion awards, 48% were for new works and our win rate on new work was 36%, which is well above our long-term target.
Throughout the company, we have great examples of building brilliant teams to attack the market, and I'd like to highlight 3 of them from the fourth quarter. First, as I said, we won a new 10-year $252 million contract to reshape and operate the IT infrastructure for the Securities and Exchange Commission. Project Manager, Brian Polk, led the winning team. We developed a compelling organizational change management plan and approach to mitigate the contract and migrate it from staff augmentation to fixed-price managed services. We'll be providing next-gen IT support to 6,000 users at SEC headquarters and to 11 regional offices around the country.
Second, under Leigh Palmer's and Ben Gianni's [ph] energetic leadership, we submitted our initial Greenway proposal, which is the primary recompete of our largest contract, Groundbreaker. We bid as part of the Eagle Alliance, a joint venture between CSRA and Northrop Grumman with heavy participation from our next-generation alliance partners. The massive bid submission is only the first of several submissions with an expected award in the spring or summer of calendar 2017.
Third, we won a $54 million recompete of our simulation work for the Environmental Protection Agency, with Deb Miller as the Project Manager and Proposal Lead. We're using best-in-class technologies, scientific applications and visualization technologies to develop sophisticated environmental models and simulations to provide insight into environmental issues that are just too large to replicate in the real world, like climate change. We want to be at the forefront of complex problems that span across agencies, and climate changes is one of them.
These are just a few examples of the early returns we're generating on growth investments. Still, we've not yet turned to growth, so we've decided as a company to take additional aggressive actions around business development as shown on Slide 9.
First, we continued our step-up in growth investments. As we spun out, we've been submitting about $10 billion annually in new business proposals. In the fourth quarter, we submitted about $3 billion of proposals for new awards, and we expect to accelerate that pace and reach $16 billion in new submits in FY '17.
We've also invested in differentiated technical solutions. In that area, we've just been recognized as one off 3 cloud service providers, the others being Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, to meet the rigorous security standards to achieve a FedRAMP, FISMA High baseline accreditation.
Our CIO, John Dancy, deserves a lot of credit here. This is a major accomplishment in security enhancement, and it reassures our customers that CSRA is vigilant in providing highly secure government cloud services. This is one of the many signs that our strategy to become the leading partner to the U.S. Government as it transitions to next-generation IT services is on track.
Second, we changed our organizational structure and personnel. Working with the board and with Dave, I tuned up our organization to be more efficient and focused on growth. The new structure is leaner, with a heavy bias towards customer intimacy. Going from 6 groups down to 4 has created clearer lanes to pursue new work.
George Batsakis, who is the driving force behind many of the large technology driven takeaway wins at SRA, has stepped up as CSRA's Chief Growth Officer. In addition, to business development, George will oversee our alliance partnerships and our technical solutions in a unified go-to-market organization. 
Finally, we come to another first in our life as a public company with our first Annual Meeting of Stockholders of CSRA Inc. to be held on August 9, 2016. This annual meeting will be a completely virtual meeting of stockholders, which will be conducted via live webcast. As a next-gen company, we are embracing the latest technology to provide expanded access, improved communications and of course, cost savings for our stockholders and the company.
Operator, we're now ready to take some questions."

And really, fundamentally, our book-to-bill has been 1 or higher now for, I think, 5 straight quarters. And anytime we lose, especially a recompete, we really want to go to the root cause and then see if there is any common themes. And frankly, we got some lessons learned, but they've been one-offs as opposed to anything that's systemic. Overall, our recompete win rate was about 80% for the year in terms of numbers -- I'm sorry, in terms of dollars, and I think like 96% in terms of numbers. And it's a slight downward movement, but it's not precipitous. There were 2, as Dave partially mentioned, recompete losses in the year that drove that 80% number. The first one was the SPAS program at DHS. And clearly, that was a place where the customer wanted to split the program into several smaller contracts that we were in the burst radius of his reaction to another large program, another large prime, and we all got painted as big SIs with the same brush. The awards generally went to smaller companies. And my takeaway there is, we've got to really evidence and push our capabilities around next-gen if we're going to differentiate ourselves as a big prime and really highlight the work we do with Amazon or Azure, the work we do with Big Data analytics, to not get painted with just that SI brush for enterprise work. Web SEM was another one and there, we really think the merger with SRA really would have given us a different set of cards to play with. It was an ERP job and vendor partnerships are just critical, and that's just one of the strengths that legacy CSC brings to the table. SRA just didn't have that ERP experience or quals that we now have jointly as CSRA. So I think it would have been a different outcome if we had been in play earlier."

There's a rich debate right now over the President's proposal to have a $3 billion fund really focused on legacy repair of IT to improve our cyber posture of the federal government. So I'd keep a steady eye on how that resolves as it works its way across the debate. I think there's a hearing with GSA and the CIO of government this week or next week. I know they've been working the hill immensely. And what I think it underpins is how important cyber is to the nation in that you've got to work the fundamental enterprise IT to do it. So I think that the trends are positive. But again, it's a very political environment with a lot of polarization on the hill and Presidential campaign, I think, unprecedented in the noise level. When you ask about the conversion of revenue, remember the process was to build our pipeline, getting to the $16 billion of annual submits, working through the time line of those being awarded and then converting to revenue. So this is the year where we're stepping up our new submits by, I don't know, 60% with all of the investment around that. As Stuart said, we'll be front-loading a lot of those submits, and we think the awards in our first half -- but remember for every one of those, they're average life of 5-year contracts, so you also have to mitigate and think of the funnel of your profitability of win. So we expect in '18 to start to see the real impact of that and affecting us positively in year-to-year growth.

So I think that's a positive note in the market and should continue, I think, to improve once we get past the Presidential election. But I also think that we've really benefited from our investment in technical differentiation for next-generation IT. We've teamed well for both cloud as well as Big Data and other enterprise-wide moves to next-gen. So I think being able to differentiate ourselves with our customers where we know their mission, we know their enterprise IT and we can help them with that digital future has helped us in our company in getting those wins."

We see some slight movement in what we've won recently toward fixed-price, that could either continue or reverse itself. Long term, we continue to see the current mix being a reasonable planning assumption. What I've seen and witnessed is that sometimes it's hard to get a customer to move to fixed price, but once they have, there's a lot of inertia there. They see a lot of benefits, they like the predictability of it, they like the incentives that it provides and the lower price. And so they tend to stay in fixed price."

We're pleased to report another strong quarter of profitability, cash flow and business development performance.

We're pleased to report another strong quarter of profitability, cash flow and business development performance. With about 6 months as a public company under our belts, merger integration is mostly behind us, and we've dramatically exceeded our cost synergy targets. We're now solidly focused on execution, and our Q4 results demonstrate the strength of our position in the market.
Since our last call, we have spent time on the road introducing the company to investors and we've gained additional research coverage, so we'll trim the commentary a bit to leave plenty of time for your questions.
As I review our performance, 3 key points stand out. First, our Q4 profit and cash flow were well ahead of our expectations, bolstering the investment thesis that we've laid out previously. Second, our guidance for FY '17 demonstrates our relentless focus on efficiency to drive earnings while lingering revenue headwinds abate. And third, our long-term growth model is very much intact.
Now I'll explore each of these thoughts in a little bit more detail. First, on the quarterly results. Revenue and earnings were both up sequentially, and all of our key metrics were within or above the guidance that we gave on the last call. The number one question we get from investors is, ""Can you sustain your margins?"" And today's results provide additional evidence that the answer is yes.
Our EBITDA margin of 17.4% leads the industry. The compatibility of our 2 legacy companies, compatibility and values like honesty and service, compatibility with a cultural affinity where the best idea wins, compatibility with a commitment to mission next-gen IT and cost control, this compatibility has allowed us to move quickly on integration, and as we've come together we've identified additional ways to operate more efficiently.
Our expanded base of fixed-price contracts incentivizes us to drive down costs continually and responsibly. Our efficiencies create a near-term revenue headwind but are highly accretive to earnings.
During the quarter we also posted strong bookings, which build the foundation for future revenue growth. Our book-to-bill of 1.0x for the quarter and 1.3x for the year demonstrates that we can compete fiercely in the federal IT marketplace. Almost half of the bookings in the quarter were for new business, including our $252 million 10-year award with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In addition, we generated excellent free cash flow in the quarter and stuck to our balanced capital allocation model. Free cash flow was $167 million, which is double our net income and a result of our dedication to cash collections and cash management.
We paid down significant debt, paid a quarterly dividend and repurchased our shares, just as we said that we'd do when we approached the public market for the first time.
Second, on the guidance for FY '17. We will continue to carefully manage our margins to generate earnings growth. With pension income comparable to Q3 and Q4, our adjusted EBITDA range would be $886 million to $921 million and adjusted EPS would be $1.97 to $2.10. This equates to year-over-year EPS growth of 4% at the midpoint and 7% at the high-end of the range. Dave will update in just a minute the changes to the pension income that will modify these numbers.
We expect revenue of $5 billion to $5.2 billion. At the midpoint, revenue would be 2% lower than in FY '16. More than half of the revenue reduction comes from the impact of our aggressive cost reductions on cost reimbursable contracts. This cost discipline is part of our DNA and will drive earnings in cash for our shareholders, as shown by the earnings growth in our FY '17 guidance.
Within the last month we've had a few of our new wins protested and we do not know when these will be concluded. Therefore, we've taken them out of our guidance. Our new wins over the last year have been strong, and we're confident that the book-to-bill ratios above 1 will lead to growth, which brings me to my third point on our long-term model. We are committed to 2% to 3% revenue growth and 8% to 10% EPS growth annually over the long term. Our win rates and win volumes are testament to the relevance and competitiveness of our offerings.
Our backlog is now $15.1 billion, which is about 3x annual revenue. Backlog is up 5% year-over-year, and ultimately revenue will grow in line with backlog. We have $6 billion in submitted proposals awaiting decision, and we expect to submit more than $10 billion of proposals in the first half of the year.
More broadly, our market is slowly returning to growth, and our customers are increasingly adopting next-generation IT. These trends give us further confidence in the direction we're taking the business as we aim to execute at the intersection of growing vertical markets and compelling technology offerings. In the process, you can rely on this management team to continue to take aggressive cost actions in freeing up the right resources to prudently invest in growth.
Now Dave will provide a bit more detail on the financial results and our forward outlook."

I share Larry's view that fourth quarter results were very strong. We maintained our focus on margins and cash collections, while solidifying our team and our operations.Turning to Slide 5. I'll primarily add",1610,"Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. I share Larry's view that fourth quarter results were very strong. We maintained our focus on margins and cash collections, while solidifying our team and our operations.
Turning to Slide 5. I'll primarily address pro forma and adjusted results. For prior periods, our pro forma results assumed the CSC spin and SRA merger had already occurred. And for all periods we exclude costs directly associated with either the spin or merger transactions or the ongoing integration. We believe pro forma adjusted figures provide an important baseline for comparing the past and future performance. Our press release provides all appropriate reconciliations from pro forma adjusted results to GAAP results.
Revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.29 billion, up 1.5% sequentially and down 4.4% from $1.35 billion of pro forma revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. The uptick in revenue compared to last quarter resulted from the normal pattern of lower leave-taking in our fourth quarter than in our third.
On a pro forma basis, our Civil segment, which includes health, Homeland Security and other federal civilian agencies, was down 1% year-over-year. Our Defense and Intelligence segment was down 8% year-over-year. One source of this decline was our Army Logistics Modernization Program, which is transitioning to a maintenance phase after a very successful large-scale software deployment. In addition, lower material purchases on Navy contracts, the sale of our Welkin business and the wind-down of Army OCO work outweighed the ramp-up of valuable new intelligence programs.
Contract mix remained a key driver of profitability in Q4, as our mix continued its trend towards fixed price. As a percentage of total revenue, our contracts in the quarter were 45% fixed price, 21% time and materials and 35% cost-plus.
Keying in on the income adjustments, we incurred a GAAP noncash expense of $203 million from the annual mark-to-market process for our pension programs, which is split about 97% in cost of services and 3% in SG&A. The noncash expense was a result of the continued low interest rate environment and the return on plan assets running below our long-term assumption.
The mark-to-market remeasurement is part of our standard year-end process. We're not expecting another remeasurement gain or loss until next Q4. We also incurred merger and integration costs of $27 million in the quarter.
With that in mind, you can really see the impact of our synergy savings. Pro forma SG&A was $44 million in the quarter compared to $62 million in Q3, and we expect it to continue to decline in FY '17.
More than half of the cost synergies are in cost of services. So in total, we're already generating savings of over $150 million on an annual run rate basis.
We made tough choices quickly, which have enabled us to grow earnings, invest in growth and move forward as a team. As a result of these savings, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $225 million, near the high end of our guidance. Adjusted EBITDA was up 8% from the same period a year ago, as EBITDA margin increased from 15.5% to 17.4%. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA excludes $2 million of stock-based compensation expense and includes $28 million of net pension-related income.
Pro forma depreciation and amortization expense was $49 million, which excludes the $16 million GAAP intangibles amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog. Interest expense was $29 million in the quarter.
Late in Q4 we hedged about half of our term loan debt. So our interest expense will be approximately $6 million higher in FY '17, but we will have greater certainty and stability if interest rates rise from their historically low levels.
For comparability across periods, pro forma earnings per share are calculated assuming an effective tax rate of 39%, the company's estimated long-term rate. Pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.50, above the high end of the guidance that we provided last call. EPS for the quarter was up 32% from $0.38 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and up 4% from last quarter. Diluted share count for the quarter was 164 million.
The pro forma metrics for the fiscal year show the same basic patterns with the same underlying drivers as the quarterly results. Revenue was $5.2 billion, which was down 4.5% from $5.4 billion in fiscal year 2015. Adjusted EBITDA was $894 million, which was up 3.4% from $865 million in fiscal year 2015, as adjusted EBITDA margins increased from 15.9% to 17.2%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year were $1.96, which was up 14% from $1.72 in fiscal year 2015.
Turning to Slide 6. We believe free cash flow should ultimately drive valuation, and it's an important metric in setting incentive compensation. Free cash flow for the quarter was $167 million or 2.1x adjusted net income, well beyond our normal model of a little better than net income as a result of sequential working capital improvements.
During the quarter the company deployed $170 million to pay down debt, $13 million to repurchase shares and $16 million in dividends, consistent with our balanced capital deployment approach.
Day sales outstanding were 52 days as of the quarter end, an improvement of 12 days from the end of the prior fiscal year and 3 days sequentially. Our ongoing program to sell our receivables lowered DSO by about 13 days. Through this program we're able to enhance our liquidity at a very reasonable cost because of the positive relationships that we have with our very creditworthy government customers.
As of April 1, 2016, the company had $130 million in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. 
On the debt side, we had $50 million of drawn revolver, $2.8 billion of term loan debt and $151 million of capital leases at quarter end. We expect to make at least another $40 million in debt payments in the first quarter of FY '17, consistent with our term loan agreements.
Our steady cash flows and $650 million of undrawn revolver capacity provide substantial liquidity and flexibility to manage the business, pay down debt, return cash to shareholders and make accretive acquisitions.
Turning to our forward guidance on Slide 7. We project that our FY 2017 revenue will be between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, which equates to a year-over-year pro forma revenue growth rate range of minus 4% to flat, indicating progress from the rate of decline we experienced in FY '16.
We project that our adjusted EBITDA will be between $870 million and $905 million and our adjusted diluted earnings per share will be between $1.91 and $2.04. This earnings guidance includes a reduction in projected noncash pension income of $16 million. As Larry noted, absent this change, guidance would have been $886 million to $921 million for EBITDA and $1.97 to $2.10 for EPS.
Finally, we're introducing free cash flow guidance of between $300 million and $350 million. At its midpoint, this would be slightly above our expectation for adjusted net income.
Now let me provide a little more color on some of the individual metrics, starting with revenue. We've told investors that in a typical year we'll have 5% to 10% of our business that we need to replace. In FY '17, a few contract headwinds push us slightly above that range. In addition to the wind-down of our Army Logistics Modernization Program, we'll face tough compares on a few large contracts that had outstanding performance last year and will return to more normal levels this year.
Our 3 largest movers: LMP, a loss to DHS recompete and the New York Health Insurance Exchange contract together decreased overall revenue by about 4%. This is part of the natural churn of our business. On top of the contract headwinds, the effective cost take-out on our cost-plus contracts reduces revenue by more than a point as well.
As for tailwinds, we have had outstanding contract award activity over the past year. Recent new business awards, including those at the SEC, VA, Department of Justice and key intelligence agencies should add about 5% to our FY '17 revenue.
Two other new business awards that would have added another 1% to 2% were reversed on protest within the past month.
In total, maintaining our strong level of new business wins should get us to the midpoint of our range, and we could move higher or lower based on better win performance or unexpected delays.
On the earnings side, we're guiding to an EBITDA margin of about 17.5%, higher than our original target from the spin of 16% to 17%. We have some tough year-over-year compares for contract profitability, and interest expense hedges will cost about $6 million in FY '17. But we'll be able to sustain the excellent margins we've posted over the last 2 quarters, given higher-than-expected synergy execution and our usual strength in contract profitability.
Our guidance for the fiscal year includes a pension income forecast of $96 million based on the fourth quarter pension remeasurement. For the last half of FY '16, pension income was running at an annual rate of $112 million. Thus, the change in pension reduced our EBITDA guidance for the year by $16 million and our EPS guidance by $0.06.
To give you a picture of how the guidance will track over the fiscal year, many of the contract headwinds we've discussed are present in the first half of the fiscal year. We expect to build from there as recent and expected new business wins ramp and are reflected in the second half results.
With that, I'll turn it back to you, Larry, for some additional comments."

Before turning to your questions, I want to spend a few more moments discussing our return to growth. 
We recognize that revenue growth is key to the long-term success of our business, and our recent business development results are very positive.
I'm now on Slide 8. A second half book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x in what are normally our lowest awards quarters is really great news. Looking at the quarter in detail supports a long-term growth picture. Of our $1.3 billion awards, 48% were for new work and our win rate on new work was 36%, which is well above our long-term target.
Throughout the company, we have great examples of building brilliant teams to attack the market, and I'd like to highlight 3 of them from the fourth quarter. First, as I said, we won a new 10-year $252 million contract to reshape and operate the IT infrastructure for the Securities and Exchange Commission. Project Manager Bryan Polk led the winning team. We developed a compelling organizational change management plan and approach to mitigate the contract and migrate it from staff augmentation to fixed-price managed services. We'll be providing next-gen IT support to 6,000 users at SEC headquarters and to 11 regional offices around the country.
Second, under Leigh Palmer's and Ben Gianni's energetic leadership, we submitted our initial Greenway proposal, which is the primary recompete of our largest contract, Groundbreaker. We bid as part of the Eagle Alliance, a joint venture between CSRA and Northrop Grumman, with heavy participation from our next-generation alliance partners. The massive bid submission is only the first of several submissions with an expected award in the spring or summer of calendar 2017.
Third, we won a $54 million recompete of our simulation work for the Environmental Protection Agency, with Deb Miller as the Project Manager and Proposal Lead. We're using best-in-class technologies, scientific applications and visualization technologies to develop sophisticated environmental models and simulations to provide insight into environmental issues that are just too large to replicate in the real world, like climate change. We want to be at the forefront of complex problems that span across agencies, and climate change is one of them.
These are just a few examples of the early returns we're generating on growth investments. Still, we've not yet turned to growth, so we've decided as a company to take additional aggressive actions around business development, as shown on Slide 9.
First, we continued our step-up in growth investments. As we've spun out, we've been submitting about $10 billion annually in new business proposals. In the fourth quarter we submitted about $3 billion of proposals for new awards, and we expect to accelerate that pace and reach $16 billion in new submits in FY '17.
We've also invested in differentiated technical solutions. In that area, we've just been recognized as one of 3 cloud service providers, the others being Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, to meet the rigorous security standards to achieve a FedRAMP, FISMA High baseline accreditation.
Our CIO, John Dancy, deserves a lot of credit here. This is a major accomplishment in security enhancement, and it reassures our customers that CSRA is vigilant in providing highly secure government cloud services. This is one of the many signs that our strategy to become the leading partner to the U.S. government as it transitions to next-generation IT services is on track.
Second, we changed our organizational structure and personnel. Working with the board and with Dave, I tuned up our organization to be more efficient and focused on growth. The new structure is leaner, with a heavy bias towards customer intimacy. Going from 6 groups down to 4 has created clearer lanes to pursue new work.
George Batsakis, who is the driving force behind many of the large technology-driven takeaway wins at SRA, has stepped up as CSRA's Chief Growth Officer. In addition to business development, George will oversee our alliance partnerships and our technical solutions in a unified go-to-market organization. 
Finally, we come to another first in our life as a public company with our first Annual Meeting of Stockholders of CSRA Inc. to be held on August 9, 2016. This annual meeting will be a completely virtual meeting of stockholders, which will be conducted via live webcast. As a next-gen company, we are embracing the latest technology to provide expanded access, improved communications and of course cost savings for our stockholders and the company.
Operator, we're now ready to take some questions."

And really, fundamentally, our book-to-bill has been 1 or higher now for, I think, 5 straight quarters. And any time we lose, especially a recompete, we really want to go to the root cause and then see if there is any common themes. And frankly, we got some lessons learned, but they've been one-offs as opposed to anything that's systemic. 
Overall our recompete win rate was about 80% for the year in terms of numbers -- I'm sorry, in terms of dollars, and I think like 96% in terms of numbers. And it's a slight downward movement, but it's not precipitous. 
There were 2, as Dave partially mentioned, recompete losses in the year that drove that 80% number. The first one was the SPAS program at DHS. And clearly that was a place where the customer wanted to split the program into several smaller contracts, that we were in the burst radius of his reaction to another large program, another large prime, and we all got painted as big SIs with the same brush. The awards generally went to smaller companies. 
And my takeaway there is, we've got to really evidence and push our capabilities around next-gen if we're going to differentiate ourselves as a big prime and really highlight the work we do with Amazon or Azure, the work we do with Big Data analytics, to not get painted with just that SI brush for enterprise work. 
WebSEM was another one, and there we really think the merger with SRA really would have given us a different set of cards to play with. It was an ERP job, and vendor partnerships are just critical, and that's just one of the strengths that legacy CSC brings to the table. SRA just didn't have that ERP experience or quals that we now have jointly as CSRA. So I think it would have been a different outcome if we had been in play earlier."

So, I mean, when you listen to the debate currently in Congress, the cost, the different appropriations and authorization bills, you're seeing an overall real increase, but in small percentages, in the IT community. So think of a real growth of 3% as they look over the long term. You are sensing higher single-digit growth for cyber work and double-digit growth for cloud and data analytics. 
There's a rich debate right now over the President's proposal to have a $3 billion fund really focused on legacy repair of IT to improve our cyber posture of the federal government. So I'd keep a steady eye on how that resolves as it works its way across the debate. 
I think there's a hearing with GSA and the CIO of government this week or next week. I know they've been working the Hill immensely. And what I think it underpins is how important cyber is to the nation, in that you've got to work the fundamental enterprise IT to do it. 
So I think that the trends are positive. But again, it's a very political environment with a lot of polarization on the Hill and a presidential campaign, I think, unprecedented in the noise level. 
When you asked about the conversion of revenue, remember the process was to build our pipeline, getting to the $16 billion of annual submits, working through the timeline of those being awarded and then converting to revenue. So this is the year where we're stepping up our new submits by, I don't know, 60%, with all of the investment around that. As Stuart said, we'll be front-loading a lot of those submits, and we think the awards in our first half -- but remember, for every one of those, they're average life of 5-year contracts, so you also have to mitigate and think of the funnel of your probability of win. 
So we expect in '18 to start to see the real impact of that and affecting us positively in year-to-year growth. But that's the kind of timeline you have to think about in moving from pipeline to submits to awards to that $800 million revenue run rate."

301669938,331912029,993055,"CSRA Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, May 25, 2016",2016-05-25,"Earnings Calls","CSRA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Stuart. Good afternoon, everybody. We're pleased to report another strong quarter of profitability, cash flow and business development performance. With about 6 months as a public company under our belts, merger integration is mostly behind us, an",858,"Thanks, Stuart. Good afternoon, everybody. We're pleased to report another strong quarter of profitability, cash flow and business development performance. With about 6 months as a public company under our belts, merger integration is mostly behind us, and we've dramatically exceeded our cost synergy targets. We're now solidly focused on execution, and our Q4 results demonstrate the strength of our position in the market.
Since our last call, we have spent time on the road introducing the company to investors and we've gained additional research coverage, so we'll trim the commentary a bit to leave plenty of time for your questions.
As I review our performance, 3 key points stand out. First, our Q4 profit and cash flow were well ahead of our expectations, bolstering the investment thesis that we've laid out previously. Second, our guidance for FY '17 demonstrates our relentless focus on efficiency to drive earnings while lingering revenue headwinds abate. And third, our long-term growth model is very much intact.
Now I'll explore each of these thoughts in a little bit more detail. First, on the quarterly results. Revenue and earnings were both up sequentially, and all of our key metrics were within or above the guidance that we gave on the last call. The number one question we get from investors is, ""Can you sustain your margins?"" And today's results provide additional evidence that the answer is yes.
Our EBITDA margin of 17.4% leads the industry. The compatibility of our 2 legacy companies, compatibility and values like honesty and service, compatibility with a cultural affinity where the best idea wins, compatibility with a commitment to mission next-gen IT and cost control, this compatibility has allowed us to move quickly on integration, and as we've come together we've identified additional ways to operate more efficiently.
Our expanded base of fixed-price contracts incentivizes us to drive down costs continually and responsibly. Our efficiencies create a near-term revenue headwind but are highly accretive to earnings.
During the quarter we also posted strong bookings, which build the foundation for future revenue growth. Our book-to-bill of 1.0x for the quarter and 1.3x for the year demonstrates that we can compete fiercely in the federal IT marketplace. Almost half of the bookings in the quarter were for new business, including our $252 million 10-year award with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In addition, we generated excellent free cash flow in the quarter and stuck to our balanced capital allocation model. Free cash flow was $167 million, which is double our net income and a result of our dedication to cash collections and cash management.
We paid down significant debt, paid a quarterly dividend and repurchased our shares, just as we said that we'd do when we approached the public market for the first time.
Second, on the guidance for FY '17. We will continue to carefully manage our margins to generate earnings growth. With pension income comparable to Q3 and Q4, our adjusted EBITDA range would be $886 million to $921 million and adjusted EPS would be $1.97 to $2.10. This equates to year-over-year EPS growth of 4% at the midpoint and 7% at the high-end of the range. Dave will update in just a minute the changes to the pension income that will modify these numbers.
We expect revenue of $5 billion to $5.2 billion. At the midpoint, revenue would be 2% lower than in FY '16. More than half of the revenue reduction comes from the impact of our aggressive cost reductions on cost reimbursable contracts. This cost discipline is part of our DNA and will drive earnings in cash for our shareholders, as shown by the earnings growth in our FY '17 guidance.
Within the last month we've had a few of our new wins protested and we do not know when these will be concluded. Therefore, we've taken them out of our guidance. Our new wins over the last year have been strong, and we're confident that the book-to-bill ratios above 1 will lead to growth, which brings me to my third point on our long-term model. We are committed to 2% to 3% revenue growth and 8% to 10% EPS growth annually over the long term. Our win rates and win volumes are testament to the relevance and competitiveness of our offerings.
Our backlog is now $15.1 billion, which is about 3x annual revenue. Backlog is up 5% year-over-year, and ultimately revenue will grow in line with backlog. We have $6 billion in submitted proposals awaiting decision, and we expect to submit more than $10 billion of proposals in the first half of the year.
More broadly, our market is slowly returning to growth, and our customers are increasingly adopting next-generation IT. These trends give us further confidence in the direction we're taking the business as we aim to execute at the intersection of growing vertical markets and compelling technology offerings. In the process, you can rely on this management team to continue to take aggressive cost actions in freeing up the right resources to prudently invest in growth.
Now Dave will provide a bit more detail on the financial results and our forward outlook."
301669938,331912029,993055,"CSRA Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, May 25, 2016",2016-05-25,"Earnings Calls","CSRA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. I share Larry's view that fourth quarter results were very strong. We maintained our focus on margins and cash collections, while solidifying our team and our operations.Turning to Slide 5. I'll primarily add",1610,"Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. I share Larry's view that fourth quarter results were very strong. We maintained our focus on margins and cash collections, while solidifying our team and our operations.
Turning to Slide 5. I'll primarily address pro forma and adjusted results. For prior periods, our pro forma results assumed the CSC spin and SRA merger had already occurred. And for all periods we exclude costs directly associated with either the spin or merger transactions or the ongoing integration. We believe pro forma adjusted figures provide an important baseline for comparing the past and future performance. Our press release provides all appropriate reconciliations from pro forma adjusted results to GAAP results.
Revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.29 billion, up 1.5% sequentially and down 4.4% from $1.35 billion of pro forma revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. The uptick in revenue compared to last quarter resulted from the normal pattern of lower leave-taking in our fourth quarter than in our third.
On a pro forma basis, our Civil segment, which includes health, Homeland Security and other federal civilian agencies, was down 1% year-over-year. Our Defense and Intelligence segment was down 8% year-over-year. One source of this decline was our Army Logistics Modernization Program, which is transitioning to a maintenance phase after a very successful large-scale software deployment. In addition, lower material purchases on Navy contracts, the sale of our Welkin business and the wind-down of Army OCO work outweighed the ramp-up of valuable new intelligence programs.
Contract mix remained a key driver of profitability in Q4, as our mix continued its trend towards fixed price. As a percentage of total revenue, our contracts in the quarter were 45% fixed price, 21% time and materials and 35% cost-plus.
Keying in on the income adjustments, we incurred a GAAP noncash expense of $203 million from the annual mark-to-market process for our pension programs, which is split about 97% in cost of services and 3% in SG&A. The noncash expense was a result of the continued low interest rate environment and the return on plan assets running below our long-term assumption.
The mark-to-market remeasurement is part of our standard year-end process. We're not expecting another remeasurement gain or loss until next Q4. We also incurred merger and integration costs of $27 million in the quarter.
With that in mind, you can really see the impact of our synergy savings. Pro forma SG&A was $44 million in the quarter compared to $62 million in Q3, and we expect it to continue to decline in FY '17.
More than half of the cost synergies are in cost of services. So in total, we're already generating savings of over $150 million on an annual run rate basis.
We made tough choices quickly, which have enabled us to grow earnings, invest in growth and move forward as a team. As a result of these savings, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $225 million, near the high end of our guidance. Adjusted EBITDA was up 8% from the same period a year ago, as EBITDA margin increased from 15.5% to 17.4%. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA excludes $2 million of stock-based compensation expense and includes $28 million of net pension-related income.
Pro forma depreciation and amortization expense was $49 million, which excludes the $16 million GAAP intangibles amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog. Interest expense was $29 million in the quarter.
Late in Q4 we hedged about half of our term loan debt. So our interest expense will be approximately $6 million higher in FY '17, but we will have greater certainty and stability if interest rates rise from their historically low levels.
For comparability across periods, pro forma earnings per share are calculated assuming an effective tax rate of 39%, the company's estimated long-term rate. Pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.50, above the high end of the guidance that we provided last call. EPS for the quarter was up 32% from $0.38 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and up 4% from last quarter. Diluted share count for the quarter was 164 million.
The pro forma metrics for the fiscal year show the same basic patterns with the same underlying drivers as the quarterly results. Revenue was $5.2 billion, which was down 4.5% from $5.4 billion in fiscal year 2015. Adjusted EBITDA was $894 million, which was up 3.4% from $865 million in fiscal year 2015, as adjusted EBITDA margins increased from 15.9% to 17.2%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year were $1.96, which was up 14% from $1.72 in fiscal year 2015.
Turning to Slide 6. We believe free cash flow should ultimately drive valuation, and it's an important metric in setting incentive compensation. Free cash flow for the quarter was $167 million or 2.1x adjusted net income, well beyond our normal model of a little better than net income as a result of sequential working capital improvements.
During the quarter the company deployed $170 million to pay down debt, $13 million to repurchase shares and $16 million in dividends, consistent with our balanced capital deployment approach.
Day sales outstanding were 52 days as of the quarter end, an improvement of 12 days from the end of the prior fiscal year and 3 days sequentially. Our ongoing program to sell our receivables lowered DSO by about 13 days. Through this program we're able to enhance our liquidity at a very reasonable cost because of the positive relationships that we have with our very creditworthy government customers.
As of April 1, 2016, the company had $130 million in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. 
On the debt side, we had $50 million of drawn revolver, $2.8 billion of term loan debt and $151 million of capital leases at quarter end. We expect to make at least another $40 million in debt payments in the first quarter of FY '17, consistent with our term loan agreements.
Our steady cash flows and $650 million of undrawn revolver capacity provide substantial liquidity and flexibility to manage the business, pay down debt, return cash to shareholders and make accretive acquisitions.
Turning to our forward guidance on Slide 7. We project that our FY 2017 revenue will be between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, which equates to a year-over-year pro forma revenue growth rate range of minus 4% to flat, indicating progress from the rate of decline we experienced in FY '16.
We project that our adjusted EBITDA will be between $870 million and $905 million and our adjusted diluted earnings per share will be between $1.91 and $2.04. This earnings guidance includes a reduction in projected noncash pension income of $16 million. As Larry noted, absent this change, guidance would have been $886 million to $921 million for EBITDA and $1.97 to $2.10 for EPS.
Finally, we're introducing free cash flow guidance of between $300 million and $350 million. At its midpoint, this would be slightly above our expectation for adjusted net income.
Now let me provide a little more color on some of the individual metrics, starting with revenue. We've told investors that in a typical year we'll have 5% to 10% of our business that we need to replace. In FY '17, a few contract headwinds push us slightly above that range. In addition to the wind-down of our Army Logistics Modernization Program, we'll face tough compares on a few large contracts that had outstanding performance last year and will return to more normal levels this year.
Our 3 largest movers: LMP, a loss to DHS recompete and the New York Health Insurance Exchange contract together decreased overall revenue by about 4%. This is part of the natural churn of our business. On top of the contract headwinds, the effective cost take-out on our cost-plus contracts reduces revenue by more than a point as well.
As for tailwinds, we have had outstanding contract award activity over the past year. Recent new business awards, including those at the SEC, VA, Department of Justice and key intelligence agencies should add about 5% to our FY '17 revenue.
Two other new business awards that would have added another 1% to 2% were reversed on protest within the past month.
In total, maintaining our strong level of new business wins should get us to the midpoint of our range, and we could move higher or lower based on better win performance or unexpected delays.
On the earnings side, we're guiding to an EBITDA margin of about 17.5%, higher than our original target from the spin of 16% to 17%. We have some tough year-over-year compares for contract profitability, and interest expense hedges will cost about $6 million in FY '17. But we'll be able to sustain the excellent margins we've posted over the last 2 quarters, given higher-than-expected synergy execution and our usual strength in contract profitability.
Our guidance for the fiscal year includes a pension income forecast of $96 million based on the fourth quarter pension remeasurement. For the last half of FY '16, pension income was running at an annual rate of $112 million. Thus, the change in pension reduced our EBITDA guidance for the year by $16 million and our EPS guidance by $0.06.
To give you a picture of how the guidance will track over the fiscal year, many of the contract headwinds we've discussed are present in the first half of the fiscal year. We expect to build from there as recent and expected new business wins ramp and are reflected in the second half results.
With that, I'll turn it back to you, Larry, for some additional comments."

Before turning to your questions, I want to spend a few more moments discussing our return to growth. 
We recognize that revenue growth is key to the long-term success of our business, and our recent business development results are very positive.
I'm now on Slide 8. A second half book-to-bill ratio of 1.2x in what are normally our lowest awards quarters is really great news. Looking at the quarter in detail supports a long-term growth picture. Of our $1.3 billion awards, 48% were for new work and our win rate on new work was 36%, which is well above our long-term target.
Throughout the company, we have great examples of building brilliant teams to attack the market, and I'd like to highlight 3 of them from the fourth quarter. First, as I said, we won a new 10-year $252 million contract to reshape and operate the IT infrastructure for the Securities and Exchange Commission. Project Manager Bryan Polk led the winning team. We developed a compelling organizational change management plan and approach to mitigate the contract and migrate it from staff augmentation to fixed-price managed services. We'll be providing next-gen IT support to 6,000 users at SEC headquarters and to 11 regional offices around the country.
Second, under Leigh Palmer's and Ben Gianni's energetic leadership, we submitted our initial Greenway proposal, which is the primary recompete of our largest contract, Groundbreaker. We bid as part of the Eagle Alliance, a joint venture between CSRA and Northrop Grumman, with heavy participation from our next-generation alliance partners. The massive bid submission is only the first of several submissions with an expected award in the spring or summer of calendar 2017.
Third, we won a $54 million recompete of our simulation work for the Environmental Protection Agency, with Deb Miller as the Project Manager and Proposal Lead. We're using best-in-class technologies, scientific applications and visualization technologies to develop sophisticated environmental models and simulations to provide insight into environmental issues that are just too large to replicate in the real world, like climate change. We want to be at the forefront of complex problems that span across agencies, and climate change is one of them.
These are just a few examples of the early returns we're generating on growth investments. Still, we've not yet turned to growth, so we've decided as a company to take additional aggressive actions around business development, as shown on Slide 9.
First, we continued our step-up in growth investments. As we've spun out, we've been submitting about $10 billion annually in new business proposals. In the fourth quarter we submitted about $3 billion of proposals for new awards, and we expect to accelerate that pace and reach $16 billion in new submits in FY '17.
We've also invested in differentiated technical solutions. In that area, we've just been recognized as one of 3 cloud service providers, the others being Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, to meet the rigorous security standards to achieve a FedRAMP, FISMA High baseline accreditation.
Our CIO, John Dancy, deserves a lot of credit here. This is a major accomplishment in security enhancement, and it reassures our customers that CSRA is vigilant in providing highly secure government cloud services. This is one of the many signs that our strategy to become the leading partner to the U.S. government as it transitions to next-generation IT services is on track.
Second, we changed our organizational structure and personnel. Working with the board and with Dave, I tuned up our organization to be more efficient and focused on growth. The new structure is leaner, with a heavy bias towards customer intimacy. Going from 6 groups down to 4 has created clearer lanes to pursue new work.
George Batsakis, who is the driving force behind many of the large technology-driven takeaway wins at SRA, has stepped up as CSRA's Chief Growth Officer. In addition to business development, George will oversee our alliance partnerships and our technical solutions in a unified go-to-market organization. 
Finally, we come to another first in our life as a public company with our first Annual Meeting of Stockholders of CSRA Inc. to be held on August 9, 2016. This annual meeting will be a completely virtual meeting of stockholders, which will be conducted via live webcast. As a next-gen company, we are embracing the latest technology to provide expanded access, improved communications and of course cost savings for our stockholders and the company.
Operator, we're now ready to take some questions."

We wish it was happening today, but it's going to take us several hard quarters of fighting to continue to win those battles on the competitive landscape to see that growth."

And really, fundamentally, our book-to-bill has been 1 or higher now for, I think, 5 straight quarters. And any time we lose, especially a recompete, we really want to go to the root cause and then see if there is any common themes. And frankly, we got some lessons learned, but they've been one-offs as opposed to anything that's systemic. 
Overall our recompete win rate was about 80% for the year in terms of numbers -- I'm sorry, in terms of dollars, and I think like 96% in terms of numbers. And it's a slight downward movement, but it's not precipitous. 
There were 2, as Dave partially mentioned, recompete losses in the year that drove that 80% number. The first one was the SPAS program at DHS. And clearly that was a place where the customer wanted to split the program into several smaller contracts, that we were in the burst radius of his reaction to another large program, another large prime, and we all got painted as big SIs with the same brush. The awards generally went to smaller companies. 
And my takeaway there is, we've got to really evidence and push our capabilities around next-gen if we're going to differentiate ourselves as a big prime and really highlight the work we do with Amazon or Azure, the work we do with Big Data analytics, to not get painted with just that SI brush for enterprise work. 
WebSEM was another one, and there we really think the merger with SRA really would have given us a different set of cards to play with. It was an ERP job, and vendor partnerships are just critical, and that's just one of the strengths that legacy CSC brings to the table. SRA just didn't have that ERP experience or quals that we now have jointly as CSRA. So I think it would have been a different outcome if we had been in play earlier."

We're running between 4% and 5% year-over-year declines in each of the last 4 quarters. Our guidance for the coming year at its midpoint is down 2%. So I think what you could reasonably expect, then, is the end of the year is closer to 0 than the beginning of the year is, and that's the kind of natural progression of '17. That's not to say there won't be any quarterly ups and downs throughout, but that's the general trend of it."

So you still get that kind of contrast in adoption rates where it's asymptomatic, where there'll be places where they're picking it up fast and others where they're being very conservative and thoughtful in their approach. 
Pricing has been generally okay. But remember, you're using automation instead of people to provide the processing, the storage, the compute, and so you get favorable pricing but at lower revenue levels."

So, I mean, when you listen to the debate currently in Congress, the cost, the different appropriations and authorization bills, you're seeing an overall real increase, but in small percentages, in the IT community. So think of a real growth of 3% as they look over the long term. You are sensing higher single-digit growth for cyber work and double-digit growth for cloud and data analytics. 
There's a rich debate right now over the President's proposal to have a $3 billion fund really focused on legacy repair of IT to improve our cyber posture of the federal government. So I'd keep a steady eye on how that resolves as it works its way across the debate. 
I think there's a hearing with GSA and the CIO of government this week or next week. I know they've been working the Hill immensely. And what I think it underpins is how important cyber is to the nation, in that you've got to work the fundamental enterprise IT to do it. 
So I think that the trends are positive. But again, it's a very political environment with a lot of polarization on the Hill and a presidential campaign, I think, unprecedented in the noise level. 
When you asked about the conversion of revenue, remember the process was to build our pipeline, getting to the $16 billion of annual submits, working through the timeline of those being awarded and then converting to revenue. So this is the year where we're stepping up our new submits by, I don't know, 60%, with all of the investment around that. As Stuart said, we'll be front-loading a lot of those submits, and we think the awards in our first half -- but remember, for every one of those, they're average life of 5-year contracts, so you also have to mitigate and think of the funnel of your probability of win. 
So we expect in '18 to start to see the real impact of that and affecting us positively in year-to-year growth. But that's the kind of timeline you have to think about in moving from pipeline to submits to awards to that $800 million revenue run rate."

We're pleased to begin fiscal year 2017 with another strong quarter of execution. In the first quarter, we posted excellent results across key financial metrics, continued our business development momentum to lay the foundation for future growth and demonstrated progress in our strategy to differentiate CSRA as the leader in digital innovation for government. In addition, we are implementing a talent management approach that will brand us as an employer of choice for high-tech professionals. Let me flesh out each of these 4 major achievements in detail.
First, revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow are all on track. So we reaffirmed the guidance that we gave on the last call. EBITDA margin was especially strong at 17.4%, driven by the twin CSRA hallmarks of excellent program execution and cost discipline. Our foundation of fixed price contracts motivates us towards innovation and cost-efficient delivery and enables us to deliver for shareholders. In addition, we generated excellent cash flow in the quarter. Through disciplined financial management, we were able to generate operating cash flow of $156 million, which allowed us to continue to pay down debt, pay dividends and begin to evaluate acquisitions.
Second, we posted another positive quarter with $1.3 billion in bookings. This marks the sixth straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. Our book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x for the trailing 12 months points to future growth and demonstrates that we can compete fiercely in the federal IT marketplace. Our health business, which is our fastest growing market, led the way with 2 key wins in the quarter. We won $180 million recompete of our work with a congressionally directed medical research program. This global funding organization supports cancer, military medical and other disease and injury-specific research. It manages more than $1 billion in biomedical research investments annually, funding groundbreaking research projects intended to transform health care for both military service members and the general public. Dr. Steven Goldberg, directs our peer review and science management team, which is the nation's preeminent provider of scientific peer review solutions. Over the last 20 years on this program, we've developed and deployed a world-class approach for engaging scientists, clinicians and consumers in the evaluation of grant applications. 
In addition, the New York State Department of Health rewarded our support with a 1-year $127 million extension of our contract to enhance, operate and maintain the health insurance exchange implemented under the Affordable Care Act. To date, we have enrolled more than 3 million residents through this program, and the program is a recognized leader across all states. We expect to reach agreement on a multiyear extension early next year.
The largest new business win in the quarter was with the U.S. Coast Guard's Telecommunication and Information Systems Command. Kudos to Pam Bask, our Coast Guard account manager who will serve as the PM for this program for her leveraging of our next-generation IT expertise and just the team's creativity to win this $55 million 5-year contract. We have a great opportunity to strengthen communications within the Coast Guard through life cycle management, server consolidation and technology insertion to enhance both current and future missions.
In addition, providing enterprise IT services and responsive technical support will lead to development and the deployment of the U.S. Coast Guard's IT infrastructure managing sensitive secret and top-secret networks both onshore and afloat. The maritime domain is complex, and the challenges and threats in our operational environment have never been greater. As the largest pure-play IT systems integrator for the Department of Homeland Security, CSRA is well-positioned to support this TISCOM's vital mission of ensuring our nation's security and prosperity. 
Across the company, we submitted $4 billion of proposals for new businesses in the first quarter, and we are on pace to achieve our FY '17 target of $16 billion in new business submits. As of the end of the quarter, we have $11 billion in submits outstanding. And looking only at new business, we had about $6.5 billion awaiting decision, including 14 opportunities greater than $100 million in total value. 
Our second quarter is shaping up to be a very strong one on the BD front. Our proposal rooms are overflowing, and we expect to submit another $5 billion of new business proposals in the second quarter. Q2 award volumes are usually high because it is the end of the government's fiscal year, but most of the awards tend to come in September. We began the quarter with the best July we've had in years with multiple $100 million-plus wins. These large wins defend our base with competitive recompetes that included a $131 [ph] million award for architecture and design work for Navy ships, and the wins also drive new growth with new business, including $167 million fixed-price IT job for the Defense Intelligence Agency where we unseeded 2 entrenched incumbents. We did sell by leveraging the competitive advantage of our shared services center in City, Louisiana and a deep technical expertise of our groundbreaker team in Maryland. 
As of the end of Q1, our backlog stood at $15.1 billion, which is about 3x annual revenue. Backlog is up 5% year-over-year, driven by strong bookings over this last year. And if we keep these positive trends going, revenue growth will certainly follow.
Third, we are enhancing our leadership and digital innovation as part of our overall strategy to drive sustainable growth by implementing next-generation technologies for our government customers. Central to that strategy is working closely with technology innovators. We recently announced new strategic partnerships with Amazon Web Services, and Doctor. These partnerships extend well beyond the standard prime sub or integrator vendor relationships so commonplace in the aerospace industry. In this case, we share go-to-market strategies, we treat them as partners, we get preferred access and pricing, and we share development strategies with our partners to our mutual benefit, but more importantly, to the benefit of our government customers. I truly believe that no one can provide our partners the same level of delivery excellence to government IT customers than CSRA can. This strategy is not some recent development or a pet project of a few techies. Rather, it is the motivating construct that unifies our customers, our business, our company and spurs our investments. In fact, late last month, senior CSRA technology leaders and I spent a week in the West Coast meeting with established tech partners, meeting with averaging technology companies and meeting with the defense innovation unit experimental, DIUx, which the DoD stood up to bridge between the military and companies operating at the cutting edge of technology. This trip came on the heels of this summer's CSRA Emerging Technology Partner Day where we met with 11 companies from leading venture capital funds to discuss capabilities and opportunities. It is clear from all of these interactions that we can catalyze adoption of these technology innovations as we deliver IT capability for government customers with incredible critical needs. We have already identified great outstanding collaborative opportunities where we can work together to create new solutions for our customers' mission challenges. In fact, I believe we'll have tangible success that will be material in our next 2 quarters. In addition to revving up the business development engine, it will help us drive organic growth through this innovation on programs that we're so proud of today. 
Fourth, we are excited about the progress we are making on talent management front, and we are committed to building CSRA into an employer of choice. Over the past quarter, we have seen consistent headcount growth for the first time as a public company. Our voluntary attrition has been trending down over the last couple of months since we have concluded much of the organizational integration activities, driven by our synergy case. We have seen strong interest in our job openings and have averaged the record number of offers accepted over the past quarter, a big shoutout to our HR team and to all of our recruiters. We are recognizing employees through our FY '17 quarterly performance award program and celebrating key contributions to our customers' missions as well as to company performance that serves them. We launched our new tuition reimbursement and certification program to support employees' continue development, which in turn will also help our customers in their digital transformation. We see our employee-focused culture as a key future discriminator in our ability to recruit and to retain the best talent, especially for next-generation technologies.
For example, we implemented a new wellness program that included a variety of offerings such as weekly Fitbit competitions amongst our interns, employee walking sessions at lunch -- yes, I'm taking part in discounted Weight Watcher programs as well as looking at biometric improvements. Our intent is to make wellness and caring for our employees' well-being a cornerstone of our CSRA culture. 
In October, we will complete the migration to one HR system. Now on the one hand, it is going to bring a significant number of improvements. It will increase efficiency of hiring and promotions and performance reviews, but what we find really exciting is we're working with our SaaS partner Workday on the new system. And this is consistent with our customers' 0 philosophy of bringing next-gen technology into our company as we deliver for our customers across the government. We are making strong progress in branding CSRA as a great place to work. 
And now I will ask Dave to provide more detail on the financial results as well as our forward outlook."
301669938,374045305,1033238,"CSRA Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2016",2016-08-10,"Earnings Calls","CSRA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter results were in line with our expectations and keep us on track for the guidance that we laid out on our last call. With this, our third public quarter, GAAP and adjusted results are coming in",1158,"Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter results were in line with our expectations and keep us on track for the guidance that we laid out on our last call. With this, our third public quarter, GAAP and adjusted results are coming into closer alignment. There is no pension mark-to-market impact this quarter and fewer spin merger and integration costs. I'll focus on the adjusted results and note any deviations from GAAP along the way.
Turning to Slide 5. Revenue for the quarter was $1.25 billion, down 3% sequentially and down 5% from pro forma revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Most of the year-over-year decline was in our Defense and Intelligence segment, consistent with the headwinds we outlined on our last earnings call. On a pro forma basis, our Civil segment, which includes health, Homeland Security and other civilian agencies, was down 2%. And our Defense and Intelligence segment was down 8% year-over-year. The largest contributor to the decline was the Logistics Modernization Program for the U.S. Army followed by a lower overall volume of direct material and other direct cost purchases. We're still negotiating with the LMP customer on the wind-down of the program, but it's worth mentioning what a successful engagement this has been. The SAP development program has saved our customers $6 billion through lower software maintenance costs and better inventory management. We look forward to supporting the Army however we can and competing on the next increment development at some point in the future. 
Our contract mix remains essentially unchanged. As a percentage of total Q1 revenue, 42% was on fixed price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 37% on cost-plus contracts. As a result of merger synergies and strong contract performance, profitability and earnings were excellent. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $218 million, up 4% from the same period a year ago as EBITDA margin increased from 15.9% to 17.4%. Similarly, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.51, up 2% from last quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was unchanged compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, but the year-ago quarter included a pretax gain of $17 million on the sale of Welkin. Without the divestiture gain, adjusted EPS would have increased 12% from the year-ago quarter.
I'll quickly walk you through the principal elements between revenue and earnings. Gross margin was 21.2%, aided by a pickup on a Department of Homeland Security program that we've been tracking for several quarters. Pro forma SG&A was $52 million, which was down $30 million year-over-year based on cost synergies and up $7 million sequentially from higher bidding proposal expense as we accelerate our submittals. The net of the program pickup, the elevated BMP spend and other similar items was about $0.02 of EPS, above our steady-state rate. 
First quarter pension-related income was $24 million, consistent with the rate laid out on the last call. GAAP depreciation and amortization expense was $65 million, which includes the $16 million of intangible amortization expense associated with SRAs funded contract backlog that we backed out of our adjusted net income and EPS. Also excluded from adjusted EBITDA and EPS was $13 million of other pretax merger and integration costs. These costs continue to decline and should be even lower in future quarters.
Interest expense was $30 million in Q1, up slightly from last quarter, given additional costs from the interest rate hedge we executed in March, which was offset somewhat by reduced debt levels. Given that we no longer have significant transaction-related adjustments in our quarterly tax rate, we're using the GAAP tax rate in our calculation of adjusted earnings per share. The effective tax rate for the quarter was around 36%, which added a little over $0.02 to EPS compared to the previously projected long-term rate of 39%.
Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $156 million, helped by incorporating SRA into the company's accounts receivable purchase facility, which increased operating cash flow by $46 million. This program makes clear financial sense as it accelerates cash collection for enhanced deployment at a very low cost of capital. As a result of the strong cash flow, we aggressively executed on our balanced capital allocation program and deployed $98 million to pay down debt, $50 million of which eliminated the outstanding balance on our revolver and $48 million of which satisfied the FY '16 excess cash flow sweep requirement on our term loans. We also used $18 million to pay dividends. Our capital allocation approach continued to balance growth and fiscal responsibility for shareholder returns. First quarter free cash flow of $67 million excludes the impact of the receivables purchase facility and reflects normal fluctuations in quarterly working capital performance. We expect free cash flow to increase in the second quarter and to remain on track for the year. Days sales outstanding were 54 days as of the quarter end, the degradation of 1 day sequentially from an unusually strong Q4 level. As of July 1, 2016, we had $133 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.7 billion in debt. Our steady cash flows and $700 million of undrawn revolver capacity provides substantial liquidity and flexibility to manage the business, pay down debt, return cash to shareholders and to make accretive acquisitions. 
With an in-line quarter, we're maintaining our forward guidance as shown on Slide 7. We continue to project fiscal year 2017 revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $870 million and $905 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.91 and $2.04 and free cash flow between $300 million and $350 million. Our assumption for pension income of $96 million is unchanged. We've slightly tweaked other base assumptions. For the full year, we now expect our effective tax rate to be around 38% and our fully diluted share count to be around 165 million shares. Annualizing revenue for the first quarter yields the low end of the FY '17 guidance range, so we'll need new business wins to move up through the guidance range. We expect new business wins to materialize from our high volumes of submits awaiting adjudication and continued robust bidding activity. Annualizing first quarter EBITDA and EPS point to the middle of the guidance ranges after controlling for the program pickup and lower tax rate. That said, we expect revenue, EBITDA and EPS to step down slightly in Q2 before turning to sequential growth in the back half of the year as we ramp new business wins. 
In summary, I'm pleased that we're able to drive improved profitability while investing heavily in the organic growth engine of the company. With a robust volume of submitted proposals and strong positioning on upcoming next-generation IT and critical mission support opportunities, we look forward to accelerating new business wins while maintaining our industry-leading profitability and strong cash generation.
With that, Amy, we're now ready to take questions."

Of course, there's more art than science to that analysis, and it's one that we spend a lot of time thinking about and assessing every quarter. To date, we've deployed about $268 million to debt paydown, about $100 million to shareholder returns and have not yet, since the spin and merger with SRA, made another acquisition. So to date, we're in the 30% range for shareholder returns and 70 for debt paydown. Long-term guidance ranges for cash deployment, of course, are 50% for debt paydown, 40% for shareholder returns and 10% for M&A. Those priorities will continue to evolve over time, obviously, over the first year out of the gates here, M&A was less of a priority for us, reducing debt from the current -- from the initial $3 billion level was a high priority and sprinkling in some effective shareholder -- share repurchases under our $400 million authorization also a priority. Going forward, we're comfortable. We're pleased with the current volume of debt we've been able to pay down. We will look at shareholder -- share buybacks going forward.

When it comes to New York State, remember there's 2 programs both continue to see some extensions. was the first one for center of Medicare and Medicaid. We did not bid on the recompete. We thought it was a flawed model. A competitor want it. As they face any challenges, we stand ready to help the State of New York with this essential function of government, and we continue to benefit from extensions on that.

And as we go through the life of it, we expect that we'll grow into a multiyear extension. It's a very good program for us. We cherish the work. We perform well on it, and we think it's a nice base for us as we look to the rest of '17 and to '18."

I'm happy to give you a few more context points there on visibility as we think about our guidance outlook. So to the low end of the guidance that you mentioned, we need to win about $150 million of new business or generate $150 million of new business revenue, I should say, in this fiscal year. To get to the midpoint it's $250 million. Of course, the high end would be $350 million. So think of that $150 million to the low end as 3% and then 5% to the midpoint and 7% to the high end. Given the volume that we have pending, we talked about $6.5 billion worth of new business bids, not recompetes but full new business. We're excited about the opportunities to win new business this quarter in what's traditionally a very strong quarter for contract award notices and we feel like that's what gives us the confidence in our guidance range and what we've seen throughout as the opportunity to deliver on that guidance range."

I'm thrilled that we took down the revolver. Second, we believe that repurchasing shares and buyback is a really good thing to do, and we'll consider acquisitions but they have to really perform in 3 fronts. They have to give us a technology edge as we think about cloud-enabled digitization of the marketplace. We always look for customer intimacy and competitive advantage. And then almost always, we want to think of future contracts that will have a really positive result from any acquisition. Examples in our past have been 4 2 6 and Tenacity. But be clear, priority 1 is a balanced approach around capital deployment, and we take some pride in reducing our debt in such an aggressive fashion as we've been disciplined about also doing share buyback."

We called it out as we did a couple of quarters ago talked about EAC adjustments, in general, being a few million higher than we would traditionally see. We call this one out because it added a bit to the results in the quarter. The net of that item and other kind of unique items in the quarter, as we said, was about $0.02 favorable to the company.

And I don't think any thought of the CR coming with the new fiscal year has slowed down anything. As we go into the government's first quarter, I still expect a CR to be shorter in duration. I still think they'll be the omnibus package, probably built on a defense appropriations bill. Everyone will have a Christmas ornamental on it.

So for us, cyber times is a direct sale where we're focused on doing work with security operations centers. Examples are the work we do for the FAA, the work we do for State Department security, the work we do for the 24th Air Force. So we have a robust direct sale program where it's competing head-to-head for pure-play cyber work. Most of it, however, is integral to enterprise IT where anywhere you are in the stack out to your endpoint computing, you're helping your government customers have everything beyond perimeter defense and thinking about active means to really identify threat. I think there's a greater propensity of the government now to invest in cyber as part of their integrated IT build. You see the proposal by -- in the President's budget, there's a couple of bills in Congress to think of industrial funding to help with the infrastructure, the legacy hardware and software to upgrade it to a place where good hygiene really matters, and cyber will be something that at least has a foot and a foundation in infrastructure that's 2016 generation instead of 2003. Relative to the pricing, I think it's -- again, customers want out of IP a lower price. They expect us to consolidate data centers, they expect us to go virtual, they expect us to leverage cloud enablement, but they also expect to have pristine elements of cyber throughout the bid, and then they'll make that differentiation. So I see customers who will invest in cloud, invest in cyber, invest in data analytics and expect us to do leveraged delivery and give them a better price."

We're pleased to begin fiscal year 2017 with another strong quarter of execution. In the first quarter, we posted excellent results across key financial metrics, continued our business development momentum to lay the foundation for future growth and demonstrated progress in our strategy to differentiate CSRA as the leader in digital innovation for government. In addition, we are implementing a talent management approach that will brand us as an employer of choice for high-tech professionals. Let me flesh out each of these 4 major achievements in detail.
First, revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow are all on track. So we reaffirm the guidance that we gave on the last call. EBITDA margin was especially strong at 17.4%, driven by the twin CSRA hallmarks of excellent program execution and cost discipline. Our foundation of fixed-price contracts motivates us towards innovation and cost-efficient delivery and enables us to deliver for shareholders. In addition, we generated excellent cash flow in the quarter. Through disciplined financial management, we were able to generate operating cash flow of $156 million, which allowed us to continue to pay down debt, pay dividends and begin to evaluate acquisitions.
Second, we posted another positive quarter with $1.3 billion in bookings. This marks the sixth straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. Our book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x for the trailing 12 months points to future growth and demonstrates that we can compete fiercely in the federal IT marketplace. Our health business, which is our fastest-growing market, led the way with 2 key wins in the quarter. We won $180 million recompete of our work for the congressionally directed medical research program. This global funding organization supports cancer, military medical and other disease and injury-specific research. It manages more than $1 billion in biomedical research investments annually, funding groundbreaking research projects intended to transform health care for both military service members and the general public. Dr. Steven Goldberg directs our peer review and science management team, which is the nation's preeminent provider of scientific peer review solutions. Over the last 20 years on this program, we've developed and deployed a world-class approach for engaging scientists, clinicians and consumers in the evaluation of grant applications. 
In addition, the New York State Department of Health rewarded our support with a 1-year $127 million extension of our contract to enhance, operate and maintain the Health Insurance Exchange implemented under the Affordable Care Act. To date, we have enrolled more than 3 million residents through this program, and the program is a recognized leader across all states. We expect to reach agreement on a multiyear extension early next year.
The largest new business win in the quarter was with the U.S. Coast Guard's Telecommunication and Information Systems Command. Kudos to Pam Bosque, our Coast Guard account manager, who will serve as the PM for this program for her leveraging of our next-generation IT expertise and just the team's creativity to win this $55 million 5-year contract. We have a great opportunity to strengthen communications within the Coast Guard through life cycle management, server consolidation and technology insertion to enhance both current and future missions.
In addition to providing enterprise IT services and responsive technical support, we'll lead the development and the deployment of the U.S. Coast Guard's IT infrastructure, managing sensitive secret and top-secret networks both onshore and afloat. The maritime domain is complex, and the challenges and threats in our operational environment have never been greater. As the largest pure-play IT systems integrator for the Department of Homeland Security, CSRA is well positioned to support TISCOM's vital mission of ensuring our nation's security and prosperity. 
Across the company, we submitted $4 billion of proposals for new businesses in the first quarter, and we are on pace to achieve our FY '17 target of $16 billion in new business submits. As of the end of the quarter, we had $11 billion in submits outstanding. And looking only at new business, we had about $6.5 billion awaiting decision, including 14 opportunities greater than $100 million in total value. 
Our second quarter is shaping up to be a very strong one on the BD front. Our proposal rooms are overflowing, and we expect to submit another $5 billion of new business proposals in the second quarter. Q2 award volumes are usually high because it is the end of the government's fiscal year, but most of the awards tend to come in September. We began the quarter with the best July we've had in years, with multiple $100 million-plus wins. These large wins defend our base with competitive recompetes that included a $131 million award for architecture and design work for Navy ships, and the wins also drive new growth with new business, including a $167 million fixed-price IT job for the Defense Intelligence Agency, where we unseeded 2 entrenched incumbents. We did so by leveraging the competitive advantage of our shared services center in Bossier City, Louisiana and the deep technical expertise of our Groundbreaker team in Maryland. 
As of the end of Q1, our backlog stood at $15.1 billion, which is about 3x annual revenue. Backlog is up 5% year-over-year, driven by strong bookings over this last year. And if we keep these positive trends going, revenue growth will certainly follow.
Third, we are enhancing our leadership and digital innovation as part of our overall strategy to drive sustainable growth by implementing next-generation technologies for our government customers. Central to that strategy is working closely with technology innovators. We recently announced new strategic partnerships with Amazon Web Services, Racemi and Docker. These partnerships extend well beyond the standard prime sub or integrator/vendor relationships so commonplace in the aerospace industry. In this case, we share go-to-market strategies, we treat them as partners, we get preferred access and pricing and we share development strategies with our partners to our mutual benefit, but more importantly, to the benefit of our government customers. I truly believe that no one can provide our partners the same level of delivery excellence to government IT customers than CSRA can. This strategy is not some recent development or a pet project of a few techies. Rather, it is the motivating construct that unifies our customers, our business, our company, and it spurs our investments. In fact, late last month, senior CSRA technology leaders and I spent a week on the West Coast, meeting with established tech partners, meeting with emerging technology companies and meeting with the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, DIUx, which the DoD stood up to bridge between the military and companies operating at the cutting edge of technology. This trip came on the heels of this summer's CSRA Emerging Technology Partner Day, where we met with 11 companies from leading venture capital funds to discuss capabilities and opportunities. It is clear from all of these interactions that we can catalyze adoption of these technology innovations as we deliver IT capability for government customers with incredible critical needs. We have already identified great outstanding collaborative opportunities where we can work together to create new solutions for our customers' mission challenges. In fact, I believe we'll have tangible success that will be material in our next 2 quarters. In addition to revving up the business development engine, it will help us drive organic growth through this innovation on programs that we're so proud of today. 
Fourth, we are excited about the progress we are making on the talent management front, and we are committed to building CSRA into an employer of choice. Over the past quarter, we have seen consistent headcount growth for the first time as a public company. Our voluntary attrition has been trending down over the last couple of months since we have concluded much of the organizational integration activities driven by our synergy case. We have seen strong interest in our job openings and have averaged a record number of offers accepted over the past quarter. A big shout-out to our HR team and to all of our recruiters. 
We are recognizing employees through our FY '17 quarterly performance award program and celebrating key contributions to our customers' missions as well as to company performance that serves them. We launched our new tuition reimbursement and certification program to support employees' continued development, which in turn will also help our customers in their digital transformation. We see our employee-focused culture as a key future discriminator in our ability to recruit and to retain the best talent, especially for next-generation technologies.
For example, we implemented a new wellness program that included a variety of offerings such as weekly Fitbit competitions amongst our interns, employee walking sessions at lunch. Yes, I'm taking part in discounted weight-watcher programs as well as looking at biometric improvements. Our intent is to make wellness and caring for our employees' well-being a cornerstone of our CSRA culture. 
In October, we will complete the migration to one HR system. Now on one hand, it is going to bring us significant number of improvements. It will increase efficiency of hiring and promotions and performance reviews, but what we find really exciting is we're working with our SaaS partner, Workday, on the new system. And this is consistent with our customers' 0 philosophy of bringing next-gen technology into our company as we deliver it for our customers across the government. We are making strong progress in branding CSRA as a great place to work. 
And now I will ask Dave to provide more detail on the financial results as well as our forward outlook."
301669938,374045305,1033357,"CSRA Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2016",2016-08-10,"Earnings Calls","CSRA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter results were in line with our expectations and keep us on track for the guidance that we laid out on our last call. With this, our third public quarter, GAAP and adjusted results are coming in",1159,"Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter results were in line with our expectations and keep us on track for the guidance that we laid out on our last call. With this, our third public quarter, GAAP and adjusted results are coming into closer alignment. There is no pension mark-to-market impact this quarter and fewer spin, merger and integration costs. I'll focus on the adjusted results and note any deviations from GAAP along the way.
Turning to Slide 5. Revenue for the quarter was $1.25 billion, down 3% sequentially and down 5% from pro forma revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Most of the year-over-year decline was in our Defense and Intelligence segment, consistent with the headwinds we outlined on our last earnings call. On a pro forma basis, our Civil segment, which includes health, Homeland Security and other civilian agencies, was down 2%. And our Defense and Intelligence segment was down 8% year-over-year. The largest contributor to the decline was the Logistics Modernization Program for the U.S. Army, followed by a lower overall volume of direct material and other direct cost purchases. We're still negotiating with the LMP customer on the wind-down of the program, but it's worth mentioning what a successful engagement this has been. The SAP development program has saved our customers $6 billion through lower software maintenance costs and better inventory management. We look forward to supporting the Army however we can and competing on the next increment of development at some point in the future. 
Our contract mix remains essentially unchanged. As a percentage of total Q1 revenue, 42% was on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 37% on cost-plus contracts. As a result of merger synergies and strong contract performance, profitability and earnings were excellent. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $218 million, up 4% from the same period a year ago as EBITDA margin increased from 15.9% to 17.4%. Similarly, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.51, up 2% from last quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was unchanged compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, but the year-ago quarter included a pretax gain of $17 million on the sale of Welkin. Without the divestiture gain, adjusted EPS would have increased 12% from the year-ago quarter.
I'll quickly walk you through the principal elements between revenue and earnings. Gross margin was 21.2%, aided by a pickup on the Department of Homeland Security program that we've been tracking for several quarters. Pro forma SG&A was $52 million, which was down $30 million year-over-year based on cost synergies and up $7 million sequentially from higher bid and proposal expense as we accelerate our submittals. The net of the program pickup, the elevated B&P spend and other similar items was about $0.02 of EPS above our steady-state rate. 
First quarter pension-related income was $24 million, consistent with the rate laid out on the last call. GAAP depreciation and amortization expense was $65 million, which includes the $16 million of intangibles amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog that we backed out of our adjusted net income and EPS. Also excluded from adjusted EBITDA and EPS was $13 million of other pretax merger and integration costs. These costs continued to decline and should be even lower in future quarters.
Interest expense was $30 million in Q1, up slightly from last quarter, given additional costs from the interest rate hedge we executed in March, which was offset somewhat by reduced debt levels. Given that we no longer have significant transaction-related adjustments in our quarterly tax rate, we're using the GAAP tax rate in our calculation of adjusted earnings per share. The effective tax rate for the quarter was around 36%, which added a little over $0.02 to EPS compared to the previously projected long-term rate of 39%.
Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $156 million, helped by incorporating SRA into the company's accounts receivable purchase facility, which increased operating cash flow by $46 million. This program makes clear financial sense as it accelerates cash collection for enhanced deployment at a very low cost of capital. As a result of the strong cash flow, we aggressively executed on our balanced capital allocation program and deployed $98 million to pay down debt, $50 million of which eliminated the outstanding balance on our revolver and $48 million of which satisfied the FY '16 excess cash flow sweep requirement on our term loans. We also used $18 million to pay dividends. Our capital allocation approach continues to balance growth and fiscal responsibility for shareholder returns. First quarter free cash flow of $67 million excludes the impact of the receivables purchase facility and reflects normal fluctuations in quarterly working capital performance. We expect free cash flow to increase in the second quarter and to remain on track for the year. 
Day sales outstanding were 54 days as of the quarter end, a degradation of 1 day sequentially from an unusually strong Q4 level. As of July 1, 2016, we had $133 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.7 billion in debt. Our steady cash flows and $700 million of undrawn revolver capacity provides substantial liquidity and flexibility to manage the business, pay down debt, return cash to shareholders and to make accretive acquisitions. 
With an in-line quarter, we're maintaining our forward guidance as shown on Slide 7. We continue to project fiscal year 2017 revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $870 million and $905 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.91 and $2.04 and free cash flow between $300 million and $350 million. Our assumption for pension income of $96 million is unchanged. We've slightly tweaked other base assumptions. For the full year, we now expect our effective tax rate to be around 38% and our fully diluted share count to be around 165 million shares. Annualizing revenue for the first quarter yields the low end of the FY '17 guidance range, so we'll need new business wins to move up through the guidance range. We expect new business wins to materialize from our high volumes of submits awaiting adjudication and continued robust bidding activity. Annualizing first quarter EBITDA and EPS point to the middle of the guidance ranges after controlling for the program pickup and lower tax rate. That said, we expect revenue, EBITDA and EPS to step down slightly in Q2 before turning to sequential growth in the back half of the year as we ramp new business wins. 
In summary, I'm pleased that we're able to drive improved profitability while investing heavily in the organic growth engine of the company. With a robust volume of submitted proposals and strong positioning on upcoming next-generation IT and critical mission support opportunities, we look forward to accelerating new business wins while maintaining our industry-leading profitability and strong cash generation.
With that, Amy, we're now ready to take questions."

Of course, there's more art than science to that analysis, and it's one that we spend a lot of time thinking about and assessing every quarter. To date, we've deployed about $268 million to debt paydown, about $100 million to shareholder returns and have not yet, since the spin and merger with SRA, made another acquisition. So to date, we're in the 30% range for shareholder returns and 70% for debt paydown. Long-term guidance ranges for cash deployment, of course, are 50% for debt paydown, 40% for shareholder returns and 10% for M&A. Those priorities will continue to evolve over time. Obviously, over the first year out of the gates here, M&A was less of a priority for us. Reducing debt from the current -- from the initial $3 billion level was a high priority and sprinkling in some effective shareholder -- share repurchases under our $400 million authorization, also a priority. Going forward, we're comfortable. We're pleased with the current volume of debt we've been able to pay down. We will look at shareholder -- share buybacks going forward. We'll continue to look at those carefully each quarter. And as we said on the call, we are open to M&A in places where it can be strategically valuable to us and help spur further organic growth."

So with the Army, with the Logistics Modernization, we've got a core development team that's continuing to provide help with some of the incremental improvements with this SAP program. And the discussion with the Army is not bringing it down as fast as was originally planned, and how do we keep some of that talented enterprise software skill set alive and well, supporting the Army program as we get ready to compete on several other SAP programs. They've been really open to the discussions and recognize, for the Army and their commitment to SAP, it's fairly strategic. We've got one of the best software teams around it, so we continue to discuss how do we protect that team for the good use of Army enterprise planning while we're bidding aggressively on several SAP opportunities. When it comes to New York State, remember, there's 2 programs both continuing to see some extensions. eMedNY was the first one for Center for Medicare and Medicaid. We did not bid on the recompete. We thought it was a flawed model. A competitor won it. As they face any challenges, we stand ready to help the State of New York with this essential function of government, and we continue to benefit from extensions on that. The one I mentioned on the call though was New York State of Health around the Affordable Care Act. We got a 1-year extension. And as we go through the life of it, we expect that will grow into a multiyear extension. It's a very good program for us. We cherish the work. We perform well on it. And we think it's a nice base for us as we look to the rest of '17 and into '18."

Given the volume that we have pending, we talked about $6.5 billion worth of new business bids, not recompetes, but full new business.

And we'll consider acquisitions, but they have to really perform in 3 fronts. They have to give us a technology edge as we think about cloud-enabled digitization of the marketplace. We always look for customer intimacy and competitive advantage. And then almost always, we want to think of future contracts that will have a really positive result from any acquisition. Examples in our past have been 42Six and Tenacity. But be clear, priority 1 is a balanced approach around capital deployment, and we take some pride in reducing our debt in such an aggressive fashion as we've been disciplined about also doing share buyback."

We called it out, as we did a couple of quarters ago, talking about EAC adjustments, in general, being a few million higher than we would traditionally see. We called this one out because it added a bit to the results in the quarter. The net of that item and other kind of unique items in the quarter, as we said, was about $0.02 favorable to the company.

And I don't think any thought of the CR coming with the new fiscal year has slowed down anything. As we go into the government's first quarter, I still expect a CR to be shorter in duration. I still think they will be the Omnibus package, probably built on a defense appropriations bill. Everyone will hang a Christmas ornament on it. And then watch the dialogue around supplementals, where they are thinking about a budget request in parallel on the national security side built around overseas contingency ops, but then a matching security side that's focused on helping federal civilian government.

So for us, cyber, at times, is a direct sale where we're focused on doing work with security operations centers. Examples are the work we do for the FAA, the work we do for State Department security, the work we do for the 24th Air Force. So we have a robust direct sale program where it's competing head-to-head for pure-play cyber work. Most of it, however, is integral to enterprise IT, where anywhere you are in the stack, out to your endpoint computing, you're helping your government customers have everything beyond perimeter defense. And thinking about active means to really identify a threat. I think there's a greater propensity of the government now to invest in cyber as part of their integrated IT build. You see the proposal by -- in the President's budget, there's a couple of bills in Congress to think of industrial funding to help with the infrastructure, the legacy hardware and software, to upgrade it to a place where good hygiene really matters, and cyber will be something that, at least, has a foot in the foundation in infrastructure that's 2016 generation instead of 2003. Relative to the pricing, I think it's -- again, customers want out of IT a lower price. They expect us to consolidate data centers, they expect us to go virtual, they expect us to leverage cloud enablement. But they also expect to have pristine elements of cyber throughout the bid, and they will make that differentiation. So I see customers who will invest in cloud, invest in cyber, invest in data analytics and expect us to do leveraged delivery and give them a better price."

We're spending a lot more energy on talent around next-generation IT, enterprise IT and some of just the core domain knowledge of our customer sets. We're having good success in building and recruiting our leverage teams out of Bossier City, Louisiana, but we also see greater mobility that a lot of our employees are taking advantage of technical certs, and they're thinking about how they move across our enterprise and doing exciting careers in next-generation IT. We'll always have the challenge with all of our peers of working their way through the process of clearances. Our advantage is we have a base of thousands of cleared IT professionals. And Leigh Palmer and Ben Gianni and the intel team are really doing a good job leveraging some of that talent across what are traditional barriers, i.e. the Potomac River, so trying to get really good tech talent to cross from Virginia to Maryland or vice versa. If the work is exciting enough, that there's a period of time, they're willing to do it and excited to do it. So I think each company has got to hit it a little bit different way. For us, what's core, talent wants next-generation certs, they want a mission that matters, they want flexibility in the workplace. We're pretty casual with open spaces. We are fine with software developers working at midnight, just so long as their peers think whatever they deployed to GitHub is really cool. And I think that's the advantage that we're going to bring as we create CSRA as a company that's a first choice for that technical talent."

We're pleased to begin fiscal year 2017 with another strong quarter of execution. In the first quarter, we posted excellent results across key financial metrics, continued our business development momentum to lay the foundation for future growth and demonstrated progress in our strategy to differentiate CSRA as the leader in digital innovation for government. In addition, we are implementing a talent management approach that will brand us as an employer of choice for high-tech professionals. Let me flesh out each of these 4 major achievements in detail.
First, revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow are all on track. So we reaffirm the guidance that we gave on the last call. EBITDA margin was especially strong at 17.4%, driven by the twin CSRA hallmarks of excellent program execution and cost discipline. Our foundation of fixed-price contracts motivates us towards innovation and cost-efficient delivery and enables us to deliver for shareholders. In addition, we generated excellent cash flow in the quarter. Through disciplined financial management, we were able to generate operating cash flow of $156 million, which allowed us to continue to pay down debt, pay dividends and begin to evaluate acquisitions.
Second, we posted another positive quarter with $1.3 billion in bookings. This marks the sixth straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. Our book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x for the trailing 12 months points to future growth and demonstrates that we can compete fiercely in the federal IT marketplace. Our health business, which is our fastest-growing market, led the way with 2 key wins in the quarter. We won $180 million recompete of our work for the congressionally directed medical research program. This global funding organization supports cancer, military medical and other disease and injury-specific research. It manages more than $1 billion in biomedical research investments annually, funding groundbreaking research projects intended to transform health care for both military service members and the general public. Dr. Steven Goldberg directs our peer review and science management team, which is the nation's preeminent provider of scientific peer review solutions. Over the last 20 years on this program, we've developed and deployed a world-class approach for engaging scientists, clinicians and consumers in the evaluation of grant applications. 
In addition, the New York State Department of Health rewarded our support with a 1-year $127 million extension of our contract to enhance, operate and maintain the Health Insurance Exchange implemented under the Affordable Care Act. To date, we have enrolled more than 3 million residents through this program, and the program is a recognized leader across all states. We expect to reach agreement on a multiyear extension early next year.
The largest new business win in the quarter was with the U.S. Coast Guard's Telecommunication and Information Systems Command. Kudos to Pam Bosque, our Coast Guard account manager, who will serve as the PM for this program for her leveraging of our next-generation IT expertise and just the team's creativity to win this $55 million 5-year contract. We have a great opportunity to strengthen communications within the Coast Guard through life cycle management, server consolidation and technology insertion to enhance both current and future missions.
In addition to providing enterprise IT services and responsive technical support, we'll lead the development and the deployment of the U.S. Coast Guard's IT infrastructure, managing sensitive secret and top-secret networks both onshore and afloat. The maritime domain is complex, and the challenges and threats in our operational environment have never been greater. As the largest pure-play IT systems integrator for the Department of Homeland Security, CSRA is well positioned to support TISCOM's vital mission of ensuring our nation's security and prosperity. 
Across the company, we submitted $4 billion of proposals for new businesses in the first quarter, and we are on pace to achieve our FY '17 target of $16 billion in new business submits. As of the end of the quarter, we had $11 billion in submits outstanding. And looking only at new business, we had about $6.5 billion awaiting decision, including 14 opportunities greater than $100 million in total value. 
Our second quarter is shaping up to be a very strong one on the BD front. Our proposal rooms are overflowing, and we expect to submit another $5 billion of new business proposals in the second quarter. Q2 award volumes are usually high because it is the end of the government's fiscal year, but most of the awards tend to come in September. We began the quarter with the best July we've had in years, with multiple $100 million-plus wins. These large wins defend our base with competitive recompetes that included a $131 million award for architecture and design work for Navy ships, and the wins also drive new growth with new business, including a $167 million fixed-price IT job for the Defense Intelligence Agency, where we unseated 2 entrenched incumbents. We did so by leveraging the competitive advantage of our shared services center in Bossier City, Louisiana and the deep technical expertise of our Groundbreaker team in Maryland. 
As of the end of Q1, our backlog stood at $15.1 billion, which is about 3x annual revenue. Backlog is up 5% year-over-year, driven by strong bookings over this last year. And if we keep these positive trends going, revenue growth will certainly follow.
Third, we are enhancing our leadership and digital innovation as part of our overall strategy to drive sustainable growth by implementing next-generation technologies for our government customers. Central to that strategy is working closely with technology innovators. We recently announced new strategic partnerships with Amazon Web Services, Racemi and Docker. These partnerships extend well beyond the standard prime sub or integrator/vendor relationships so commonplace in the aerospace industry. In this case, we share go-to-market strategies, we treat them as partners, we get preferred access and pricing and we share development strategies with our partners to our mutual benefit, but more importantly, to the benefit of our government customers. 
I truly believe that no one can provide our partners the same level of delivery excellence to government IT customers than CSRA can. This strategy is not some recent development or a pet project of a few techies. Rather, it is the motivating construct that unifies our customers, our business, our company, and it spurs our investments. In fact, late last month, senior CSRA technology leaders and I spent a week on the West Coast, meeting with established tech partners, meeting with emerging technology companies and meeting with the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, DIUx, which the DoD stood up to bridge between the military and companies operating at the cutting edge of technology. 
This trip came on the heels of this summer's CSRA Emerging Technology Partner Day, where we met with 11 companies from leading venture capital funds to discuss capabilities and opportunities. It is clear from all of these interactions that we can catalyze adoption of these technology innovations as we deliver IT capability for government customers with incredible critical needs. We have already identified great outstanding collaborative opportunities where we can work together to create new solutions for our customers' mission challenges. In fact, I believe we'll have tangible success that will be material in our next 2 quarters. In addition to revving up the business development engine, it will help us drive organic growth through this innovation on programs that we're so proud of today. 
Fourth, we are excited about the progress we are making on the talent management front, and we are committed to building CSRA into an employer of choice. Over the past quarter, we have seen consistent headcount growth for the first time as a public company. Our voluntary attrition has been trending down over the last couple of months since we have concluded much of the organizational integration activities driven by our synergy case. We have seen strong interest in our job openings and have averaged a record number of offers accepted over the past quarter. A big shout-out to our HR team and to all of our recruiters. 
We are recognizing employees through our FY '17 quarterly performance award program and celebrating key contributions to our customers' missions as well as to company performance that serves them. We launched our new tuition reimbursement and certification program to support employees' continued development, which in turn will also help our customers in their digital transformation. We see our employee-focused culture as a key future discriminator in our ability to recruit and to retain the best talent, especially for next-generation technologies.
For example, we implemented a new wellness program that included a variety of offerings such as weekly Fitbit competitions amongst our interns, employee walking sessions at lunch. Yes, I'm taking part in discounted Weight Watcher programs as well as looking at biometric improvements. Our intent is to make wellness and caring for our employees' well-being a cornerstone of our CSRA culture. 
In October, we will complete the migration to one HR system. Now on one hand, it is going to bring us significant number of improvements. It will increase efficiency of hiring and promotions and performance reviews, but what we find really exciting is we're working with our SaaS partner, Workday, on the new system. And this is consistent with our customers' 0 philosophy of bringing next-gen technology into our company as we deliver it for our customers across the government. We are making strong progress in branding CSRA as a great place to work. 
And now I will ask Dave to provide more detail on the financial results as well as our forward outlook."
301669938,374045305,1033461,"CSRA Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2016",2016-08-10,"Earnings Calls","CSRA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter results were in line with our expectations and keep us on track for the guidance that we laid out on our last call. With this, our third public quarter, GAAP and adjusted results are coming in",1159,"Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter results were in line with our expectations and keep us on track for the guidance that we laid out on our last call. With this, our third public quarter, GAAP and adjusted results are coming into closer alignment. There is no pension mark-to-market impact this quarter and fewer spin, merger and integration costs. I'll focus on the adjusted results and note any deviations from GAAP along the way.
Turning to Slide 5. Revenue for the quarter was $1.25 billion, down 3% sequentially and down 5% from pro forma revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Most of the year-over-year decline was in our Defense and Intelligence segment, consistent with the headwinds we outlined on our last earnings call. On a pro forma basis, our Civil segment, which includes health, Homeland Security and other civilian agencies, was down 2%. And our Defense and Intelligence segment was down 8% year-over-year. The largest contributor to the decline was the Logistics Modernization Program for the U.S. Army, followed by a lower overall volume of direct material and other direct cost purchases. We're still negotiating with the LMP customer on the wind-down of the program, but it's worth mentioning what a successful engagement this has been. The SAP development program has saved our customers $6 billion through lower software maintenance costs and better inventory management. We look forward to supporting the Army however we can and competing on the next increment of development at some point in the future. 
Our contract mix remains essentially unchanged. As a percentage of total Q1 revenue, 42% was on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 37% on cost-plus contracts. As a result of merger synergies and strong contract performance, profitability and earnings were excellent. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $218 million, up 4% from the same period a year ago as EBITDA margin increased from 15.9% to 17.4%. Similarly, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.51, up 2% from last quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was unchanged compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, but the year-ago quarter included a pretax gain of $17 million on the sale of Welkin. Without the divestiture gain, adjusted EPS would have increased 12% from the year-ago quarter.
I'll quickly walk you through the principal elements between revenue and earnings. Gross margin was 21.2%, aided by a pickup on the Department of Homeland Security program that we've been tracking for several quarters. Pro forma SG&A was $52 million, which was down $30 million year-over-year based on cost synergies and up $7 million sequentially from higher bid and proposal expense as we accelerate our submittals. The net of the program pickup, the elevated B&P spend and other similar items was about $0.02 of EPS above our steady-state rate. 
First quarter pension-related income was $24 million, consistent with the rate laid out on the last call. GAAP depreciation and amortization expense was $65 million, which includes the $16 million of intangibles amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog that we back out of our adjusted net income and EPS. Also excluded from adjusted EBITDA and EPS was $13 million of other pretax merger and integration costs. These costs continued to decline and should be even lower in future quarters.
Interest expense was $30 million in Q1, up slightly from last quarter, given additional costs from the interest rate hedge we executed in March, which was offset somewhat by reduced debt levels. Given that we no longer have significant transaction-related adjustments in our quarterly tax rate, we're using the GAAP tax rate in our calculation of adjusted earnings per share. The effective tax rate for the quarter was around 36%, which added a little over $0.02 to EPS compared to the previously projected long-term rate of 39%.
Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $156 million, helped by incorporating SRA into the company's accounts receivable purchase facility, which increased operating cash flow by $46 million. This program makes clear financial sense as it accelerates cash collection for enhanced deployment at a very low cost of capital. As a result of the strong cash flow, we aggressively executed on our balanced capital allocation program and deployed $98 million to pay down debt, $50 million of which eliminated the outstanding balance on our revolver and $48 million of which satisfied the FY '16 excess cash flow sweep requirement on our term loans. We also used $18 million to pay dividends. Our capital allocation approach continues to balance growth and fiscal responsibility for shareholder returns. First quarter free cash flow of $67 million excludes the impact of the receivables purchase facility and reflects normal fluctuations in quarterly working capital performance. We expect free cash flow to increase in the second quarter and to remain on track for the year. 
Days sales outstanding were 54 days as of the quarter end, a degradation of 1 day sequentially from an unusually strong Q4 level. As of July 1, 2016, we had $133 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.7 billion in debt. Our steady cash flows and $700 million of undrawn revolver capacity provide substantial liquidity and flexibility to manage the business, pay down debt, return cash to shareholders and to make accretive acquisitions. 
With an in-line quarter, we're maintaining our forward guidance as shown on Slide 7. We continue to project fiscal year 2017 revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion; adjusted EBITDA between $870 million and $905 million; adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.91 and $2.04 and free cash flow between $300 million and $350 million. Our assumption for pension income of $96 million is unchanged. We've slightly tweaked other base assumptions. For the full year, we now expect our effective tax rate to be around 38% and our fully diluted share count to be around 165 million shares. Annualizing revenue for the first quarter yields the low end of the FY '17 guidance range, so we'll need new business wins to move up through the guidance range. 
We expect new business wins to materialize from our high volumes of submits awaiting adjudication and continued robust bidding activity. Annualizing first quarter EBITDA and EPS point to the middle of the guidance ranges after controlling for the program pickup and lower tax rate. That said, we expect revenue, EBITDA and EPS to step down slightly in Q2 before turning to sequential growth in the back half of the year as we ramp new business wins. 
In summary, I'm pleased that we're able to drive improved profitability while investing heavily in the organic growth engine of the company. With a robust volume of submitted proposals and strong positioning on upcoming next-generation IT and critical mission support opportunities, we look forward to accelerating new business wins while maintaining our industry-leading profitability and strong cash generation.
With that, Amy, we're now ready to take questions."

Of course, there's more art than science to that analysis, and it's one that we spend a lot of time thinking about and assessing every quarter. To date, we've deployed about $268 million to debt paydown, about $100 million to shareholder returns and have not yet, since the spin and merger with SRA, made another acquisition. So to date, we're in the 30% range for shareholder returns and 70% for debt paydown. Long-term guidance ranges for cash deployment, of course, are 50% for debt paydown, 40% for shareholder returns and 10% for M&A. Those priorities will continue to evolve over time. Obviously, over the first year out of the gates here, M&A was less of a priority for us. Reducing debt from the current -- from the initial $3 billion level was a high priority and sprinkling in some effective shareholder -- share repurchases under our $400 million authorization, also a priority. Going forward, we're comfortable. We're pleased with the current volume of debt we've been able to pay down. We will look at shareholder -- share buybacks going forward. We'll continue to look at those carefully each quarter. And as we said on the call, we are open to M&A in places where it can be strategically valuable to us and help spur further organic growth."

So with the Army, with the Logistics Modernization, we've got a core development team that's continuing to provide help with some of the incremental improvements with this SAP program. And the discussion with the Army is not bringing it down as fast as was originally planned, and how do we keep some of that talented enterprise software skill set alive and well, supporting the Army program as we get ready to compete on several other SAP programs. They've been really open to the discussions and recognize, for the Army and their commitment to SAP, it's fairly strategic. We've got one of the best software teams around it, so we continue to discuss how do we protect that team for the good use of Army enterprise planning while we're bidding aggressively on several SAP opportunities. When it comes to New York State, remember, there's 2 programs both continuing to see some extensions. eMedNY was the first one for Center for Medicare and Medicaid. We did not bid on the recompete. We thought it was a flawed model. A competitor won it. As they face any challenges, we stand ready to help the State of New York with this essential function of government, and we continue to benefit from extensions on that. The one I mentioned on the call though was New York State of Health around the Affordable Care Act. We got a 1-year extension. And as we go through the life of it, we expect that will grow into a multiyear extension. It's a very good program for us. We cherish the work. We perform well on it. And we think it's a nice base for us as we look to the rest of '17 and into '18."

To get to the mid-point, it's $250 million, and of course, the high end would be $350 million. So think of that $150 million to the low end as 3% and then 5% to the mid-point and 7% to the high end. Given the volume that we have pending, we talked about $6.5 billion worth of new business bids, not recompetes, but full new business.

And we'll consider acquisitions, but they have to really perform in 3 fronts. They have to give us a technology edge as we think about cloud-enabled digitization of the marketplace. We always look for customer intimacy and competitive advantage. And then almost always, we want to think of future contracts that will have a really positive result from any acquisition. Examples in our past have been 42Six and Tenacity.

We called it out, as we did a couple of quarters ago, talking about EAC adjustments, in general, being a few million higher than we would traditionally see. We called this one out because it added a bit to the results in the quarter. The net of that item and other kind of unique items in the quarter, as we said, was about $0.02 favorable to the company.

So a lot of our government customers seem to be fairly disciplined. We take real pride in watching FEDSIM as a bastion of adults running acquisition in the government today, and we think they will continue to operate in a very professional, disciplined manner. There's other great examples of that. So I think this quarter is lining up to be fairly disciplined with lots of award activity. And I don't think any thought of the CR coming with the new fiscal year has slowed down anything. As we go into the government's first quarter, I still expect a CR to be shorter in duration. I still think they will be the Omnibus package, probably built on a defense appropriations bill. Everyone will hang a Christmas ornament on it. And then watch the dialogue around supplementals, where they are thinking about a budget request in parallel on the national security side built around overseas contingency ops, but then a matching security side that's focused on helping federal civilian government. I think that play is going to be run again."

So for us, cyber, at times, is a direct sale where we're focused on doing work with security operations centers. Examples are the work we do for the FAA, the work we do for State Department security, the work we do for the 24th Air Force. So we have a robust direct sale program where it's competing head-to-head for pure-play cyber work. Most of it, however, is integral to enterprise IT, where anywhere you are in the stack, out to your endpoint computing, you're helping your government customers have everything beyond perimeter defense. And thinking about active means to really identify a threat. I think there's a greater propensity of the government now to invest in cyber as part of their integrated IT build. You see the proposal by -- in the President's budget, there's a couple of bills in Congress to think of industrial funding to help with the infrastructure, the legacy hardware and software, to upgrade it to a place where good hygiene really matters, and cyber will be something that, at least, has a foot in the foundation in an infrastructure that's 2016 generation instead of 2003. Relative to the pricing, I think it's -- again, customers want, out of IT, a lower price. They expect us to consolidate data centers, they expect us to go virtual, they expect us to leverage cloud enablement. But they also expect to have pristine elements of cyber throughout the bid, and they will make that differentiation. So I see customers who will invest in cloud, invest in cyber, invest in data analytics and expect us to do leveraged delivery and give them a better price."

We're spending a lot more energy on talent around next-generation IT, enterprise IT and some of just the core domain knowledge of our customer sets.

We'll always have the challenge with all of our peers of working our way through the process of clearances. Our advantage is we have a base of thousands of cleared IT professionals. And Leigh Palmer and Ben Gianni and the intel team are really doing a good job leveraging some of that talent across what are traditional barriers, i.e. the Potomac River, so trying to get really good tech talent to cross from Virginia to Maryland or vice versa. If the work is exciting enough, that there's a period of time, they're willing to do it and excited to do it. But I think each company has got to hit it a little bit different way. For us, what's core, talent wants next-generation certs, they want a mission that matters, they want flexibility in the workplace. We're pretty casual with open spaces. We are fine with software developers working at midnight, just so long as their peers think whatever they deployed to GitHub is really cool.

We're pleased to begin fiscal year 2017 with another strong quarter of execution.

We're pleased to begin fiscal year 2017 with another strong quarter of execution. In the first quarter, we posted excellent results across key financial metrics, continued our business development momentum to lay the foundation for future growth and demonstrated progress in our strategy to differentiate CSRA as the leader in digital innovation for government. In addition, we are implementing a talent management approach that will brand us as an employer of choice for high-tech professionals. Let me flesh out each of these 4 major achievements in detail.
First, revenue, EBITDA, EPS and free cash flow are all on track. So we reaffirm the guidance that we gave on the last call. EBITDA margin was especially strong at 17.4%, driven by the twin CSRA hallmarks of excellent program execution and cost discipline. Our foundation of fixed-price contracts motivates us towards innovation and cost-efficient delivery and enables us to deliver for shareholders. In addition, we generated excellent cash flow in the quarter. Through disciplined financial management, we were able to generate operating cash flow of $156 million, which allowed us to continue to pay down debt, pay dividends and begin to evaluate acquisitions.
Second, we posted another positive quarter with $1.3 billion in bookings. This marks the sixth straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. Our book-to-bill ratio of 1.3x for the trailing 12 months points to future growth and demonstrates that we can compete fiercely in the federal IT marketplace. Our health business, which is our fastest-growing market, led the way with 2 key wins in the quarter. We won $180 million recompete of our work for the congressionally directed medical research program. This global funding organization supports cancer, military medical and other disease and injury-specific research. It manages more than $1 billion in biomedical research investments annually, funding groundbreaking research projects intended to transform health care for both military service members and the general public. Dr. Steven Goldberg directs our peer review and science management team, which is the nation's preeminent provider of scientific peer review solutions. Over the last 20 years on this program, we've developed and deployed a world-class approach for engaging scientists, clinicians and consumers in the evaluation of grant applications. 
In addition, the New York State Department of Health rewarded our support with a 1-year $127 million extension of our contract to enhance, operate and maintain the Health Insurance Exchange implemented under the Affordable Care Act. To date, we have enrolled more than 3 million residents through this program, and the program is a recognized leader across all states. We expect to reach agreement on a multiyear extension early next year.
The largest new business win in the quarter was with the U.S. Coast Guard's Telecommunication and Information Systems Command. Kudos to Pam Bosque, our Coast Guard account manager, who will serve as the PM for this program for her leveraging of our next-generation IT expertise and just the team's creativity to win this $55 million 5-year contract. We have a great opportunity to strengthen communications within the Coast Guard through life cycle management, server consolidation and technology insertion to enhance both current and future missions.
In addition to providing enterprise IT services and responsive technical support, we'll lead the development and the deployment of the U.S. Coast Guard's IT infrastructure, managing sensitive secret and top-secret networks both onshore and afloat. The maritime domain is complex, and the challenges and threats in our operational environment have never been greater. As the largest pure-play IT systems integrator for the Department of Homeland Security, CSRA is well positioned to support TISCOM's vital mission of ensuring our nation's security and prosperity. 
Across the company, we submitted $4 billion of proposals for new businesses in the first quarter, and we are on pace to achieve our FY '17 target of $16 billion in new business submits. As of the end of the quarter, we had $11 billion in submits outstanding. And looking only at new business, we had about $6.5 billion awaiting decision, including 14 opportunities greater than $100 million in total value. 
Our second quarter is shaping up to be a very strong one on the BD front. Our proposal rooms are overflowing, and we expect to submit another $5 billion of new business proposals in the second quarter. Q2 award volumes are usually high because it is the end of the government's fiscal year, but most of the awards tend to come in September. We began the quarter with the best July we've had in years, with multiple $100 million-plus wins. These large wins defend our base with competitive recompetes that included a $131 million award for architecture and design work for Navy ships, and the wins also drive new growth with new business, including a $167 million fixed-price IT job for the Defense Intelligence Agency, where we unseated 2 entrenched incumbents. We did so by leveraging the competitive advantage of our shared services center in Bossier City, Louisiana and the deep technical expertise of our Groundbreaker team in Maryland. 
As of the end of Q1, our backlog stood at $15.1 billion, which is about 3x annual revenue. Backlog is up 5% year-over-year, driven by strong bookings over this last year. And if we keep these positive trends going, revenue growth will certainly follow.
Third, we are enhancing our leadership and digital innovation as part of our overall strategy to drive sustainable growth by implementing next-generation technologies for our government customers. Central to that strategy is working closely with technology innovators. We recently announced new strategic partnerships with Amazon Web Services, Racemi and Docker. These partnerships extend well beyond the standard prime sub or integrator/vendor relationships so commonplace in the aerospace industry. In this case, we share go-to-market strategies, we treat them as partners, we get preferred access and pricing and we share development strategies with our partners to our mutual benefit, but more importantly, to the benefit of our government customers. 
I truly believe that no one can provide our partners the same level of delivery excellence to government IT customers than CSRA can. This strategy is not some recent development or a pet project of a few techies. Rather, it is the motivating construct that unifies our customers, our business, our company, and it spurs our investments. In fact, late last month, senior CSRA technology leaders and I spent a week on the West Coast, meeting with established tech partners, meeting with emerging technology companies and meeting with the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, DIUx, which the DoD stood up to bridge between the military and companies operating at the cutting edge of technology. 
This trip came on the heels of this summer's CSRA Emerging Technology Partner Day, where we met with 11 companies from leading venture capital funds to discuss capabilities and opportunities. It is clear from all of these interactions that we can catalyze adoption of these technology innovations as we deliver IT capability for government customers with incredible critical needs. We have already identified great outstanding collaborative opportunities where we can work together to create new solutions for our customers' mission challenges. In fact, I believe we'll have tangible success that will be material in our next 2 quarters. In addition to revving up the business development engine, it will help us drive organic growth through this innovation on programs that we're so proud of today. 
Fourth, we are excited about the progress we are making on the talent management front, and we are committed to building CSRA into an employer of choice. Over the past quarter, we have seen consistent headcount growth for the first time as a public company. Our voluntary attrition has been trending down over the last couple of months since we have concluded much of the organizational integration activities driven by our synergy case. We have seen strong interest in our job openings and have averaged a record number of offers accepted over the past quarter. A big shout-out to our HR team and to all of our recruiters. 
We are recognizing employees through our FY '17 quarterly performance award program and celebrating key contributions to our customers' missions as well as to company performance that serves them. We launched our new tuition reimbursement and certification program to support employees' continued development, which in turn will also help our customers in their digital transformation. We see our employee-focused culture as a key future discriminator in our ability to recruit and to retain the best talent, especially for next-generation technologies.
For example, we implemented a new wellness program that included a variety of offerings such as weekly Fitbit competitions amongst our interns, employee walking sessions at lunch. Yes, I'm taking part in discounted Weight Watcher programs as well as looking at biometric improvements. Our intent is to make wellness and caring for our employees' well-being a cornerstone of our CSRA culture. 
In October, we will complete the migration to one HR system. Now on one hand, it is going to bring us significant number of improvements. It will increase efficiency of hiring and promotions and performance reviews, but what we find really exciting is we're working with our SaaS partner, Workday, on the new system. And this is consistent with our customers' 0 philosophy of bringing next-gen technology into our company as we deliver it for our customers across the government. We are making strong progress in branding CSRA as a great place to work. 
And now I will ask Dave to provide more detail on the financial results as well as our forward outlook."
301669938,374045305,1033814,"CSRA Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 10, 2016",2016-08-10,"Earnings Calls","CSRA Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter results were in line with our expectations and keep us on track for the guidance that we laid out on our last call. With this, our third public quarter, GAAP and adjusted results are coming in",1159,"Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter results were in line with our expectations and keep us on track for the guidance that we laid out on our last call. With this, our third public quarter, GAAP and adjusted results are coming into closer alignment. There is no pension mark-to-market impact this quarter and fewer spin, merger and integration costs. I'll focus on the adjusted results and note any deviations from GAAP along the way.
Turning to Slide 5. Revenue for the quarter was $1.25 billion, down 3% sequentially and down 5% from pro forma revenue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. Most of the year-over-year decline was in our Defense and Intelligence segment, consistent with the headwinds we outlined on our last earnings call. On a pro forma basis, our Civil segment, which includes health, Homeland Security and other civilian agencies, was down 2%. And our Defense and Intelligence segment was down 8% year-over-year. The largest contributor to the decline was the Logistics Modernization Program for the U.S. Army, followed by a lower overall volume of direct material and other direct cost purchases. We're still negotiating with the LMP customer on the wind-down of the program, but it's worth mentioning what a successful engagement this has been. The SAP development program has saved our customers $6 billion through lower software maintenance costs and better inventory management. We look forward to supporting the Army however we can and competing on the next increment of development at some point in the future. 
Our contract mix remains essentially unchanged. As a percentage of total Q1 revenue, 42% was on fixed-price contracts, 21% on time and material contracts and 37% on cost-plus contracts. As a result of merger synergies and strong contract performance, profitability and earnings were excellent. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $218 million, up 4% from the same period a year ago as EBITDA margin increased from 15.9% to 17.4%. Similarly, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.51, up 2% from last quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was unchanged compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, but the year-ago quarter included a pretax gain of $17 million on the sale of Welkin. Without the divestiture gain, adjusted EPS would have increased 12% from the year-ago quarter.
I'll quickly walk you through the principal elements between revenue and earnings. Gross margin was 21.2%, aided by a pickup on the Department of Homeland Security program that we've been tracking for several quarters. Pro forma SG&A was $52 million, which was down $30 million year-over-year based on cost synergies and up $7 million sequentially from higher bid and proposal expense as we accelerate our submittals. The net of the program pickup, the elevated B&P spend and other similar items was about $0.02 of EPS above our steady-state rate. 
First quarter pension-related income was $24 million, consistent with the rate laid out on the last call. GAAP depreciation and amortization expense was $65 million, which includes the $16 million of intangibles amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog that we back out of our adjusted net income and EPS. Also excluded from adjusted EBITDA and EPS was $13 million of other pretax merger and integration costs. These costs continued to decline and should be even lower in future quarters.
Interest expense was $30 million in Q1, up slightly from last quarter, given additional costs from the interest rate hedge we executed in March, which was offset somewhat by reduced debt levels. Given that we no longer have significant transaction-related adjustments in our quarterly tax rate, we're using the GAAP tax rate in our calculation of adjusted earnings per share. The effective tax rate for the quarter was around 36%, which added a little over $0.02 to EPS compared to the previously projected long-term rate of 39%.
Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $156 million, helped by incorporating SRA into the company's accounts receivable purchase facility, which increased operating cash flow by $46 million. This program makes clear financial sense as it accelerates cash collection for enhanced deployment at a very low cost of capital. As a result of the strong cash flow, we aggressively executed on our balanced capital allocation program and deployed $98 million to pay down debt, $50 million of which eliminated the outstanding balance on our revolver and $48 million of which satisfied the FY '16 excess cash flow sweep requirement on our term loans. We also used $18 million to pay dividends. Our capital allocation approach continues to balance growth and fiscal responsibility for shareholder returns. First quarter free cash flow of $67 million excludes the impact of the receivables purchase facility and reflects normal fluctuations in quarterly working capital performance. We expect free cash flow to increase in the second quarter and to remain on track for the year. 
Days sales outstanding were 54 days as of the quarter end, a degradation of 1 day sequentially from an unusually strong Q4 level. As of July 1, 2016, we had $133 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.7 billion in debt. Our steady cash flows and $700 million of undrawn revolver capacity provide substantial liquidity and flexibility to manage the business, pay down debt, return cash to shareholders and to make accretive acquisitions. 
With an in-line quarter, we're maintaining our forward guidance as shown on Slide 7. We continue to project fiscal year 2017 revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion; adjusted EBITDA between $870 million and $905 million; adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.91 and $2.04 and free cash flow between $300 million and $350 million. Our assumption for pension income of $96 million is unchanged. We've slightly tweaked other base assumptions. For the full year, we now expect our effective tax rate to be around 38% and our fully diluted share count to be around 165 million shares. Annualizing revenue for the first quarter yields the low end of the FY '17 guidance range, so we'll need new business wins to move up through the guidance range. 
We expect new business wins to materialize from our high volumes of submits awaiting adjudication and continued robust bidding activity. Annualizing first quarter EBITDA and EPS point to the middle of the guidance ranges after controlling for the program pickup and lower tax rate. That said, we expect revenue, EBITDA and EPS to step down slightly in Q2 before turning to sequential growth in the back half of the year as we ramp new business wins. 
In summary, I'm pleased that we're able to drive improved profitability while investing heavily in the organic growth engine of the company. With a robust volume of submitted proposals and strong positioning on upcoming next-generation IT and critical mission support opportunities, we look forward to accelerating new business wins while maintaining our industry-leading profitability and strong cash generation.
With that, Amy, we're now ready to take questions."

Of course, there's more art than science to that analysis, and it's one that we spend a lot of time thinking about and assessing every quarter. To date, we've deployed about $268 million to debt paydown, about $100 million to shareholder returns and have not yet, since the spin and merger with SRA, made another acquisition. So to date, we're in the 30% range for shareholder returns and 70% for debt paydown. Long-term guidance ranges for cash deployment, of course, are 50% for debt paydown, 40% for shareholder returns and 10% for M&A. Those priorities will continue to evolve over time. Obviously, over the first year out of the gates here, M&A was less of a priority for us. Reducing debt from the current -- from the initial $3 billion level was a high priority and sprinkling in some effective shareholder -- share repurchases under our $400 million authorization, also a priority. Going forward, we're comfortable. We're pleased with the current volume of debt we've been able to pay down. We will look at shareholder -- share buybacks going forward. We'll continue to look at those carefully each quarter. And as we said on the call, we are open to M&A in places where it can be strategically valuable to us and help spur further organic growth."

So with the Army, with the Logistics Modernization, we've got a core development team that's continuing to provide help with some of the incremental improvements with this SAP program.

They've been really open to the discussions and recognize, for the Army and their commitment to SAP, it's fairly strategic. We've got one of the best software teams around it, so we continue to discuss how do we protect that team for the good use of Army enterprise planning while we're bidding aggressively on several SAP opportunities. When it comes to New York State, remember, there's 2 programs both continuing to see some extensions. eMedNY was the first one for Center for Medicare and Medicaid. We did not bid on the recompete. We thought it was a flawed model. A competitor won it. As they face any challenges, we stand ready to help the State of New York with this essential function of government, and we continue to benefit from extensions on that. The one I mentioned on the call though was New York State of Health around the Affordable Care Act. We got a 1-year extension. And as we go through the life of it, we expect that will grow into a multiyear extension. It's a very good program for us. We cherish the work. We perform well on it. And we think it's a nice base for us as we look to the rest of '17 and into '18."

We called it out, as we did a couple of quarters ago, talking about EAC adjustments, in general, being a few million higher than we would traditionally see. We called this one out because it added a bit to the results in the quarter. The net of that item and other kind of unique items in the quarter, as we said, was about $0.02 favorable to the company.

So for us, cyber, at times, is a direct sale where we're focused on doing work with security operations centers. Examples are the work we do for the FAA, the work we do for State Department security, the work we do for the 24th Air Force. So we have a robust direct sale program where it's competing head-to-head for pure-play cyber work. Most of it, however, is integral to enterprise IT, where anywhere you are in the stack, out to your endpoint computing, you're helping your government customers have everything beyond perimeter defense. And thinking about active means to really identify a threat. I think there's a greater propensity of the government now to invest in cyber as part of their integrated IT build. You see the proposal by -- in the President's budget, there's a couple of bills in Congress to think of industrial funding to help with the infrastructure, the legacy hardware and software, to upgrade it to a place where good hygiene really matters, and cyber will be something that, at least, has a foot in the foundation in an infrastructure that's 2016 generation instead of 2003. Relative to the pricing, I think it's -- again, customers want, out of IT, a lower price. They expect us to consolidate data centers, they expect us to go virtual, they expect us to leverage cloud enablement. But they also expect to have pristine elements of cyber throughout the bid, and they will make that differentiation. So I see customers who will invest in cloud, invest in cyber, invest in data analytics and expect us to do leveraged delivery and give them a better price."

We're spending a lot more energy on talent around next-generation IT, enterprise IT and some of just the core domain knowledge of our customer sets. We're having good success in building and recruiting our leverage teams out of Bossier City, Louisiana, but we also see greater mobility that a lot of our employees are taking advantage of technical certs, and they're thinking about how they move across our enterprise and doing exciting careers in next-generation IT. We'll always have the challenge with all of our peers of working our way through the process of clearances. Our advantage is we have a base of thousands of cleared IT professionals. And Leigh Palmer and Ben Gianni and the intel team are really doing a good job leveraging some of that talent across what are traditional barriers, i.e. the Potomac River, so trying to get really good tech talent to cross from Virginia to Maryland or vice versa. If the work is exciting enough, that there's a period of time, they're willing to do it and excited to do it. But I think each company has got to hit it a little bit different way. For us, what's core, talent wants next-generation certs, they want a mission that matters, they want flexibility in the workplace. We're pretty casual with open spaces. We are fine with software developers working at midnight, just so long as their peers think whatever they deployed to GitHub is really cool.

It's our best quarter yet since going public, and we're pretty excited about it. Revenue, EBITDA and EPS were all above both our forecast and the consensus estimates. Kudos to all of our program managers who were able to accelerate mission delivery for our customers and drive excellent performance.
This performance shows up in sequential revenue and EBITDA growth and in the especially strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 8.1%, which helped drive adjusted EPS growth of 10% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Our Q2 EBITDA margins were well above our long-term target of 16% to 17%. Our aggressive execution on the synergy case has built a strong foundation, but achieving these levels is the result of tremendous execution and discipline in the part of our seasoned program managers. Because fixed-price contracts are such a large part of our mix, we have become industry best at executing fixed-price work. We may now then dial back our margins as we invest in and deliver growth, but strong fixed-price execution is an essential part of our DNA at achieving our long-term target of 16% to 17%. 
Beyond the financial results, I want to focus your attention on 3 key points: First, what we're seeing now validates the strategy and the operating model that we laid out just about a year ago. Second, our business development engine is humming, generating substantial new wins in a very competitive environment. And third, our talent management team is rapidly staffing our new wins to position us for sustainable growth.
So let me speak to each of these 3 points in more detail. Point number one. We are really hitting our stride as a new company. Our second quarter results demonstrate the promise of CSRA as we pivot towards growth and continue to deliver industry-leading profitability. It's now been a year since we got together for our Analyst Day in New York, and we'll celebrate a year as a publicly traded company in December. A lot has happened over that time, and we've had many successes and a few challenges. Still, I see the last year as validating our strategy and our operating model.
Let me start at the beginning with our customers. Our employees remain committed to customer success, and customer satisfaction remains high. Passion for mission is a shared value for all our employees, and it is central to all that we do. While revenue has occasionally been a challenge with greater headwinds than we expected from our legacy book of business, our BD engine is now firing on all cylinders. And we have proven that we can be the trenched competitors on both technical innovation and cost efficiency. Our focus on next-generation thinking and robust two-way partnerships with leading technology vendors is spurring new business wins that will drive growth. 
For example, on the last call, I referenced our first Emerging Technology Partner Day [ph] that we hosted over the summer. We already have built an offering around [indiscernible] an especially exciting technology partner whose product provides visibility throughout the entire application infrastructure stack to deliver past, present and, most importantly, predictive analytics. We see tremendous applicability throughout the Department of Homeland Security for this offering and using our DC1 contract to deliver. We held our second Emerging Technology Partner Day [ph] last week, and I look forward to more success in working with new and innovative players to bring the best technology to bear to help our customers' missions. 
Now we've come together rapidly, which has accelerated the development of new culture and an operating model that has generated tremendous cost savings and made us more competitive in the marketplace. We outlined a synergy case and then doubled the savings in half the time. We are still maturing our processes, but our commitment to cost discipline and innovative solutions are hallmarks that you can depend on from us. 
Point number 2. The business development results for the quarter were just outstanding. We posted our seventh straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. Our government customers accelerated awards at the end of their fiscal year, and we posted $2.4 billion in bookings for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.9x. Over the past year, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.3. As impressive as the reported business development numbers are, they understate just how good a quarter it was. 63% of the bookings in the quarter were for new business as opposed to recompetes, and our win rate of new business was 40%, which is well above our target rate of 25%. Moreover, we have a $744 million award in the quarter, most of which was new business for CSRA that was subsequently protested. Now the contracting organization for this award has 100% success rate defending its original decision against protests, so we're confident that we will ultimately prevail. If we had included that award in the second quarter bookings, our total bookings would have been $3.2 billion for a book-to-bill ratio of 2.5x, including $2.3 billion in new business. This is more than double the target of $1 billion in new awards each quarter even as we are still ramping up our submit volume.
Our investments in business development and our focus on next-generation solutions are paying off. Our new business wins position us well to return to organic growth in fiscal year 2018. The second quarter marked the moment where we saw the full benefits of our merger and integration. For the first time, the new business awards were primarily the result of combined CSRA bids. George Batsakis and his BD team are truly industry's best, and we believe we can win anything we go after. The awards reflected broad-based success across the entire portfolio, with 6 awards north of $100 million in total contract value. We had significant new awards in each of our 4 groups and both in mission and in IT. The common theme throughout is delivering innovative and efficient technology solutions to our customers' most pressing needs.
Let me highlight just a few of the major wins in the quarter to give you a sense of what I mean. First, our largest award was a 5-year $503 million blanket purchase agreement to provide background checks for the Office of Personnel Management. Gill Dusek [ph] and his team will manage the program for us, and they were instrumental in the vision of how to win and then execute this work by introducing new partners and new technology into a workflow to significantly increase efficiency and improve quality. We performed background investigations across all 4 of our groups and see screening and vetting as a strong potential growth vector for us and a process that's just screaming for next-generation data analytics.
Second, John Marshall led the takeaway of $114 million cyber program to develop and deploy a network security strategy to protect the offices throughout the Pentagon. CSRA will also work with the U.S. Cyber Command to provide situational awareness of potential network threats. This program is a tremendous calling card of our deep and significant cyber capabilities. 
Third, Casha Wilson Daly [ph] leads a team that won a $116 million contract to modernize the IT systems of the Office of Justice Programs within the Department of Justice. This is a key component of our growth strategy, helping existing enterprise IT customers realize their digital future and, in this case, through cloud migration, agile application development and real focus on mobile application development and leveraged shared services.
Fourth, Egan Donmeds [ph] led the successful capture of the $73 million contract to manage a portfolio of cloud computing services across the Department of Veteran Affairs. This is one of a number of cloud wins in the quarter with many more pending and in discussion. Here's a prime example of where we're leveraging our first-hand experience of transitioning our own data [ph] to the cloud in [ph] building decades of systems integration and expertise to be the go-to cloud provider for the public sector. 
And fifth, we won a $45 million 3-year contract to advise the U.S. Customs and Border Protection on effective and efficient methods to detect and prevent unlawful travel and trade. Alfonso Delucio [ph] will head up a collaborative team of systems engineers and logisticians to identify and deploy intuitive, leading-edge technology to secure and protect our borders.
On top of these Q2 wins, we continue to see significant opportunities to take market share. Across the company, we submitted $4.9 billion of proposals for new business in the second quarter, and we're on a pace to achieve our FY '17 target of $16 billion in new bids. At the end of the quarter, we had $12 billion in submits outstanding. And looking only at new business, we had about $6.4 billion awaiting decision, including 18 opportunities each greater than $100 million in total value. 
Our third quarter should be another strong quarter for awards. As I said, the $744 million award that was protested should be resolved, and we have more than $3 billion in additional new business award decisions expected in the quarter. This kind of momentum is keeping morale high both on the BD team and really at every level across the company, which brings me to make third key point, talent. 
In the second quarter, we had record new hires of about 1,300 employees, another 500 who accepted with future start dates, and we still have about 1,000 more funded openings. The acceptance rate and offers extended is about 90%. Our new wins are creating a demand for new talent, and we're having great success bringing in people who are attracted to the combination of deep mission expertise with a focus on next-generation thinking around IT and a culture that builds around core principles like best idea wins where we work across barriers, we work across domains, and we work across hierarchies to find the best idea to solve any problem. Importantly, many of those new hires were in our Integrated Technology Center in Bossier City, Louisiana. And next week, our team will be at the formal ribbon-cutting ceremony. As we build up staff and capability at the state-of-the-art IT delivery and data center, we're breeding great jobs to Louisiana, developing more efficient and effective solutions for our customers and providing a great work environment for our team. The key driver for ITC growth in this quarter was our Enterprise Service Operations center win for the Defense Intelligence Agency. Under $167 million contract, Kelly Miller [ph] is leading a team that manages self-help knowledge portals and provides remote service desk resolution and infield customer engagement supporting the intelligence customers globally. This program is a future platform for next-generation software-as-a-service offering to a broad set of customers, and it's just a wonderful platform for the company. And we're going to keep this momentum up at the ITC with $150 million third quarter new business award that will implement shared services and partner with service now for the Department of Commerce.
Finally, early this morning, our nation elected Donald Trump [ph] as our next President. With congratulations from President Obama and Secretary Clinton, we celebrate the peaceful transfer of power and a quick move to the governments [ph] of the nation. The prevailing message has been one of change, and we now will see how broad that change can be. President-elect Trump has spoken in favor of easing sequestration, enhancing infrastructure and defense spending and taking care of veterans, all areas of strength for us. Also, as the largest IT provider to DHS, we expect to benefit from a focus on delivering mission success to that department. We will continue to navigate the complexities of government well and the demand for information technology, and technology-enabled mission services is going to remain strong.
Now Dave will provide more detail on the financial results and our forward outlook."

I'm pleased to report that the second quarter results were ahead of our expectations on almost all measures.

I'm pleased to report that the second quarter results were ahead of our expectations on almost all measures. The results are also fairly straightforward as GAAP and adjusted results are steadily coming into closer alignment as we approach the 1-year mark post merger.
Turning to Slide 5. Revenue for the quarter was $1.26 billion, up 1% sequentially and down 4% from pro forma revenue in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. The sequential growth was the result of a lot of hard work across the team, and I see it as an early indicator that we're turning the corner on revenue.
Quarterly revenue and profitability benefited from some pull-forward of program deliveries that were expected in the third and fourth quarters across both segments. These accelerated deliveries drove the sequential increases in revenue and EPS when we had expected a slight decline in both. Our contract mix also improved slightly. As a percentage of total revenue, 46% was on fixed-price contracts, 20% on time and material contracts and 34% on cost-plus contracts. We see contract trends continuing to support our attractive business mix. 
As a result of strong contract performance and merger synergies, profitability and earnings were excellent. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $229 million, up 5% sequentially and down 3% from the same period a year ago with a record EBITDA margin of 18.1%. Similarly, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.56, up 10% from last quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was up 6% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. 
In the second quarters of FY '16 and now FY '17, we executed our programs with outstanding efficiency, leading to a higher volume of contract EAC improvements and other pickups than usual and driving a quarterly spike in EBITDA margins. 
In addition, our aggressive execution of the merger synergy case has laid the foundation for the FY '17 results. We've been able to accelerate and amplify the savings based on the phenomenal efforts of the finance team and really the entire company. 
Over the next few quarters, we expect our EBITDA margin to decline from the Q2 level toward our FY '17 guidance in the low to mid -- in the low to mid-17% range. Our longer-term guidance range of 16% to 17%, which would still lead our peer group, remains appropriate as we pivot toward top line growth. 
I'll walk through a few of the income drivers with a focus on what's changed from last quarter. Pretax merger and integration costs, which are GAAP expenses but excluded from adjusted EBITDA, were $8 million or about half of what they were last quarter. These expenses will continue to decline over the next few quarters. The low [ph] EBITDA, depreciation and amortization, excluding the intangibles amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog, was $47 million or $2 million less than last quarter. Interest expense was $29 million in the quarter, down about $1 million from last quarter as we continue to take down our debt. Our effective tax rate was around 36%, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter but down 3 percentage points from the year-ago quarter.
Finally, pension-related income was $24 million, so no change there, but we always want to be clear about the noncash contribution to adjusted EBITDA and EPS.
Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $55 million, which was lower than expected. Days sales outstanding were 57 days as of the quarter end, an increase of 3 days sequentially. DSO typically improves in the final quarter of the government's fiscal year, but we didn't experience the usual volume of early payments this year. Cash flow was also affected by onetime payments and timing items. For example, we made tax payments of $45 million in the quarter compared to about $2 million in the first quarter. We also made a $25 million payment to another contractor pursuant to a divestiture agreement executed in 2013. When the government reimburses that contractor, they'll pass along the payment to us, and we expect that reimbursement to occur this fiscal year. This advanced payment was a one-off transaction, and there's nothing similar remaining on our books. In addition, second quarter capital expenditures were higher than usual due to the timing of customer requirements. And approximately $20 million of our Q2 CapEx was noncash in nature, related to the accounting treatment of training equipment deployed on one of our large programs. As a result, free cash flow during the quarter was $8 million. Direct project capital expenditures should normalize in the second half of FY '17.
We followed our balanced capital allocation program in Q2, deploying $50 million to pay down debt and $24 million to return to shareholders, $16 million in dividends and $8 million in share repurchases. We spent another $5 million on share buybacks in early October for a total of about 0.5 million shares in late Q2 and early Q3. $337 million now remains on our current share repurchase authorization. 
As of September 30, 2016, we had $68 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen as we pay down debt and grow EBITDA. Since going public, we've now paid down about $320 million in debt and have improved to about 3x net debt to EBITDA. We prioritize debt paydown to create flexibility and to enable our balance sheet to be a strategic asset going forward.
Now onto the forward outlook. We're maintaining our guidance as shown on Slide 7. We continue to project fiscal year 2017 revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $870 million and $905 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.91 and $2.04 and free cash flow between $300 million and $350 million.
Let me now address our visibility into the rest of FY '17 and early signs of what to expect in FY '18. Annualizing revenue for the first half remains near the low end of our FY '17 range. On our last call, I talked about needing to generate about $150 million of revenue from new business to reach the bottom of the revenue range. With our strong awards in the second quarter, we've taken care of most of that figure. In fact, the awards made in the quarter should generate more than $400 million in incremental revenue on an annual basis. But our 2 largest awards in the quarter aren't expected to generate revenue until December or later. The OPM contract requires us to build capability and then process investigations before significant revenue is recognized. And resolution of the protest on our $744 million army win isn't expected until the end of the third quarter. So what increased our confidence in driving organic growth in 2018, we still have greater visibility into the lower end of this year's revenue range than the top. But on the bottom line through the first half of the year, we're tracking towards the high side of our EPS guidance range. There are 3 other P&L items that we should discuss even though they won't have a material impact on our adjusted EBITDA or EPS this year. First, the term loan markets have improved since our spin merger transaction, so we're in the process of repricing a reduction in the spread on our Term Loan B effective at the end of November when the soft call provision expires at the one-year anniversary of our loans. We also expect to repay a portion of our Term Loan B outstanding balance by upsizing the current Term Loan A. This transfer of debt would reduce our effective interest rate, and we also expect to extend the maturities of all loans by 1 year and amend certain terms and conditions of the credit agreement in our favor. The noncash accelerated amortization charges associated with this amend and extend transaction would increase our GAAP interest expense in Q3. But consistent with industry practice, we'd exclude this onetime charge from our adjusted earnings figures. Going forward, the repricing should reduce our cash interest expense by around $5 million per year. And the extended long-duration and amended terms provide us with outstanding flexibility in executing our strategy. Second, for the last 2 quarters, we've incurred $16 million of intangibles amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog. Going forward, GAAP intangibles expense will decline with only 2 months a backlog related amortization in the third quarter figure and none thereafter. This has no impact on our guidance but as we noted previously, it will impact our GAAP EPS.
And third, this fall, we've offered to buy out certain groups in our frozen pension program. The offer has just recently closed so we don't have a final tally, but we will shrink both the assets and the obligations of the pension program. This will necessitate a mark-to-market adjustment in our third quarter in addition to the usual fourth quarter adjustment. It's too soon to tell the direction or magnitude of the mark-to-market adjustments or any changes to recurring pension income, but the recent mortality table update should be favorable. Remember that the mark-to-market adjustments are in GAAP EBITDA and GAAP EPS but not in the adjusted EBITDA or EPS that we guide to, and that none of these changes impact cash flow. We do expect free cash flow to rebound and to end the year within the guidance range. 
With higher holiday leave-taking from our employees and our government customers in the December quarter, we expect Q3 revenue, EBITDA and EPS to decline slightly, consistent with our experience last year when pro forma revenue declined approximately $50 million sequentially. Seasonal improvements in growth for many of the large Q2 and Q3 wins should drive a meaningful sequential improvement in Q4. This would imply that we're closer to organic growth in the fourth quarter and that we enter FY '18 with strong momentum and an opportunity for top line growth to reach the range of our long-term model of 2% to 3%.
In summary, we continue to deliver industry-leading profitability, and we can see growth on the horizon based on outstanding business development momentum.
With that, operator, we're now ready to take questions."

It appears the adjudication of it is slipping from like late spring to late summer of next year. And with the transition period, it's moving from being an FY '18 event for us to be an FY '19 event. I also think the context is important that you've seen some debate and discussion of whether or not you separate the leadership of NSA from cyber command and then whether or not you have a civilian leader at the helm at NSA. And when you think of the work that President-elect Trump wants to do with the review of all the cyber defense and vulnerabilities, he's going to look at joint task forces that walk across federal state local government. He absolutely wants look at enhancing cyber command, and then he's spoken at length about improving offensive capabilities, really focused on deterrants.

Big picture though, every quarter will look a little bit different in terms of fixed-price program performance, and we'll continue to try to drive outstanding delivery on any one of those programs. As Larry mentioned in his earlier comments, fixed-price program execution is really a hallmark of a company at this point and will continue to drive outsized performance every quarter. Gross margins in the overall 18.1% EBITDA margin though are not what we are projecting over any future period that we're particularly strong in this quarter. To the second point on -- of your question about what was pulled forward in revenue from Q3 and Q4, we had projected going into the quarter last call that our numbers would be down slightly and the top line from Q1 to Q2. Instead, they were up about $10 million in revenue.

We talked about needing $150 million or about 3% of our revenue guidance to get to the low end of guidance this time last quarter. And on my script and comments, we didn't exactly say that we had filled that entire bucket, but we filled most of it. So think of us as being a debt last 1% of the 3% we needed this time last quarter. Exactly what the Q3 and Q4 revenue results are will depend on a few factors. One, the ongoing pace of new business award activity and our success of  recompetes. Certainly, we're pleased with Q2 and as we mentioned a couple of wins in early Q3. The right kinds of momentums are in place, but we need to continue to win new business to continue to fill the rest of the less than 1% gap to get to the low end of guidance and then to fill into the guidance range. Second, the continuing resolution has an effect on certain programs across the business and can influence our customers' thoughts on things like whether this is the right couple of months to do a direct material purchase or to engage in a surge in labor support. Across a couple of thousand programs you can imagine that 1 million here and 1 million there add up. And the exact timing of the resolution of the CR and what the new administration's priorities look like as they take place over the winter months will also have an effect, particularly as we enter Q4. So that combination of factors is what continues to influence our thinking every day.

It's our best quarter yet since going public, and we're pretty excited about it. Revenue, EBITDA and EPS were all above both our forecast and the consensus estimates. Kudos to all of our program managers who were able to accelerate mission delivery for our customers and drive excellent performance.
This performance shows up in sequential revenue and EBITDA growth and in the especially strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 8.1%, which helped drive adjusted EPS growth of 10% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Our Q2 EBITDA margins were well above our long-term target of 16% to 17%. Our aggressive execution on the synergy case has built a strong foundation, but achieving these levels is the result of tremendous execution and discipline in the part of our seasoned program managers. Because fixed-price contracts are such a large part of our mix, we have become industry best at executing fixed-price work. We may now then dial back our margins as we invest in and deliver growth, but strong fixed-price execution is an essential part of our DNA at achieving our long-term target of 16% to 17%. 
Beyond the financial results, I want to focus your attention on 3 key points: First, what we're seeing now validates the strategy and the operating model that we laid out just about a year ago. Second, our business development engine is humming, generating substantial new wins in a very competitive environment. And third, our talent management team is rapidly staffing our new wins to position us for sustainable growth.
So let me speak to each of these 3 points in more detail. Point number one. We are really hitting our stride as a new company. Our second quarter results demonstrate the promise of CSRA as we pivot towards growth and continue to deliver industry-leading profitability. It's now been a year since we got together for our Analyst Day in New York, and we'll celebrate a year as a publicly traded company in December. A lot has happened over that time, and we've had many successes and a few challenges. Still, I see the last year as validating our strategy and our operating model.
Let me start at the beginning with our customers. Our employees remain committed to customer success, and customer satisfaction remains high. Passion for mission is a shared value for all our employees, and it is central to all that we do. While revenue has occasionally been a challenge with greater headwinds than we expected from our legacy book of business, our BD engine is now firing on all cylinders. And we have proven that we can be the trenched competitors on both technical innovation and cost efficiency. Our focus on next-generation thinking and robust two-way partnerships with leading technology vendors is spurring new business wins that will drive growth. 
For example, on the last call, I referenced our first Emerging Technology Partner Day [ph] that we hosted over the summer. We already have built an offering around Perspica, an especially exciting technology partner whose product provides visibility throughout the entire application infrastructure stack to deliver past, present and, most importantly, predictive analytics. We see tremendous applicability throughout the Department of Homeland Security for this offering and using our DC1 contract to deliver. We held our second Emerging Technology Partner Day [ph] last week, and I look forward to more success in working with new and innovative players to bring the best technology to bear to help our customers' missions. 
Now we've come together rapidly, which has accelerated the development of new culture and an operating model that has generated tremendous cost savings and made us more competitive in the marketplace. We outlined a synergy case and then doubled the savings in half the time. We are still maturing our processes, but our commitment to cost discipline and innovative solutions are hallmarks that you can depend on from us. 
Point number 2. The business development results for the quarter were just outstanding. We posted our seventh straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. Our government customers accelerated awards at the end of their fiscal year, and we posted $2.4 billion in bookings for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.9x. Over the past year, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.3. As impressive as the reported business development numbers are, they understate just how good a quarter it was. 63% of the bookings in the quarter were for new business as opposed to recompetes, and our win rate of new business was 40%, which is well above our target rate of 25%. Moreover, we have a $744 million award in the quarter, most of which was new business for CSRA that was subsequently protested. Now the contracting organization for this award has 100% success rate defending its original decision against protests, so we're confident that we will ultimately prevail. If we had included that award in the second quarter bookings, our total bookings would have been $3.2 billion for a book-to-bill ratio of 2.5x, including $2.3 billion in new business. This is more than double the target of $1 billion in new awards each quarter even as we are still ramping up our submit volume.
Our investments in business development and our focus on next-generation solutions are paying off. Our new business wins position us well to return to organic growth in fiscal year 2018. The second quarter marked the moment where we saw the full benefits of our merger and integration. For the first time, the new business awards were primarily the result of combined CSRA bids. George Batsakis and his BD team are truly industry's best, and we believe we can win anything we go after. The awards reflected broad-based success across the entire portfolio, with 6 awards north of $100 million in total contract value. We had significant new awards in each of our 4 groups and both in mission and in IT. The common theme throughout is delivering innovative and efficient technology solutions to our customers' most pressing needs.
Let me highlight just a few of the major wins in the quarter to give you a sense of what I mean. First, our largest award was a 5-year $503 million blanket purchase agreement to provide background checks for the Office of Personnel Management. Gil Dussek and his team will manage the program for us, and they were instrumental in the vision of how to win and then execute this work by introducing new partners and new technology into a workflow to significantly increase efficiency and improve quality. We performed background investigations across all 4 of our groups and see screening and vetting as a strong potential growth vector for us and a process that's just screaming for next-generation data analytics.
Second, John Marshall led the takeaway of $114 million cyber program to develop and deploy a network security strategy to protect the offices throughout the Pentagon. CSRA will also work with the U.S. Cyber Command to provide situational awareness of potential network threats. This program is a tremendous calling card of our deep and significant cyber capabilities. 
Third, Tasha Wilson-Daley leads a team that won a $116 million contract to modernize the IT systems of the Office of Justice Programs within the Department of Justice. This is a key component of our growth strategy, helping existing enterprise IT customers realize their digital future and, in this case, through cloud migration, agile application development and real focus on mobile application development and leveraged shared services.
Fourth, Egan Dunmish [ph] led the successful capture of the $73 million contract to manage a portfolio of cloud computing services across the Department of Veteran Affairs. This is one of a number of cloud wins in the quarter with many more pending and in discussion. Here's a prime example of where we're leveraging our first-hand experience of transitioning our own data [ph] to the cloud in building decades of systems integration and expertise to be the go-to cloud provider for the public sector. 
And fifth, we won a $45 million 3-year contract to advise the U.S. Customs and Border Protection on effective and efficient methods to detect and prevent unlawful travel and trade. Alfonso Delucio [ph] will head up a collaborative team of systems engineers and logisticians to identify and deploy intuitive, leading-edge technology to secure and protect our borders.
On top of these Q2 wins, we continue to see significant opportunities to take market share. Across the company, we submitted $4.9 billion of proposals for new business in the second quarter, and we're on a pace to achieve our FY '17 target of $16 billion in new bids. At the end of the quarter, we had $12 billion in submits outstanding. And looking only at new business, we had about $6.4 billion awaiting decision, including 18 opportunities each greater than $100 million in total value. 
Our third quarter should be another strong quarter for awards. As I said, the $744 million award that was protested should be resolved, and we have more than $3 billion in additional new business award decisions expected in the quarter. This kind of momentum is keeping morale high both on the BD team and really at every level across the company, which brings me to make third key point, talent. 
In the second quarter, we had record new hires of about 1,300 employees, another 500 who accepted with future start dates, and we still have about 1,000 more funded openings. The acceptance rate and offers extended is about 90%. Our new wins are creating a demand for new talent, and we're having great success bringing in people who are attracted to the combination of deep mission expertise with a focus on next-generation thinking around IT and a culture that builds around core principles like best idea wins where we work across barriers, we work across domains, and we work across hierarchies to find the best idea to solve any problem. Importantly, many of those new hires were in our Integrated Technology Center in Bossier City, Louisiana. And next week, our team will be at the formal ribbon-cutting ceremony. As we build up staff and capability at the state-of-the-art IT delivery and data center, we're breeding great jobs to Louisiana, developing more efficient and effective solutions for our customers and providing a great work environment for our team. The key driver for ITC growth in this quarter was our Enterprise Service Operations center win for the Defense Intelligence Agency. Under $167 million contract, Kelly Miller [ph] is leading a team that manages self-help knowledge portals and provides remote service desk resolution and infield customer engagement supporting the intelligence customers globally. This program is a future platform for next-generation software-as-a-service offering to a broad set of customers, and it's just a wonderful platform for the company. And we're going to keep this momentum up at the ITC with $150 million third quarter new business award that will implement shared services and partner with service now for the Department of Commerce.
Finally, early this morning, our nation elected Donald Trump as our next President. With congratulations from President Obama and Secretary Clinton, we celebrate the peaceful transfer of power and a quick move to the governance of the nation. The prevailing message has been one of change, and we now will see how broad that change can be. President-elect Trump has spoken in favor of easing sequestration, enhancing infrastructure and defense spending and taking care of veterans, all areas of strength for us. Also, as the largest IT provider to DHS, we expect to benefit from a focus on delivering mission success to that department. We will continue to navigate the complexities of government well and the demand for information technology, and technology-enabled mission services is going to remain strong.
Now Dave will provide more detail on the financial results and our forward outlook."

I'm pleased to report that the second quarter results were ahead of our expectations on almost all measures.

I'm pleased to report that the second quarter results were ahead of our expectations on almost all measures. The results are also fairly straightforward as GAAP and adjusted results are steadily coming into closer alignment as we approach the 1-year mark post merger.
Turning to Slide 5. Revenue for the quarter was $1.26 billion, up 1% sequentially and down 4% from pro forma revenue in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. The sequential growth was the result of a lot of hard work across the team, and I see it as an early indicator that we're turning the corner on revenue.
Quarterly revenue and profitability benefited from some pull-forward of program deliveries that were expected in the third and fourth quarters across both segments. These accelerated deliveries drove the sequential increases in revenue and EPS when we had expected a slight decline in both. Our contract mix also improved slightly. As a percentage of total revenue, 46% was on fixed-price contracts, 20% on time and material contracts and 34% on cost-plus contracts. We see contract trends continuing to support our attractive business mix. 
As a result of strong contract performance and merger synergies, profitability and earnings were excellent. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $229 million, up 5% sequentially and down 3% from the same period a year ago with a record EBITDA margin of 18.1%. Similarly, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.56, up 10% from last quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was up 6% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. 
In the second quarters of FY '16 and now FY '17, we executed our programs with outstanding efficiency, leading to a higher volume of contract EAC improvements and other pickups than usual and driving a quarterly spike in EBITDA margins. 
In addition, our aggressive execution of the merger synergy case has laid the foundation for the FY '17 results. We've been able to accelerate and amplify the savings based on the phenomenal efforts of the finance team and really the entire company. 
Over the next few quarters, we expect our EBITDA margin to decline from the Q2 level toward our FY '17 guidance in the low to mid -- in the low to mid-17% range. Our longer-term guidance range of 16% to 17%, which would still lead our peer group, remains appropriate as we pivot toward top line growth. 
I'll walk through a few of the income drivers with a focus on what's changed from last quarter. Pretax merger and integration costs, which are GAAP expenses but excluded from adjusted EBITDA, were $8 million or about half of what they were last quarter. These expenses will continue to decline over the next few quarters. Below EBITDA, depreciation and amortization, excluding the intangibles amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog, was $47 million or $2 million less than last quarter. Interest expense was $29 million in the quarter, down about $1 million from last quarter as we continue to take down our debt. Our effective tax rate was around 36%, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter but down 3 percentage points from the year-ago quarter.
Finally, pension-related income was $24 million, so no change there, but we always want to be clear about the noncash contribution to adjusted EBITDA and EPS.
Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $55 million, which was lower than expected. Days sales outstanding were 57 days as of the quarter end, an increase of 3 days sequentially. DSO typically improves in the final quarter of the government's fiscal year, but we didn't experience the usual volume of early payments this year. Cash flow was also affected by onetime payments and timing items. For example, we made tax payments of $45 million in the quarter compared to about $2 million in the first quarter. We also made a $25 million payment to another contractor pursuant to a divestiture agreement executed in 2013. When the government reimburses that contractor, they'll pass along the payment to us, and we expect that reimbursement to occur this fiscal year. This advanced payment was a one-off transaction, and there's nothing similar remaining on our books. 
In addition, second quarter capital expenditures were higher than usual due to the timing of customer requirements. And approximately $20 million of our Q2 CapEx was noncash in nature, related to the accounting treatment of training equipment deployed on one of our large programs. As a result, free cash flow during the quarter was $8 million. Direct project capital expenditures should normalize in the second half of FY '17.
We followed our balanced capital allocation program in Q2, deploying $50 million to pay down debt and $24 million to return to shareholders, $16 million in dividends and $8 million in share repurchases. We spent another $5 million on share buybacks in early October for a total of about 0.5 million shares in late Q2 and early Q3. $337 million now remains on our current share repurchase authorization. 
As of September 30, 2016, we had $68 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen as we pay down debt and grow EBITDA. Since going public, we've now paid down about $320 million in debt and have improved to about 3x net debt to EBITDA. We prioritize debt paydown to create flexibility and to enable our balance sheet to be a strategic asset going forward.
Now on to the forward outlook. We're maintaining our guidance as shown on Slide 7. We continue to project fiscal year 2017 revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $870 million and $905 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.91 and $2.04 and free cash flow between $300 million and $350 million.
Let me now address our visibility into the rest of FY '17 and early signs of what to expect in FY '18. Annualizing revenue for the first half remains near the low end of our FY '17 range. On our last call, I talked about needing to generate about $150 million of revenue from new business to reach the bottom of the revenue range. With our strong awards in the second quarter, we've taken care of most of that figure. In fact, the awards made in the quarter should generate more than $400 million in incremental revenue on an annual basis. But our 2 largest awards in the quarter aren't expected to generate revenue until December or later. The OPM contract requires us to build capability and then process investigations before significant revenue is recognized. And resolution of the protest on our $744 million army win isn't expected until the end of the third quarter. So while we've increased our confidence in driving organic growth in 2018, we still have greater visibility into the lower end of this year's revenue range than the top. But on the bottom line through the first half of the year, we're tracking towards the high side of our EPS guidance range. 
There are 3 other P&L items that we should discuss even though they won't have a material impact on our adjusted EBITDA or EPS this year: First, the term loan markets have improved since our spin-merger transaction, so we're in the process of repricing a reduction in the spread on our Term Loan B effective at the end of November when the soft-call provision expires at the 1-year anniversary of our loans. We also expect to repay a portion of our Term Loan B outstanding balance by upsizing the current Term Loan A. This transfer of debt would reduce our effective interest rate, and we also expect to extend the maturities of all loans by 1 year and amend certain terms and conditions of the credit agreement in our favor. The noncash accelerated amortization charges associated with this amend-and-extend transaction would increase our GAAP interest expense in Q3. But consistent with industry practice, we'd exclude this onetime charge from our adjusted earnings figures. Going forward, the repricing should reduce our cash interest expense by around $5 million per year, and the extended loan  duration and amended terms provide us with outstanding flexibility in executing our strategy. 
Second, for the last few quarters, we've incurred $16 million of intangibles amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog. Going forward, GAAP intangibles expense will decline with only 2 months of backlog-related amortization in the third quarter figure and none thereafter. This has no impact on our guidance, but as we've noted previously, it will impact our GAAP EPS.
And third, this fall, we've offered to buy out certain groups in our frozen pension program. The offer has just recently closed so we don't have a final tally, but we will shrink both the assets and the obligations of the pension program. This will necessitate a mark-to-market adjustment in our third quarter in addition to the usual fourth quarter adjustment. It's too soon to tell the direction or magnitude of the mark-to-market adjustments or any changes to recurring pension income, but the recent mortality table update should be favorable. Remember that the mark-to-market adjustments are in GAAP EBITDA and GAAP EPS but not in the adjusted EBITDA or EPS that we guide to and that none of these changes impact cash flow. We do expect free cash flow to rebound and to end the year within the guidance range. 
With higher holiday leave-taking from our employees and our government customers in the December quarter, we expect Q3 revenue, EBITDA and EPS to decline slightly, consistent with our experience last year when pro forma revenue declined approximately $50 million sequentially. Seasonal improvements in growth for many of the large Q2 and Q3 wins should drive a meaningful sequential improvement in Q4. This would imply that we're closer to organic growth in the fourth quarter and that we enter FY '18 with strong momentum and an opportunity for top line growth to reach the range of our long-term model of 2% to 3%.
In summary, we continue to deliver industry-leading profitability, and we can see growth on the horizon based on outstanding business development momentum.
With that, operator, we're now ready to take questions."

I mean, I'm of the belief that most of our federal government customers first look to a hybrid capability where they have an on-prem instantiation within their 4 walls and may look to another private cloud where there's good insight as to where the data at rest is. We do have some aggressive customers on the FEDSIM side just pushing work packages right out to Azure or Amazon, and that's the future you've got to recognize and embrace. And yes, you could cannibalize some of your own work. The classic model is where we're using remedy inside a facility with lots of people, and we kick it out to service now with software-as-a-service and get phenomenal improvements in labor savings. That provides a much lower cost to our federal government customer, but it allows you to price it competitively and guard your margins. So we'll always opt for leveraged services with automation to guard our margins, and at times, we'll put some of our own cannibalized revenue at risk. But you can see we're pretty passionate about that model. We think it is the future, and you've got to rush to it as opposed to avoid it."

And with the transition period, it's moving from being an FY '18 event for us to being an FY '19 event. I also think the context is important that you've seen some debate and discussion of whether or not you separate the leadership of NSA from Cyber Command and then whether or not you have a civilian leader at the helm at NSA. And when you think of the work that President-elect Trump wants to do with the review of all the cyber defense and vulnerabilities, he's going to look at joint task forces that walk across federal state local government. He absolutely wants to look at enhancing Cyber Command, and then he's spoken at length about improving offensive capabilities, really focused on deterrents. So I think that when you think of GES [ph] as well as risk 1 [ph] and risk 2 [ph] as kind of the fabric to underpin that sort of an assessment, there may be additional delays as they reset, but we'll take it in stride and continue to perform."

So it's our first and, frankly, our best information to date in terms of validity of data to project what the long-term win rate of the combined company will be but far too early to say 25% is understated and it'll be closer to the Q2 40% rate.

We're a few quarters into life as an independent public company, and in each of those quarters, we've talked about the solid execution on fixed-price program. So we're still settling in and figuring out exactly what a typical quarter looks like in terms of EAC improvements. This quarter was a few million higher than we were expecting it would be entering the quarter in terms of EAC benefits and a few million higher than the first quarter was as you'll see in the 10-Q that we file overnight tonight. Big picture, though, every quarter will look a little bit different in terms of fixed-price program performance, and we'll continue to try to drive outstanding delivery on every one of those programs. As Larry mentioned in his earlier comments, fixed-price program execution is really a hallmark of a company at this point and will continue to drive for outsized performance every quarter. Gross margins and then the overall 18.1% EBITDA margin, though, are not what we are projecting over any future period. They were particularly strong in this quarter. To the second point on -- of your question about what was pulled forward in revenue from Q3 and Q4, we had projected going into the quarter on our last call that our numbers would be down slightly in the top line from Q1 to Q2. Instead, they were up about $10 million in revenue. If you were to think of having projected down $10 million or $20 million, consistent with consensus and delivered $10 million of upside instead, that $20 million or $30 million is not an unreasonable kind of volume to associate with what was pulled forward from Q3 and Q4 into Q2."

We talked about needing $150 million or about 3% of our revenue guidance to get to the low end of guidance this time last quarter. And on my scripted comments, we didn't exactly say that we had filled that entire bucket but that we'd filled most of it. So think of us as being in that last 1% of the 3% we needed this time last quarter. Exactly what the Q3 and Q4 revenue results are will depend on a few factors. One, the ongoing pace of new business award activity and our success on recompetes. Certainly, we're pleased with Q2 and, as we mentioned, a couple of wins in early Q3. The right kinds of momentum are in place, but we need to continue to win new business to continue to fill the rest of the less than 1% gap to get to the low end of guidance and then to fill into the guidance range. Second, the continuing resolution has an effect on certain programs across the business and can influence our customers' thoughts on things like whether this is the right couple of months to do a direct material purchase or to engage in a surge in labor support. Across a couple of thousand programs, you can imagine that 1 million here and 1 million there add up. And the exact timing of the resolution of the CR and what the new administration's priorities look like as they take place over the winter months will also have an effect, particularly as we enter Q4. So that combination of factors is what continues to influence our thinking every day. We think we've still got the right guidance range, and we're pleased with the business development progress of the last few months."

It's our best quarter yet since going public, and we're pretty excited about it. Revenue, EBITDA and EPS were all above both our forecast and the consensus estimates. Kudos to all of our program managers who were able to accelerate mission delivery for our customers and drive excellent performance.
This performance shows up in sequential revenue and EBITDA growth and in the especially strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 8.1%, which helped drive adjusted EPS growth of 10% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Our Q2 EBITDA margins were well above our long-term target of 16% to 17%. Our aggressive execution on the synergy case has built a strong foundation, but achieving these levels is the result of tremendous execution and discipline on the part of our seasoned program managers. Because fixed-price contracts are such a large part of our mix, we have become industry best at executing fixed-price work. We may now and then dial back our margins as we invest in and deliver growth, but strong fixed-price execution is an essential part of our DNA and achieving our long-term target of 16% to 17%. 
Beyond the financial results, I want to focus your attention on three key points: First, what we're seeing now validates the strategy and the operating model that we laid out just about a year ago; second, our business development engine is humming, generating substantial new wins in a very competitive environment; and third, our talent management team is rapidly staffing our new wins to position us for sustainable growth.
So let me speak to each of these 3 points in more detail. Point number one. We are really hitting our stride as a new company. Our second quarter results demonstrate the promise of CSRA as we pivot towards growth and continue to deliver industry-leading profitability. It's now been a year since we got together for our Analyst Day in New York, and we'll celebrate a year as a publicly traded company in December. A lot has happened over that time, and we've had many successes and a few challenges. Still, I see the last year as validating our strategy and our operating model.
Let me start at the beginning with our customers. Our employees remain committed to customer success, and customer satisfaction remains high. Passion for mission is a shared value for all our employees, and it is central to all that we do. While revenue has occasionally been a challenge with greater headwinds than we expected from our legacy book of business, our BD engine is now firing on all cylinders. And we have proven that we can beat entrenched competitors on both technical innovation and cost efficiency. Our focus on next-generation thinking and robust two-way partnerships with leading technology vendors is spurring new business wins that will drive growth. 
For example, on the last call, I referenced our first Emerging Technology Partner Day [ph] that we hosted over the summer. We already have built an offering around Perspica, an especially exciting technology partner whose product provides visibility throughout the entire application infrastructure stack to deliver past, present and, most importantly, predictive analytics. We see tremendous applicability throughout the Department of Homeland Security for this offering and using our DC1 contract to deliver. We held our second Emerging Technology Partner Day [ph] last week, and I look forward to more success in working with new and innovative players to bring the best technology to bear to help our customers' missions. 
Now we've come together rapidly, which has accelerated the development of a new culture and an operating model that has generated tremendous cost savings and made us more competitive in the marketplace. We outlined a synergy case and then doubled the savings in half the time. We are still maturing our processes, but our commitment to cost discipline and innovative solutions are hallmarks that you can depend on from us. 
Point number 2. The business development results for the quarter were just outstanding. We posted our seventh straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. Our government customers accelerated awards at the end of their fiscal year, and we posted $2.4 billion in bookings for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.9x. Over the past year, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.3. As impressive as the reported business development numbers are, they understate just how good a quarter it was. 63% of the bookings in the quarter were for new business as opposed to recompetes, and our win rate on new business was 40%, which is well above our target rate of 25%. Moreover, we have a $744 million award in the quarter, most of which was new business for CSRA that was subsequently protested. Now the contracting organization for this award has 100% success rate defending its original decisions against protests, so we're confident that we will ultimately prevail. If we had included that award in the second quarter bookings, our total bookings would have been $3.2 billion for a book-to-bill ratio of 2.5x, including $2.3 billion in new business. This is more than double the target of $1 billion in new awards each quarter even as we are still ramping up our submit volume.
Our investments in business development and our focus on next-generation solutions are paying off. Our new business wins position us well to return to organic growth in fiscal year 2018. The second quarter marked the moment where we saw the full benefits of our merger and integration. For the first time, the new business awards were primarily the result of combined CSRA bids. George Batsakis and his BD team are truly industry's best, and we believe we can win anything we go after. The awards reflected broad-based success across the entire portfolio, with 6 awards north of $100 million in total contract value. We had significant new awards in each of our 4 groups and both in mission and in IT. The common theme throughout is delivering innovative and efficient technology solutions to our customers' most pressing needs.
Let me highlight just a few of the major wins in the quarter to give you a sense of what I mean. First, our largest award was a 5-year $503 million blanket purchase agreement to provide background checks for the Office of Personnel Management. Gil Dussek and his team will manage the program for us, and they were instrumental in the vision of how to win and then execute this work by introducing new partners and new technology into a workflow to significantly increase efficiency and improve quality. We performed background investigations across all 4 of our groups and see screening and vetting as a strong potential growth vector for us and a process that's just screaming for next-generation data analytics.
Second, John Marshall led the takeaway of $114 million cyber program to develop and deploy a network security strategy to protect the offices throughout the Pentagon. CSRA will also work with the U.S. Cyber Command to provide situational awareness of potential network threats. This program is a tremendous calling card of our deep and significant cyber capabilities. 
Third, Tasha Wilson-Daley leads a team that won a $116 million contract to modernize the IT systems of the Office of Justice Programs within the Department of Justice. This is a key component of our growth strategy, helping existing enterprise IT customers realize their digital future and, in this case, through cloud migration, agile application development, a real focus on mobile application development and leveraged shared services.
Fourth, Egan Donmiez [ph] led the successful capture of the $73 million contract to manage a portfolio of cloud computing services across the Department of Veteran Affairs. This is one of a number of cloud wins in the quarter with many more pending and in discussion. Here's a prime example of where we're leveraging our first-hand experience of transitioning our own data to the cloud in building decades of systems integration and expertise to be the go-to cloud provider for the public sector. 
And fifth, we won a $45 million 3-year contract to advise the U.S. Customs and Border Protection on effective and efficient methods to detect and prevent unlawful travel and trade. Alfonso Delucio [ph] will head up a collaborative team of systems engineers and logisticians to identify and deploy intuitive, leading-edge technology to secure and protect our borders.
On top of these Q2 wins, we continue to see significant opportunities to take market share. Across the company, we submitted $4.9 billion of proposals for new business in the second quarter, and we're on a pace to achieve our FY '17 target of $16 billion in new bids. At the end of the quarter, we had $12 billion in submits outstanding. And looking only at new business, we had about $6.4 billion awaiting decision, including 18 opportunities each greater than $100 million in total value. 
Our third quarter should be another strong quarter for awards. As I said, the $744 million award that was protested should be resolved, and we have more than $3 billion in additional new business award decisions expected in the quarter. This kind of momentum is keeping morale high both on the BD team and really at every level across the company, which brings me to my third key point, talent. 
In the second quarter, we had record new hires of about 1,300 employees, another 500 who accepted with future start dates, and we still have about 1,000 more funded openings. The acceptance rate on offers extended is about 90%. Our new wins are creating a demand for new talent, and we're having great success bringing in people who are attracted to the combination of deep mission expertise with a focus on next-generation thinking around IT and a culture that builds around core principles like best idea wins where we work across barriers, we work across domains, and we work across hierarchies to find the best idea to solve any problem. Importantly, many of those new hires were in our Integrated Technology Center in Bossier City, Louisiana. And next week, our team will be at the formal ribbon-cutting ceremony. As we build up staff and capability at the state-of-the-art IT delivery and data center, we're bringing great jobs to Louisiana, developing more efficient and effective solutions for our customers and providing a great work environment for our team. The key driver for ITC growth in this quarter was our Enterprise Service Operations center win for the Defense Intelligence Agency. Under $167 million contract, Kelly Miller [ph] is leading a team that manages self-help knowledge portals and provides remote service desk resolution and infield customer engagement supporting the intelligence customers globally. This program is a future platform for next-generation software-as-a-service offering to a broad set of customers, and it's just a wonderful platform for the company. And we're going to keep this momentum up at the ITC with $150 million third quarter new business award that will implement shared services and partner with service now for the Department of Commerce.
Finally, early this morning, our nation elected Donald Trump as our next President. With congratulations from President Obama and Secretary Clinton, we celebrate the peaceful transfer of power and the quick move to the governance of the nation. The prevailing message has been one of change, and we now will see how broad that change can be. President-elect Trump has spoken in favor of easing sequestration, enhancing infrastructure and defense spending and taking care of veterans, all areas of strength for us. Also, as the largest IT provider to DHS, we expect to benefit from a focus on delivering mission success to that department. We will continue to navigate the complexities of government well and the demand for information technology, and technology-enabled mission services is going to remain strong.
Now Dave will provide more detail on the financial results and our forward outlook."

I'm pleased to report that the second quarter results were ahead of our expectations on almost all measures. The results are also fairly straightforward as GAAP and adjusted results are steadily coming into closer alignment as we approach the 1-year mark post merger.
Turning to Slide 5. Revenue for the quarter was $1.26 billion, up 1% sequentially and down 4% from pro forma revenue in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. The sequential growth was the result of a lot of hard work across the team, and I see it as an early indicator that we're turning the corner on revenue.
Quarterly revenue and profitability benefited from some pull-forward of program deliveries that were expected in the third and fourth quarters across both segments. These accelerated deliveries drove the sequential increases in revenue and EPS when we had expected a slight decline in both. Our contract mix also improved slightly. As a percentage of total revenue, 46% was on fixed-price contracts, 20% on time and material contracts and 34% on cost-plus contracts. We see contract trends continuing to support our attractive business mix. 
As a result of strong contract performance and merger synergies, profitability and earnings were excellent. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $229 million, up 5% sequentially and down 3% from the same period a year ago with a record EBITDA margin of 18.1%. Similarly, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.56, up 10% from last quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was up 6% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. 
In the second quarters of FY '16 and now FY '17, we executed our programs with outstanding efficiency, leading to a higher volume of contract EAC improvements and other pickups than usual and driving a quarterly spike in EBITDA margins. 
In addition, our aggressive execution of the merger synergy case has laid the foundation for the FY '17 results. We've been able to accelerate and amplify the savings based on the phenomenal efforts of the finance team and really the entire company. 
Over the next few quarters, we expect our EBITDA margin to decline from the Q2 level toward our FY '17 guidance in the low to mid-17% range. Our longer-term guidance range of 16% to 17%, which would still lead our peer group, remains appropriate as we pivot toward top line growth. 
I'll walk through a few of the income drivers with a focus on what's changed from last quarter. Pretax merger and integration costs, which are GAAP expenses but excluded from adjusted EBITDA, were $8 million or about half of what they were last quarter. These expenses will continue to decline over the next few quarters. Below EBITDA, depreciation and amortization, excluding the intangibles amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog, was $47 million or $2 million less than last quarter. Interest expense was $29 million in the quarter, down about $1 million from last quarter as we continue to take down our debt. Our effective tax rate was around 36%, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter but down 3 percentage points from the year-ago quarter.
Finally, pension-related income was $24 million, so no change there, but we always want to be clear about the noncash contribution to adjusted EBITDA and EPS.
Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $55 million, which was lower than expected. Days sales outstanding were 57 days as of the quarter end, an increase of 3 days sequentially. DSO typically improves in the final quarter of the government's fiscal year, but we didn't experience the usual volume of early payments this year. Cash flow was also affected by onetime payments and timing items. For example, we made tax payments of $45 million in the quarter compared to about $2 million in the first quarter. We also made a $25 million payment to another contractor pursuant to a divestiture agreement executed in 2013. When the government reimburses that contractor, they'll pass along the payment to us, and we expect that reimbursement to occur this fiscal year. This advanced payment was a one-off transaction, and there's nothing similar remaining on our books. 
In addition, second quarter capital expenditures were higher than usual due to the timing of customer requirements. And approximately $20 million of our Q2 CapEx was noncash in nature, related to the accounting treatment of training equipment deployed on one of our large programs. As a result, free cash flow during the quarter was $8 million. Direct project capital expenditures should normalize in the second half of FY '17.
We followed our balanced capital allocation program in Q2, deploying $50 million to pay down debt and $24 million to return to shareholders, $16 million in dividends and $8 million in share repurchases. We spent another $5 million on share buybacks in early October for a total of about 0.5 million shares in late Q2 and early Q3. $337 million now remains on our current share repurchase authorization. 
As of September 30, 2016, we had $68 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen as we pay down debt and grow EBITDA. Since going public, we've now paid down about $320 million in debt and have improved to about 3x net debt to EBITDA. We prioritize debt pay down to create flexibility and to enable our balance sheet to be a strategic asset going forward.
Now on to the forward outlook. We're maintaining our guidance as shown on Slide 7. We continue to project fiscal year 2017 revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $870 million and $905 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.91 and $2.04 and free cash flow between $300 million and $350 million.
Let me now address our visibility into the rest of FY '17 and early signs of what to expect in FY '18. Annualizing revenue for the first half remains near the low end of our FY '17 range. On our last call, I talked about needing to generate about $150 million of revenue from new business to reach the bottom of the revenue range. With our strong awards in the second quarter, we've taken care of most of that figure. In fact, the awards made in the quarter should generate more than $400 million in incremental revenue on an annual basis. But our 2 largest awards in the quarter aren't expected to generate revenue until December or later. The OPM contract requires us to build capability and then process investigations before significant revenue is recognized. And resolution of the protest on our $744 million army win isn't expected until the end of the third quarter. So while we've increased our confidence in driving organic growth in 2018, we still have greater visibility into the lower end of this year's revenue range than the top. But on the bottom line through the first half of the year, we're tracking towards the high side of our EPS guidance range. 
There are three other P&L items that we should discuss even though they won't have a material impact on our adjusted EBITDA or EPS this year: First, the term loan markets have improved since our spin-merger transaction, so we're in the process of repricing a reduction in the spread on our Term Loan B, effective at the end of November when the soft-call provision expires at the 1-year anniversary of our loans. We also expect to repay a portion of our Term Loan B outstanding balance by upsizing the current Term Loan A. This transfer of debt would reduce our effective interest rate, and we also expect to extend the maturities of all loans by one year and amend certain terms and conditions of the credit agreement in our favor. The noncash accelerated amortization charges associated with this amend-and-extend transaction would increase our GAAP interest expense in Q3. But consistent with industry practice, we'd exclude this onetime charge from our adjusted earnings figures. Going forward, the repricing should reduce our cash interest expense by around $5 million per year, and the extended loan duration and amended terms provide us with outstanding flexibility in executing our strategy. 
Second, for the last few quarters, we've incurred $16 million of intangibles amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog. Going forward, GAAP intangibles expense will decline with only 2 months of backlog-related amortization in the third quarter figure and none thereafter. This has no impact on our guidance, but as we've noted previously, it will impact our GAAP EPS.
And third, this fall, we've offered to buy out certain groups in our frozen pension program. The offer has just recently closed so we don't have a final tally, but we will shrink both the assets and obligations of the pension program. This will necessitate a mark-to-market adjustment in our third quarter in addition to the usual fourth quarter adjustment. It's too soon to tell the direction or magnitude of the mark-to-market adjustments or any changes to recurring pension income, but the recent mortality table updates should be favorable. Remember that the mark-to-market adjustments are in GAAP EBITDA and GAAP EPS but not in the adjusted EBITDA or EPS that we guide to and that none of these changes impact cash flow. We do expect free cash flow to rebound and to end the year within the guidance range. 
With higher holiday leave-taking from our employees and our government customers in the December quarter, we expect Q3 revenue, EBITDA and EPS to decline slightly, consistent with our experience last year when pro forma revenue declined approximately $50 million sequentially. Seasonal improvements in growth for many of the large Q2 and Q3 wins should drive a meaningful sequential improvement in Q4. This would imply that we're closer to organic growth in the fourth quarter and that we enter FY '18 with strong momentum and an opportunity for top line growth to reach the range of our long-term model of 2% to 3%.
In summary, we continue to deliver industry-leading profitability, and we can see growth on the horizon based on outstanding business development momentum.
With that, operator, we're now ready to take questions."

It appears the adjudication of it is slipping from like late spring to late summer of next year. And with the transition period, it's moving from being an FY '18 event for us to being an FY '19 event. I also think the context is important that you've seen some debate and discussion of whether or not you separate the leadership of NSA from Cyber Command and then whether or not you have a civilian leader at the helm at NSA. And when you think of the work that President-elect Trump wants to do with the review of all the cyber defense and vulnerabilities, he's going to look at joint task forces that walk across federal state local government. He absolutely wants to look at enhancing Cyber Command, and then he's spoken at length about improving offensive capabilities, really focused on deterrence. So I think that when you think of GES [ph] as well as risk 1 [ph] and risk 2 [ph] as kind of the fabric to underpin that sort of an assessment, there may be additional delays as they reset, but we'll take it in stride and continue to perform."

So it's our first and, frankly, our best information to date in terms of validity of data to project what the long-term win rate of the combined company will be but far too early to say 25% is understated and it'll be closer to the Q2 40% rate.

We're a few quarters into life as an independent public company, and in each of those quarters, we've talked about the solid execution on fixed-price programs. So we're still settling in and figuring out exactly what a typical quarter looks like in terms of EAC improvements. This quarter was a few million higher than we were expecting it would be entering the quarter in terms of EAC benefits and a few million higher than the first quarter was as you'll see in the 10-Q that we file overnight tonight. Big picture, though, every quarter will look a little bit different in terms of fixed-price program performance, and we'll continue to try to drive outstanding delivery on every one of those programs. As Larry mentioned in his earlier comments, fixed-price program execution is really a hallmark of the company at this point and will continue to drive for outsized performance every quarter. Gross margins and then the overall 18.1% EBITDA margin, though, are not what we are projecting over any future period. They were particularly strong in this quarter. To the second point on -- of your question about what was pulled forward in revenue from Q3 and Q4, we had projected going into the quarter on our last call that our numbers would be down slightly in the top line from Q1 to Q2. Instead, they were up about $10 million in revenue. If you were to think of having projected down $10 million or $20 million, consistent with consensus and delivered $10 million of upside instead, that $20 million or $30 million is not an unreasonable kind of volume to associate with what was pulled forward from Q3 and Q4 into Q2."

We talked about needing $150 million or about 3% of our revenue guidance to get to the low end of guidance this time last quarter. And on my scripted comments, we didn't exactly say that we had filled that entire bucket but that we'd filled most of it. So think of us as being in that last 1% of the 3% we needed this time last quarter. Exactly what the Q3 and Q4 revenue results are will depend on a few factors. One, the ongoing pace of new business award activity and our success on recompetes. Certainly, we're pleased with Q2 and, as we mentioned, a couple of wins in early Q3. The right kinds of momentum are in place, but we need to continue to win new business to continue to fill the rest of the less than 1% gap to get to the low end of guidance and then to fill into the guidance range. Second, the continuing resolution has an effect on certain programs across the business and can influence our customers' thoughts on things like whether this is the right couple of months to do a direct material purchase or to engage in a surge in labor support. Across a couple of thousand programs, you can imagine that 1 million here and 1 million there add up. And the exact timing of the resolution of the CR and what the new administration's priorities look like as they take place over the winter months will also have an effect, particularly as we enter Q4. So that combination of factors is what continues to influence our thinking every day. We think we've still got the right guidance range, and we're pleased with the business development progress of the last few months."

It's our best quarter yet since going public, and we're pretty excited about it. Revenue, EBITDA and EPS were all above both our forecast and the consensus estimates. Kudos to all of our program managers who were able to accelerate mission delivery for our customers and drive excellent performance.
This performance shows up in sequential revenue and EBITDA growth and in the especially strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 8.1%, which helped drive adjusted EPS growth of 10% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Our Q2 EBITDA margins were well above our long-term target of 16% to 17%. Our aggressive execution on the synergy case has built a strong foundation, but achieving these levels is the result of tremendous execution and discipline on the part of our seasoned program managers. Because fixed-price contracts are such a large part of our mix, we have become industry best at executing fixed-price work. We may now and then dial back our margins as we invest in and deliver growth, but strong fixed-price execution is an essential part of our DNA and achieving our long-term target of 16% to 17%. 
Beyond the financial results, I want to focus your attention on 3 key points: First, what we're seeing now validates the strategy and the operating model that we laid out just about a year ago; second, our business development engine is humming, generating substantial new wins in a very competitive environment; and third, our talent management team is rapidly staffing our new wins to position us for sustainable growth.
So let me speak to each of these 3 points in more detail. Point number one. We are really hitting our stride as a new company. Our second quarter results demonstrate the promise of CSRA as we pivot towards growth and continue to deliver industry-leading profitability. It's now been a year since we got together for our Analyst Day in New York, and we'll celebrate a year as a publicly traded company in December. A lot has happened over that time, and we've had many successes and a few challenges. Still, I see the last year as validating our strategy and our operating model.
Let me start at the beginning with our customers. Our employees remain committed to customer success, and customer satisfaction remains high. Passion for mission is a shared value for all our employees, and it is central to all that we do. While revenue has occasionally been a challenge with greater headwinds than we expected from our legacy book of business, our BD engine is now firing on all cylinders. And we have proven that we can beat entrenched competitors on both technical innovation and cost efficiency. Our focus on next-generation thinking and robust 2-way partnerships with leading technology vendors is spurring new business wins that will drive growth. 
For example, on the last call, I referenced our first Emerging Technology Partner Day [ph] that we hosted over the summer. We already have built an offering around Perspica, an especially exciting technology partner whose product provides visibility throughout the entire application infrastructure stack to deliver past, present and, most importantly, predictive analytics. We see tremendous applicability throughout the Department of Homeland Security for this offering and using our DC1 contract to deliver. We held our second Emerging Technology Partner Day [ph] last week, and I look forward to more success in working with new and innovative players to bring the best technology to bear to help our customers' missions. 
Now we've come together rapidly, which has accelerated the development of a new culture and an operating model that has generated tremendous cost savings and made us more competitive in the marketplace. We outlined a synergy case and then doubled the savings in half the time. We are still maturing our processes, but our commitment to cost discipline and innovative solutions are hallmarks that you can depend on from us. 
Point number 2. The business development results for the quarter were just outstanding. We posted our seventh straight quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 or greater. Our government customers accelerated awards at the end of their fiscal year, and we posted $2.4 billion in bookings for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.9x. Over the past year, our book-to-bill ratio was 1.3. As impressive as the reported business development numbers are, they understate just how good a quarter it was. 63% of the bookings in the quarter were for new business as opposed to recompetes, and our win rate on new business was 40%, which is well above our target rate of 25%. Moreover, we have a $744 million award in the quarter, most of which was new business for CSRA that was subsequently protested. Now the contracting organization for this award has 100% success rate defending its original decisions against protests, so we're confident that we will ultimately prevail. If we had included that award in the second quarter bookings, our total bookings would have been $3.2 billion for a book-to-bill ratio of 2.5x, including $2.3 billion in new business. This is more than double the target of $1 billion in new awards each quarter even as we are still ramping up our submit volume.
Our investments in business development and our focus on next-generation solutions are paying off. Our new business wins position us well to return to organic growth in fiscal year 2018. The second quarter marked the moment where we saw the full benefits of our merger and integration. For the first time, the new business awards were primarily the result of combined CSRA bids. George Batsakis and his BD team are truly industry's best, and we believe we can win anything we go after. The awards reflected broad-based success across the entire portfolio, with 6 awards north of $100 million in total contract value. We had significant new awards in each of our 4 groups and both in mission and in IT. The common theme throughout is delivering innovative and efficient technology solutions to our customers' most pressing needs.
Let me highlight just a few of the major wins in the quarter to give you a sense of what I mean. First, our largest award was a 5-year $503 million blanket purchase agreement to provide background checks for the Office of Personnel Management. Gil Dussek and his team will manage the program for us, and they were instrumental in the vision of how to win and then execute this work by introducing new partners and new technology into a workflow to significantly increase efficiency and improve quality. We performed background investigations across all 4 of our groups and see screening and vetting as a strong potential growth vector for us and a process that's just screaming for next-generation data analytics.
Second, John Marshall led the takeaway of $114 million cyber program to develop and deploy a network security strategy to protect the offices throughout the Pentagon. CSRA will also work with the U.S. Cyber Command to provide situational awareness of potential network threats. This program is a tremendous calling card of our deep and significant cyber capabilities. 
Third, Tasha Wilson-Daley leads a team that won a $116 million contract to modernize the IT systems of the Office of Justice Programs within the Department of Justice. This is a key component of our growth strategy, helping existing enterprise IT customers realize their digital future and, in this case, through cloud migration, agile application development, a real focus on mobile application development and leveraged shared services.
Fourth, Egan Donmiez [ph] led the successful capture of the $73 million contract to manage a portfolio of cloud computing services across the Department of Veteran Affairs. This is one of a number of cloud wins in the quarter with many more pending and in discussion. Here's a prime example of where we're leveraging our first-hand experience of transitioning our own data to the cloud in building decades of systems integration and expertise to be the go-to cloud provider for the public sector. 
And fifth, we won a $45 million 3-year contract to advise the U.S. Customs and Border Protection on effective and efficient methods to detect and prevent unlawful travel and trade. Alfonso Delucio [ph] will head up a collaborative team of systems engineers and logisticians to identify and deploy intuitive, leading-edge technology to secure and protect our borders.
On top of these Q2 wins, we continue to see significant opportunities to take market share. Across the company, we submitted $4.9 billion of proposals for new business in the second quarter, and we're on a pace to achieve our FY '17 target of $16 billion in new bids. At the end of the quarter, we had $12 billion in submits outstanding. And looking only at new business, we had about $6.4 billion awaiting decision, including 18 opportunities each greater than $100 million in total value. 
Our third quarter should be another strong quarter for awards. As I said, the $744 million award that was protested should be resolved, and we have more than $3 billion in additional new business award decisions expected in the quarter. This kind of momentum is keeping morale high both on the BD team and really at every level across the company, which brings me to my third key point, talent. 
In the second quarter, we had record new hires of about 1,300 employees, another 500 who accepted with future start dates, and we still have about 1,000 more funded openings. The acceptance rate on offers extended is about 90%. Our new wins are creating a demand for new talent, and we're having great success bringing in people who are attracted to the combination of deep mission expertise with a focus on next-generation thinking around IT and a culture that builds around core principles like best idea wins where we work across barriers, we work across domains, and we work across hierarchies to find the best idea to solve any problem. Importantly, many of those new hires were in our Integrated Technology Center in Bossier City, Louisiana. And next week, our team will be at the formal ribbon-cutting ceremony. As we build up staff and capability at the state-of-the-art IT delivery and data center, we're bringing great jobs to Louisiana, developing more efficient and effective solutions for our customers and providing a great work environment for our team. The key driver for ITC growth in this quarter was our Enterprise Service Operations center win for the Defense Intelligence Agency. Under $167 million contract, Kelly Miller [ph] is leading a team that manages self-help knowledge portals and provides remote service desk resolution and infield customer engagement supporting the intelligence customers globally. This program is a future platform for next-generation software-as-a-service offering to a broad set of customers, and it's just a wonderful platform for the company. And we're going to keep this momentum up at the ITC with $150 million third quarter new business award that will implement shared services and partner with service now for the Department of Commerce.
Finally, early this morning, our nation elected Donald Trump as our next President. With congratulations from President Obama and Secretary Clinton, we celebrate the peaceful transfer of power and the quick move to the governance of the nation. The prevailing message has been one of change, and we now will see how broad that change can be. President-elect Trump has spoken in favor of easing sequestration, enhancing infrastructure and defense spending and taking care of veterans, all areas of strength for us. Also, as the largest IT provider to DHS, we expect to benefit from a focus on delivering mission success to that department. We will continue to navigate the complexities of government well and the demand for information technology, and technology-enabled mission services is going to remain strong.
Now Dave will provide more detail on the financial results and our forward outlook."
301669938,404325441,1083548,"CSRA Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 09, 2016",2016-11-09,"Earnings Calls","CSRA Inc.","Executives","Okay. Thanks, Larry, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to report that the second quarter results were ahead of our expectations on almost all measures.

I'm pleased to report that the second quarter results were ahead of our expectations on almost all measures. The results are also fairly straightforward as GAAP and adjusted results are steadily coming into closer alignment as we approach the 1-year mark post merger.
Turning to Slide 5. Revenue for the quarter was $1.26 billion, up 1% sequentially and down 4% from pro forma revenue in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. The sequential growth was the result of a lot of hard work across the team, and I see it as an early indicator that we're turning the corner on revenue.
Quarterly revenue and profitability benefited from some pull-forward of program deliveries that were expected in the third and fourth quarters across both segments. These accelerated deliveries drove the sequential increases in revenue and EPS when we had expected a slight decline in both. Our contract mix also improved slightly. As a percentage of total revenue, 46% was on fixed-price contracts, 20% on time and material contracts and 34% on cost-plus contracts. We see contract trends continuing to support our attractive business mix. 
As a result of strong contract performance and merger synergies, profitability and earnings were excellent. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $229 million, up 5% sequentially and down 3% from the same period a year ago with a record EBITDA margin of 18.1%. Similarly, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.56, up 10% from last quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS was up 6% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. 
In the second quarters of FY '16 and now FY '17, we executed our programs with outstanding efficiency, leading to a higher volume of contract EAC improvements and other pickups than usual and driving a quarterly spike in EBITDA margins. 
In addition, our aggressive execution of the merger synergy case has laid the foundation for the FY '17 results. We've been able to accelerate and amplify the savings based on the phenomenal efforts of the finance team and really the entire company. 
Over the next few quarters, we expect our EBITDA margin to decline from the Q2 level toward our FY '17 guidance in the low to mid-17% range. Our longer-term guidance range of 16% to 17%, which would still lead our peer group, remains appropriate as we pivot toward top line growth. 
I'll walk through a few of the income drivers with a focus on what's changed from last quarter. Pretax merger and integration costs, which are GAAP expenses but excluded from adjusted EBITDA, were $8 million or about half of what they were last quarter. These expenses will continue to decline over the next few quarters. Below EBITDA, depreciation and amortization, excluding the intangibles amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog, was $47 million or $2 million less than last quarter. Interest expense was $29 million in the quarter, down about $1 million from last quarter as we continue to take down our debt. Our effective tax rate was around 36%, essentially unchanged from the prior quarter but down 3 percentage points from the year-ago quarter.
Finally, pension-related income was $24 million, so no change there, but we always want to be clear about the noncash contribution to adjusted EBITDA and EPS.
Now turning to Slide 6. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $55 million, which was lower than expected. Days sales outstanding were 57 days as of the quarter end, an increase of 3 days sequentially. DSO typically improves in the final quarter of the government's fiscal year, but we didn't experience the usual volume of early payments this year. Cash flow was also affected by onetime payments and timing items. For example, we made tax payments of $45 million in the quarter compared to about $2 million in the first quarter. We also made a $25 million payment to another contractor pursuant to a divestiture agreement executed in 2013. When the government reimburses that contractor, they'll pass along the payment to us, and we expect that reimbursement to occur this fiscal year. This advanced payment was a one-off transaction, and there's nothing similar remaining on our books. 
In addition, second quarter capital expenditures were higher than usual due to the timing of customer requirements. And approximately $20 million of our Q2 CapEx was noncash in nature, related to the accounting treatment of training equipment deployed on one of our large programs. As a result, free cash flow during the quarter was $8 million. Direct project capital expenditures should normalize in the second half of FY '17.
We followed our balanced capital allocation program in Q2, deploying $50 million to pay down debt and $24 million to return to shareholders, $16 million in dividends and $8 million in share repurchases. We spent another $5 million on share buybacks in early October for a total of about 0.5 million shares in late Q2 and early Q3. $337 million now remains on our current share repurchase authorization. 
As of September 30, 2016, we had $68 million in cash and cash equivalents and $2.6 billion in debt. Our balance sheet continues to strengthen as we pay down debt and grow EBITDA. Since going public, we've now paid down about $320 million in debt and have improved to about 3x net debt to EBITDA. We prioritize debt pay down to create flexibility and to enable our balance sheet to be a strategic asset going forward.
Now on to the forward outlook. We're maintaining our guidance as shown on Slide 7. We continue to project fiscal year 2017 revenue between $5 billion and $5.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA between $870 million and $905 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share between $1.91 and $2.04 and free cash flow between $300 million and $350 million.
Let me now address our visibility into the rest of FY '17 and early signs of what to expect in FY '18. Annualizing revenue for the first half remains near the low end of our FY '17 range. On our last call, I talked about needing to generate about $150 million of revenue from new business to reach the bottom of the revenue range. With our strong awards in the second quarter, we've taken care of most of that figure. In fact, the awards made in the quarter should generate more than $400 million in incremental revenue on an annual basis. But our 2 largest awards in the quarter aren't expected to generate revenue until December or later. The OPM contract requires us to build capability and then process investigations before significant revenue is recognized. And resolution of the protest on our $744 million army win isn't expected until the end of the third quarter. So while we've increased our confidence in driving organic growth in 2018, we still have greater visibility into the lower end of this year's revenue range than the top. But on the bottom line through the first half of the year, we're tracking towards the high side of our EPS guidance range. 
There are 3 other P&L items that we should discuss even though they won't have a material impact on our adjusted EBITDA or EPS this year: First, the term loan markets have improved since our spin-merger transaction, so we're in the process of repricing a reduction in the spread on our Term Loan B, effective at the end of November when the soft-call provision expires at the 1-year anniversary of our loans. We also expect to repay a portion of our Term Loan B outstanding balance by upsizing the current Term Loan A. This transfer of debt would reduce our effective interest rate, and we also expect to extend the maturities of all loans by one year and amend certain terms and conditions of the credit agreement in our favor. The noncash accelerated amortization charges associated with this amend-and-extend transaction would increase our GAAP interest expense in Q3. But consistent with industry practice, we'd exclude this onetime charge from our adjusted earnings figures. Going forward, the repricing should reduce our cash interest expense by around $5 million per year, and the extended loan duration and amended terms provide us with outstanding flexibility in executing our strategy. 
Second, for the last few quarters, we've incurred $16 million of intangibles amortization expense associated with SRA's funded contract backlog. Going forward, GAAP intangibles expense will decline with only 2 months of backlog-related amortization in the third quarter figure and none thereafter. This has no impact on our guidance, but as we've noted previously, it will impact our GAAP EPS.
And third, this fall, we've offered to buy out certain groups in our frozen pension program. The offer has just recently closed so we don't have a final tally, but we will shrink both the assets and obligations of the pension program. This will necessitate a mark-to-market adjustment in our third quarter in addition to the usual fourth quarter adjustment. It's too soon to tell the direction or magnitude of the mark-to-market adjustments or any changes to recurring pension income, but the recent mortality table updates should be favorable. Remember that the mark-to-market adjustments are in GAAP EBITDA and GAAP EPS but not in the adjusted EBITDA or EPS that we guide to and that none of these changes impact cash flow. We do expect free cash flow to rebound and to end the year within the guidance range. 
With higher holiday leave-taking from our employees and our government customers in the December quarter, we expect Q3 revenue, EBITDA and EPS to decline slightly, consistent with our experience last year when pro forma revenue declined approximately $50 million sequentially. Seasonal improvements in growth for many of the large Q2 and Q3 wins should drive a meaningful sequential improvement in Q4. This would imply that we're closer to organic growth in the fourth quarter and that we enter FY '18 with strong momentum and an opportunity for top line growth to reach the range of our long-term model of 2% to 3%.
In summary, we continue to deliver industry-leading profitability, and we can see growth on the horizon based on outstanding business development momentum.
With that, operator, we're now ready to take questions."

I also think the context is important that you've seen some debate and discussion of whether or not you separate the leadership of NSA from Cyber Command and then whether or not you have a civilian leader at the helm at NSA. And when you think of the work that President-elect Trump wants to do with the review of all the cyber defense and vulnerabilities, he's going to look at joint task forces that walk across federal state local government. He absolutely wants to look at enhancing Cyber Command, and then he's spoken at length about improving offensive capabilities, really focused on deterrence.

It's just -- it's not only competitively sensitive but, frankly, too early to have a really clear sense for what that total package would look like."

One thing that caught my attention in your opening comments was the 40% win rate in the quarter, and I wanted -- I mean, just kind of reverse engineering, it looks like so $1.2 billion roughly of the bookings were new, and the OPM presumably accounted for a big slug of that. So was this just a function of a couple chunky wins in the quarter? Or I just wonder how we should assess the original theory of 25% as being kind of an acceptable level. Or are we at the point where the funnel is targeted in such a way that you think north of that is actually sustainable?

And as we said in the scripted comments, September was really the first quarter where the vast majority of what was awarded had been bid as a CSRA bid, not as a legacy company bid. So it's our first and, frankly, our best information to date in terms of validity of data to project what the long-term win rate of the combined company will be but far too early to say 25% is understated and it'll be closer to the Q2 40% rate. We're really pleased with where it was in Q2 but need a lot more data before we can get confident in anything higher than that."

We're a few quarters into life as an independent public company, and in each of those quarters, we've talked about the solid execution on fixed-price programs. So we're still settling in and figuring out exactly what a typical quarter looks like in terms of EAC improvements. This quarter was a few million higher than we were expecting it would be entering the quarter in terms of EAC benefits and a few million higher than the first quarter was as you'll see in the 10-Q that we file overnight tonight. Big picture, though, every quarter will look a little bit different in terms of fixed-price program performance, and we'll continue to try to drive outstanding delivery on every one of those programs. As Larry mentioned in his earlier comments, fixed-price program execution is really a hallmark of the company at this point and will continue to drive for outsized performance every quarter. Gross margins and then the overall 18.1% EBITDA margin, though, are not what we are projecting over any future period. They were particularly strong in this quarter. To the second point on -- of your question about what was pulled forward in revenue from Q3 and Q4, we had projected going into the quarter on our last call that our numbers would be down slightly in the top line from Q1 to Q2. Instead, they were up about $10 million in revenue. If you were to think of having projected down $10 million or $20 million, consistent with consensus and delivered $10 million of upside instead, that $20 million or $30 million is not an unreasonable kind of volume to associate with what was pulled forward from Q3 and Q4 into Q2."

We talked about needing $150 million or about 3% of our revenue guidance to get to the low end of guidance this time last quarter. And on my scripted comments, we didn't exactly say that we had filled that entire bucket but that we'd filled most of it. So think of us as being in that last 1% of the 3% we needed this time last quarter. Exactly what the Q3 and Q4 revenue results are will depend on a few factors. One, the ongoing pace of new business award activity and our success on recompetes. Certainly, we're pleased with Q2 and, as we mentioned, a couple of wins in early Q3. The right kinds of momentum are in place, but we need to continue to win new business to continue to fill the rest of the less than 1% gap to get to the low end of guidance and then to fill into the guidance range. Second, the continuing resolution has an effect on certain programs across the business and can influence our customers' thoughts on things like whether this is the right couple of months to do a direct material purchase or to engage in a surge in labor support. Across a couple of thousand programs, you can imagine that 1 million here and 1 million there add up. And the exact timing of the resolution of the CR and what the new administration's priorities look like as they take place over the winter months will also have an effect, particularly as we enter Q4. So that combination of factors is what continues to influence our thinking every day. We think we've still got the right guidance range, and we're pleased with the business development progress of the last few months."
