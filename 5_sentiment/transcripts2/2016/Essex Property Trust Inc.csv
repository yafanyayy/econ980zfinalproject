John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I will cover the following topics on the call: first, comment on Q4 and market conditions; and second, commentary on investment activities. 
On to the first topic. Yesterday, we were pleased to report continued strong operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 2015. In the fourth quarter, core FFO per share increased 17% compared to Q4 2014. For the full year, core FFO was $0.42 per share, above the midpoint of the initial 2015 guidance range. For the 5-year period from the 2010 recessionary trough, we have grown core FFO per share by 96%, increased our dividend nearly 7% per year and led the multi-family REIT industry with an annual total return of 19%. Angela Kleiman will comment on guidance in a moment, which anticipates continued strength into 2016. 
As widely reported, an anticipated slowdown in rent growth occurred in Q4 in Northern California. Third-party research firms have reacted by lowering rent growth and occupancy expectations for 2016. We believe that the Q4 slowdown does not materially change the 2016 outlook for Northern California for the following reasons. First, we believe that 2015 rent growth in Northern California was greater than anyone expected. I'd say 2015 was an extraordinary year. This context is important when comparing results because any disruption can appear disappointing. In this case, we expect to go from extraordinary in 2015 to strong in 2016 because the scenario that we outlined in our 2016 market forecast in connection with our Q3 2015 conference call, and we are now reaffirming that forecast. Specifically, we believe market rents will increase by 7.5% in Northern California in 2016, down from the 2015 average of 10.9%. 
Our second comment relates to the typical seasonality in Q4, which, in my 30 years at Essex, always occurs, although at varying intensity. Demand driven by job growth moderated in Q4, which is typical as many companies wait until after the holidays to add workers. New apartment deliveries will also vary throughout the year, and so above-average deliveries in Q4, along with lower demand can cause temporary softness until demand recovers, typically by early February. We estimate that Q4 deliveries of apartments in Northern California represented about 44% of the roughly 10,000 apartments delivered in all of 2015 versus 35% and 25% in Q4 of '14 and '13, respectively. John Burkart will summarize January results in a moment, given his confidence that the Q4 slowdown is not indicative of a trend. 
Our final point relates to our estimation of excess demand relative to supply in 2016. In our market forecast, again unchanged from last quarter, we project the 3 Bay Area counties to generate 2.9% job growth in 2016, significantly lower but still strong relative to the extraordinary job growth of 4.1% for the comparable metros in 2015. That 2.9% Bay Area job growth equates to around 95,000 jobs. Those 95,000 jobs will produce demand for around 47,000 housing units, assuming the typical 2 for 1 relationship between jobs and housing demand. In 2016, we expect the Bay Area to produce around 18,000 homes, both apartment and for sale, which represent only 38% of the demand attributable to job growth. With market occupancy around 96%, expensive single-family homes and demand well in excess of supply, we believe that great price and power will continue in 2016.
Rental affordability is often mentioned as a possible cause to lower rent growth. However, these are high-income and high-cost areas, and fortunately, incomes in the Bay Area are growing substantially. San Jose, for example, has a median household income of around $102,000, and personal incomes grew by 7.3% in 2014 and are estimated to increase 6.5% and 7.1% in 2015 and 2016, respectively. In Santa Clara County, which includes San Jose, monthly rents in the Essex portfolio average around $2,500 as compared to median rents in San Jose of around $2,200. The median income will allow someone without a roommate to rent the either the average Essex apartment or the medium price apartment in the metro area. 
Nothing in this discussion should imply that we lack concern about the U.S. economy, recent market volatility or the resilient fee of tech jobs, all of which are risks to our market outlook. If economic conditions worsen, we may not be able to achieve the macro assumptions driving our forecast, including 2.8% U.S. GDP growth and 2% U.S. job growth. We see nothing in our markets that would indicate that tech jobs are imploding. To the contrary, the tech markets continued to do well, as indicated by San Jose's 4.4% December over the December year-over-year job growth. Further, our analysis of the largest tech companies indicates that they are growing in market capitalization and generating huge amounts of cash. We would have thought 10 years ago that Alphabet and Google would be the world's largest-listed companies. A comparison of the top 10 U.S.-based tech companies against the top 10 nontech companies shows just how much the world has changed. The top 10 tech companies are worth around $2.8 trillion, 21% more than the nontechs, and have $556 billion in cash more than twice as much as the nontechs. Approximately $1.8 trillion of the equity capitalization of the tech leaders was created in the past 10 years over 3x the nontech. 
Finally, while only 3 of the nontech leaders are based in the Essex markets, all of the tech leaders are headquartered on the West Coast. We clearly don't see the end of large investment and technology in the foreseeable future and believe that our portfolio is well positioned for this continued growth. 
To the second topic, investment activity. So far, our acquisition markets have experienced little impact from global economic conditions. Cap rates have not moved much. At this point, A-quality property and locations created at around a 4.25 cap rate using the Essex methodology, but more aggressive buyers are often sub-4. B-quality property and locations typically have cap rates 25 to 50 basis points higher than A-quality property. 
We are seeing 3 significant headwinds affecting development in the West Coast markets, which we believe will moderate apartment supply going forward. First, construction lenders are sizing construction loans based on loan-to-cost ratios of between 60% to 65%, down about 5% from a few months ago. Second, cities continue to increase demand from developers in the form of low-income housing units, higher fees and costly improvement. Finally, construction costs have increased around 10% in each of the past 2 years despite declining commodity prices, as skilled labor forces are inadequate to meet related construction activity. Obviously, the slower housing supply is beneficial to the Essex portfolio overall. 
As previously announced, we sold the 296 units Sharon Green Apartments in Northern California for $245 million or $828,000 per unit and at a cap rate in the high 3% range. We used 10 31 exchanges to reinvest the proceed to Sharon Green into 3 properties that are detailed in the press release. We estimate that core FFO will increase by approximately $1 million in 2016 as a result of these transactions. 
Our business plan for investments is outlined in the press release. We hope that economic uncertainty will bring more transactions to the market and that financing rates will be attractive. Depending upon the stock price, acquisitions may be funded as part of our co-investment program or on our balance sheet. We currently have 2 properties in contract to be sold. Similarly, the use of proceeds from dispositions will also be strongly influenced by the stock price. 
That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call today. Now I'll turn the call over to John Burkart."

Our results exceeded our initial revenue guidance in all 3 regions for the combined Essex theory portfolio, and expenses were favorable to guidance leading to an exceptional 10.7% NOI growth, the highest in 15 years. 
Our outperformance was attributable to job growth exceeding expectations and lower-than-expected housing supply. As of December 2015, our markets added 361,000 jobs compared to December 2014, 40 basis points higher than our original projection of 2.5%. A total of 63,000 new units of supply, both multi-family and single-family, was delivered into the markets in 2015. That's about 6,900 units below our original forecast largely for the reasons that Mike mentioned, including labor shortages, municipal delays, rising costs and more stringent letter underwriting. The supply-demand imbalance is the key factor behind our market strength. We estimate, assuming 2 jobs create one unit for housing, as the 331,000 jobs created is equivalent to about 165,000 units of housing demand compared to only 63,000 units of new supply delivered, meaning demand exceeded supply by over 2.5x. 
The fourth quarter, which is the low point seasonal demand and rental rate in our market, was relatively strong across all 3 regions, with a 7.5% increase in gross revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Achieved rent on new leases were up 8.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
We have made great progress in our management of the BRE portfolio. However, we still have more work to do with respect to refining unit amenity pricing, lease expiration management and renovation. Therefore, for the purpose of comparable sequential results, the Essex legacy portfolio provides the best insight. Adjusted for occupancy changes, the Essex portfolio achieved 1.6% sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2015, the same as 2014. 
We continue to find opportunities with our renovation program. We increased the number of units renovated in the same-store portfolio, 143% from 254 units in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 618 units in the fourth quarter of 2015. The scope of the unit churn are site-specific based on opportunities in the marketplace. 
Now I will share some highlights for each region. The Seattle market continues to absorb new supply and push rents outside the CBD higher. Revenues for our Seattle CBD portfolio increased 5.3%, while revenue for the majority of our portfolio, which is located on the East side of Bellevue and Redmond, grew 8.3% for the fourth quarter compared to the prior year's quarter. According to AXIO, the Seattle market had the strongest year since the Great Recession, ended the year with approximately 8% year-over-year rental growth as of December 2015. 
In the Bay Area, the successful technology companies continue to lease or pursue space to grow their companies. The technology-driven San Francisco Peninsula and Silicon Valley market absorbed over 1 million square feet of space in each of the fourth quarter of 2015 or 50% of the total absorption for 2015. 
Also that leased space in Alameda, North San Jose Shoreline, [indiscernible], a division of [indiscernible] leased space in Bruno and Microsoft recently submitted plans for a new campus in Mountain View, with construction expected to begin next year. 
Southern California region continues to be strong, driven by solid job growth in each market. The 8.4% NOI growth rate achieved in 2015 was the highest in 15 years. We expect momentum we saw in 2015 to continue into 2016, given the limited new supply in the Southern California region, although we do expect some challenges in the Downtown L.A. as that local market absorbs the planned deliveries. Rental increases in the San Diego market have increased each year since 2010 and ended the year up 7% over the prior year according to AXIO. 
I'm pleased with our 2015 results, and although I recognize the real economic risks and concerns of the marketplace, the current conditions that we are experiencing in our market gives me confidence that we will achieve our plan outlined in the guidance. 
Our portfolio occupancy as of February 2 is at 96.1%, consistent with our budget. And our net availability out 30 days stand at 5.3%. We are positioned well to take advantage of the spring rental season. 
Looking forward into 2016, we again expect demand to substantially exceed supply in our markets by over 2x, leading to continued rental market strength. 
In January of 2016, our average achieved rent for new leases for our 3 regions was 2.4% above our achieved rent in December of 2015, consistent with our budget. 
I think our momentum positions us well for 2016. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman."
332646,322631916,928163,"Essex Property Trust Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2016",2016-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Essex Property Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Today, I will briefly review 2015 results then focus on 2016 guidance and provide a balance sheet update.

Today, I will briefly review 2015 results then focus on 2016 guidance and provide a balance sheet update. 
For 2015, I'm pleased to report that our same-property revenue growth for the full year was 8%, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. Same-property revenue growth and NOI growth for the combined portfolio, which consists of the last 3 quarters of the year, was 7.6% and 10.1%, respectively. Both of these also exceeded the midpoint of our most recent guidance. 
On to 2016. We anticipate another strong year with 11% projected core FFO per share growth, primarily driven by same property gross assumptions. Our top line growth of 7% at the midpoint reflects our expectation of continued favorable supply/demand relationship. For reference, business point is 25 basis points higher than our initial guidance for 2015, which was 6.75%. 
We are projecting higher operating expense growth of 3.75% at the midpoint. Controllable expenses are expected to increase modestly at around 1% for the year. Therefore, the 2 key drivers to expense increase are as follows: first, higher utility costs. Know that 2015 utility cost increase was only 0.3%, so very muted, primarily due to water conservation. And second, an increase in our allocation to property management expense. This is consistent with what we've previously communicated. We will review this allocation on a regular basis in conjunction with our transformation plan. The new management fee allocation equates to 2.4% of revenues, which is less than 3% commonly used within the industry. The resulting bottom line is that we are expecting another strong year, with 8.5% NOI growth at the midpoint. 
As for G&A, the increase by 5% of the midpoint is primarily due to our new corporate headquarters lease. The offset to this expense as discussed in a previous call this the yield from reinvesting the proceeds from the sale of our former Palo Alto headquarters. Thereby, the resulting net impact [indiscernible] $0.01 per share. 
For the first quarter this year, we are projecting core FFO per share at the midpoint to be $0.03 below fourth quarter of last year. The reduction is attributed to onetime items such as favorable variance in the fourth quarter and property tax with the legacy BRE portfolio, generating $0.04 of core FFO per share. In addition, we have recently sold several properties, including Sharon Green, and have not fully redeployed its proceeds. The result is $0.01 per share drag on the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter last year. 
Other assumptions to our guidance can be found on Page 5 of the press release and S-14 of the supplemental. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We repaid $150 million of private placement bonds in January and have assumed an unsecured bond offering in our guidance for 2016. The only noteworthy maturity remaining in 2016 is the $200 million term loan in the fourth quarter. We have several options available to refinance this debt, which allows us to be opportunistic. 
We generally favor refinancing majorities with unsecured debt that is 5- to 10-year in terms depending on the interest rate curve and the related spreads. 
Lastly, we are ahead of our scheduled in reducing our net debt-to-EBITDA to 5.8x due to substantial growth in EBITDA. Based on recent $215 stock price, our leverage from debt-to-market cap is at 27%. 
In comparison, heading into the great '08 recession, our leverage was 35% at the end of 2007. Therefore, with our $1 billion line of credit extended to 2021, unfunded commitments of $230 million, which is below 3% of total market cap and with a light maturity schedule over the next several years, we are well positioned to be opportunistic and to weather any substantial capital market dislocation. 
That concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

I think there we're still anticipating that process to occur, although the resiliency in the tech markets has been a little bit surprising to us, obviously, a positive surprise. And so I think the numbers this year we have -- again, to go to the forecast, the market forecast, we have Northern California at about 7.5%, and our guidance is marginally higher than that. And so we are expecting a little bit of loss-to-lease usage. That will be the delta in the 2 different numbers. So does that make sense as it relates to Northern Cal?"

Of course, Q4 was a dip, and it is higher at the end of January than it was at the end of December. Again, you have the impact of what we think happened again as I mentioned in my comments. We had lumpy supply hitting the market in Q4 in Northern California. And when that happens, some people are trying to lease up their apartment buildings, becoming more aggressive with respect to concessions and/or rent levels. And when that happens, everyone else adjusts along with it. And again, this is within a period that you always have lower demand for a variety of reasons. And so you have lower demand. You have too much hitting the marketplace, and owners reacting very aggressively. I think that, that, as John Burkart pointed, out has largely the run the course because now demand has returned to normal levels. Some of those lease-ups have adjusted in price. And as a result of world looks, I could say, more or less on track for what we thought was going to happen. So again, from my perspective, the fourth quarter is the lease relevant quarter. And I know seems like the analysts focus on it many times over the last 10 years. And I think that they give it too much weight in terms of the overall relevance of the quarter. It's the least relevant. Things can happen is that of the slowdown of demand, and I think that's what happened this year, and it's happened many times before."

And it's hard to run the business and enter into transactions to take, what, 60 days to close and expect anything with respect to your stock price. As it relates to Sharon Green, you're right. Originally, we had intended to 10 31 exchange around 2/3 of the proceeds, pull forward the dividend in order to create the money that we could use for stock buyback. We changed the plan when the stock was in the 2 30 to 2 40 range and decided to 10 31 exchange everything. But that demonstrates how we think about the world. We try to again make good decisions with our eye focused on building NAV per share, and building cash flow per share. And it's worked out for us really well over a lot of years, and we'll continue doing that doing forward. But to your point, it is incredibly difficult to plan exactly what we're going to do when the world is changing so much. And I would say the same thing is true with respect to our guidance. We issued our market forecast last quarter. Many may argue that the prospects for GDP growth are not nearly as good today as they were just a couple of months ago, but the reality is, who knows? We're using a number that economy.com, the 2.8% GDP growth, with the expectation that the economy will improve, improve as we go through 2016. But the reality is we don't know that either. We try to, again be -- react to the business, keep our eyes focused on the transaction activity out there and then make the decisions. We expect this to be a challenging year from the perspective of uncertainty and volatility. And again, I think that we generally do well in that type of environment, certainly, with respect to transaction because things can become more mispriced and/or they're -- it could cause sellers, for example -- the uncertainty can often cause sellers to become more interested in selling, so maybe we'll see more transactions at the marketplace. I know on the development side, the construction side, there are cost increases and other factors of cost development deals to not pencil the way the developers had hoped that they would pencil.

But I will say that the point that I made in my comments about what is the impact of, well, this incredible wealth has been created by Alphabet and I think I said Google. I meant Apple in my comments. The tremendous amount of cash is there. The wealth has been created, et cetera. What is the long-term impact of that on the marketplace if you look out 2 or 3 years? And we don't know the answer to that. We think it's pretty positive. And as an example, we can cite what happened when Bill Gates decided to move Microsoft to Seattle and really form that business in the Seattle market. I think it transformed Seattle in ways that we can't really understand. There are books that are written about this and we talked about them before. But again, this incredible wealth generation will increase economic activity, we know that. It will bring the best and brightest people into the marketplaces. And those that own these companies will reinvest those funds in ways that are generally very, very good for the economy. So that is part of the equation that's difficult to predict if you get beyond 2017 and '18, although I wouldn't count the tech market of the out of the ballgame with respect to growth rate in '17 and '18 because of this factor. Again, it's hard to understand it exactly right now, but looking at Seattle as an example, I think you'll see continued development in these markets for a longer period of time."

From my perspective, there's a couple of issues out there that are pretty important, which includes with municipalities that commonly forbid this. So that would be another issue.

From the BRE perspective as far as the legacy portfolio, we've certainly come a long way. As I mentioned in my remarks, some of the opportunities we still have going forward, specifically with that portfolio relating to amenity refi and the amenity adjustments and expirations. And the expirations have yet been commented on several times, but for clarity, clearly we could fix that. It was in a 12-month period as the lease expires, It's [indiscernible] into a certain bucket. The problem is it's not the best thing to do economically. Typically, you're better to work through that over a couple of year period and not force people to take actions that are inconsistent with the market. So we just tried to move it on the margin, and that's what we're doing. As it relates to the amenity adjustment, that takes several years to get right and, frankly, on the FX legacy side, we're still refining that as well, trying to really connect with how the market perceives the different valuation of our similar unit types and makes adjustments as an ongoing effort at our company. It just needed a lot more work on the BRE side as they really just started that revenue management process. On the big picture, on the expense side, things aren't pretty good quarter there. We now have the BRE portfolio, legacy portfolio, performing on a controllable expense basis, admin and those types of expenses on a per-unit basis, below the Essex portfolio, and that makes sense that portfolio in several newer than ours. And so we've a lot of work and we have that in very good order. From a management perspective, we have great people, and that is completely intermixed throughout the portfolio. So there is no Essex or BRE assets there. All Essex assets and how we manage them is almost exactly the same as a few new ones that are getting cleaned up. But basically, almost 100% the same. So that's come a long way, and we're very pleased with where that's that. On the renovations, the last piece, that these takes on again, our renovation program was pretty focused on making sure our product meets the market exactly. It's a very asset-by-asset program. And so we mentioned that the of launched it, which we have. 2016 will have a greater focus on the BRE portfolio as a percentage, then move on to the Essex portfolio and a switch from this last year. And we'll continue to explore those opportunities. Hopefully, that answers the question."

First, Mike, I appreciate your comments on tech and the jobs out there in your opening remarks. And looking -- I guess what was a little surprising is looking at your job forecast of the latest one in your sub today versus the one a year ago, the job growth forecasts are sort of similar. And yet, obviously, the news headlines today are clearly fresher than they were a year ago, but Twitter, Yahoo!, you see some of these companies that are in the news, whether for business model issues or space giveback on their office use. I'm just trying to reconcile the two. What would be the things that you guys would look for that would tell you something is happening, a red flag out there that would tell you that things may be changing? Because the outlook that you gave in your job picture is a bit different than sort of a sentiment if you read the newspapers or speak to folks, not your folks, but speak to the that's on this side of the country."

Yes, I mean, the one point that we pretty dramatically outperformed the job forecast last year. So yes, this year, as a forecast, it's pretty similar to last year, but you have the large outperformance in the middle of that, which we didn't expect, obviously. So we're going back to what we consider to be a more sustainable job forecast. And so going forward, how do we detect the things are different from plan? We would use our own portfolio as being a primary source. Typically, what happens in the portfolio when you look at 30-day affordability and some of the other portfolio metrics, you would see dislocation happening more quickly than the data vendors will pick it up generally by 1 or 2 months. So we would generally see that hiccup happening right in the rental activity and affordability. So we'd look for that, and that'll be the primary trigger to focus more effort on what's going on. In terms of what we're most concerned about, a lot of people talk about the unicorns out there. And we're less concerned about them, more concerned about the large tech companies because when you look at the number of employees, it's pretty dramatically different. Again, back to our top 10 tech public companies. There's about -- they have about 165,000 employees in the Bay Area, whereas the top 20 unicorns have about 11,000 employees in the Bay Area. So we are clearly more concerned about the top 10 or the big tech companies, but we're also -- on the flipside, we also recognize that they have such tremendous financial capabilities, again, the amount of cash that they have, the amount of growth that they've generated, the office space that they are leasing and the overall commercial activity. There's nothing to us that appears to be a hiccup in what their activities are, and that is what's really driving or anchoring our forecast for next year."

And again, we prepared this forecast last quarter. So the world was a little bit different then. And we can go through the process of changing the forecast dramatically, but the reality is the world is changing so rapidly that you can't change the forecast every month, which would almost be necessary based on the amount of volatility we've had in the marketplace. But what our process is, is we use the macro data for the broad macro numbers, which is U.S. GDP growth and U.S. job growth, and then we drive the more specific market forecast based on our own supply/demand analysis. And Angela has come up with a regression analysis that takes into account various different factors, including both supply and demand. It includes wage growth, for example, as one of the key items or affordability. And so the economic rent growth in our market forecast is Essex proprietary, but it's driven by macro numbers that come from data providers. I think 2.8% is the highest of the data providers, as I recall. Looking at the list, there are some in the 1.5% range. Again, we could change this on an ongoing basis, but to what point? I think that the forecast looks achievable. If you look at last year, we missed the GDP forecast but outperformed on the job side. So is this a perfect science? Obviously, it's not. And it seems like we had resilience on the job growth side relative to historical relationships. And again, I think it goes back to that wealth incredible -- wealth creation that we've had on the West Coast that is really driving economic activity that is disconnecting from a lot of the data going back 5 or 10 years. So I think a lot of things are happening. It seems to us that these are achievable numbers. And again, we'll see. We expect the volatile years. I know everyone knows."

So you had an incredible asset bubble with respect to these tech companies, and that went on for a lot longer than anyone expected it to go one and ultimately had a horrific effect of things. I think that, that really is the exception, though. When you look at 2007, 2008 -- 2008, 2009 recession, actually, the tech world did rather well. It was construction, government, manufacturing, except for they did incredibly poorly and thank everything. I think that that's actually more of my belief with respect to the tech world. It's not necessarily the tech world that tends to be so volatile in terms of employment. It's the broader economy. So I don't have necessarily any great fear about tech itself.

We know that Southern California, for example, is a more diversified economy and, therefore, will have less dislocation, but again, not the same growth rate either. So if we see significant dislocation in the tech markets, we will obviously try to move more the portfolio southward. There is a small bias toward that, as you saw in the Sharon Green transaction, where we sell Northern California and we reinvest 2/3 Northern California, 1/3 Southern California.

And I thought at the time how crazy it was to think that, let alone say it out loud. Of course, had you known your stock would go up to 250 or close to it a few years there, you that in a heartbeat. And your execution has been outstanding. But right now, this long list, as Goldfarb pointed out, of things going on, to what extent that it was a lot of people are asking whether they're signals that you're not seeing anything fundament is yet. With all this in mind, what would you do what the signal might be, but what would you do? Would there be an idea of selling assets in both? Because one thing that you still have is fantastic asset value. You could sell assets today incredibly low cap rates, maybe pay special dividend, deliver further and really honker down. What kind of action when you take if you do see something pop up in your fundamentals?"

He asked what happened to his $240 stock price. Keith is always with us. Again, it goes back to that relationship between asset values and the stock price. And that has been changing seemingly everyday, and we sure would like to see some consistency in stock price before we make big strategic decisions. And unfortunately, that's probably not going to happen this year. And so we will look for opportunities, much like Sharon Green Apartments, where we think we can sell an asset and the either by the stock back or pay a special dividend. Both of them are potentially attractive to us. And we want to see some meaningful pickup in terms of impact on NAV per share. So today, that is probably there, but it wasn't there last week. And again, the trend -- it takes, what, 60 to 90 days to actually go through the transaction process. And then you have got to work through the reinvestment plan. So we're trying to do the best we can. I will tell you that we will sell more assets this year than we've sold for the last several years. And I think that, that will continue to trend. And we'll look for both really 2 different things: one, pairing off the assets that we think will underperform over the longer period, which will probably be in the higher cap rate type of area, but then the more opportunistic, much like Sharon Green, after the at a attractive, very aggressive cap rates that we can redeploying the positive spreads. So we'll be looking at those."

John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I will cover the following topics on the call: first, comment on Q4 an",1304,"Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I will cover the following topics on the call: first, comment on Q4 and market conditions; and second, commentary on investment activities. 
On to the first topic. Yesterday, we were pleased to report continued strong operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 2015. In the fourth quarter, core FFO per share increased 17% compared to Q4 2014. For the full year, core FFO was $0.42 per share, above the midpoint of the initial 2015 guidance range. For the 5-year period, from the 2010 recessionary trough, we have grown core FFO per share by 96%, increased our dividend nearly 7% per year and led the multifamily REIT industry with an annual total return of 19%. Angela Kleiman will comment on guidance in a moment, which anticipates continued strength into 2016. 
As widely reported, an unanticipated slowdown in rent growth occurred in Q4 in Northern California. Third-party research firms have reacted by lowering rent growth and occupancy expectations for 2016. We believe that the Q4 slowdown does not materially change the 2016 outlook for Northern California for the following reasons. First, we believe that 2015 rent growth in Northern California was greater than anyone expected. I'd say, 2015 was an extraordinary year. This context is important when comparing results because any disruption can appear disappointing. In this case, we expect to go from extraordinary in 2015 to strong in 2016, which is the scenario that we outlined in our 2016 market forecast in connection with our Q3 2015 conference call, and we are now reaffirming that forecast. Specifically, we believe market rents will increase by 7.5% in Northern California in 2016, down from the 2015 average of 10.9%. 
Our second comment relates to the typical seasonality in Q4, which, in my 30 years at Essex, always occurs, although at varying intensity. Demand driven by job growth moderated in Q4, which is typical as many companies wait until after the holidays to add workers. New apartment deliveries will also vary throughout the year, and so above-average deliveries in Q4, along with lower demand, can cause temporary softness until demand recovers, typically by early February. We estimate that Q4 deliveries of apartments in Northern California represented about 44% of the roughly 10,000 apartments delivered in all of 2015 versus 35% and 25% in Q4 '14 and '13, respectively. John Burkart will summarize January results in a moment, given his confidence that the Q4 slowdown is not indicative of a trend.
Our final point relates to our estimation of excess demand relative to supply in 2016. In our market forecast, again unchanged from last quarter, we project the 3 Bay Area counties to generate 2.9% job growth in 2016, significantly lower but still strong relative to the extraordinary job growth of 4.1% for the comparable metros in 2015. That 2.9% Bay Area job growth equates to around 95,000 jobs. Those 95,000 jobs will produce demand for around 47,000 housing units, assuming the typical 2-for-1 relationship between jobs and housing demand. In 2016, we expect the Bay Area to produce around 18,000 homes, both apartments and for sale, which represent only 38% of the demand attributable to job growth. With market occupancy around 96%, expensive single-family homes and demand well in excess of supply, we believe that great pricing power will continue in 2016.
Rental affordability is often mentioned as a possible cause for lower rent growth. However, these are high-income and high-cost areas, and fortunately, incomes in the Bay Area are growing substantially. San Jose, for example, has a median household income of around $102,000 and personal incomes grew by 7.3% in 2014 and are estimated to increase 6.5% and 7.1% in 2015 and 2016, respectively. In Santa Clara County, which includes San Jose, monthly rents in the Essex portfolio average around $2,500 as compared to median rents in San Jose of around $2,200. The median income will allow someone without a roommate to rent either the average Essex apartment or the medium price apartment in the metro area. 
Nothing in this discussion should imply that we lack concern about the U.S. economy, recent market volatility or the resiliency of tech jobs, all of which are a risk to our market outlook. If economic conditions worsen, we may not be able to achieve the macro assumptions driving our forecast, including 2.8% U.S. GDP growth and 2% U.S. job growth. We see nothing in our markets that would indicate that tech jobs are imploding. To the contrary, the tech markets continued to do well, as indicated by San Jose's 4.4% December over the -- December year-over-year job growth. Further, our analysis of the largest tech companies indicates that they are growing in market capitalization and generating huge amounts of cash. Who would have thought 10 years ago that Alphabet and Google would be the world's largest listed companies.
A comparison of the top 10 U.S.-based tech companies against the top 10 non-tech companies shows just how much the world has changed. The top 10 tech companies are worth around $2.8 trillion, 21% more than the nontechs, and have $556 billion in cash more than twice as much as the nontechs. Approximately $1.8 trillion of the equity capitalization of the tech leaders was created in the past 10 years, over 3x the nontech. 
Finally, while only 3 of the non-tech leaders are based in the Essex market, all of the tech leaders are headquartered on the West Coast. We clearly don't see the end of large investments in technology in the foreseeable future and believe that our portfolio is well positioned for this continued growth. 
To the second topic, investment activity. So far, acquisition markets have experienced little impact from global economic conditions. Cap rates have not moved much. At this point, A-quality property and locations trade at around a 4 1/4 cap rate using the Essex methodology, but more aggressive buyers are often sub-4. B-quality property and locations typically have cap rates 25 to 50 basis points higher than A-quality property.
We are seeing 3 significant headwinds affecting development in the West Coast markets, which we believe will moderate apartment supply going forward. First, construction lenders are sizing construction loans based on loan-to-cost ratios of between 60% to 65%, down about 5% from a few months ago. Second, cities continue to increase demands from developers in the form of low-income housing units, higher fees and costly improvement. Finally, construction costs have increased around 10% in each of the past 2 years, despite declining commodity prices as skilled labor forces are inadequate to meet related construction activity. Obviously, the slower housing supply is beneficial to the Essex portfolio overall. 
As previously announced, we sold the 296-unit Sharon Green Apartments in Northern California for $245 million or $828,000 per unit and at a cap rate in the high 3% range. We used 1031 exchanges to reinvest the proceed to Sharon Green into 3 properties that are detailed in the press release. We estimate that core FFO will increase by approximately $1 million in 2016 as a result of these transactions. 
Our business plan for investments is outlined in the press release. We hope that economic uncertainty will bring more transactions to the market and that financing rates will be attractive. Depending upon the stock price, acquisitions may be funded as part of our co-investment program or on our balance sheet. We currently have 2 properties in contract to be sold. Similarly, the use of proceeds from dispositions will also be strongly influenced by the stock price. 
That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call today. Now, I'll turn the call over to John Burkart."

Our results exceeded our initial revenue guidance in all 3 regions for the combined Essex BRE portfolio, and expenses were favorable to guidance, leading to an exceptional 10.7% NOI growth, the highest in 15 years. 
Our outperformance was attributable to job growth exceeding expectations and lower-than-expected housing supply. As of December 2015, our markets added 361,000 jobs compared to December 2014, 40 basis points higher than our original projection at 2.5%. A total of 63,000 new units of supply, both multifamily and single-family, was delivered into the markets in 2015. That's about 6,900 units below our original forecast, largely for the reasons that Mike mentioned, including labor shortages, municipal delays, rising costs and more stringent lender underwriting. The supply-demand imbalance is the key factor behind our market's strength. We estimate, assuming 2 jobs create 1 unit demand for housing, that the 331,000 jobs created is equivalent to about 165,000 units of housing demand compared to only 63,000 units of new supply delivered, meaning demand exceeded supply by over 2.5x. 
The fourth quarter, which is the low point seasonal demand and rental rate in our market, was relatively strong across all 3 regions, with a 7.5% increase in gross revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Achieved rent on new leases were up 8.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
We've made great progress in our management of the BRE portfolio. However, we still have more work to do with respect to refining unit, amenity pricing, lease expiration management and renovation. Therefore, for the purpose of comparable sequential results, the Essex legacy portfolio provides the best insight. Adjusted for occupancy changes, the Essex portfolio achieved 1.6% sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2015, the same as 2014. 
We continue to find opportunities with our renovation program. We increased the number of units renovated in the same-store portfolio, 143% from 254 units in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 618 units in the fourth quarter of 2015. The scope of the unit churn are site-specific based on opportunities in the marketplace. 
Now I will share some highlights for each region. The Seattle market continues to absorb new supply and push rents outside the CBD higher. Revenues for our Seattle CBD portfolio increased 5.3%, while revenue for the majority of our portfolio, which is located on the east side near Bellevue and Redmond, grew 8.3% for the fourth quarter compared to the prior year's quarter.
According to AXIO, the Seattle market had the strongest year since the Great Recession, ended the year with approximately 8% year-over-year rental growth as of December 2015. 
In the Bay Area, the successful technology companies continue to lease or pursue space to grow their company. The technology-driven San Francisco Peninsula and Silicon Valley markets absorbed over 1 million square feet of space in each of the -- in each -- in the fourth quarter of 2015 or 50% of the total absorption for 2015.
Alphabet leased space in Alameda, North San Jose, Shoreline. YouTube, a division of Alphabet, leased space in San Bruno. And Microsoft recently submitted plans for a new campus in Mountain View, with construction expected to begin next year. 
Southern California region continues to be strong, driven by solid job growth in each market. The 8.4% NOI growth rate achieved in 2015 was the highest in 15 years. We expect momentum we saw in 2015 to continue into 2016, given the limited new supply in the Southern California region, although we do expect some challenges in the Downtown L.A. as that local market absorbs the planned deliveries. Rental increases in the San Diego market have increased each year since 2010 and ended the year up 7% over the prior year, according to AXIO. 
I'm pleased with our 2015 results. And although I recognize the real economic risks and concerns in the marketplace, the current conditions that we are experiencing in our market gives me confidence that we will achieve our plan outlined in the guidance. 
Our portfolio occupancy as of February 2 is at 96.1%, consistent with our budget. And our net availability of 30 days stands at 5.3%. We are positioned well to take advantage of the spring rental season. 
Looking forward into 2016, we again expect demand to substantially exceed supply in our markets by over 2x, leading to continued rental market strength. In January of 2016, our average achieved rent for new leases for our 3 regions was 2.4% above our achieved rent in December of 2015, consistent with our budget. I think our momentum positions us well for 2016.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman."

Today, I will briefly review 2015 results, then focus on 2016 guidance and provide a balance sheet update. For 2015, I'm pleased to report that our same-property revenue growth for the full year was 8%, which exceeded the midpoint of our g",640,"Thanks, John. Today, I will briefly review 2015 results, then focus on 2016 guidance and provide a balance sheet update. 
For 2015, I'm pleased to report that our same-property revenue growth for the full year was 8%, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. Same-property revenue growth and NOI growth for the combined portfolio, which consists of the last 3 quarters of the year, was 7.6% and 10.1%, respectively. Both of these also exceeded the midpoint of our most recent guidance. 
On to 2016. We anticipate another strong year with 11% projected core FFO per share growth, primarily driven by same-property growth assumptions. Our top line growth of 7% at the midpoint reflects our expectation of continued favorable supply/demand relationship. For reference, business volume is 25 basis points higher than our initial guidance for 2015, which was 6.75%. 
We are projecting higher operating expense growth of 3.75% at the midpoint. Controllable expenses are expected to increase modestly at around 1% for the year. Therefore, the 2 key drivers to expense increase are as follows: first, higher utility costs. Know that 2015 utility cost increase was only 0.3%. So very muted, primarily due to water conservation. And second, an increase in our allocation to property management expense. This is consistent with what we've previously communicated. We will review this allocation on a regular basis in conjunction with our transformation plan. The new management fee allocation equates to 2.4% of revenues, which is less than 3% commonly used within the industry. The resulting bottom line is that we are expecting another strong year, with 8.5% NOI growth at the midpoint. 
As for G&A, the increase by 5% of the midpoint is primarily due to our new corporate headquarters lease. To offset to this expense as discussed on a previous call, is the yield from reinvesting the proceeds from the sale of our former Palo Alto headquarters. Thereby, the resulting net impact to FFO is $0.01 per share. 
For the first quarter this year, we are projecting core FFO per share at the midpoint to be $0.03 below fourth quarter of last year. The reduction is attributed to onetime items such as favorable variance in the fourth quarter and property tax for the legacy BRE portfolio, generating $0.04 of core FFO per share. In addition, we have recently sold several properties, including Sharon Green, that have not fully redeployed its proceeds. The result is $0.01 per share drag on the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year. 
Other assumptions to our guidance can be found on Page 5 of the press release and S-14 of the supplemental. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We repaid $150 million of private placement bonds in January and have assumed an unsecured bond offering in our guidance for 2016. The only noteworthy maturity remaining in 2016 is the $200 million term loan in the fourth quarter. We have several options available to refinance this debt, which allows us to be opportunistic. 
We generally favor refinancing of maturities with unsecured debt that is 5- to 10-year in terms depending on the interest rate curve and the related spreads. 
Lastly, we are ahead of our scheduled in reducing our net debt-to-EBITDA to 5.8x due to substantial growth in EBITDA. Based on recent $215 stock price, our leverage from debt-to-market cap is at 27%. 
In comparison, heading into the great '08 recession, our leverage was 35% at the end of 2007. Therefore, with $1 billion line of credit extended to 2021, unfunded commitments of $230 million, which is below 3% of total market cap and with a light maturity schedule over the next several years, we are well positioned to be opportunistic and to weather any substantial capital market dislocation. 
That concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

And if I missed a piece of your question, please, go ahead and correct me. But our general thesis has been that Northern California has obviously been the strongest market for a long time and Seattle right behind it. But over time, we expected Southern California to slowly improve while Northern California, which was hitting these double-digit NOI growth rates, would slowly decline. I think that we're still anticipating that process to occur, although the resiliency in the tech markets has been a little bit surprising to us, obviously, a positive surprise. And so I think the numbers this year we have -- again, to go to the forecast, the market forecast, we have Northern California at about 7.5%, and our guidance is marginally higher than that. And so we are expecting a little bit of a loss to lease usage. That will be the delta in the 2 different numbers. So does that make sense as it relates to Northern Cal?"

Of course, Q4 was a dip, and it is higher at the end of January than it was at the end of December. Again, you have the impact of what we think happened again, as I mentioned in my comments, we had lumpy supply hitting the market in Q4 in Northern California. And when that happens, some people are trying to lease-up their apartment buildings, becoming more aggressive with respect to concessions and/or rent levels. And when that happens, everyone else adjusts along with it. And again, this is within a period that you always have lower demand for a variety of reasons. And so you have lower demand. You have too much hitting the marketplace, and owners reacting very aggressively. I think that, that, as John Burkart have pointed out is largely the run the course because now demand has returned to normal levels. Some of those lease-ups have adjusted in price. And as a result of what it looks like, it's more or less on track for what we thought was going to happen. So again, from my perspective, the fourth quarter is the least relevant quarter. And I know seems like the analysts focus on it many times over the last 10 years. And I think that they give it too much weight in terms of the overall relevance of the quarter. It's the least relevant. Things can happen just given the slowdown in demand. And I think that's what happened this year, and it's happened many times before."

We're going to be consistent on the buy side, and we're going to be a more aggressive seller. The question is, how we fund that activity. And so we have a co-investment program that if we don't like the stock price, in other words, if we think the stock price implied return is higher than the asset that we buy, we're obviously not going to issue the stock in order to buy it. So we will go into a co-investment-type function. I think, as I look back at many years of doing this, we do best when there's a disruption in the marketplace. And assets can sometimes be mispriced. And if that happens, we want to be ready to do so. Again, I think the chances of exactly where we fund it change everyday, change with the stock price. Based on today's price, obviously, we would not be excited about using our stock. But if you go back 3 months, our stock price and the market in general have been all over the place. And we can't tell you what's going to happen in the future. We just recognize that it's a very volatile period of time, and I guess, we would ask people to trust us to make wise decisions with respect to how we conduct ourselves in the investment markets. It is possible that we won't do nearly that much in acquisitions, if we can't find transactions relative to our cost of capital that makes sense."

The answer is we can't possibly predict. It's all over the place. And it's hard to run a business and enter into transactions that take, what, 60 days to close and expect anything with respect to your stock price. As it relates to Sharon Green, you're right. Originally, we had intended to 1031 exchange around 2/3 of the proceeds, pull forward a dividend in order to create some money that we could use for a stock buyback. We changed the plan when the stock was in the $230 to $240 range and decided to 1031 exchange everything. But that demonstrates how we think about the world. We try to, again, make good decisions with our eye focused on building NAV per share and building cash flow per share. And it's worked out for us really well over a lot of years, and we'll continue doing that doing forward. But to your point, it is incredibly difficult to plan exactly what we're going to do when the world is changing so much. And I would say the same thing is true with respect to our guidance. We issued our market forecast last quarter. Many may argue that the prospects for GDP growth are not nearly as good today as they were just a couple of months ago, but the reality is, who knows? We're using the numbers at economy.com, the 2.8% GDP growth, with the expectation that the economy will improve as we go through 2016. But the reality is we don't know that either. We try to, again, be -- react to the business, keep our eyes focused on the transaction activity out there and then make the decisions. We expect this to be a challenging year from the perspective of uncertainty and volatility. And again, I think that we generally do well in that type of environment, certainly with respect to transaction because things tend to become mispriced and/or they're -- it could cause sellers, for example -- the uncertainty can often cause sellers to become more interested in selling. So maybe we'll see more transactions at the marketplace. I know on the development side, construction side, there are cost increases and other factors have caused development deals to not pencil the way that developers had hoped that they would pencil. And that could lead to some other opportunities in that area. Again, I don't know what's going to happen this year. And to any greater extent, there's so much volatility out there. But we think that we have produced this scenario that makes sense, given the broader environment. And we will see what happens."

I meant Apple in my comments. The tremendous amount of cash is there. The wealth has been created, et cetera. What is the long-term impact of that on the marketplace if you look out 2 or 3 years? And we don't know the answer to that. We think it's pretty positive. And as an example, we can cite what happened when Bill Gates decided to move Microsoft to Seattle and really formed that business in the Seattle market, I think it transformed Seattle in ways that we can't really understand. There are books that are written about this, and we've talked about them before. But again, this incredible wealth generation will increase economic activity. We know that. It will bring the best and brightest people into the marketplaces. And those that own these companies will reinvest those funds in ways that are generally very, very good for the economy. So that is part of the equation that's difficult to predict, if you get beyond 2017 and '18, although I wouldn't count the tech market out of the ballgame with respect to growth rate in '17 and '18 because of this factor. Again, it's hard to understand it exactly right now. But looking at Seattle as an example, I think you'll see continued development in these markets for a longer period of time."

From the BRE perspective as far as the legacy portfolio, we've certainly come a long way. As I mentioned in my remarks, some of the opportunities we still have going forward, specifically with that portfolio relating to amenity refi and the amenity adjustments and expirations. And the expirations have been commented on several times, but for clarity, clearly we can fix that. It was in a 12-month period. As the lease expires, it force things into a certain bucket. The problem is it's not the best thing to do economically. Typically, you're better to work through that over a couple of year period and not force people to take actions that are inconsistent with the market. So we just try to move it on the margin, and that's what we're doing. As it relates to the amenity adjustments, that takes several years to get right and, frankly, on the Essex legacy side, we're still refining that as well, trying to really connect with how the market perceives the different valuations of our similar unit types and make adjustments as an ongoing effort at our company. It just needed a lot more work on the BRE side as they really just started that revenue management process. On the big picture, on the expense side, things aren't pretty good order there. We now have the BRE portfolio, legacy portfolio, performing on the controllable expense basis, means admin and those types of expenses on a per-unit basis, below the Essex portfolio, and that makes sense that portfolio is little newer than ours. And so we've -- but it also a lot of work and we have that in very good order. From a management perspective, we have great people, and that is completely intermixed throughout the portfolio. So there is no Essex or BRE assets there. All Essex assets and how we manage them is almost exactly the same as a few nuance items that are getting cleaned up, but, basically, almost 100% the same. So that's come a long way, and we're very pleased with where that's at. On the renovation, the last big piece, that piece takes time. Again, our renovation program was pretty focused on making sure our product meets the market exactly. It's a very asset-by-asset program. And so we mentioned that we get launched it, which we have. 2016 will have a greater focus on the BRE portfolio as a percentage, then move along the Essex portfolio, and there's a switch from this last year. And we'll continue to explore those opportunities. Hopefully, that answers the question."

Yes, I mean, the one point is that we pretty dramatically outperformed the job forecast last year. So yes, this year, as a forecast, it's pretty similar to last year, but you have the large outperformance in the middle of that, which we didn't expect, obviously. So we're going back to a what we consider to be a more sustainable job forecast. And so going forward, how do we detect the things are different from plan? We would use our own portfolio as being a primary source. Typically, what happens in the portfolio when you look at 30-day Ford availability and some of the other portfolio metrics, you will see dislocation happening more quickly than the data vendors will pick it up generally by 1 or 2 months. So we would generally see that hiccup happening right in the rental activity and Ford affordability. So we'll look for that, and that will be the primary trigger to focus more effort on what's going on. In terms of what we're most concerned about, a lot of people talk about the unicorns out there. And we're less concerned about them, more concerned about the large tech companies, because when you look at the number of employees, it's pretty dramatically different. Again, back to our top 10 tech public companies, there's about -- they have about 165,000 employees in the Bay Area, whereas the top 20 unicorns have about 11,000 employees in the Bay Area. So we are clearly more concerned about the top 10 or the big tech companies, but we're also -- on the flip side, we also recognize that they have such tremendous financial capabilities, again, the amount of cash that they have, the amount of growth that they've generated, the office space that they are leasing and the overall commercial activity. There is nothing to us that appears to be a hiccup in what their activities are, and that is what's really driving or anchoring our forecast for next year."

And again, we prepared this forecast last quarter. So the world was a little bit different then. And we can go through the process of changing the forecast dramatically, but the reality is the world is changing so rapidly that you can't change the forecast every month, which would almost be necessary based on the amount of volatility we've had in the marketplace. But what our process is, we use the macro data for the broad macro numbers, which are U.S. GDP growth and U.S. job growth, and then we drive the more specific market forecast based on our own supply/demand analysis. And Angela has come up with a regression analysis that takes into account various different factors, including both supply and demand. It includes wage growth, for example, as one of the key items, affordability. And so the economic rent growth in our market forecast is Essex proprietary, but it's driven by macro numbers that come from data providers. I think 2.8% is the highest of the data providers, as I recall. Looking at the list, there are some that are in the 1.5% range. Again, we could change this on an ongoing basis, but to what point? I think that the forecast looks achievable. If you look at last year, we missed the GDP forecast, but outperformed on the job side. So is this a perfect science? Obviously, it's not. And it seems like we had resilience on the job growth side relative to historical relationships. And again, I think it goes back to that wealth incredible -- wealth creation that we've had on the West Coast that is really driving economic activity that is disconnecting from a lot of the data going back 5 or 10 years. So I think a lot of things are happening. It seems to us that these are achievable numbers. And again, we'll see. We expect the volatile years. I know everyone knows."

Obviously, the Internet period was an incredible period in terms of that. And for example, you had, I think price-to-sales ratios were something like 49x in year 2000, and they're more like 7 now. So you had an incredible asset bubble with respect to these tech companies, and that went on for a lot longer than anyone expected it to go one and ultimately had a horrific impact of things. I think that, that really is the exception, though. When you look at 2007-2008 or 2008-2009 recession, actually, the tech world did rather well. It was construction, government, manufacturing, except where they did incredibly quarterly and thank everything. I think that's actually more of my belief with respect to the tech world. It's not necessarily the tech world that tends to be so volatile in terms of employment. It's the broader economy. So I don't have necessarily any great fear about tech itself. I have fear about just generally what's happening in the economy, because, I think, actually, tech, with the one notable exception of the Internet boom and bust period, the tech has actually done reasonably well during economic cycles and the downturns."

We know that Southern California, for example, is a more diversified economy and, therefore, will have less dislocation, but again, not the same growth rate either. So if we see significant dislocation in the tech markets, we will obviously try to move more the portfolio southward. There is a small bias toward that, as you saw in the Sharon Green transaction, where we sell Northern California and we reinvest 2/3 Northern California, 1/3 Southern California. I think you will continue to see some of that happen. But again, we're not in a mindset that we need to divest of tech -- the tech market."

And so we will look for opportunities, much like Sharon Green, where we think we can sell an asset and either buy the stock back or pay a special dividend. Both of them are potentially attractive to us. And we want to see some meaningful pickup in terms of impact on NAV per share. So today, that is probably there, but it wasn't there last week.

John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I will cover the following topics on the call: first, comments on Q4 a",1304,"Thank you for joining us today, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I will cover the following topics on the call: first, comments on Q4 and market conditions; and second, commentary on investment activities. 
On to the first topic. Yesterday, we were pleased to report continued strong operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 2015. In the fourth quarter, core FFO per share increased 17% compared to Q4 2014. For the full year, core FFO was $0.42 per share, above the midpoint of the initial 2015 guidance range. For the 5-year period, from the 2010 recessionary trough, we have grown core FFO per share by 96%, increased our dividend nearly 7% per year and led the multifamily REIT industry with an annual total return of 19%. Angela Kleiman will comment on guidance in a moment, which anticipates continued strength into 2016. 
As widely reported, an unanticipated slowdown in rent growth occurred in Q4 in Northern California. Third-party research firms have reacted by lowering rent growth and occupancy expectations for 2016. We believe that the Q4 slowdown does not materially change the 2016 outlook for Northern California for the following reasons. First, we believe that 2015 rent growth in Northern California was greater than anyone expected. I'd say, 2015 was an extraordinary year. This context is important when comparing results because any disruption can appear disappointing. In this case, we expect to go from extraordinary in 2015 to strong in 2016, which is the scenario that we outlined in our 2016 market forecast in connection with our Q3 2015 conference call, and we are now reaffirming that forecast. Specifically, we believe market rents will increase by 7.5% in Northern California in 2016, down from the 2015 average of 10.9%. 
Our second comment relates to the typical seasonality in Q4, which, in my 30 years at Essex, always occurs, although at varying intensity. Demand driven by job growth moderated in Q4, which is typical as many companies wait until after the holidays to add workers. New apartment deliveries will also vary throughout the year, and so above-average deliveries in Q4, along with lower demand, can cause temporary softness until demand recovers, typically by early February. We estimate that Q4 deliveries of apartments in Northern California represented about 44% of the roughly 10,000 apartments delivered in all of 2015 versus 35% and 25% in Q4 '14 and '13, respectively. John Burkart will summarize January results in a moment, given his confidence that the Q4 slowdown is not indicative of a trend.
Our final point relates to our estimation of excess demand relative to supply in 2016. In our market forecast, again unchanged from last quarter, we project the 3 Bay Area counties to generate 2.9% job growth in 2016, significantly lower but still strong relative to the extraordinary job growth of 4.1% for the comparable metros in 2015. That 2.9% Bay Area job growth equates to around 95,000 jobs. Those 95,000 jobs will produce demand for around 47,000 housing units, assuming the typical 2-for-1 relationship between jobs and housing demand. In 2016, we expect the Bay Area to produce around 18,000 homes, both apartments and for sale, which represent only 38% of the demand attributable to job growth. With market occupancy around 96%, expensive single-family homes and demand well in excess of supply, we believe that great pricing power will continue in 2016.
Rental affordability is often mentioned as a possible cause for lower rent growth. However, these are high-income and high-cost areas, and fortunately, incomes in the Bay Area are growing substantially. San Jose, for example, has a median household income of around $102,000 and personal incomes grew by 7.3% in 2014 and are estimated to increase 6.5% and 7.1% in 2015 and 2016, respectively. In Santa Clara County, which includes San Jose, monthly rents in the Essex portfolio average around $2,500 as compared to median rents in San Jose of around $2,200. The median income will allow someone without a roommate to rent either the average Essex apartment or the median price apartment in the metro area. 
Nothing in this discussion should imply that we lack concern about the U.S. economy, recent market volatility or the resiliency of tech jobs, all of which are a risk to our market outlook. If economic conditions worsen, we may not be able to achieve the macro assumptions driving our forecast, including 2.8% U.S. GDP growth and 2% U.S. job growth. We see nothing in our markets that would indicate that tech jobs are imploding. To the contrary, the tech markets continue to do well, as indicated by San Jose's 4.4% December over the -- December year-over-year job growth. Further, our analysis of the largest tech companies indicates that they are growing in market capitalization and generating huge amounts of cash. Who would have thought 10 years ago that Alphabet and Google would be the world's largest listed companies.
A comparison of the top 10 U.S.-based tech companies against the top 10 non-tech companies shows just how much the world has changed. The top 10 tech companies are worth around $2.8 trillion, 21% more than the nontechs, and have $556 billion in cash, more than twice as much as the nontechs. Approximately $1.8 trillion of the equity capitalization of the tech leaders was created in the past 10 years, over 3x the nontech. 
Finally, while only 3 of the non-tech leaders are based in the Essex market, all of the tech leaders are headquartered on the West Coast. We clearly don't see the end of large investments in technology in the foreseeable future, and believe that our portfolio is well positioned for this continued growth. 
To the second topic, investment activity. So far, acquisition markets have experienced little impact from global economic conditions. Cap rates have not moved much. At this point, A-quality property and locations trade at around a 4 1/4 cap rate using the Essex methodology, but more aggressive buyers are often sub-4. B-quality property and locations typically have cap rates 25 to 50 basis points higher than A-quality property.
We are seeing 3 significant headwinds affecting development in the West Coast markets, which we believe will moderate apartment supply going forward. First, construction lenders are sizing construction loans based on loan-to-cost ratios of between 60% to 65%, down about 5% from a few months ago. Second, cities continue to increase demands from developers in the form of low-income housing units, higher fees and costly improvement. Finally, construction costs have increased around 10% in each of the past 2 years, despite declining commodity prices as skilled labor forces are inadequate to meet related construction activity. Obviously, the slower housing supply is beneficial to the Essex portfolio overall. 
As previously announced, we sold the 296-unit Sharon Green Apartments in Northern California for $245 million or $828,000 per unit and at a cap rate in the high 3% range. We used 1031 exchanges to reinvest the proceed to Sharon Green into 3 properties that are detailed in the press release. We estimate that core FFO will increase by approximately $1 million in 2016 as a result of these transactions. 
Our business plan for investments is outlined in the press release. We hope that economic uncertainty will bring more transactions to the market and that financing rates will be attractive. Depending upon the stock price, acquisitions may be funded as part of our co-investment program or on our balance sheet. We currently have 2 properties in contract to be sold. Similarly, the use of proceeds from dispositions will also be strongly influenced by the stock price. 
That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call today. Now, I'll turn the call over to John Burkart."

Our results exceeded our initial revenue guidance in all 3 regions for the combined Essex BRE portfolio, and expenses were favorable to guidance, leading to an exceptional 10.7% NOI growth, the highest in 15 years. 
Our outperformance was attributable to job growth exceeding expectations and lower-than-expected housing supply. As of December 2015, our markets added 361,000 jobs compared to December 2014, 40 basis points higher than our original projection of 2.5%. A total of 63,000 new units of supply, both multifamily and single-family, was delivered into the markets in 2015. That's about 6,900 units below our original forecast, largely for the reasons that Mike mentioned, including labor shortages, municipal delays, rising costs and more stringent lender underwriting. The supply-demand imbalance is the key factor behind our market's strength. We estimate, assuming 2 jobs create 1 unit demand for housing, that the 331,000 jobs created is equivalent to about 165,000 units of housing demand compared to only 63,000 units of new supply delivered, meaning demand exceeded supply by over 2.5x. 
The fourth quarter, which is the low point in seasonal demand and rental rate in our market, was relatively strong across all 3 regions, with a 7.5% increase in gross revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Achieved rent on new leases were up 8.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
We've made great progress in our management of the BRE portfolio. However, we still have more work to do with respect to refining unit, amenity pricing, lease expiration management and renovation. Therefore, for the purpose of comparable sequential results, the Essex legacy portfolio provides the best insight. Adjusted for occupancy changes, the Essex portfolio achieved 1.6% sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2015, the same as 2014. 
We continue to find opportunities with our renovation program. We increased the number of units renovated in the same-store portfolio 143%, from 254 units in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 618 units in the fourth quarter of 2015. The scope of the unit turns are site-specific based on opportunities in the marketplace. 
Now I will share some highlights for each region. The Seattle market continues to absorb new supply and push rents outside the CBD higher. Revenues for our Seattle CBD portfolio increased 5.3%, while revenue for the majority of our portfolio, which is located on the east side near Bellevue and Redmond, grew 8.3% for the fourth quarter compared to the prior year's quarter.
According to AXIO, the Seattle market had the strongest year since the Great Recession, ending the year with approximately 8% year-over-year rental growth as of December 2015. 
In the Bay Area, the successful technology companies continue to lease or pursue space to grow their company. The technology-driven San Francisco Peninsula and Silicon Valley markets absorbed over 1 million square feet of space in each of the -- in each -- in the fourth quarter of 2015 or 50% of the total absorption for 2015.
Alphabet leased space in Alameda, North San Jose, Shoreline. YouTube, a division of Alphabet, leased space in San Bruno. And Microsoft recently submitted plans for a new campus in Mountain View, with construction expected to begin next year. 
Southern California region continues to be strong, driven by solid job growth in each market. The 8.4% NOI growth rate achieved in 2015 was the highest in 15 years. We expect momentum we saw in 2015 to continue into 2016, given the limited new supply in the Southern California region, although we do expect some challenges in the Downtown L.A. as that local market absorbs the planned deliveries. Rental increases in the San Diego market have increased each year since 2010 and ended the year up 7% over the prior year, according to AXIO. 
I'm pleased with our 2015 results. And although I recognize the real economic risks and concerns in the marketplace, the current conditions that we are experiencing in our market gives me confidence that we will achieve our plan outlined in the guidance. 
Our portfolio occupancy as of February 2 is at 96.1%, consistent with our budget. And our net availability of 30 days stands at 5.3%. We are positioned well to take advantage of the spring rental season. 
Looking forward into 2016, we again expect demand to substantially exceed supply in our markets by over 2x, leading to continued rental market strength. In January of 2016, our average achieved rent for new leases for our 3 regions was 2.4% above our achieved rent in December of 2015, consistent with our budget. I think our momentum positions us well for 2016.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman."
332646,322631916,928292,"Essex Property Trust Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2016",2016-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Essex Property Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Today, I will briefly review 2015 results, then focus on 2016 guidance and provide a balance sheet update.

Today, I will briefly review 2015 results, then focus on 2016 guidance and provide a balance sheet update. 
For 2015, I'm pleased to report that our same-property revenue growth for the full year was 8%, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. Same-property revenue growth and NOI growth for the combined portfolio, which consists of the last 3 quarters of the year, was 7.6% and 10.1%, respectively. Both of these also exceeded the midpoint of our most recent guidance. 
On to 2016. We anticipate another strong year with 11% projected core FFO per share growth, primarily driven by same-property growth assumptions. Our top line growth of 7% at the midpoint reflects our expectation of continued favorable supply/demand relationship. For reference, business volume is 25 basis points higher than our initial guidance for 2015, which was 6.75%. 
We are projecting higher operating expense growth of 3.75% at the midpoint. Controllable expenses are expected to increase modestly at around 1% for the year. Therefore, the 2 key drivers to expense increases are as follows: first, higher utility costs. Know that 2015 utility cost increase was only 0.3%. So very muted, primarily due to water conservation. And second, an increase in our allocation to property management expense. This is consistent with what we've previously communicated. We will review this allocation on a regular basis in conjunction with our transformation plan. The new management fee allocation equates to 2.4% of revenues, which is less than 3% commonly used within the industry. The resulting bottom line is that we are expecting another strong year, with 8.5% NOI growth at the midpoint. 
As for G&A, the increase by 5% of the midpoint is primarily due to our new corporate headquarters lease. The offset to this expense, as discussed on a previous call, is the yield from reinvesting the proceeds from the sale of our former Palo Alto headquarters. Thereby, the resulting net impact to FFO is about $0.01 per share. 
For the first quarter this year, we are projecting core FFO per share at the midpoint to be $0.03 below fourth quarter of last year. The reduction is attributed to onetime items such as favorable variance in the fourth quarter and property tax for the legacy BRE portfolio, generating $0.04 of core FFO per share. In addition, we have recently sold several properties, including Sharon Green, and have not fully redeployed its proceeds. The result is $0.01 per share drag on the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year. 
Other assumptions to our guidance can be found on Page 5 of the press release and S-14 of the supplemental. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We repaid $150 million of private placement bonds in January and have assumed an unsecured bond offering in our guidance for 2016. The only noteworthy maturity remaining in 2016 is the $200 million term loan in the fourth quarter. We have several options available to refinance this debt, which allows us to be opportunistic. 
We generally favor refinancing of maturities with unsecured debt that is 5 to 10 year in terms depending on the interest rate curve and the related spreads. 
Lastly, we are ahead of our scheduled in reducing our net debt-to-EBITDA to 5.8x due to substantial growth in EBITDA. Based on recent $215 stock price, our leverage from debt-to-market cap is at 27%. 
In comparison, heading into the great '08 recession, our leverage was 35% at the end of 2007. Therefore, with $1 billion line of credit extended to 2021, unfunded commitments of $230 million, which is below 3% of total market cap and with a light maturity schedule over the next several years, we are well positioned to be opportunistic and to weather any potential capital market dislocation. 
That concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

I think that we're still anticipating that process to occur, although the resiliency in the tech markets has been a little bit surprising to us, obviously, a positive surprise. And so I think the numbers this year we have -- again, to go to the forecast, the market forecast, we have Northern California at about 7.5%, and our guidance is marginally higher than that. And so we are expecting a little bit of a loss to lease usage. That will be the delta in the 2 different numbers. So does that make sense as it relates to Northern Cal?"

Of course, Q4 was a dip, and it is higher at the end of January than it was at the end of December. Again, you have the impact of what we think happened again, as I mentioned in my comments, we had lumpy supply hitting the market in Q4 in Northern California. And when that happens, some people are trying to lease-up their apartment buildings become more aggressive with respect to concessions and/or rent levels. And when that happens, everyone else adjusts along with it. And again, this is within a period that you always have lower demand for a variety of reasons. And so you have lower demand. You have too much hitting the marketplace, and owners reacting very aggressively. I think that, that, as John Burkart has pointed out is largely the run the course because now demand has returned to normal levels. Some of those lease-ups have adjusted in price. And as a result of what it looks like, it's more or less on track for what we thought was going to happen. So again, from my perspective, the fourth quarter is the least relevant quarter. And I know seems like the analysts focus on it many times over the last 10 years. And I think that they give it too much weight in terms of the overall relevance of the quarter. It's the least relevant. Things can happen just given the slowdown in demand. And I think that's what happened this year, and it's happened many times before."

We're going to be consistent on the buy side, and we're going to be a more aggressive seller. The question is how we fund that activity. And so we have a co-investment program that if we don't like the stock price, in other words, if we think the stock price implied return is higher than the asset that we buy, we're obviously not going to issue the stock in order to buy it. So we will go into a co-investment-type function. I think, as I look back at many years of doing this, we do best when there's a disruption in the marketplace. And assets can sometimes be mispriced. And if that happens, we want to be ready to do so. Again, I think the chances of exactly where we fund it change every day, change with the stock price. Based on today's price, obviously, we would not be excited about using our stock. But if you go back 3 months, our stock price and the market in general have been all over the place. And we can't tell you what's going to happen in the future. We just recognize that it's a very volatile period of time, and I guess, we would ask people to trust us to make wise decisions with respect to how we conduct ourselves in the investment markets. It is possible that we won't do nearly that much in acquisitions if we can't find transactions relative to our cost of capital that make sense."

The answer is we can't possibly predict. It's all over the place. And it's hard to run a business and enter into transactions that take, what, 60 days to close and expect anything with respect to your stock price. As it relates to Sharon Green, you're right. Originally, we had intended to 1031 exchange around 2/3 of the proceeds, pull forward a dividend in order to create some money that we could use for a stock buyback. We changed the plan when the stock was in the $230 to $240 range and decided to 1031 exchange everything. But that demonstrates how we think about the world. We try to, again, make good decisions with our eye focused on building NAV per share and building cash flow per share. And it's worked out for us really well over a lot of years, and we'll continue doing that doing forward. But to your point, it is incredibly difficult to plan exactly what we're going to do when the world is changing so much. And I would say the same thing is true with respect to our guidance. We issued our market forecast last quarter. Many may argue that the prospects for GDP growth are not nearly as good today as they were just a couple of months ago, but the reality is, who knows? We're using a numbers at economy.com, the 2.8% GDP growth, with the expectation that the economy will improve as we go through 2016. But the reality is we don't know that either. We try to, again, be -- react to the business, keep our eyes focused on the transaction activity out there and then make the decisions. We expect this to be a challenging year from the perspective of uncertainty and volatility. And again, I think that we generally do well in that type of environment, certainly with respect to transaction because things tend to become mispriced and/or they're -- it could cause sellers, for example -- the uncertainty can often cause sellers to become more interested in selling. So maybe we'll see more transactions at the marketplace. I know on the development side, construction side, there are cost increases and other factors have caused development deals to not pencil the way that developers had hoped that they would pencil. And that could lead to some other opportunities in that area. Again, I don't know what's going to happen this year. And to any great extent, there's so much volatility out there. But we think that we have produced this scenario that makes sense, given the broader environment. And we will see what happens."

But I will say that the point that I made in my comments about what is the impact of, well, this incredible wealth has been created by Alphabet. And I think I said Google. I meant Apple in my comments. The tremendous amount of cash is there. The wealth has been created, et cetera. What is the long-term impact of that on the marketplace if you look out 2 or 3 years? And we don't know the answer to that. We think it's pretty positive. And as an example, we can cite what happened when Bill Gates decided to move Microsoft to Seattle and really formed that business in the Seattle market, I think it transformed Seattle in ways that we can't really understand. There are books that are written about this, and we've talked about them before. But again, this incredible wealth generation will increase economic activity. We know that. It will bring the best and brightest people into the marketplaces. And those that own these companies will reinvest those funds in ways that are generally very, very good for the economy. So that is part of the equation that's difficult to predict as you get beyond 2017 and '18, although I wouldn't count the tech market out of the ballgame with respect to growth rate in '17 and '18 because of this factor.

And that concept is an exchange for a very small fee to the landlord. That is really their goal. From my perspective, there's a couple of issues out there that are pretty important, which includes in municipalities who commonly forbid this. So that would be another issue. And really the biggest issue is our resident satisfaction for our current residents.

And in that case, we -- our velocity went down a little bit. But again, all of this is according to plan. So overall, we finished up the 1 South Market lease-up in the quarter. Epic, we're very close. We're over 90%. And MB360 is flying along, as you can see. The concern that people had, we certainly share, we read the papers and we listen, reached out to an awful lot of people, and of course, including the managers that are running the lease-ups and had good conversations with all of them. And their view was this is really consistent with seasonal issues, with some level of -- as far as demand goes, and then the supply impacting the rents. So hopefully that helps. And I'll let John talk about planned development."

From the BRE perspective as far as the legacy portfolio, we've certainly come a long way. As I mentioned in my remarks, some of the opportunities we still have going forward, specifically with that portfolio relating to amenity refi and the amenity adjustments and expirations. And the expirations have been commented on several times, but for clarity, clearly we can fix that. It was in a 12-month period. As the lease expires, it forced things into a certain bucket. The problem is it's not the best thing to do economically. Typically, you're better to work through that over a couple of year period and not force people to take actions that are inconsistent with the market. So we just try to move it on the margin, and that's what we're doing. As it relates to the amenity adjustments, that takes several years to get right and, frankly, on the Essex legacy side, we're still refining that as well, trying to really connect with how the market perceives the different valuations of our similar unit types and make adjustments as an ongoing effort at our company. It just needed a lot more work on the BRE side as they really just started that revenue management process. On the big picture, on the expense side, things are in pretty good order there. We now have the BRE portfolio, legacy portfolio, performing on the controllable expense basis, maintenance, admin and those types of expenses on a per-unit basis, below the Essex portfolio. And that makes sense. That portfolio is little newer than ours. And so we've put in an awful lot of work and we have that in very good order. From a management perspective, we have great people, and that is completely intermixed throughout the portfolio. So there is no Essex or BRE assets. They are all Essex assets, and how we manage them is almost exactly the same as a few nuanced items that are getting cleaned up, but, basically, almost 100% the same. So that's come a long way, and we're very pleased with where that's at. On the renovation, the last big piece, that piece takes time. Again, our renovation program, we’re pretty focused on making sure our product meets the market exactly. It's a very asset-by-asset program. And so we mentioned that we had launched it, which we have. 2016 will have a greater focus on the BRE portfolio as a percentage, then move along the Essex portfolio, and that’s a switch from this last year. And we'll continue to explore those opportunities. Hopefully, that answers the question."

First, Mike, I appreciate your comments on tech and the jobs out there in your opening remarks.

And yet, obviously, the news headlines today are clearly fresher than they were a year ago, but Twitter, Yahoo!, you see some of these companies that are in the news, whether for business model issues or space giveback on their office use. I'm just trying to reconcile the 2. What would be the things that you guys would look for that would tell you something is happening, a red flag out there that would tell you that things may be changing, because the outlook that you gave in your job picture is a bit different than sort of the sentiment, if you read the newspapers or speak to folks, not your folks, but speak to the -- on this side of the country."

Yes, I mean, the one point is that we pretty dramatically outperformed the job forecast last year. So yes, this year, as a forecast, it's pretty similar to last year, but you have the large outperformance in the middle of that, which we didn't expect, obviously. So we're going back to a what we consider to be a more sustainable job forecast. And so going forward, how do we detect that things are different from plan? We would use our own portfolio as being a primary source. Typically, what happens in the portfolio when you look at 30-day forward availability and some of the other portfolio metrics, you will see dislocation happening more quickly than the data vendors will pick it up generally by 1 or 2 months. So we would generally see that hiccup happening right in the rental activity and forward availability. So we'll look for that, and that will be the primary trigger to focus more effort on what's going on. In terms of what we're most concerned about, a lot of people talk about the unicorns out there. And we're less concerned about them, more concerned about the large tech companies, because when you look at the number of employees, it's pretty dramatically different. Again, back to our top 10 tech public companies, there's about -- they have about 165,000 employees in the Bay Area, whereas the top 20 unicorns have about 11,000 employees in the Bay Area. So we are clearly more concerned about the top 10 or the big tech companies, but we're also -- on the flip side, we also recognize that they have such tremendous financial capabilities, again, the amount of cash that they have, the amount of growth that they've generated, the office space that they are leasing and the overall commercial activity. There is nothing to us that appears to be a hiccup in what their activities are, and that is what's really driving or anchoring our forecast for next year."

They were pulling back in their office lease in the East Coast. But when we looked at the big picture, we also recognized that they expanded their office space here, close to headquarters. So there's been a conscious decision to try to be more centralized. But net office space concern, they have not decreased and they add in. The news about Yahoo! laying off 1,700 employees. But what we also saw was the Sony PlayStation entertainment moving their headquarters from Japan to San Mateo and expanding, obviously, the office needs and which will bring in another what we would expect 700 to 800 or hiring 700 to 800 new employees. So that’s the context."

And from our perspective, that's going to require people that are working in the Downtown, but living somewhere else to relocate to the Downtown. And we expect that to be somewhat choppy. But the overall supply/demand of L.A. is incredibly positive to us. Los Angeles County produces somewhere around 0.5% or 0.6% of its stock every year.

And again, we prepared this forecast last quarter. So the world was a little bit different then. And we can go through the process of changing the forecast dramatically, but the reality is the world is changing so rapidly that you can't change the forecast every month, which would almost be necessary based on the amount of volatility we've had in the marketplace. But what our process is, we use the macro data for the broad macro numbers, which are U.S. GDP growth and U.S. job growth, and then we drive the more specific market forecast based on our own supply/demand analysis. And Angela has come up with a regression analysis that takes into account various different factors, including both supply and demand. It includes wage growth, for example, as one of the key items, affordability. And so the economic rent growth in our market forecast is Essex proprietary, but it's driven by macro numbers that come from data providers. I think 2.8% is the highest of the data providers, as I recall. Looking at the list, there are some that are in the 1.5% range. Again, we could change this on an ongoing basis, but to what point? I think that the forecast looks achievable. If you look at last year, we missed the GDP forecast, but outperformed on the job side. So is this a perfect science? Obviously, it's not. And it seems like we had resilience on the job growth side relative to historical relationships. And again, I think it goes back to that wealth -- incredible wealth creation that we've had on the West Coast that is really driving economic activity that is disconnecting from a lot of the data going back 5 or 10 years. So I think a lot of things are happening. It seems to us that these are achievable numbers. And again, we'll see. We expect a volatile year, as I know everyone knows."

And when it comes to the unknowables, I have to go back and maybe summarize what I've seen in the last 30 years as it relates to Northern California. And I've seen huge dislocation and disruption. Obviously, the Internet period was an incredible period in terms of that. And for example, you had, I think price-to-sales ratios were something like 49x in year 2000, and they're more like 7 now. So you had an incredible asset bubble with respect to these tech companies, and that went on for a lot longer than anyone expected it to go on and ultimately had a horrific impact of things. I think that, that really is the exception, though. When you look at 2007-2008 or 2008-2009 recession, actually, the tech world did rather well. It was construction, government, manufacturing, except where they did incredibly poorly and tanked everything. I think that that's actually more of my belief with respect to the tech world. It's not necessarily the tech world that tends to be so volatile in terms of employment. It's the broader economy. So I don't have necessarily any great fear about tech itself. I have fear about just generally what's happening in the economy, because, I think, actually, tech, with the one notable exception of the Internet boom and bust period, the tech has actually done reasonably well during the economic cycles and the downturns."

I mean, what are you going to -- you can pay in cash at 20 basis points or something like that. But I mean, as we look at the industries and what's happening in the world, it seems like tech is actually pretty well positioned relative to some of the other choices. We know that Southern California, for example, is a more diversified economy and, therefore, will have less dislocation, but again, not the same growth rate either. So if we see significant dislocation in the tech markets, we will obviously try to move more of the portfolio southward. There is a small bias toward that, as you saw in the Sharon Green transaction, where we sell Northern California and we reinvest 2/3 Northern California, 1/3 Southern California. I think you will continue to see some of that happen. But again, we're not in a mindset that we need to divest of tech -- the tech market."

And unfortunately, that's probably not going to happen this year. And so -- but we will look for opportunities, much like Sharon Green, where we think we can sell an asset and either buy the stock back or pay a special dividend. Both of them are potentially attractive to us. And we want to see some meaningful pickup in terms of impact on NAV per share. So today, that is probably there, but it wasn't there last week. And again, the trend -- it takes, what, 60 to 90 days to actually go through the transaction process. And then you have got to work through the reinvestment plan. So we're trying to do the best we can. I will tell you that we will sell more assets this year than we sold for the last several years. And I think that, that will continue to trend. And we'll look for both really 2 different things: one, pairing off the assets that we think will underperform over the longer period, which will probably be in the higher cap rate type of area, but then the more opportunistic, much like Sharon Green asset that traded at a very attractive, very aggressive cap rate that we can redeploy at a positive spread.

John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I will cover the following topics on the call: first, comments on Q4 and market conditions; and second, commentary on investment activities. 
On to the first topic. Yesterday, we were pleased to report continued strong operating results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 2015. In the fourth quarter, core FFO per share increased 17% compared to Q4 2014. For the full year, core FFO was $0.42 per share, above the midpoint of the initial 2015 guidance range. For the 5-year period, from the 2010 recessionary trough, we have grown core FFO per share by 96%, increased our dividend nearly 7% per year and led the multifamily REIT industry with an annual total return of 19%. Angela Kleiman will comment on guidance in a moment, which anticipates continued strength into 2016. 
As widely reported, an unanticipated slowdown in rent growth occurred in Q4 in Northern California. Third-party research firms have reacted by lowering rent growth and occupancy expectations for 2016. We believe that the Q4 slowdown does not materially change the 2016 outlook for Northern California for the following reasons. First, we believe that 2015 rent growth in Northern California was greater than anyone expected. I'd say, 2015 was an extraordinary year. This context is important when comparing results because any disruption can appear disappointing. In this case, we expect to go from extraordinary in 2015 to strong in 2016, which is the scenario that we outlined in our 2016 market forecast in connection with our Q3 2015 conference call, and we are now reaffirming that forecast. Specifically, we believe market rents will increase by 7.5% in Northern California in 2016, down from the 2015 average of 10.9%. 
Our second comment relates to the typical seasonality in Q4, which, in my 30 years at Essex, always occurs, although at varying intensity. Demand driven by job growth moderated in Q4, which is typical as many companies wait until after the holidays to add workers. New apartment deliveries will also vary throughout the year, and so above-average deliveries in Q4, along with lower demand, can cause temporary softness until demand recovers, typically by early February. We estimate that Q4 deliveries of apartments in Northern California represented about 44% of the roughly 10,000 apartments delivered in all of 2015 versus 35% and 25% in Q4 '14 and '13, respectively. John Burkart will summarize January results in a moment, given his confidence that the Q4 slowdown is not indicative of a trend.
Our final point relates to our estimation of excess demand relative to supply in 2016. In our market forecast, again unchanged from last quarter, we project the 3 Bay Area counties to generate 2.9% job growth in 2016, significantly lower but still strong relative to the extraordinary job growth of 4.1% for the comparable metros in 2015. That 2.9% Bay Area job growth equates to around 95,000 jobs. Those 95,000 jobs will produce demand for around 47,000 housing units, assuming the typical 2-for-1 relationship between jobs and housing demand. In 2016, we expect the Bay Area to produce around 18,000 homes, both apartments and for sale, which represent only 38% of the demand attributable to job growth. With market occupancy around 96%, expensive single-family homes and demand well in excess of supply, we believe that great pricing power will continue in 2016.
Rental affordability is often mentioned as a possible cause for lower rent growth. However, these are high-income and high-cost areas, and fortunately, incomes in the Bay Area are growing substantially. San Jose, for example, has a median household income of around $102,000 and personal incomes grew by 7.3% in 2014 and are estimated to increase 6.5% and 7.1% in 2015 and 2016, respectively. In Santa Clara County, which includes San Jose, monthly rents in the Essex portfolio average around $2,500 as compared to median rents in San Jose of around $2,200. The median income will allow someone without a roommate to rent either the average Essex apartment or the median price apartment in the metro area. 
Nothing in this discussion should imply that we lack concern about the U.S. economy, recent market volatility or the resiliency of tech jobs, all of which are a risk to our market outlook. If economic conditions worsen, we may not be able to achieve the macro assumptions driving our forecast, including 2.8% U.S. GDP growth and 2% U.S. job growth. We see nothing in our markets that would indicate that tech jobs are imploding. To the contrary, the tech markets continue to do well, as indicated by San Jose's 4.4% December over the -- December year-over-year job growth. Further, our analysis of the largest tech companies indicates that they are growing in market capitalization and generating huge amounts of cash. Who would have thought 10 years ago that Alphabet and Google would be the world's largest listed companies.
A comparison of the top 10 U.S.-based tech companies against the top 10 non-tech companies shows just how much the world has changed. The top 10 tech companies are worth around $2.8 trillion, 21% more than the nontechs, and have $556 billion in cash, more than twice as much as the nontechs. Approximately $1.8 trillion of the equity capitalization of the tech leaders was created in the past 10 years, over 3x the nontech. 
Finally, while only 3 of the non-tech leaders are based in the Essex market, all of the tech leaders are headquartered on the West Coast. We clearly don't see the end of large investments in technology in the foreseeable future, and believe that our portfolio is well positioned for this continued growth. 
To the second topic, investment activity. So far, acquisition markets have experienced little impact from global economic conditions. Cap rates have not moved much. At this point, A-quality property and locations trade at around a 4 1/4 cap rate using the Essex methodology, but more aggressive buyers are often sub-4. B-quality property and locations typically have cap rates 25 to 50 basis points higher than A-quality property.
We are seeing 3 significant headwinds affecting development in the West Coast markets, which we believe will moderate apartment supply going forward. First, construction lenders are sizing construction loans based on loan-to-cost ratios of between 60% to 65%, down about 5% from a few months ago. Second, cities continue to increase demands from developers in the form of low-income housing units, higher fees and costly improvement. Finally, construction costs have increased around 10% in each of the past 2 years, despite declining commodity prices as skilled labor forces are inadequate to meet related construction activity. Obviously, the slower housing supply is beneficial to the Essex portfolio overall. 
As previously announced, we sold the 296-unit Sharon Green Apartments in Northern California for $245 million or $828,000 per unit and at a cap rate in the high 3% range. We used 1031 exchanges to reinvest the proceed to Sharon Green into 3 properties that are detailed in the press release. We estimate that core FFO will increase by approximately $1 million in 2016 as a result of these transactions. 
Our business plan for investments is outlined in the press release. We hope that economic uncertainty will bring more transactions to the market and that financing rates will be attractive. Depending upon the stock price, acquisitions may be funded as part of our co-investment program or on our balance sheet. We currently have 2 properties in contract to be sold. Similarly, the use of proceeds from dispositions will also be strongly influenced by the stock price. 
That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call today. Now I'll turn the call over to John Burkart."

Our results exceeded our initial revenue guidance in all 3 regions for the combined Essex BRE portfolio, and expenses were favorable to guidance, leading to an exceptional 10.7% NOI growth, the highest in 15 years. 
Our outperformance was attributable to job growth exceeding expectations and lower-than-expected housing supply. As of December 2015, our markets added 361,000 jobs compared to December 2014, 40 basis points higher than our original projection of 2.5%. A total of 63,000 new units of supply, both multifamily and single-family, was delivered into the markets in 2015. That's about 6,900 units below our original forecast, largely for the reasons that Mike mentioned, including labor shortages, municipal delays, rising costs and more stringent lender underwriting. The supply-demand imbalance is the key factor behind our market's strength. We estimate, assuming 2 jobs create 1 unit demand for housing, that the 331,000 jobs created is equivalent to about 165,000 units of housing demand compared to only 63,000 units of new supply delivered, meaning demand exceeded supply by over 2.5x. 
The fourth quarter, which is the low point in seasonal demand and rental rate in our market, was relatively strong across all 3 regions, with a 7.5% increase in gross revenue compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Achieved rent on new leases were up 8.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. 
We've made great progress in our management of the BRE portfolio. However, we still have more work to do with respect to refining unit, amenity pricing, lease expiration management and renovation. Therefore, for the purpose of comparable sequential results, the Essex legacy portfolio provides the best insight. Adjusted for occupancy changes, the Essex portfolio achieved 1.6% sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2015, the same as 2014. 
We continue to find opportunities with our renovation program. We increased the number of units renovated in the same-store portfolio 143%, from 254 units in the fourth quarter of 2014 to 618 units in the fourth quarter of 2015. The scope of the unit turns are site-specific based on opportunities in the marketplace. 
Now I will share some highlights for each region. The Seattle market continues to absorb new supply and push rents outside the CBD higher. Revenues for our Seattle CBD portfolio increased 5.3%, while revenue for the majority of our portfolio, which is located on the east side near Bellevue and Redmond, grew 8.3% for the fourth quarter compared to the prior year's quarter.
According to AXIO, the Seattle market had the strongest year since the Great Recession, ending the year with approximately 8% year-over-year rental growth as of December 2015. 
In the Bay Area, the successful technology companies continue to lease or pursue space to grow their company. The technology-driven San Francisco Peninsula and Silicon Valley markets absorbed over 1 million square feet of space in each of the -- in each -- in the fourth quarter of 2015 or 50% of the total absorption for 2015.
Alphabet leased space in Alameda, North San Jose, Shoreline. YouTube, a division of Alphabet, leased space in San Bruno. And Microsoft recently submitted plans for a new campus in Mountain View, with construction expected to begin next year. 
Southern California region continues to be strong, driven by solid job growth in each market. The 8.4% NOI growth rate achieved in 2015 was the highest in 15 years. We expect momentum we saw in 2015 to continue into 2016, given the limited new supply in the Southern California region, although we do expect some challenges in the Downtown L.A. as that local market absorbs the planned deliveries. Rental increases in the San Diego market have increased each year since 2010 and ended the year up 7% over the prior year, according to AXIO. 
I'm pleased with our 2015 results. And although I recognize the real economic risks and concerns in the marketplace, the current conditions that we are experiencing in our market gives me confidence that we will achieve our plan outlined in the guidance. 
Our portfolio occupancy as of February 2 is at 96.1%, consistent with our budget. And our net availability of 30 days stands at 5.3%. We are positioned well to take advantage of the spring rental season. 
Looking forward into 2016, we again expect demand to substantially exceed supply in our markets by over 2x, leading to continued rental market strength. In January of 2016, our average achieved rent for new leases for our 3 regions was 2.4% above our achieved rent in December of 2015, consistent with our budget. I think our momentum positions us well for 2016.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman."
332646,322631916,928661,"Essex Property Trust Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2016",2016-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Essex Property Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John. Today, I will briefly review 2015 results, then focus on 2016 guidance and provide a balance sheet update.

Today, I will briefly review 2015 results, then focus on 2016 guidance and provide a balance sheet update. 
For 2015, I'm pleased to report that our same-property revenue growth for the full year was 8%, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. Same-property revenue growth and NOI growth for the combined portfolio, which consists of the last 3 quarters of the year, was 7.6% and 10.1%, respectively. Both of these also exceeded the midpoint of our most recent guidance. 
On to 2016. We anticipate another strong year with 11% projected core FFO per share growth, primarily driven by same-property growth assumptions. Our top line growth of 7% at the midpoint reflects our expectation of continued favorable supply/demand relationship. For reference, business volume is 25 basis points higher than our initial guidance for 2015, which was 6.75%. 
We are projecting higher operating expense growth of 3.75% at the midpoint. Controllable expenses are expected to increase modestly at around 1% for the year. Therefore, the 2 key drivers to expense increases are as follows: first, higher utility costs. Know that 2015 utility cost increase was only 0.3%. So very muted, primarily due to water conservation. And second, an increase in our allocation to property management expense. This is consistent with what we've previously communicated. We will review this allocation on a regular basis in conjunction with our transformation plan. The new management fee allocation equates to 2.4% of revenues, which is less than 3% commonly used within the industry. The resulting bottom line is that we are expecting another strong year, with 8.5% NOI growth at the midpoint. 
As for G&A, the increase by 5% of the midpoint is primarily due to our new corporate headquarters lease. The offset to this expense, as discussed on a previous call, is the yield from reinvesting the proceeds from the sale of our former Palo Alto headquarters. Thereby, the resulting net impact to FFO is about $0.01 per share. 
For the first quarter this year, we are projecting core FFO per share at the midpoint to be $0.03 below fourth quarter of last year. The reduction is attributed to onetime items such as favorable variance in the fourth quarter and property tax for the legacy BRE portfolio, generating $0.04 of core FFO per share. In addition, we have recently sold several properties, including Sharon Green, and have not fully redeployed its proceeds. The result is $0.01 per share drag on the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter of last year. 
Other assumptions to our guidance can be found on Page 5 of the press release and S-14 of the supplemental. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. We repaid $150 million of private placement bonds in January and have assumed an unsecured bond offering in our guidance for 2016. The only noteworthy maturity remaining in 2016 is the $200 million term loan in the fourth quarter. We have several options available to refinance this debt, which allows us to be opportunistic. 
We generally favor refinancing of maturities with unsecured debt that is 5 to 10 year in terms depending on the interest rate curve and the related spreads. 
Lastly, we are ahead of our scheduled in reducing our net debt-to-EBITDA to 5.8x due to substantial growth in EBITDA. Based on recent $215 stock price, our leverage from debt-to-market cap is at 27%. 
In comparison, heading into the great '08 recession, our leverage was 35% at the end of 2007. Therefore, with $1 billion line of credit extended to 2021, unfunded commitments of $230 million, which is below 3% of total market cap and with a light maturity schedule over the next several years, we are well positioned to be opportunistic and to weather any potential capital market dislocation. 
That concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

I think that we're still anticipating that process to occur, although the resiliency in the tech markets has been a little bit surprising to us, obviously, a positive surprise. And so I think the numbers this year we have -- again, to go to the forecast, the market forecast, we have Northern California at about 7.5%, and our guidance is marginally higher than that. And so we are expecting a little bit of a loss to lease usage. That will be the delta in the 2 different numbers. So does that make sense as it relates to Northern Cal?"

Of course, Q4 was a dip, and it is higher at the end of January than it was at the end of December. Again, you have the impact of what we think happened again, as I mentioned in my comments, we had lumpy supply hitting the market in Q4 in Northern California. And when that happens, some people are trying to lease-up their apartment buildings become more aggressive with respect to concessions and/or rent levels. And when that happens, everyone else adjusts along with it. And again, this is within a period that you always have lower demand for a variety of reasons. And so you have lower demand. You have too much hitting the marketplace, and owners reacting very aggressively. I think that, that, as John Burkart has pointed out is largely the run the course because now demand has returned to normal levels. Some of those lease-ups have adjusted in price. And as a result of what it looks like, it's more or less on track for what we thought was going to happen. So again, from my perspective, the fourth quarter is the least relevant quarter. And I know seems like the analysts focus on it many times over the last 10 years. And I think that they give it too much weight in terms of the overall relevance of the quarter. It's the least relevant. Things can happen just given the slowdown in demand. And I think that's what happened this year, and it's happened many times before."

So we will go into a co-investment-type function. I think, as I look back at many years of doing this, we do best when there's a disruption in the marketplace. And assets can sometimes be mispriced. And if that happens, we want to be ready to do so. Again, I think the chances of exactly where we fund it change every day, change with the stock price.

The answer is we can't possibly predict. It's all over the place. And it's hard to run a business and enter into transactions that take, what, 60 days to close and expect anything with respect to your stock price. As it relates to Sharon Green, you're right. Originally, we had intended to 1031 exchange around 2/3 of the proceeds, pull forward a dividend in order to create some money that we could use for a stock buyback. We changed the plan when the stock was in the $230 to $240 range and decided to 1031 exchange everything. But that demonstrates how we think about the world. We try to, again, make good decisions with our eye focused on building NAV per share and building cash flow per share. And it's worked out for us really well over a lot of years, and we'll continue doing that doing forward. But to your point, it is incredibly difficult to plan exactly what we're going to do when the world is changing so much. And I would say the same thing is true with respect to our guidance. We issued our market forecast last quarter. Many may argue that the prospects for GDP growth are not nearly as good today as they were just a couple of months ago, but the reality is, who knows? We're using a numbers at economy.com, the 2.8% GDP growth, with the expectation that the economy will improve as we go through 2016. But the reality is we don't know that either. We try to, again, be -- react to the business, keep our eyes focused on the transaction activity out there and then make the decisions. We expect this to be a challenging year from the perspective of uncertainty and volatility. And again, I think that we generally do well in that type of environment, certainly with respect to transaction because things tend to become mispriced and/or they're -- it could cause sellers, for example -- the uncertainty can often cause sellers to become more interested in selling. So maybe we'll see more transactions at the marketplace. I know on the development side, construction side, there are cost increases and other factors have caused development deals to not pencil the way that developers had hoped that they would pencil. And that could lead to some other opportunities in that area. Again, I don't know what's going to happen this year. And to any great extent, there's so much volatility out there. But we think that we have produced this scenario that makes sense, given the broader environment. And we will see what happens."

There are books that are written about this, and we've talked about them before. But again, this incredible wealth generation will increase economic activity. We know that. It will bring the best and brightest people into the marketplaces. And those that own these companies will reinvest those funds in ways that are generally very, very good for the economy. So that is part of the equation that's difficult to predict as you get beyond 2017 and '18, although I wouldn't count the tech market out of the ballgame with respect to growth rate in '17 and '18 because of this factor. Again, it's hard to understand it exactly right now. But looking at Seattle as an example, I think you'll see continued development in these markets for a longer period of time."

So a lot of the discussion people -- I think people think that they're trying to move the apartments into hotel-type situations, and that's not really the case, or at least not what I've seen or heard. It's really a matter of trying to work with the landlords. Of course, the landlords do allow their residents to, under certain circumstances, move forward and sublet some space. And that concept is an exchange for a very small fee to the landlord. That is really their goal. From my perspective, there's a couple of issues out there that are pretty important, which includes in municipalities who commonly forbid this. So that would be another issue. And really the biggest issue is our resident satisfaction for our current residents. And so weighing a relatively small fee versus the precedent satisfaction of the impact of the quality of life to our residents really doesn't seem like a program that would make sense.

From the BRE perspective as far as the legacy portfolio, we've certainly come a long way. As I mentioned in my remarks, some of the opportunities we still have going forward, specifically with that portfolio relating to amenity refi and the amenity adjustments and expirations. And the expirations have been commented on several times, but for clarity, clearly we can fix that. It was in a 12-month period. As the lease expires, it forced things into a certain bucket. The problem is it's not the best thing to do economically. Typically, you're better to work through that over a couple of year period and not force people to take actions that are inconsistent with the market. So we just try to move it on the margin, and that's what we're doing. As it relates to the amenity adjustments, that takes several years to get right and, frankly, on the Essex legacy side, we're still refining that as well, trying to really connect with how the market perceives the different valuations of our similar unit types and make adjustments as an ongoing effort at our company. It just needed a lot more work on the BRE side as they really just started that revenue management process. On the big picture, on the expense side, things are in pretty good order there. We now have the BRE portfolio, legacy portfolio, performing on the controllable expense basis, maintenance, admin and those types of expenses on a per-unit basis, below the Essex portfolio. And that makes sense. That portfolio is little newer than ours. And so we've put in an awful lot of work and we have that in very good order. From a management perspective, we have great people, and that is completely intermixed throughout the portfolio. So there is no Essex or BRE assets. They are all Essex assets, and how we manage them is almost exactly the same as a few nuanced items that are getting cleaned up, but, basically, almost 100% the same. So that's come a long way, and we're very pleased with where that's at. On the renovation, the last big piece, that piece takes time. Again, our renovation program, we’re pretty focused on making sure our product meets the market exactly. It's a very asset-by-asset program. And so we mentioned that we had launched it, which we have. 2016 will have a greater focus on the BRE portfolio as a percentage, then move along the Essex portfolio, and that’s a switch from this last year. And we'll continue to explore those opportunities. Hopefully, that answers the question."

First, Mike, I appreciate your comments on tech and the jobs out there in your opening remarks. And looking -- I guess, what was a little surprising is, looking at your job forecast, the latest one in your sub today versus the one a year ago, the job growth forecasts are sort of similar. And yet, obviously, the news headlines today are clearly fresher than they were a year ago, but Twitter, Yahoo!, you see some of these companies that are in the news, whether for business model issues or space giveback on their office use. I'm just trying to reconcile the 2. What would be the things that you guys would look for that would tell you something is happening, a red flag out there that would tell you that things may be changing, because the outlook that you gave in your job picture is a bit different than sort of the sentiment, if you read the newspapers or speak to folks, not your folks, but speak to the -- on this side of the country."

Yes, I mean, the one point is that we pretty dramatically outperformed the job forecast last year. So yes, this year, as a forecast, it's pretty similar to last year, but you have the large outperformance in the middle of that, which we didn't expect, obviously. So we're going back to a what we consider to be a more sustainable job forecast. And so going forward, how do we detect that things are different from plan? We would use our own portfolio as being a primary source. Typically, what happens in the portfolio when you look at 30-day forward availability and some of the other portfolio metrics, you will see dislocation happening more quickly than the data vendors will pick it up generally by 1 or 2 months. So we would generally see that hiccup happening right in the rental activity and forward availability. So we'll look for that, and that will be the primary trigger to focus more effort on what's going on. In terms of what we're most concerned about, a lot of people talk about the unicorns out there. And we're less concerned about them, more concerned about the large tech companies, because when you look at the number of employees, it's pretty dramatically different. Again, back to our top 10 tech public companies, there's about -- they have about 165,000 employees in the Bay Area, whereas the top 20 unicorns have about 11,000 employees in the Bay Area. So we are clearly more concerned about the top 10 or the big tech companies, but we're also -- on the flip side, we also recognize that they have such tremendous financial capabilities, again, the amount of cash that they have, the amount of growth that they've generated, the office space that they are leasing and the overall commercial activity. There is nothing to us that appears to be a hiccup in what their activities are, and that is what's really driving or anchoring our forecast for next year."

So there's been a conscious decision to try to be more centralized. But net office space concern, they have not decreased and they add in. The news about Yahoo! laying off 1,700 employees. But what we also saw was the Sony PlayStation entertainment moving their headquarters from Japan to San Mateo and expanding, obviously, the office needs and which will bring in another what we would expect 700 to 800 or hiring 700 to 800 new employees.

And from our perspective, that's going to require people that are working in the Downtown, but living somewhere else to relocate to the Downtown. And we expect that to be somewhat choppy. But the overall supply/demand of L.A. is incredibly positive to us. Los Angeles County produces somewhere around 0.5% or 0.6% of its stock every year.

And again, we prepared this forecast last quarter. So the world was a little bit different then. And we can go through the process of changing the forecast dramatically, but the reality is the world is changing so rapidly that you can't change the forecast every month, which would almost be necessary based on the amount of volatility we've had in the marketplace. But what our process is, we use the macro data for the broad macro numbers, which are U.S. GDP growth and U.S. job growth, and then we drive the more specific market forecast based on our own supply/demand analysis. And Angela has come up with a regression analysis that takes into account various different factors, including both supply and demand. It includes wage growth, for example, as one of the key items, affordability. And so the economic rent growth in our market forecast is Essex proprietary, but it's driven by macro numbers that come from data providers. I think 2.8% is the highest of the data providers, as I recall. Looking at the list, there are some that are in the 1.5% range. Again, we could change this on an ongoing basis, but to what point? I think that the forecast looks achievable. If you look at last year, we missed the GDP forecast, but outperformed on the job side. So is this a perfect science? Obviously, it's not. And it seems like we had resilience on the job growth side relative to historical relationships. And again, I think it goes back to that wealth -- incredible wealth creation that we've had on the West Coast that is really driving economic activity that is disconnecting from a lot of the data going back 5 or 10 years. So I think a lot of things are happening. It seems to us that these are achievable numbers. And again, we'll see. We expect a volatile year, as I know everyone knows."

And when it comes to the unknowables, I have to go back and maybe summarize what I've seen in the last 30 years as it relates to Northern California. And I've seen huge dislocation and disruption. Obviously, the Internet period was an incredible period in terms of that. And for example, you had, I think price-to-sales ratios were something like 49x in year 2000, and they're more like 7 now. So you had an incredible asset bubble with respect to these tech companies, and that went on for a lot longer than anyone expected it to go on and ultimately had a horrific impact of things. I think that, that really is the exception, though. When you look at 2007-2008 or 2008-2009 recession, actually, the tech world did rather well. It was construction, government, manufacturing, except where they did incredibly poorly and tanked everything. I think that that's actually more of my belief with respect to the tech world. It's not necessarily the tech world that tends to be so volatile in terms of employment. It's the broader economy. So I don't have necessarily any great fear about tech itself. I have fear about just generally what's happening in the economy, because, I think, actually, tech, with the one notable exception of the Internet boom and bust period, the tech has actually done reasonably well during the economic cycles and the downturns."

We know that Southern California, for example, is a more diversified economy and, therefore, will have less dislocation, but again, not the same growth rate either. So if we see significant dislocation in the tech markets, we will obviously try to move more of the portfolio southward. There is a small bias toward that, as you saw in the Sharon Green transaction, where we sell Northern California and we reinvest 2/3 Northern California, 1/3 Southern California.

And so -- but we will look for opportunities, much like Sharon Green, where we think we can sell an asset and either buy the stock back or pay a special dividend. Both of them are potentially attractive to us. And we want to see some meaningful pickup in terms of impact on NAV per share. So today, that is probably there, but it wasn't there last week.

John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A.

John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. 
I'll cover the following topics on the call: first, comments on our Q1 results and market conditions; second, investment activities; and finally, an update on rent control proposals. 
Yesterday, we were pleased to report continued strong operating results for the first quarter of 2016. For the past several years, one of our primary operating goals has been to grow core FFO per share. I congratulate the Essex team for accomplishing that goal, with over 100% increase in core FFO per share since Q1 2011.
Generally speaking, the West Coast economy continues to perform well, and we are on track to achieve our 2016 market rent forecast shown on Page S-16 of the supplement. Recent job reports have generally equaled or exceeding our expectations.
In Southern California, we have modestly increased our market rent growth expectations from 5.2% to 5.5%, again mostly related to better-than-expected jobs, representing more evidence that our thesis for slow and steady growth continues. 
For Northern California, we are lowering our economic rent growth forecast from 7.5% to 6.5%. 
As noted on our last call, supply deliveries during the typically weak fourth quarter caused lower rent growth in Northern California, mostly focused on 3 submarkets: Delta [ph] market in San Francisco; the Peninsula, South of San Francisco and/or San Jose, which, combined, account for approximately 7% of our same-store NOI. 
As reflected in our Q1 results, we experienced a choppy but nice rebound from Q4. March and April have brought renewed pricing pressure focused on these 3 submarkets in the form of greater concessions often equal to 6 to 8 weeks of rent, as newly delivered apartments is pushed rapid absorption in a competitive market. The greater concessions provide enough incentive to draw people out of nearby properties, pressuring price for stabilized communities. 
Apartment supply deliveries and hiring are inherently lumpy, and much like Q4 '15 and the past couple of months, conditions can change quickly. John Burkart will elaborate further in his comments.
Turning to Seattle. We have significantly increased the economic rent forecast for Seattle from 4.9% to 6.1%, as its great job growth and strong economy has provided the demand to absorb Seattle significant new apartment pipeline at higher-than-expected rents. 
On to the second topic, investments. During the quarter, we originated a preferred equity investment on an apartment development consisting of 494 apartment homes located in Glendale, California. The investment provides a 12% preferred return on outstanding principal, with a total commitment of $47 million. We are working on other preferred equity transactions, as developers are finding themselves in need of additional equity, given construction cost increases, more conservative construction lending standards and more challenging and expensive entitlement processes.
Market clearing cap rates for development deals typically generate around a 4.5% to 4.75% untrended cap rate, which is below our yield threshold. We continue to look for development opportunities that meet our underwriting criteria, and we are not likely to lower our targets in the near term.
There has been widespread discussion of increasing cap rates in the West Coast markets. 2 of the recent acquisitions, Mio and Enso, both in San Jose, were cited by brokers as examples of cap rates that are higher than comparable properties trading a few months earlier. We take this as a complement that we acquired property at a better-than-market cap rate. However, in our evaluation of many deals we have recently underwritten, the value of Mio and Enso did not much change in the past several quarters. In our experience, cap rates change slowly, primarily because buyers and sellers don't change their pricing expectations quickly or easily. Rather, buyers and sellers need to be convinced that the market conditions have permanently changed.
Financial distress often shortens this process for changing cap rates, but currently, there is almost no distress in well-located apartments. To the contrary, the amount of positive leverage available to buyers at existing cap rates represents a compelling opportunity in this yield-starved environment. 
During the quarter and is outlined in the press release, we acquired 2 properties to facilitate 1031 exchanges and sold 2 properties as part of the portfolio call-in [ph] process. 
Similar to last quarter, A-quality property and locations traded around a 4.25 [ph] cap rate used in Essex methodology, but from time to time, more aggressive buyers will pay sub-4 cap rates. 
B-quality properties and locations typically have cap rates 25 to 50 basis points higher than A-quality property. 
And on my third topic, which is rent control. There have been several new developments with respect to rent control in various California cities, mostly in Northern California. Most notable, the City Council in San Jose has amended the existing rent stabilization ordinance to lower the maximum rent increase on renewals to 5% from 8% previously. The amended San Jose ordinance also contains a provision to bank or accumulate up to 8% of potential rent increases to be used during periods that market rent increases are below the 5% maximum. 
Finally, the San Jose ordinance is applicable only to properties built before 1979.
Oakland, which also has an existing rent stabilization ordinance, recently passed an emergency 90-day moratorium on rent increases, applicable only to properties built before 1983. 
In addition to the specific actions in San Jose and Oakland, we believe that tenants rights groups will adapt to win for approval of referendums that will oppose rent control in several cities.
It is important to note that all local ordinances, including the activity just described, must comply with state law, which mandates, among other things, that vacant apartments are prohibited from rent control, and rent control can only be applied to property built before 1996. 
We believe that these various ordinances will have limited impact on Essex, primarily because the vast majority of our properties are newer than the rent control cutoff dates in the various stabilization ordinances. 
In addition, because rent control limits renewal rent increases, residents stay longer, which reduces turnover at rent control property. 
Reduced turnover means that fewer apartments are available to rent for people moving into the area, which likely pushes rents upward on the available apartment inventory. 
Thus, renewals will often occur at below-market rates, but this impact is partially mitigated by higher rents on new leases, reflecting the unintended secondary effects of rent control.
I'm incredibly grateful for John Eudy and many Essex team members for attending and advocating on behalf of the company and the industry at several city council meetings. The meetings contain a lot of emotion and often end well past midnight. 
That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining the call today. I will now turn the call over to John Burkart."
332646,330162094,967749,"Essex Property Trust Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2016",2016-04-29,"Earnings Calls","Essex Property Trust, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mike. We had a good quarter, delivering total same-store revenue growth of 7.3% and NOI growth of 8.8%. Our renovation team got off to a great start in 2016. We increased the number of units renovated in the same-store portfolio 229%, from 24",765,"Thank you, Mike. We had a good quarter, delivering total same-store revenue growth of 7.3% and NOI growth of 8.8%. 
Our renovation team got off to a great start in 2016. We increased the number of units renovated in the same-store portfolio 229%, from 247 units in the first quarter of 2015 to 813 units in the first quarter of 2016. The increased unit turn negatively impacted our vacancy rate by about 5 basis points for the quarter in the same-store portfolio compared to the prior year. 
Now I will share some highlights for each region.
Strong demand in the Seattle market, fueled by employment growth of 3.3% in March, which is above our expectations, enabled the market to absorb the new supply and continue to grow revenues. Our Seattle portfolio grew revenues 7% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. We made a strategic decision due to the market strength in the first quarter to emphasize achieved rental rates over occupancy, and we've continued to do so as we entered the spring leasing season. That position is paying off well with better-than-expected performance, and it will position us well going forward.
Submarkets performed similar to last year, with the CBD growing rental revenue about 4% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable quarter. And the East, North Eastside, North and South submarkets are all growing between 7.5% and 9% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to their comparable quarter. 
In the Bay Area, as I mentioned previously, our expectations for the first quarter were that the market would be choppy, and then it would be followed by the normal seasonal pattern. However, the market is currently softer than expected. Our same-store achieved rents in March of 2016 were about 6% over achieved rents in March 2015.
And the achieved rents in April of 2016 are roughly 4% over the comparable month due to the difficult comps. 
The BLS surveys continue to show strong employment growth in the Bay Area. We just recently reported March 2016 employment growth rates of 4%, 2.4% and 3.8% for San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose MDs, respectively, which are above our expectations. The household survey reported unemployment decline at average of 60 basis points in each MD year-over-year, which is consistent with strong job growth. 
Both reports indicate strong employment market, which is able to absorb the total supply multi-family and single-family units and continue to grow rent.
It appears that in addition to the lumpiness of the multi-family supply deliveries during the low-demand period, other factors are currently impacting the demand in the Bay Area market, such as doubling up and increased inventories choosing to rent single-family homes, which enables more roommates to share the rent; onetime impact of the crackdown of the student visa program, which has reduced demand from outside the country; and an increase in the flexibility work arrangement, enabling employees to telecommute from outside the normal commute zone. 
We have noted a slight change in the geographic location of the open position listed by the major tech companies. There's a slight increase in total open positions between Washington and California. However, California open positions have declined slightly, while the Washington open positions have increased slightly. This shift may be the product of the tight labor market and housing market that we have in the Bay Area.
Southern California region continues to perform, driven by strong job growth exceeding our expectations. As expected, the momentum we saw in 2015 continued into 2016, enabling us to achieve a revenue growth of 6.1% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable quarter. 
In the L.A. MSA, L.A. CBD, which is impacted by positive supply, grew rental revenue 4.9% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. And the Woodland Hills submarket, which had the greatest positive impact from Porter Ranch relocation, performed at the top end of the MSA, with an increase in rental revenues at 8.6% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable quarter.
We estimate that the increased demand for short-term rentals related to the Porter Ranch leases increased the year-over-year growth rate for the L.A. MSA portfolio by about 30 basis points during the first quarter of 2016.
Currently, our portfolio occupancy is at 95.8%, and our availability 30 days out is at 5.4%. Considering the underperformance in the Northern California portfolio, we are cautiously optimistic about the spring leasing season. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman."

I'll start with our first quarter results then provide an update on recent capital markets activities. 
I'm pleased to report that our core FFO for the first quarter exceeded the mid-point of our guidance by $0.08 per share. Although $0.04 was related to timing of expenses, the remaining $0.04 was primarily driven by stronger-than-anticipated operations, which led to another quarter of solid operating results. 
Also in the first quarter, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $1.60 per share, which is an 11% year-over-year increase and represents our 20th year of consecutive dividend growth. 
Moving on to recent capital markets activities. In April, we issued $450 million of 10-year [ph] senior unsecured notes at a rate of 3.375% per annum. The net proceeds from the offering were used to pay off the balance on our line of credit, redeem the Series H Preferred Stock and fund other corporate activities. While there is a temporary mismatch on the timing of the use for some portion of the proceeds, we believe it was an opportune time to enter into that market.
Our only remaining maturity this year is $200 million term loan, which comes due in November. With 0 outstanding on our $1 billion line of credit and limited near-term debt maturities, our balance sheet is well-positioned to be opportunistic, as we evaluate future investment or refinancing strategies.
For the full year, we are reaffirming our guidance on same-property revenue, expense and NOI growth and the mid-point of our core FFO per share of $10.92. Lastly, I would like to highlight a new page, S-12.1 in our supplemental, which provides additional disclosures on the revenue-generating and nonrevenue-generating CapEx spending. We hope these enhanced disclosures will be beneficial to the investment community.

It was that slowdown from month-to-month, actually, through the first quarter and into April that was concerning us. And there was a couple of other pieces, too. One is that our evaluation of apartment supply indicates further lumpiness in Q2 and Q3. So roughly, in the San Francisco MSA, 3,600 units get delivered in Q2 and 2,700 in Q3. So roughly 70% of the expected annual deliveries will happen in Q2 or Q3. So we're concerned about that. And the significance since we turn or renew or turn around 50% of the leases in these next several months, that has a pretty significant impact on the overall results. So I guess, perhaps we're being overly cautious, but those were the factors that led us to do that. And actually, let me add one more factor, and that is overall supply and demand, as you look at the numbers, appears to be disconnecting in some way. As an example or to go through the numbers, the Bay Area is expected to produce about 93,000 jobs in 2016. That would ordinarily, at a 2:1 look at all housing and not just apartments, would give you 46,000 units of demand against about 20,000 apartments and homes being delivered into the marketplace. So about a 2 for 1 relationship. So there should be sufficient demand to absorb the supply as it comes on board. Yet, what we're seeing on the marketplace is that there is more concessions, and the supply is not being absorbed as easily as we otherwise would expect. So that supply-demand disconnect is a concern to us. Could be indicative of perhaps employment is slowing, but it hasn't really hit the numbers yet, in the last many years that I've been here. It seems that sometimes, we see changes in the marketplace before they actually get reported in the numbers. So those would be a little bit of background on why we decided not to change guidance."

First off, with the supply coming in, and they're trying to get the units absorbed, they're naturally offering concessions, and those have been increased. And they are in the start of the process as it relates to some of the concessionary activity, and then, of course, others, consumer, the empowered consumer and with the information you have some concession jumpers. And so people are moving around, and that causes some pressure then on the next level on the apartments. As it relates to the doubling up, it's really happening at various levels within the apartment zone. And you have people that are doubling up into 2s, people doubling up into 1s, just various things going on. And It's all incremental, right? But that incremental takes a hair off the demand that's out there and ultimately reduces demand. And so that's that you see it all over. The feedback that we get anecdotally is that the single-family market is very, very high occupancy right now. And that, again, would have taken up some of the demand, and it makes sense if you think about it for a larger unit in effect, and you can put a couple of 2, 3, 4 people in income earners and have a nice space. So I think people are finding ways to deal with the higher rents, and some of those again, mean doubling up."

So -- but again, to the point, it appears that Seattle and San Francisco, i.e. both being tech markets, are performing very well on the job side. And therefore, we look at the supply side of, the lumpiness of the supply is being a contributing factor or a driver of this disconnect. As we go forward, it's going to be interesting to see because again, if you look at the overall numbers, going from jobs and job growth to household formation to supply, it would not indicate that we should have weakness in the apartment area. And the concessions seem to be going from roughly a month to 6 to 8 weeks. That would not be indicated, given the overall supply-demand numbers. But yet here we are.

And so that's the effect of concessions. And it seems to me that concessions are prevalent in the marketplace, and it increased. And again, that's what's causing the softness. Again, I believe that the concessions can abate, much like they did in January, February quickly, but we just don't know exactly how that's going to happen. It's a function of how many units do you have, how aggressive the owners are. Obviously, if you deliver a new building, you have $0 coming in on your vacant units. And so you're highly motivated to rent them. And many of those owners are saying, ""Hey, rather than leaving it vacant, I'll try to hit really high absorption numbers and increase my cash flow."" Again, they are incented -- they have a different financial objective or a different financial view relative to stabilized apartments. And so -- but they have a dramatic effect on stabilized apartments. So that process is going to play out, and so we're going to be clearly a bit more pressure than we have over the last couple of years. And we'll have to see how that ultimately turns out."

And so if you give them another 8% off their rent in the form of a concession, they are all over it. And so it's a very fluid marketplace. And what I suspect will happen is we will go through this period of time, and we'll absorb the units. We'll get back into Q4 in San Francisco, where we think roughly 1,300 units will be delivered.

And so I don't want to give you exact targets, but of the $250 million program, we've decided to take some balance sheet risk, to the extent that the stock trades at a significant discount to NAV.

John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. 
I'll cover the following topics on the call: first, comments on our Q1 results and market conditions; second, investment activities; and finally, an update on rent control proposals.
Yesterday, we were pleased to report continued strong operating results for the first quarter of 2016. For the past several years, one of our primary operating goals has been to grow core FFO per share. I congratulate the Essex team for accomplishing that goal, with over 100% increase in core FFO per share since Q1 2011.
Generally speaking, the West Coast economy continues to perform well, and we are on track to achieve our 2016 market forecast shown on Page S-16 of the supplement. Recent job reports have generally equaled or exceeding our expectations.
In Southern California, we have modestly increased our market rent growth expectations from 5.2% to 5.5%, again mostly related to better-than-expected jobs, representing more evidence that our thesis for slow and steady growth continues.
For Northern California, we are lowering our economic rent growth forecast from 7.5% to 6.5%. 
As noted on our last call, supply deliveries during the typically weak fourth quarter caused lower rent growth in Northern California, mostly focused on 3 submarkets: South of Market Street in San Francisco; the Peninsula, South of San Francisco and North San Jose, which, combined, account for approximately 7% of our same-store NOI.
As reflected in our Q1 results, we experienced a choppy but nice rebound from Q4. March and April have brought renewed pricing pressure focused on these 3 submarkets in the form of greater concessions often equal to 6 to 8 weeks of rent, as newly delivered apartments push rapid absorption in a competitive market. The greater concessions provide enough incentive to draw people out of nearby properties, pressuring price for stabilized communities.
Apartment supply deliveries and hiring are inherently lumpy, and much like Q4 '15 and the past couple of months, conditions can change quickly. John Burkart will elaborate further in his comments.
Turning to Seattle. We have significantly increased the economic rent forecast for Seattle from 4.9% to 6.1%, as its great job growth and strong economy has provided the demand to absorb Seattle significant new apartment pipeline at higher-than-expected rents.
Under the second topic, investments. During the quarter, we originated a preferred equity investment on an apartment development consisting of 494 apartment homes located in Glendale, California. The investment provides a 12% preferred return on outstanding principal, with a total commitment of $47 million. We are working on other preferred equity transactions, as developers are finding themselves in need of additional equity, given construction cost increases, more conservative construction lending standards and more challenging and expensive entitlement processes.
Market clearing cap rates for development deals typically generate around a 4.5% to 4.75% untrended cap rate, which is below our yield threshold. We continue to look for development opportunities that meet our underwriting criteria, and we are not likely to lower our targets in the near term.
There has been widespread discussion of increasing cap rates in the West Coast markets. 2 of the recent acquisitions, Mio and Enso, both in San Jose, were cited by brokers as examples of cap rates that are higher than comparable properties trading a few months earlier. We take this as a complement that we acquired property at a better-than-market cap rate. However, in our evaluation of many deals we have recently underwritten, the value of Mio and Enso did not much change in the past several quarters. In our experience, cap rates change slowly, primarily because buyers and sellers don't change their pricing expectations quickly or easily. Rather, buyers and sellers need to be convinced that the market conditions have permanently changed.
Financial distress often shortens this process for changing cap rates, but currently, there is almost no distress in well-located apartments. To the contrary, the amount of positive leverage available to buyers at existing cap rates represents a compelling opportunity in this yield-starved environment. 
During the quarter and is outlined in the press release, we acquired 2 properties to facilitate 1031 exchanges and sold 2 properties as part of the portfolio call-in [ph] process. 
Similar to last quarter, A-quality property and locations traded around a  4 1/4 cap rate using the Essex methodology, but from time to time, more aggressive buyers will pay sub-4 cap rates.
B-quality properties and locations typically have cap rates 25 to 50 basis points higher than A-quality property.
And on my third topic, which is rent control. There have been several new developments with respect to rent control in various California cities, mostly in Northern California. Most notable, the City Council in San Jose has amended the existing rent stabilization ordinance to lower the maximum rent increase on renewals to 5% from 8% previously. The amended San Jose ordinance also contains a provision to bank or accumulate up to 8% of potential rent increases to be used during periods that market rent increases are below the 5% maximum.
Finally, the San Jose ordinance is applicable only to properties built before 1979.
Oakland, which also has an existing rent stabilization ordinance, recently passed an emergency 90-day moratorium on rent increases, applicable only to properties built before 1983.
In addition to the specific actions in San Jose and Oakland, we believe that tenants' rights groups will attempt to win vote of approval of referendums that will impose rent control in several cities.
It is important to note that all local ordinances, including the activity just described, must comply with state law, which mandates, among other things, that vacant apartments are prohibited from rent control, and rent control can only be applied to property built before 1996.
We believe that these various ordinances will have limited impact on Essex, primarily because the vast majority of our properties are newer than the rent control cutoff dates in the various stabilization ordinances.
In addition, because rent control limits renewal rent increases, residents stay longer, which reduces turnover at rent control property.
Reduced turnover means that fewer apartments are available to rent for people moving into the area, which likely pushes rents upward on the available apartment inventory.
Thus, renewals will often occur at below-market rates, but this impact is partially mitigated by higher rents on new leases, reflecting the unintended secondary effects of rent control.
I'm incredibly grateful for John Eudy and many Essex team members for attending and advocating on behalf of the company and the industry at several city council meetings. The meetings contain a lot of emotion and often end well past midnight.
That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining the call today. I will now turn the call over to John Burkart."

We had a good quarter, delivering total same-store revenue growth of 7.3% and NOI growth of 8.8%. Our renovation team got off to a great start in 2016. We increased the number of units renovated in the same-store portfolio 229%, from 24",766,"Thank you, Mike. We had a good quarter, delivering total same-store revenue growth of 7.3% and NOI growth of 8.8%. 
Our renovation team got off to a great start in 2016. We increased the number of units renovated in the same-store portfolio 229%, from 247 units in the first quarter of 2015 to 813 units in the first quarter of 2016. The increased unit turn negatively impacted our vacancy rate by about 5 basis points for the quarter in the same-store portfolio compared to the prior year. 
Now I will share some highlights for each region.
Strong demand in the Seattle market, fueled by employment growth of 3.3% in March, which is above our expectations, enabled the market to absorb the new supply and continue to grow revenues. Our Seattle portfolio grew revenues 7% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. We made a strategic decision due to the market strength in the first quarter to emphasize achieved rental rates over occupancy, and we've continued to do so as we entered the spring leasing season. That position is paying off well with better-than-expected performance, and it will position us well going forward.
Submarkets performed similar to last year, with the CBD growing rental revenue about 4% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable quarter. And the East, North Eastside, North and South submarkets are all growing between 7.5% and 9% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to their comparable quarter. 
In the Bay Area, as I mentioned previously, our expectations for the first quarter were that the market would be choppy, and then it would be followed by the normal seasonal pattern. However, the market is currently softer than expected. Our same-store achieved rents in March of 2016 were about 6% over achieved rents in March 2015.
And the achieved rents in April of 2016 are roughly 4% over the comparable month due to the difficult comps.
The BLS surveys continue to show strong employment growth in the Bay Area. We just recently reported March 2016 employment growth rates of 4%, 2.4% and 3.8% for San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose MDs, respectively, which are above our expectations. The household survey reported unemployment decline an average of 60 basis points in each MD year-over-year, which is consistent with strong job growth.
Both reports indicate strong employment market, which should be able to absorb the total supply multi-family and single-family units and continue to grow rent.
It appears that in addition to the lumpiness of the multi-family supply deliveries during the low-demand period, other factors are currently impacting the demand in the Bay Area market, such as doubling up and increased inventories choosing to rent single-family homes, which enables more roommates to share the rent; onetime impact of the crackdown of the student visa program, which has reduced demand from outside the country; and an increase in the flexible work arrangement, enabling employees to telecommute from outside the normal commute zone. 
We have noted a slight change in the geographic location of the open position listed by the major tech companies. There's a slight increase in total open positions between Washington and California. However, California open positions have declined slightly, while the Washington open positions have increased slightly. This shift may be the product of the tight labor market and housing market that we have in the Bay Area.
Southern California region continues to perform, driven by strong job growth exceeding our expectations. As expected, the momentum we saw in 2015 continued into 2016, enabling us to achieve a revenue growth of 6.1% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable quarter.
In the L.A. MSA, L.A. CBD, which is impacted by positive supply, grew rental revenue 4.9% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. And the Woodland Hills submarket, which had the greatest positive impact from Porter Ranch relocation, performed at the top end of the MSA, with an increase in rental revenues at 8.6% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable quarter.
We estimate that the increased demand for short-term rentals related to the Porter Ranch leases increased the year-over-year growth rate for the L.A. MSA portfolio by about 30 basis points during the first quarter of 2016.
Currently, our portfolio occupancy is at 95.8%, and our availability 30 days out is at 5.4%. Considering the underperformance in the Northern California portfolio, we are cautiously optimistic about the spring leasing season. 
Thank you, and we will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman."

I'm pleased to report that our core FFO for the first quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.08 per share. Although $0.04 was related to timing of expenses, the remaining $0.04 was primarily driven by stronger-than-anticipated operations, which led to another quarter of solid operating results.
Also in the first quarter, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $1.60 per share, which is an 11% year-over-year increase and represents our 20th year of consecutive dividend growth.
Moving on to recent capital markets activities. In April, we issued $450 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes at a rate of 3.375% per annum. The net proceeds from the offering were used to pay off the balance on our line of credit, redeemed the Series H Preferred Stock and fund other corporate activities. While there is a temporary mismatch on the timing of the use for some portion of the proceeds, we believe it was an opportune time to enter into that market.
Our only remaining maturity this year is $200 million term loan, which comes due in November. With 0 outstanding on our $1 billion line of credit and limited near-term debt maturities, our balance sheet is well-positioned to be opportunistic, as we evaluate future investment or refinancing alternatives.
For the full year, we are reaffirming our guidance on same-property revenue, expense and NOI growth and the midpoint of our core FFO per share of $10.92. Lastly, I would like to highlight a new page, S-12.1 in our supplemental, which provides additional disclosures on the revenue-generating and nonrevenue-generating CapEx spending. We hope these enhanced disclosures will be beneficial to the investment community.

It was that slowdown from month-to-month, actually, through the first quarter and into April that was concerning us. And there was a couple of other pieces, too. One is that our evaluation of apartment supply indicates further lumpiness in Q2 and Q3. So roughly, in the San Francisco MSA, 3,600 units get delivered in Q2 and 2,700 in Q3. So roughly 70% of the expected annual deliveries will happen in Q2 or Q3. So we're concerned about that. And the significance since we turn or renew -- or turn around 50% of the leases in these next several months, that has a pretty significant impact on the overall results. So I guess, perhaps we're being overly cautious, but those were the factors that led us to do that. And actually, let me add one more factor, and that is overall supply and demand, as you look at the numbers, appears to be disconnecting in some way. As an example or to go through the numbers, the Bay Area is expected to produce about 93,000 jobs in 2016. That would ordinarily, at a 2:1 look at all housing and not just apartments, would give you 46,000 units of demand against about 20,000 apartments and homes being delivered into the marketplace. So about a 2 for 1 relationship. So there should be sufficient demand to absorb the supply as it comes on board. Yet, what we're seeing in the marketplace is that there is more concessions, and the supply is not being absorbed as easily as we otherwise would expect. So that supply-demand disconnect is of concern to us. Could be indicative of perhaps employment is slowing, but it hasn't really hit the numbers yet, in the last many years that I've been here. It seems that sometimes, we see changes in the marketplace before they actually get reported in the numbers. So those would be the little bit of background on why we decided not to change guidance."

Having said that, the other thing we pay attention to is affordability of rentals versus homeownership. And in every one of our markets, and Ivy, you know this better than anyone, the cost of these homes is pretty significant. I think the median-priced home in San Francisco is over $1 million.

First off, with the supply coming in, and they're trying to get the units absorbed, they're naturally offering concessions, and those have been increased. And they are in the start of the process as it relates to some of the concessionary activity, and then, of course, others, with the consumer, the empowered consumer and with the information you have some concession jumpers. And so people are moving around and that causes some pressure then on the next level on the apartments. As it relates to the doubling up, it's really happening at various levels within the apartment zone. And you have people that are doubling up into 2s, people doubling up into 1s, just various things going on. And It's all incremental, right? But that incremental takes a hair off the demand so that's out there and, again, ultimately reduces demand. And so that you see it all over. The feedback that we get anecdotally is that the single-family market is very, very high occupancy right now. And that, again, would have taken up some of the demand, and it makes sense if you think about it for a larger unit in effect, and you can put a couple of 2, 3, 4 people in income earners and have a nice space. So I think people are finding ways to deal with the higher rents, and some of those again, being doubling up."

So -- but again, to the point, it appears that Seattle and San Francisco, i.e. both being tech markets, are performing very well on the job side. And therefore, we look at the supply side of, the lumpiness of the supply is being a contributing factor or a driver of this disconnect. As we go forward, it's going to be interesting to see because again, if you look at the overall numbers, going from jobs and job growth to household formation to supply, it would not indicate that we should have weakness in the apartment area. And the concessions seem to be going from roughly a month to 6 to 8 weeks. That would not be indicated, given the overall supply-demand numbers. But yet here we are.

And so that's the effect of concessions. And it seems to me that concessions are prevalent in the marketplace, and it increased. And again, that's what's causing the softness. Again, I believe that the concessions can abate, much like they did in January, February quickly, but we just don't know exactly how that's going to happen. It's a function of how many units do you have, how aggressive the owners are. Obviously, if you have -- if you deliver a new building, you have $0 coming in on your vacant units. And so you're highly motivated to rent them. And many of those owners are saying, ""Hey, rather than leaving it vacant, I'll try to hit really high absorption numbers and increase my cash flow."" Again, they are incented -- they have a different financial objective or a different financial view relative to stabilized apartments. And so -- but they have a dramatic effect on stabilized apartments. So that process is going to play out, and so we're going to be clearly a bit more pressure than we have over the last couple of years. And we'll have to see how that ultimately turns out."

We're trying to align sales proceeds from properties, such as, I think I mentioned that roughly 1/3 of the Sharon Green sale, we wanted to use for share repurchase. And when the stock price recovered, and we were not trading at a discount to NAV, we decided to just go ahead and redeploy that with the 1031 Exchange. So the evolution of our thought process on that is go ahead and use the balance sheet because it seems like the dislocations in the stock are -- and we had one of the first quarter, those dislocations are relatively temporary in nature. And so I don't want to give you exact targets, but of the $250 million program, we've decided to take some balance sheet risk, to the extent that the stock trades at a significant discount to NAV. And again, I'm not going to share with you our targets and how that works. But practically, if it's not 10% to 15% type of discounts, it probably doesn't make much of a difference. So we will use some balance sheet, and we would look for significant discounts. And we will be ready within relatively short periods of time, given dislocation in stock price."

However,  if that changed, if we saw job growth dynamics change, for example, I think that would be more fundamental in nature, and that would change our thinking about how we want to allocate the portfolio. So again, we have these exceptional job growth numbers that have continued in Q1 San Francisco at 4.1%, Seattle at 3.2%, et cetera. That's a trailing 3-month number. Those numbers are incredibly powerful when it comes to owning apartments. And so as long as those numbers remain as strong as they are and not to mention the amount of wealth has been created within the technology area, I think we estimated the 10 top tech companies have produced about $1.8 trillion in wealth. And obviously, some of that is not in the West Coast, but a lot of it is here. Those dynamics keep us excited about earning properties in Northern California despite the lumpiness of the supply."

So definitely, affordability is much, much different in Seattle and Francisco, and that would drive what John Burkart was talking about, with respect to double-up some more -- the more affordability enters the equation, the more doubling up you would expect to happen. So clearly, Seattle, if you look at median income levels are high, about $84,000, which is less in San Francisco and San Jose. They are both over $100,000. But nonetheless, when you look at that relationship between average rents, which are about 1,400 in Seattle, on average, this is the whole marketplace, there is a high level of affordability in Seattle.

John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A.

John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. 
I'll cover the following topics on the call: first, comments on our Q1 results and market conditions; second, investment activities; and finally, an update on rent control proposals.
Yesterday, we were pleased to report continued strong operating results for the first quarter of 2016. For the past several years, one of our primary operating goals has been to grow core FFO per share. I congratulate the Essex team for accomplishing that goal, with over 100% increase in core FFO per share since Q1 2011.
Generally speaking, the West Coast economy continues to perform well, and we are on track to achieve our 2016 market rent forecast shown on Page S-16 of the supplement. Recent job reports have generally equaled or exceeded our expectations.
In Southern California, we have modestly increased our market rent growth expectations from 5.2% to 5.5%, again mostly related to better-than-expected jobs, representing more evidence that our thesis for slow and steady growth continues.
For Northern California, we are lowering our economic rent growth forecast from 7.5% to 6.5%. 
As noted on our last call, supply deliveries during the typically weak fourth quarter caused lower rent growth in Northern California, mostly focused on 3 submarkets: South of Market in San Francisco; the Peninsula south of San Francisco and North San Jose, which, combined, account for approximately 7% of our same-store NOI.
As reflected in our Q1 results, we experienced a choppy but nice rebound from Q4. March and April have brought renewed pricing pressure focused on these 3 submarkets in the form of greater concessions often equal to 6 to 8 weeks of rent, as newly delivered apartments push rapid absorption in a competitive market. The greater concessions provide enough incentive to draw people out of nearby properties, pressuring price for stabilized communities.
Apartment supply deliveries and hiring are inherently lumpy, and much like Q4 '15 and the past couple of months, conditions can change quickly. John Burkart will elaborate further in his comments.
Turning to Seattle. We have significantly increased the economic rent forecast for Seattle from 4.9% to 6.1%, as its great job growth and strong economy has provided the demand to absorb Seattle's significant new apartment pipeline at higher-than-expected rents.
Under the second topic, investments. During the quarter, we originated a preferred equity investment on an apartment development consisting of 494 apartment homes located in Glendale, California. The investment provides a 12% preferred return on outstanding principal, with a total commitment of $47 million. We are working on other preferred equity transactions, as developers are finding themselves in need of additional equity, given construction cost increases, more conservative construction lending standards and more challenging and expensive entitlement processes.
Market clearing cap rates for development deals typically generate around a 4.5% to 4.75% untrended cap rate, which is below our yield threshold. We continue to look for development opportunities that meet our underwriting criteria, and we are not likely to lower our targets in the near term.
There has been widespread discussion of increasing cap rates in the West Coast markets. 2 of our recent acquisitions, Mio and Enso, both in San Jose, were cited by brokers as examples of cap rates that are higher than comparable properties trading a few months earlier. We take this as a complement that we acquired property at a better-than-market cap rate. However, in our evaluation of many deals we have recently underwritten, the value of Mio and Enso did not change materially in the past several quarters. In our experience, cap rates change slowly, primarily because buyers and sellers don't change their pricing expectations quickly or easily. Rather, buyers and sellers need to be convinced that market conditions have permanently changed.
Financial distress often shortens this process for changing cap rates, but currently, there is almost no distress in well-located apartments. To the contrary, the amount of positive leverage available to buyers at existing cap rates represents a compelling opportunity in this yield-starved environment. 
During the quarter and as outlined in the press release, we acquired 2 properties to facilitate 1031 Exchanges and sold 2 properties as part of a portfolio culling process. 
Similar to last quarter, A-quality property and locations traded around a 4 1/4 cap rate using the Essex methodology, but from time to time, more aggressive buyers will pay sub-4 cap rates.
B-quality properties and locations typically have cap rates 25 to 50 basis points higher than A-quality property.
And onto my third topic, which is rent control. There have been several new developments with respect to rent control in various California cities, mostly in Northern California. Most notable, the City Council in San Jose has amended the existing rent stabilization ordinance to lower the maximum rent increase on renewals to 5% from 8% previously. The amended San Jose ordinance also contains a provision to bank or accumulate up to 8% of potential rent increases to be used during periods that market rent increases are below the 5% maximum.
Finally, the San Jose ordinance is applicable only to properties built before 1979.
Oakland, which also has an existing rent stabilization ordinance, recently passed an emergency 90-day moratorium on rent increases, applicable only to properties built before 1983.
In addition to the specific actions in San Jose and Oakland, we believe that tenants' rights groups will attempt to win voter approval of referendums that will impose rent control in several cities.
It is important to note that all local ordinances, including the activity just described, must comply with state law, which mandates, among other things, that vacant apartments are prohibited from rent control, and rent control can only be applied to property built before 1996.
We believe that these various ordinances will have limited impact on Essex, primarily because the vast majority of our properties are newer than the rent control cutoff dates in the various stabilization ordinances.
In addition, because rent control limits renewal rent increases, residents stay longer, which reduces turnover at rent control property.
Reduced turnover means that fewer apartments are available to rent for people moving into the area, which likely pushes rents upward on the available apartment inventory.
Thus, renewals will often occur at below-market rates, but this impact is partially mitigated by higher rents on new leases, reflecting the unintended secondary effects of rent control.
I'm incredibly grateful for John Eudy and many Essex team members for attending and advocating on behalf of the company and the industry at several city council meetings. The meetings contain a lot of emotion and often end well past midnight.
That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining the call today. I will now turn the call over to John Burkart."

We had a good quarter, delivering total same-store revenue growth of 7.3% and NOI growth of 8.8%. Our renovation team got off to a great start in 2016. We increased the number of units renovated in the same-store portfolio 229%, from 24",767,"Thank you, Mike. We had a good quarter, delivering total same-store revenue growth of 7.3% and NOI growth of 8.8%. 
Our renovation team got off to a great start in 2016. We increased the number of units renovated in the same-store portfolio 229%, from 247 units in the first quarter of 2015 to 813 units in the first quarter of 2016. The increased unit turns negatively impacted our vacancy rate by about 5 basis points for the quarter in the same-store portfolio compared to the prior year. 
Now I will share some highlights for each region.
Strong demand in the Seattle market, fueled by employment growth of 3.3% in March, which is above our expectations, enabled the market to absorb the new supply and continued to grow revenues. Our Seattle portfolio grew revenues 7% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. We made the strategic decision due to the market strength in the first quarter to emphasize achieved rental rates over occupancy, and we've continued to do so as we entered the spring leasing season. That decision is paying off well with better-than-expected performance, and it will position us well going forward.
Submarkets performed similar to last year, with the CBD growing rental revenue about 4% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable quarter. And the East, North Eastside, North and South submarkets are all growing between 7.5% and 9% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to their comparable quarter. 
In the Bay Area, as I mentioned previously, our expectations for the first quarter were that the market would be choppy, and then it would be followed by the normal seasonal pattern. However, the market is currently softer than expected. Our same-store achieved rents in March 2016 were about 6% over achieved rents in March 2015.
And the achieved rents in April 2016 are roughly 4% over the comparable month due to the difficult comps.
The BLS surveys continue to show strong employment growth in the Bay Area. The industry survey reported March 2016 employment growth rates of 4%, 2.4% and 3.8% for San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose MDs, respectively, which are above our expectations. The household survey reported unemployment declined an average of 60 basis points in each MD year-over-year, which is consistent with strong job growth.
Both reports indicate strong employment market, which should be able to absorb the total supply multi-family and single-family units and continue to grow rents.
It appears that in addition to the lumpiness of the multi-family supply deliveries during the low-demand period, other factors are currently impacting the demand in the Bay Area market, such as doubling up and increase in renters choosing to rent single-family homes, which enables more roommates to share the rent; the onetime impact of the crackdown of the student visa program, which has reduced demand from outside the country; and an increase in the flexible work arrangement, enabling employees to telecommute from outside the normal commute zone. 
We have noted a slight change in the geographic location of the open position listed by the major tech companies. There's a slight increase in total open positions between Washington and California. However, the California open positions have declined slightly, while the Washington open positions have increased slightly. This shift may be the product of the tight labor market and housing market that we have in the Bay Area.
Southern California region continues to perform, driven by strong job growth exceeding our expectations. As expected, the momentum we saw in 2015 continued into 2016, enabling us to achieve a revenue growth of 6.1% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable quarter.
In the L.A. MSA, L.A. CBD, which is impacted by pocket of supply, grew rental revenue 4.9% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. And the Woodland Hills submarket, which had the greatest positive impact from Porter Ranch's relocation, performed at the top of the MSA, with an increase in rental revenues at 8.6% for the first quarter of 2016 compared to the comparable quarter.
We estimate that the increased demand for short-term rentals related to the Porter Ranch leases increased the year-over-year growth rate for the L.A. MSA portfolio by about 30 basis points during the first quarter of 2016.
Currently, our portfolio occupancy is at 95.8%, and our availability 30 days out is at 5.4%. Considering the underperformance in the Northern California portfolio, we are cautiously optimistic about the spring leasing season. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman."

I'm pleased to report that our core FFO for the first quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.08 per share. Although $0.04 was related to timing of expenses, the remaining $0.04 was primarily driven by stronger-than-anticipated operations, which led to another quarter of solid operating results.
Also in the first quarter, we declared a quarterly common dividend of $1.60 per share, which is an 11% year-over-year increase and represents our 20th year of consecutive dividend growth.
Moving on to recent capital markets activities. In April, we issued $450 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes at a rate of 3.375% per annum. The net proceeds from the offering were used to pay off the balance on our line of credit, redeem the Series H Preferred Stock and fund other corporate activities. While there is a temporary mismatch on the timing of the use for some portion of the proceeds, we believed it was an opportune time to enter the debt market.
Our only remaining maturity this year is $200 million term loan, which comes due in November. With 0 outstanding on our $1 billion line of credit and limited near-term debt maturities, our balance sheet is well-positioned to be opportunistic, as we evaluate future investment or refinancing alternatives.
For the full year, we are reaffirming our guidance on same-property revenue, expense and NOI growth and the midpoint of our core FFO per share of $10.92. Lastly, I would like to highlight a new page, S-12.1 in our supplemental, which provides additional disclosures on the revenue-generating and nonrevenue-generating CapEx spending. We hope these enhanced disclosures will be beneficial to the investment community.

It was that slowdown from month-to-month, actually, through the first quarter and into April that was concerning us. And there was a couple of other pieces, too. One is that our evaluation of apartment supply indicates further lumpiness in Q2 and Q3. So roughly, in the San Francisco MSA, 3,600 units get delivered in Q2 and 2,700 in Q3. So roughly 70% of the expected annual deliveries will happen in Q2 or Q3. So we're concerned about that. And the significance since we turn or renew -- or turn around 50% of the leases in these next several months, that has a pretty significant impact on the overall results. So I guess, perhaps we're being overly cautious, but those were the factors that led us to do that. And actually, let me add one more factor, and that is overall supply and demand, as you look at the numbers, appears to be disconnecting in some way. As an example or to go through the numbers, the Bay Area is expected to produce about 93,000 jobs in 2016. That would ordinarily, at a 2:1 look at all housing and not just apartments, would give you 46,000 units of demand against about 20,000 apartments and homes being delivered into the marketplace. So about a 2 for 1 relationship. So there should be sufficient demand to absorb the supply as it comes on board. Yet, what we're seeing in the marketplace is that there is more concessions, and the supply is not being absorbed as easily as we otherwise would expect. So that supply-demand disconnect is of concern to us. Could be indicative of perhaps employment is slowing, but it hasn't really hit the numbers yet, in the last many years that I've been here. It seems that sometimes, we see changes in the marketplace before they actually get reported in the numbers. So those would be the little bit of background on why we decided not to change guidance."

First off, with the supply coming in, and they're trying to get the units absorbed, they're naturally offering concessions, and those have been increased. And they are in the start of the process as it relates to some of the concessionary activity, and then, of course, others, with the consumer, the empowered consumer and with the information age you have some concession jumpers. And so people are moving around and that causes some pressure then on the next level on the apartments. As it relates to the doubling up, it's really happening at various levels within the apartment zone. And you have people that are doubling up into 2s, people are doubling up into 1s, just various things going on. And it's all incremental, right? But that incremental takes a hair off the demand that's out there and, again, ultimately reduces demand. And so that's -- you see it all over. The feedback that we get anecdotally is that the single-family market is very, very high occupancy right now. And that, again, would have taken up some of the demand, and it makes sense if you think about it. It's a larger unit in effect, and you can put a couple of or 2, 3, 4 people in, income earners, and have a nice space. So I think people are finding ways to deal with the higher rents, and some of those again, mean doubling up."

I think I commented that around 40%, 40-plus percent of the supply in Northern California hit the fourth quarter during the seasonally weakest time. So -- but again, to the point, it appears that Seattle and San Francisco, i.e. both being tech markets, are performing very well on the job side. And therefore, we looked at the supply side, the lumpiness of the supply as being a contributing factor or a driver of this disconnect. As we go forward, it's going to be interesting to see because again, if you look at the overall numbers, going from jobs and job growth to household formation to supply, it would not indicate that we should have weakness in the apartment area. And the concessions seem to be going from roughly a month to 6 to 8 weeks. That would not be indicated, given the overall supply-demand numbers. But yet here we are. And so we are trying to make sense out of why that is occurring. We don't have anything at this point."

So essentially, we didn't -- as a general rule, revising guidance at the end of the first quarter is something that I think is generally not what you want to do because it's only one quarter.

And so that's the effect of concessions. And it seems to me that concessions are prevalent in the marketplace, and they have increased. And again, that's what's causing the softness. Again, I believe that the concessions can abate, much like they did in January, February, quickly, but we just don't know exactly how that's going to happen. It's a function of how many units do you have, how aggressive the owners are. Obviously, if you have -- if you deliver a new building, you have $0 coming in on your vacant units. And so you're highly motivated to rent them. And many of those owners are saying, ""Hey, rather than leaving it vacant, I'll try to hit really high absorption numbers and increase my cash flow."" Again, they are incented -- they have a different financial objective or a different financial view relative to stabilized apartments. And so -- but they have a dramatic effect on the stabilized apartments. So that process is going to play out, and so we're going to be clearly under a bit more pressure than we have over the last couple of years. And we'll have to see how that ultimately turns out."

And when the stock price recovered, and we were not trading at a discount to NAV, we decided to just go ahead and redeploy that with the 1031 Exchange. So the evolution of our thought process on that is to go ahead and use the balance sheet because it seems like the dislocations in the stock are -- and we had one in the first quarter, those dislocations are relatively temporary in nature. And so I don't want to give you exact targets, but of the $250 million program, we've decided to take some balance sheet risk, to the extent that the stock trades at a significant discount to NAV. And again, I'm not going to share with you our targets and how that works. But practically, if it's not 10% to 15% type of discounts, it probably doesn't make much of a difference.

Those numbers are incredibly powerful when it comes to owning apartments.

So definitely, affordability is much, much different in Seattle than San Francisco, and that would drive what John Burkart was talking about, with respect to double-up some more -- the more affordability enters the equation, the more doubling up you would expect to happen. So clearly, Seattle, if you look at median income levels are high, about $84,000, which is less than San Francisco and San Jose that are both over $100,000.

And welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I'll cover the following topics on the call:",1408,"Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining us today. And welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I'll cover the following topics on the call: first, our commentary and quarterly results and market conditions; second, an investment market update; and finally, the latest on rent control proposals in California. 
So on to the first topic. The second quarter was challenging operationally, as job growth was weaker than expected in several key markets, often coinciding with peaking apartment supply deliveries. With that said, we're pleased that we exceeded our core FFO per share guidance for the quarter and are increasing our 2016 core FFO guidance by $0.06 at the midpoint. We are also tightening the revenue guidance range, leaving the midpoint of our revenue guidance slightly lower, largely attributable to reduced rent growth expectations in Northern California. Once again, I thank the Essex team for their focus and effort in driving bottom line growth in a demanding and changing environment.
Generally speaking, the West Coast economy continues to outpace the slow growth national economy, which we now estimate will produce 2016 job growth of 1.8%, down from our prior estimate of 2%. Throughout our California markets, we have pockets of strength and weakness coinciding with the quantity of new apartment deliveries and the level of concessions being offered by landlords. In response to these conditions, we have lowered our 2016 market rent forecast by 50 basis points to 5.5% on Page S-16 of our supplemental package. Generally, B-quality apartments and locations continue to perform better than As, as lower price points become more important to renters as affordability pressures increase. 
In my 30 years at Essex, I have not seen the divergence in performance between Seattle and Northern California that we're currently experiencing, and our Seattle results have been a huge positive surprise. The economies of Seattle and Northern California have a large tech component and thus unusual -- and thus usually follow a similar path in terms of rent growth. Seattle generates more housing supply, measured as a percentage of stock, which has historically moderated as long-term rent growth, again, relative to Northern California. The cost of this divergence is largely on the demand side, driven by job growth. To demonstrate this, I'm going to refer to nonseasonally adjusted job growth from January to June, primarily because the year-over-year job numbers are significantly influenced by the strong second half of 2015. 
Seattle had the strongest job growth for the first half of 2016 compared to each of the past 6 years, and the margin of outperformance is notable. In 2015, which you likely will recall was a very good year, Seattle increased total jobs for the first half of the year by 30,000. The comparable job growth for 2016 was 43,400 or 44% more jobs added relative to 2015. To contrast this with Northern California, in January through June 2016, we added 27,000 jobs, down from 44,100 in the comparable period of 2015. Based on this activity, we are changing our 2016 forecast on Page S-16 of the supplement as follows. 
In Seattle, job growth increase was 15% to 55,800 jobs, and our 2016 market rent forecast increases to 8.5% from 6.1%. In Northern California, job growth is reduced from 93,100 to 74,200, and our 2016 market rent forecast goes from 6.5% to 3.8%. We still believe that our apartments located in the centers of technology and innovation will deliver above-average rent growth. This belief is supported by the integration of technology into virtually every part of our lives, resulting in high growth expectation, higher income levels and better wage growth. 
Southern California remains on track to achieve our targets for 2016. There are, however, pockets of supply that impact price in submarkets. Overall, we had solid results through the Southland, especially in L.A. and San Diego. As a result, we're leaving our 2016 rent growth expectations unchanged. As noted on our last call, apartment supply deliveries are inherently lumpy, which affects market rents based on the concession level and other pricing considerations. Last quarter, we estimated that approximately 70% of the 2016 supply will occur in the second and third quarter of -- in San Francisco, San Jose and Los Angeles. In San Francisco and San Jose, we expect apartment supply to begin to moderate in the fourth quarter of 2016, and we expect new deliveries of apartments in 2017 will fall about 20% to 30% in San Francisco and 30% to 40% in San Jose. 
Second topic, investment markets. Our 2016 guidance called for $400 million to $600 million in acquisitions and $200 million to $300 million in dispositions. Through the second quarter, we've acquired around $150 million and disposed of about $110 million, including our pro-rata share of co-investments. We've also added approximately $67 million to the outstanding balance of our preferred equity investments. 
We are working on several acquisition deals that we expect to be largely funded through dispositions. With this activity, we should be in the range of our guidance assumptions for acquisitions and at the high end of the range for dispositions. We also have about $15 million [ph] in potential preferred equity transactions that are being underwritten. 
During the quarter, the stock traded at or marginally below net asset value, making accretive acquisitions and dispositions challenging to execute. We continue to wait for market conditions that allow accretive transactions, strongly preferring that to acquisitions or dispositions that accomplish little with respect to growth in NAV and core FFO per share. We will also continue to selectively call the portfolio, reinvest it in lower-risk or higher growth opportunities. 
Cap rates have been stable for the last quarter, with A-quality property and locations trading around a 4 to 4.25 cap rate using the Essex methodology, and from time to time, more aggressive buyers will pay sub-4 cap rates. B-quality property and locations typically have cap rates 25 to 50 basis points higher than A-quality property. 
While rental growth rates are moderating, so is the cost of debt, such that the percentage of positive leverage on real estate deals is approaching record highs. We continue to see fewer redevelopment starts in Northern California, largely attributable to increased cost of construction and discipline shown by lenders. We expect a small increase in apartment supply in Seattle in Southern California in 2017. 
Market clearing cap rates for development deals typically generate a 4.5% to 4.75% untrended cap rate, which is below our yield threshold. We continue to look for development opportunities that meet our underwriting criteria, and we are not likely to lower targets in the near term. 
And then finally, third topic, rent control. Generally, there appears to be less urgency related to rent control now that rents have moderated in Northern California. However, the process started by tenant rights groups in several Northern California cities has led to several ballot initiatives. So far, qualified initiatives exist for the ballot in Northern California cities of Mountain View, Richmond, San Mateo and Alameda. Burlingame remains in the qualification process. Generally, these proposals provide for CPI-based rent increases on renewals only, subject to a cap. These are in addition to changes to the rent control ordinance in San Jose that I discussed in last quarter's call. 
It is important to note that all local rent control ordinances must comply with state law, which mandates, among other things, that vacant apartments are prohibited from rent control. We believe that these various ordinances will have limited impact on Essex, primarily because a vast majority of our properties are newer than the rent control cutoff dates and the various stabilization ordinances or state law, whichever applies. 
Finally, in our experience, rent control ordinances generally shift the pricing burden from the renewing renter to the new resident. In other words, while rent control reduces renewal rent increases, it also reduces turnover in all rent control property, which means that fewer apartments are available to rent for people looking for a new apartment, which likely pushes rents upward on the vacant and available apartment inventory. Thus, while renewals will often occur at below-market rates, this impact is partially mitigated by higher rents on new leases, reflecting the unintended secondary effect of rent control. 
That concludes my comments. Thank you again for joining the call. I'll now turn the call over to John Burkart."

We had another good quarter, delivering total same-store revenue growth of 6.9% and NOI growth of 8.2% relative to the comparable quarter. As Northern California has slowed down due to the factors that Mike mentioned, Seattle has strength",872,"Thank you, Mike. We had another good quarter, delivering total same-store revenue growth of 6.9% and NOI growth of 8.2% relative to the comparable quarter. As Northern California has slowed down due to the factors that Mike mentioned, Seattle has strengthened and Southern California continues to perform. 
Now I will share some highlights for each region. The strong demand in Seattle, fueled by the surge in employment through the first half of this year, which is above our expectations, enabled the market to absorb the new supply and continue to grow revenues. Our Seattle portfolio grew revenues 7.5% in the second quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter. 
The submarkets performed similar to last year, with the CBD growing revenue about 5.4% and the East side, North and South submarkets, where over 80% of our portfolio is located, growing revenues between 7.7% and 9% for the second quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter. 
In the Bay Area, the market has strengthened from the first quarter. July rents are up about 5% from the beginning of the year. However, due to the tough comps from last year, net effective rents are up only about 1/2 percent from last year's rent at this time. 
San Francisco and San Jose continue to absorb the supply at a rate of approximately 19 units per month for lease-up and 30 units per month for lease-up, respectively, for AXIO. Concessions have decreased from 6 to 8 weeks, down from 4 to 6 weeks. East Bay has been stronger, however, as the toughest comps for the peak leasing season. 
Our 2 lease-ups in the East Bay, The Galloway and Agora, are leasing up as planned, with The Galloway absorbing about 30 units per month and the 49-unit Agora leasing about 15 units per month. 
The Bay Area economy continues to be a vibrant economy, benefiting from the ongoing expansion of technology into traditional industries. Numerous corporations have created innovation outposts in the Bay Area such as General Electric, Walmart, BMW, Nissan and General Motors. According to a recent study, there are over 50 corporate innovation outposts located in the Bay Area. The next largest concentration is in London with only 10. 
Office absorption was positive in all 3 Bay Area MSAs, from 321,000 square feet in Oakland MSA to 790,000 square feet in the San Jose MSA. There were numerous leases signed in the Bay Area recently by companies such as Tidbits, Lift, Stripes, LifeLock, Uber and Twitch, a video game, a division of Amazon, all combined, leasing over 1 million square feet of space in the quarter. 
Currently, there's approximately 10.8 million square feet of office space under construction in the Bay Area, of which 46% is preleased. 
[indiscernible], the Chinese electronics maker, just purchased nearly 50 acres of land that belonged to Yahoo! near [indiscernible] Stadium in Santa Clara, California. The acquisition adds 3 million square feet of space for [indiscernible] operations, which spans smartphones, bicycles, virtual reality headsets and, eventually, electric cars and is enough for about 12,000 workers. 
Finally, the city of Santa Clarita recently approved related $6.5 billion major project just north of [indiscernible] Stadium, the largest private development in Silicon Valley history. The project includes 5.7 million square feet of office space, 1.1 million square feet of retail space, 1,360 apartment homes, 700 hotel rooms and 450,000 square feet of restaurant and entertainment space. Construction is expected to start in late 2017. 
The Southern California region continues to be a solid performer overall. In the L.A. MSA, the CBD grew revenues 3.8% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year's quarter, as it continues to absorb new supply. The Woodland Hills Tri-Cities submarkets were the strongest in L.A. MSA, growing revenues over 7% for the second quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter. 
Silicon Beach continues to see new investment from technology companies. Google is outgrowing its 100,000 square feet space in Venice and is expanding to the 319,000-square-foot hangar where Howard Hughes is assembled to giant [indiscernible] called the [indiscernible]. Google purchased the adjacent 12 acres of empty land, next to the hangar, a couple of years ago. 
In the Orange County, in North Orange submarkets -- in Orange County, the North Orange submarket outperformed South Orange submarket in the second quarter of 2016, with revenues growing 5.9% and 3.1%, respectively, over the prior year's quarter. Revenue increased 7.4% in San Diego's MSA, with the Northern submarkets outperforming the CBD and Southern some markets relative to the comparable quarter. Recently, Google signed a 60,000-square-foot office lease in Northern San Diego's tech-heavy Sorrento Mesa area, expanding the Southern California footprint into San Diego for the first time. 
Currently, our portfolio is at 96.2% and our availability of 30 days out is at 5.2%. Our renewals are being sent out in the 5% to 6% range in both Northern and Southern California and in the 6 to 8% range in the Pacific Northwest for the third quarter. We are positioned well for the second half of this year, and we look forward to 2017 when we expect the supply to decrease in Northern California. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman."

Today, I will comment on our second quarter results, the state of our balance sheet and the updated full year guidance. 
Once again, our core FFO per share for the quarter exceeded the midpoint of the guidance by $0.08. Although $0.04 of the outperformance primarily related to property tax refunds and timing of expenses, the remaining $0.04 was driven by stronger-than-anticipated operations, capital and investment decisions, which benefited the bottom line. 
In addition, our total FFO for the quarter was actually higher than core FFO per share by $0.07. This was primarily attributed to successful insurance recoveries for lost rents due to the MB360 fire, which occurred prior to the BRE merger. 
As for our balance sheet, during the quarter, we issued $450 million of 10-year unsecured bonds at a coupon of 3 3/8 and retired our Series H Preferred Stock. Our only remaining debt maturity this year is a $200 million term loan due in November, which we plan to refinance with a new 5-year unsecured term loan. And we expect to attain a more attractive pricing than the current 2.4%.
 
So far, this year, we have funded our development equity needs with disposition proceeds and have not issued any common equity. 
Currently, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is inside of our target range, and we are comfortable with this ratio resting in the high-5s, as this range has proven to have successfully weathered the Great Recession. 
With our $1 billion revolver undrawn, a strong balance sheet and numerous sources of equity and debt-to-capital, we continue to be well positioned to -- for future growth. 
Turning to our revised guidance for the full year. As Mike commented, even though Northern California is facing headwinds this year, we still expect the region to perform well relative to the nation and produce over 7% same-property revenue growth. However, the lumpiness of supply deliveries in Northern California, coupled with lower job growth in the region, will impact our full year same-store rent growth. Therefore, we have tightened our range and lowered the midpoint. 
Our expense growth assumptions remain unchanged at 3.8%. The resulting expected NOI growth is now 8.1% at the midpoint, which remains within the guidance range provided at the beginning of 2016. 
From an FFO perspective, the projected reduction to same-property growth rate is approximately $0.05 per share to the full year core FFO. But due to favorable year-to-date results, which have exceeded our original forecast and accretive capital markets and investment transactions completed so far, we are able to raise our full year core FFO midpoint by $0.06 per share to $10.98. 
For 2016, we are projecting core FFO growth of 12%, which represents our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. 
Thank you, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions."

It's interesting, when we talk about how unusual this has played out this year, it almost means that we have to turn to whether it's a one-time occurrence or a part of trends going either direction, both in Northern California and Seattle. And the answer to that is it's, I think, unknowable. And it becomes one of the things we're very focused on trying to figure out. But I think the expectation would be, well, let's go back to when we started the year. We started the year with an expectation that Seattle would have continued good job growth. And because of the supply, there would be pressure on rents. I think we started the year with a rent growth expectation of around 4.9%. So what happened is we got the supply, but we just dramatically exceeded the job growth, as noted in my comments. I suspect that some of those conditions will even out, that, again, I've been here for 30 years, just had my 30th anniversary and here at Essex, and I've never seen this divergence. And so I would say 2 things. One, we don't know. Two, we suspect that we will see a more normal balance, more consistent with 29 to 30 years I've been here. And number three, we're going to be studying it to try and determine what we think the longer-term trends might be. Does that make sense? So the answer is [indiscernible]."

We have not seen changes in cap rates, and I think you've got -- as I tried to comment in my prepared remarks, you have 2 forces. I think, on the one hand, you have lower growth rates, although, to put that in perspective, the growth rates that we saw over the last 4 or 5 years are extraordinary in Northern California. So I don't think that most of the private investors that were buying property Northern California had the expectation of the rent growth that they got over the last several years. So I think the growth that we got for over the last several years was an anomaly, not a normal thing. And I don't think, again, that most buyers have that expectation. Having said that, as it relates to the longer-term picture, the private markets tend to be long-term oriented in terms of making these investments. And I think they still see Northern California as one of the strongest long-term CAGRs of rent growth generators that there is in the United States. And so they know that, and they play a long-term game. And so I don't think that the attractiveness in the investment markets of property Northern California has changed very much. And then finally, the third factor is you have debt costs that are lower now. And so the amount of positive leverage you have on apartment properties is pretty extraordinary. And we're 26% levered. A lot of investors out there are 60% or 70% levered. And obviously, that makes a huge difference. So I don't see anything in the near term where you can buy a property that yields somewhere around 4.5%, finance it with a lot of positive leverage with some growth over time. I think, in this environment, that looks like a winner more broadly. And so I wouldn't expect cap rates or evaluations to change very significantly at all."

Obviously, that helps us and the flip in San Francisco, for example, where you're going to start regulating, I mean, they're going to put it the other way. It's going to hurt you. So we have not tried to do that, but again, I think there are other factors that are similar to that, to the extent people are doubling up, to the extent that employers are allowing people to work from home x days a week so that they can commute longer distances and/or connect by telecommunication devices, et cetera, and not coming to the office at all. So there's a whole cadre of things that we try to capture in our relationship between job growth and demand or households. And so to the extent that Airbnb or already these other factors might enter into the equation, we would alter our -- it's generally 2:1 relationship. So 2 jobs equal 1 household, and that 1 household covers both the for sale and the rental stocks.

So our tendency is actually start to push the 2:1 up to a higher ratio and actually doing that in connection with affordability as well because people make different decisions based on relative affordability of apartments within marketplace. So it's all part of a discussion, but it's a larger discussion than Airbnb is my point."

They are -- they're increasing and have increased. This is Mike Schall again. And again, going back to Northern California in the last year for example, where we had an incredible surge in rents, it pushed the affordability in San Francisco to about -- where are we? It's well over the long-term high. So we have added almost 29%. And the long-term average is 26.5%, and the high is 33.1%. So we're starting to push beyond that range that people can afford. And our view is that affordability, basically, is a constraint. It doesn't mean that if it's super cheap, then that's good. It's just having a very low ratio can mean just have too much housing in the marketplace. That's obviously not a good thing either. But there are couple of markets in San Francisco and the Bay Area that are pushing that ratio to a level that we haven't seen in several -- in a couple of decades. So that is an area of concern. Having said that, with rents moderating this year and personal incomes increasing, it helps take pressure off of that ratio. So again, my view is that last year, we got, let's say, 2 years of rent growth in Northern California. And just a little bit of a breather, part of that is caused by affordability, and part of that is pushing renters into the other markets, the East Bay, for example, where -- which is where we're getting the best rent growth this year. So it's part of the equation that we consider, again, when we start pushing up into the mid-20s. When people are paying 25%, let's say, or higher of the median income in rent or in their rent, then it starts becoming an issue."

In general, so going back to the beginning of the year, we had Seattle as our weakest market. And it wasn't because we thought that there was some implosion intact or even a problem intact. It was just simply -- if you just look at the ratio of supply and demand, it looked like it was more exposed than either Northern California or Southern California. So that's what caused that. Again, we do this based on experience, history and judgment, and sometimes, we're wrong. And so certainly, that's the case in Seattle at this point in time. As to going forward, are we going to continue at 3.5% job growth in Seattle, which will take of whatever supply the market can produce? I would guess that it's going to continue to be better than we think, but I don't know if we can sustain 3.5%. I would -- I still rank our markets as -- in terms of desirability as Northern, Southern California, obviously, those big geography, but Northern and Southern California as being more desirable than Seattle because we've seen supply really get out of whack in Seattle in prior cycles. And so that's how we would judge it. California has all these various other elements where they're trying to convert from a suburban type housing profile to more of an urban high-rise residential around transit. That's going to be a long-term difficult thing to, do. And I think it will have the overall impact of muting supply deliveries. So I guess, that's why we give California, the urban core coastal California markets a little bit of a positive relative to Seattle. As it relates to the rent-to-median income, Seattle's current ratio is around 21%. The long-term average rent around 18%. So this is a good example of the long-term average not being all that meaningful. You might say, ""Yes, there's plenty of room for rents to grow there because it's only 18%."" The problem is it's 18% because there's too much affordable housing in the marketplace. So the lower that ratio gets, the less pricing power you generally have in the marketplace. So that's why you say that rent-to-income acts mainly as a constraint not sort of a driving force. So there's plenty of room for pricing. Seattle has very high median household income levels, in the $80,000 to $90,000 range. And the rents are pretty attractively priced. So I don't see that as a constraint."

And John Eudy, who heads development and is Chief Investment Officer, along with Craig Zimmerman, can maybe comment on this as well. I think it's just rents and cost to build. So you need really high rents and in order to pencil a development deal. And where do you find those really high rents? You find them in San Francisco proper and on the Peninsula and in San Jose and, to some extent, in various parts of L.A., which, again, it has more supply than it's had over the last several years. So that's what moderates construction outside of the core areas. The rents are quite as high, and construction costs are pretty darn similar. And I guess, the issue that this brings up is how deep is the, A, tranche of the rental market because now we've had several years of delivering the As into the top tier, how deep is that? How long can you continue to get those, achieved those rents before you're really dipping down into the B part of the renter pool and you're making some of that top-level to Bs, you're pushing them into the A product, which is, I think, part of the problem here. So again, we're watching that. I think there's a certain level at which we -- what California needs is more affordable housing. And the current solutions to this situation are to produce more, very high-end luxury housing. And so there's an obvious disconnect that needs to play out. Do you have any comments to that one, Mr. Eudy?"

They're smart when it comes to rental positions. They're smart when it comes to making their decisions for the most part. And so I wouldn't see any divergence at all. I think the market is fluid and things change. I think that you could have some tech companies opening more office space based on where their people want to work. That's a possibility.

Cap rates tend to be pretty sticky because the first thing that happens is buyers and sellers do not agree on what the price is. So sellers remember the last 10 transactions, and buyers think the world has changed and so they demand something different. And so that can go on for some period of time, and you would see it in the transaction volumes when the deals are closed. Normally, the things that motivate transactions are financial distress and those types of things, which, in a world of positive leverage, we don't really see that happening and really great economics as well. So I would say that you would have to see maybe, I'd say, a year before you really saw a real directional change in cap rates because, again, I think you're going to end up with the [indiscernible] transactions in the meantime.

Again, these businesses, our business was not founded upon 6% annual rent growth for long, long periods of time because income levels have to -- have some relationship to rent levels in order for people to afford it. So there are constraints within this industry or within the housing markets that will constrain you ultimately. Again, it doesn't mean that we're going to go from being a great market to a lousy market. And I think that maybe investors are focused on the Great Recession, which I think was an extraordinary period of time or the Internet boom bust period, where often neglect the fact that rents went up 40% in 2 years and then went all the way back down in the ensuing 3 years. But nonetheless, those things, I think, are dominant in people's memories. And -- but I think that the normal cycles would not be nearly that extreme. So again, I think Northern California goes back to being a more normal market. What does that mean? It means, let's say, 3% to 4% revenue growth. Let's say, we're going to add some value and renovation and maybe can add some value in transactions. And the business runs well at that, with that."

And welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I'll cover the following topics on the call:",1410,"Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining us today. And welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I'll cover the following topics on the call: first, our commentary on quarterly results and market conditions; second, an investment market update; and finally, the latest on rent control proposals in California.
So on to the first topic. The second quarter was challenging operationally, as job growth was weaker than expected in several key markets, often coinciding with peaking apartment supply deliveries. With that said, we're pleased that we exceeded our core FFO per share guidance for the quarter and are increasing our 2016 core FFO guidance by $0.06 at the midpoint. We are also tightening the revenue guidance range, leaving the midpoint of our revenue guidance slightly lower, largely attributable to reduced rent growth expectations in Northern California. Once again, I thank the Essex team for their focus and effort in driving bottom line growth in a demanding and changing environment.
Generally speaking, the West Coast economy continues to outpace the slow growth national economy, which we now estimate will produce 2016 job growth of 1.8%, down from our prior estimate of 2%. Throughout our California markets, we have pockets of strength and weakness coinciding with the quantity of new apartment deliveries and the level of concessions being offered by landlords. In response to these conditions, we have lowered our 2016 market rent forecast by 50 basis points to 5.5% on Page S-16 of our supplemental package. Generally, B-quality apartments and locations continue to perform better than As, as lower price points become more important to renters as affordability pressures increase.
In my 30 years at Essex, I have not seen the divergence in performance between Seattle and Northern California that we're currently experiencing, and our Seattle results have been a huge positive surprise. The economies of Seattle and Northern California have a large tech component and thus unusual -- and thus usually follow a similar path in terms of rent growth. Seattle generates more housing supply, measured as a percentage of stock, which has historically moderated as long-term rent growth, again, relative to Northern California. The cost of this divergence is largely on the demand side, driven by job growth. To demonstrate this, I'm going to refer to nonseasonally adjusted job growth from January to June, primarily because the year-over-year job numbers are significantly influenced by the strong second half of 2015.
Seattle had the strongest job growth for the first half of 2016 compared to each of the past 6 years, and the margin of outperformance is notable. In 2015, which you likely will recall was a very good year, Seattle increased total jobs for the first half of the year by 30,000. The comparable job growth for 2016 was 43,400 or 44% more jobs added relative to 2015. To contrast this with Northern California, in January through June 2016, we added 27,000 jobs, down from 44,100 in the comparable period of 2015. Based on this activity, we are changing our 2016 forecast on Page S-16 of the supplement as follows.
In Seattle, job growth increase is 15% to 55,800 jobs, and our 2016 market rent forecast increases to 8.5% from 6.1%. In Northern California, job growth is reduced from 93,100 to 74,200, and our 2016 market rent forecast goes from 6.5% to 3.8%. We still believe that our apartments located in the centers of technology and innovation will deliver above-average rent growth. This belief is supported by the integration of technology into virtually every part of our lives, resulting in high growth expectation, higher income levels and better wage growth.
Southern California remains on track to achieve our targets for 2016. There are, however, pockets of supply that impact price in certain submarkets. Overall, we had solid results through the Southland, especially in L.A. and San Diego. As a result, we're leaving our 2016 rent growth expectations unchanged. As noted on our last call, apartment supply deliveries are inherently lumpy, which affects market rents based on the concession level and other pricing considerations. Last quarter, we estimated that approximately 70% of the 2016 supply will occur in the second and third quarter of -- in San Francisco, San Jose and Los Angeles. In San Francisco and San Jose, we expect apartment supply to begin to moderate in the fourth quarter of 2016, and we expect new deliveries of apartments in 2017 will fall about 20% to 30% in San Francisco and 30% to 40% in San Jose.
Second topic, investment markets. Our 2016 guidance called for $400 million to $600 million in acquisitions and $200 million to $300 million in dispositions. Through the second quarter, we've acquired around $150 million and disposed of about $110 million, including our pro-rata share of co-investments. We've also added approximately $67 million to the outstanding balance of our preferred equity investments.
We are working on several acquisition deals that we expect to be largely funded through dispositions. With this activity, we should be in the range of our guidance assumptions for acquisitions and at the high end of the range for dispositions. We also have about $50 million in potential preferred equity transactions that are being underwritten.
During the quarter, the stock traded at or marginally below net asset value, making accretive acquisitions and dispositions challenging to execute. We continue to wait for market conditions that allow accretive transactions, strongly preferring that to acquisitions or dispositions that accomplish little with respect to growth in NAV and core FFO per share. We will also continue to selectively call the portfolio, reinvest it in lower-risk or higher growth opportunities. 
Cap rates have been stable for the last quarter, with A-quality property and locations trading around a 4 to 4.25 cap rate using the Essex methodology. And from time to time, more aggressive buyers will pay sub-4 cap rates. B-quality property and locations typically have cap rates 25 to 50 basis points higher than A-quality property.
While rental growth rates are moderating, so is the cost of debt, such that the percentage of positive leverage on real estate deals is approaching record highs. We continue to see fewer redevelopment starts in Northern California, largely attributable to increased cost of construction and discipline shown by lenders. We expect a small increase in apartment supply in Seattle and Southern California in 2017. 
Market clearing cap rates for development deals typically generate a 4.5% to 4.75% untrended cap rate, which is below our yield threshold. We continue to look for development opportunities that meet our underwriting criteria, and we are not likely to lower targets in the near term.
And then finally, third topic, rent control. Generally, there appears to be less urgency related to rent control now that rents have moderated in Northern California. However, the process started by tenant rights groups in several Northern California cities has led to several ballot initiatives. So far, qualified initiatives exist for the ballot in Northern California cities of Mountain View, Richmond, San Mateo and Alameda. Burlingame remains in the qualification process. Generally, these proposals provide for a CPI-based rent increases on renewals only, subject to a cap. These are in addition to changes to the rent control ordinance in San Jose that I discussed in last quarter's call. 
It is important to note that all local rent control ordinances must comply with state law, which mandates, among other things, that vacant apartments are prohibited from rent control. We believe that these various ordinances will have limited impact on Essex, primarily because of the vast majority of our properties are newer than the rent control cutoff dates and the various stabilization ordinances or state law, whichever applies.
Finally, in our experience, rent control ordinances generally shift the pricing burden from the renewing renter to the new resident. In other words, while rent control reduces renewal rent increases, it also reduces turnover in all rent control property, which means that fewer apartments are available to rent for people looking for a new apartment, which likely pushes rents upward on the vacant and available apartment inventory. Thus, while renewals will often occur at below-market rates, this impact is partially mitigated by higher rents on new leases, reflecting the unintended secondary effect of rent control.
That concludes my comments. Thank you again for joining the call. I'll now turn the call over to John Burkart."

We had another good quarter, delivering total same-store revenue growth of 6.9% and NOI growth of 8.2% relative to the comparable quarter. As Northern California has slowed down due to the factors that Mike mentioned, Seattle has strengthened and Southern California continues to perform.
Now I will share some highlights for each region. The strong demand in Seattle, fueled by the surge in employment for the first half of this year, which is above our expectations, enabled the market to absorb the new supply and continue to grow revenues. Our Seattle portfolio grew revenues 7.5% in the second quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter.
The submarkets performed similar to last year, with the CBD growing revenue about 5.4% and the East side, North and South submarkets, where over 80% of our portfolio is located, growing revenues between 7.7% and 9% for the second quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter.
In the Bay Area, the market has strengthened from the first quarter. July rents are up about 5% from the beginning of the year. However, due to the tough comps from last year, net effective rents are up only about 1/2 percent from last year's rent at this time.
San Francisco and San Jose continue to absorb the supply at a rate of approximately 19 units per month for lease-up and 30 units per month for lease-up, respectively, for AXIO. Concessions have decreased from 6 to 8 weeks, down from 4 to 6 weeks. East Bay has been stronger, however, as the toughest comps for the peak leasing season.
Our 2 lease-ups in the East Bay, The Galloway and Agora, are leasing up as planned, with The Galloway absorbing about 30 units per month and the 49-unit Agora leasing about 15 units per month.
The Bay Area economy continues to be a vibrant economy, benefiting from the ongoing expansion of technology into traditional industries. Numerous corporations have created innovation outposts in the Bay Area such as General Electric, Walmart, BMW, Nissan and General Motors. According to a recent study, there are over 50 corporate innovation outposts located in the Bay Area. The next largest concentration is in London with only 10. 
Office absorption was positive in all 3 Bay Area MSAs, from 321,000 square feet in Oakland MSA to 790,000 square feet in the San Jose MSA. There were numerous leases signed in the Bay Area recently by companies such as Tidbits, Lyft, Stripes, LifeLock, Delta, Uber, and Twitch, a video gaming division of Amazon, all combined, leasing over 1 million square feet of space in the quarter.
Currently, there's approximately 10.8 million square feet of office space under construction in the Bay Area, of which 46% is preleased.
LeEco, the Chinese electronics maker, just purchased nearly 50 acres of land that belonged to Yahoo! near Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. The acquisition adds 3 million square feet of space for LeEco's operations, which spans smartphones, bicycles, virtual reality headsets and, eventually, electric cars and is enough for about 12,000 workers.
Finally, the city of Santa Clarita recently approved related $6.5 billion major project just north of Levi's Stadium, the largest private development in Silicon Valley history. The project includes 5.7 million square feet of office space, 1.1 million square feet of retail space, 1,360 apartment homes, 700 hotel rooms and 450,000 square feet of restaurant and entertainment space. Construction is expected to start in late 2017.
The Southern California region continues to be a solid performer overall. In the L.A. MSA, the CBD grew revenues 3.8% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year's quarter, as it continues to absorb new supply. The Woodland Hills and Tri-Cities submarkets were the strongest in the L.A. MSA, growing revenues over 7% for the second quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter.
Silicon Beach continues to see new investment from technology companies. Google is outgrowing its 100,000 square feet space in Venice and is expanding to the 319,000-square-foot hangar where Howard Hughes is assembled a giant wooden seaplane called the Spruce Goose. Google purchased the adjacent 12 acres of empty land, next to the hangar, a couple of years ago.
In the Orange County, in North Orange submarkets -- in Orange County, the North Orange submarket outperformed South Orange submarket in the second quarter of 2016, with revenues growing 5.9% and 3.1%, respectively, over the prior year's quarter. Revenue increased 7.4% in San Diego's MSA, with the Northern submarkets outperforming the CBD and Southern some markets relative to the comparable quarter. Recently, Google signed a 60,000-square-foot office lease in Northern San Diego's tech-heavy Sorrento Mesa area, expanding its Southern California footprint into San Diego for the first time.
Currently, our portfolio is at 96.2%, and our availability 30 days out is at 5.2%. Our renewals are being sent out in the 5% to 6% range in both Northern and Southern California and in the 6 to 8% range in the Pacific Northwest for the third quarter. We are positioned well for the second half of this year, and we look forward to 2017 when we expect the supply to decrease in Northern California.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman."

Once again, our core FFO per share for the quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.08. Although $0.04 of the outperformance primarily related to property tax refunds and timing of expenses, the remaining $0.04 was driven by stronger-than-anticipated operations, capital and investment decisions, which benefited the bottom line.
In addition, our total FFO for the quarter was actually higher than core FFO per share by $0.07. This was primarily attributed to successful insurance recoveries for lost rents due to the MB360 fire, which occurred prior to the BRE merger. 
As for our balance sheet, during the quarter, we issued $450 million of 10-year unsecured bonds at a coupon of 3 3/8 and retired our Series H Preferred Stock. Our only remaining debt maturity this year is a $200 million term loan due in November, which we plan to refinance with a new 5-year unsecured term loan. And we expect to retain a more attractive pricing than the current 2.4%.
 
So far, this year, we have funded our development equity needs with disposition proceeds and have not issued any common equity.
Currently, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is inside of our target range, and we are comfortable with this ratio resting in the high-5s, as this range has proven to have successfully weathered the Great Recession.
With our $1 billion revolver undrawn, a strong balance sheet and numerous sources of equity and debt capital, we continue to be well positioned to -- for future growth.
Turning to our revised guidance for the full year. As Mike commented, even though Northern California is facing headwinds this year, we still expect the region to perform well relative to the nation and produce over 7% same-property revenue growth. However, the lumpiness of supply deliveries in Northern California, coupled with lower job growth in the region, will impact our full year same-store rent growth. Therefore, we have tightened our range and lowered the midpoint.
Our expense growth assumptions remain unchanged at 3.8%. The resulting expected NOI growth is now 8.1% at the midpoint, which remains within the guidance range provided at the beginning of 2016.
From an FFO perspective, the projected reduction to same-property growth rate is approximately $0.05 per share to the full year core FFO. But due to favorable year-to-date results, which have exceeded our original forecast and accretive capital markets and investment transactions completed so far, we are able to raise our full year core FFO midpoint by $0.06 per share to $10.98.
For 2016, we are projecting core FFO growth of 12%, which represents our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth.

It's interesting, when we talk about how unusual this has played out this year, it almost means that we have to determine whether it's a onetime occurrence or it is a part of trends going either direction, both in Northern California and Seattle. And the answer to that is it's, I think, unknowable. And it becomes one of the things we're very focused on trying to figure out. But I think the expectation would be, well, let's go back to where we started the year. We started the year with the expectation that Seattle would have continued good job growth. And because of the supply, there would be pressure on rents. I think we started the year with a rent growth expectation of around 4.9%. So what happened is we got the supply, but we just dramatically exceeded the job growth, as noted in my comments. I suspect that some of those conditions will even out, that, again, I've been here for 30 years, just had my 30th anniversary and here at Essex, and I've never seen this divergence. And so I would say 2 things. One, we don't know. Two, we suspect that we will see a more normal balance, more consistent with 29 to 30 years I've been here. And number three, we're going to be studying it to try and determine what we think the longer-term trends might be. Does that make sense? So the answer is [indiscernible]."

We have not seen changes in cap rates, and I think you've got -- and as I tried to comment in my prepared remarks, you have 2 forces. I think, on the one hand, you have lower growth rates, although, to put that in perspective, the growth rates that we saw over the last 4, 5 years are extraordinary in Northern California. So I don't think that most of the private investors that were buying property in Northern California had the expectation of the rent growth that they got over the last several years. So I think the growth that we got is -- for over the last several years was an anomaly, not a normal thing. And I don't think, again, that most buyers have that expectation. Having said that, as it relates to the longer-term picture, the private markets tend to be long-term oriented in terms of making these investments. And I think they still see Northern California as one of the strongest long-term CAGRs of rent growth generators that there is in the United States. And so they know that, and they play a long-term game. And so I don't think that the attractiveness in the investment markets of property Northern California has changed very much. And then finally, the third factor is you have debt costs that are lower now. And so the amount of positive leverage you have on apartment properties is pretty extraordinary. And we're 26% levered. A lot of investors out there are 60% or 70% levered. And obviously, that makes a huge difference. So I don't see anything in the near term where you can buy a property that yields somewhere around 4.5%, finance it with a lot of positive leverage with some growth over time. I think, in this environment, that looks like a winner more broadly. And so I wouldn't expect cap rates or evaluations to change very significantly at all."

And as you point out, I agree with you on Airbnb to the extent you have more apartment units that are pulled out for a hoteling type of use. Obviously, that helps us in the flip in San Francisco, for example, where you're going to start regulating, I mean, they're going to put that the other way. It's going to hurt you. So we have not tried to do that, but again, I think there are other factors that are similar to that, to the extent people are doubling up, to the extent that employers are allowing people to work from home x days a week so that they can commute longer distances and/or connect by telecommunication devices, et cetera, and not coming to the office at all. So there's a whole cadre of things we try to capture in our relationship between job growth and demand or households. And so to the extent that Airbnb or any of these other factors might enter into the equation, we would alter our -- it's generally 2:1 relationship. So 2 jobs equal 1 household, and that 1 household covers both the for sale and the rental stocks. So we would start changing that ratio if we thought that any one of these factors became more significant."

And again, going back to Northern California, last year, for example, where we had an incredible surge in rents, it pushed the affordability in San Francisco to about -- where we've been. It's well over the long-term high. So we have added almost 29%. And the long-term average is 26.5%, and the high is 33.1%. So we're starting to push beyond that range that people can afford. And our view is that affordability, basically, is a constraint. It doesn't mean that if it's super cheap, then that's good. It's just having a very low ratio can mean -- just have too much housing in the marketplace. That's obviously not a good thing either. But there are couple of markets in San Francisco and the Bay Area that are pushing that ratio to a level that we haven't seen in several -- in a couple of decades. So that is an area of concern. Having said that, with rents moderating this year and personal incomes increasing, it helps take pressure off of that ratio. So again, my view is that last year, we got, let's say, 2 years of rent growth in Northern California. And just a little bit of a breather, part of that is caused by affordability, and part of that is pushing renters into the other markets, the East Bay, for example, where -- which is where we're getting the best rent growth this year. So it's part of the equation that we consider, again, when we start pushing up into the mid-20s. When people are paying 25%, let's say, or higher of the median income in rent or in their rent, then it starts becoming an issue."

In general, so going back to the beginning of the year, we had Seattle as our weakest market. And it wasn't because we thought that there was some implosion intact or even a problem intact. It was just simply -- if you just look at the ratio of supply and demand, it looked like it was more exposed than either Northern California or Southern California. So that's what caused that. Again, we do this based on experience, history and judgment, and sometimes, we're wrong. And so certainly, that's the case in Seattle at this point in time. As to going forward, are we going to continue at 3.5% job growth in Seattle, which will take care of whatever supply the market can produce? I would guess that it's going to continue to be better than we think, but I don't know we can sustain 3.5%. I would -- I still rank our markets as -- in terms of desirability as Northern, Southern California, obviously, those big geography, but Northern and Southern California as being more desirable than Seattle because we've seen supply really get out of whack in Seattle in prior cycles, and so that's how we would judge it. California has all these various other elements where they're trying to convert from a suburban type housing profile to more of an urban high-rise residential around transit. That's going to be a long-term difficult thing to do, and I think it will have the overall impact of muting supply deliveries. So I guess, that's why we give California the urban core coastal California markets a little bit of a positive relative to Seattle. As it relates to the rent-to-median income, Seattle's current ratio is around 21%. The long-term average rent, 18%. So this is a good example of the long-term average not being all that meaningful. You might say, ""Yes, there's plenty of room for rents to grow there because it's only 18%."" The problem is it's 18% because there's too much affordable housing in the marketplace. So the lower that ratio gets, the less pricing power you generally have in the marketplace. So that's why I say that rent-to-income acts mainly as a constraint not a sort of a driving force. So there's plenty of room for pricing, though Seattle has very high median household income levels in the $80,000 to $90,000 range, and the rents are pretty attractively priced. So I don't see that as a constraint."

And John Eudy, who heads development and is Chief Investment Officer, along with Craig Zimmerman, can maybe comment on this as well. I think it's just rents and cost to build. So you need really high rents, and in order to pencil a development deal, and where do you find those really high rents? You find them in San Francisco proper and on the Peninsula and in San Jose, and to some extent, in various parts of L.A., which, again, it has more supply than it's had over the last several years. So that's what moderates construction outside of the core areas. The rents are quite as high, and construction costs are pretty darn similar. And I guess, the issue that this brings up is how deep is the, A, tranche of the rental market because now we've had several years of delivering the As into the -- that top tier, how deep is that? How long can you continue to get those, achieve those rents before you're really dipping down into the B part of the renter pool, and you're making some of that top-level to Bs. You're pushing them into the A product, which is, I think, part of the problem here. So again, we're watching that. I think there's a certain level at which we -- what California needs is more affordable housing. And the current solutions to this situation are to produce more, very high-end luxury housing. And so there's an obvious disconnect that needs to play out. Do you have any comments to that one, Mr. Eudy?"

I mean, that's essentially the dilemma that we're talking about. I mean, tech is tech. It's -- businesses are going to make decisions. People are going to make decisions based on the opportunity before them. They're going to live where they can afford to live in a good place, high quality of life, et cetera, and where would that opportunity present itself, they will find that people are smart. They're smart when it comes to making rental decisions. They're smart when it comes to making career decisions for the most part. And so I wouldn't see any divergence at all. I think it's -- the market is fluid and things change. I think that you could have some tech companies opening more office space based on where their people want to work. That's a possibility. Having said that, as John said, there's millions of square feet being -- of commercial space being delivered here. And you have these tech giants, which have enormous amounts of cash and enormous financial capabilities that are building -- that are investing in these office buildings. Every part of the Silicon Valley, I think, has been essentially remade in a number of different ways. Well, I'll give you another staff that hasn't come up on these calls before, but there are at least 50 non-tech companies that have innovation centers here. John -- actually, John may have mentioned this in his remarks, but non-tech companies with innovation centers here because technology is so integrated in everything we do.

Again, these businesses, our business was not founded upon 6% annual rent growth for long, long periods of time because income levels have to -- have some relationship to rent levels in order for people to afford it. So there are constraints within this industry or within the housing markets that will constrain you ultimately. Again, it doesn't mean that we're going to go from being a great market to a lousy market. And I think that maybe investors are focused on the Great Recession, which I think was an extraordinary period of time or the Internet boom bust period, where that often neglect the fact that rents went up 40% in 2 years, and then went all the way back down in the ensuing 3 years. But nonetheless, those things, I think, are dominant in people's memories, and -- but I think that the normal cycles would not be nearly that extreme. So again, I think Northern California goes back to being a more normal market. What does that mean? It means, let's say, 3% to 4% revenue growth, let's say, we're going to add some value in renovation and maybe we can add some value in transactions, and the business runs well at that, with that."

And welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I'll cover the following topics on the call:",1410,"Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining us today. And welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I'll cover the following topics on the call: first, our commentary on quarterly results and market conditions; second, an investment market update; and finally, the latest on rent control proposals in California.
So on to the first topic. The second quarter was challenging operationally, as job growth was weaker than expected in several key markets, often coinciding with peaking apartment supply deliveries. With that said, we're pleased that we exceeded our core FFO per share guidance for the quarter and are increasing our 2016 core FFO guidance by $0.06 at the midpoint. We are also tightening the revenue guidance range, leaving the midpoint of our revenue guidance slightly lower, largely attributable to reduced rent growth expectations in Northern California. Once again, I thank the Essex team for their focus and effort in driving bottom line growth in a demanding and changing environment.
Generally speaking, the West Coast economy continues to outpace the slow growth national economy, which we now estimate will produce 2016 job growth of 1.8%, down from our prior estimate of 2%. Throughout our California markets, we have pockets of strength and weakness coinciding with the quantity of new apartment deliveries and the level of concessions being offered by landlords. In response to these conditions, we have lowered our 2016 market rent forecast by 50 basis points to 5.5% on Page S-16 of our supplemental package. Generally, B-quality apartments and locations continue to perform better than As, as lower price points become more important to renters as affordability pressures increase.
In my 30 years at Essex, I have not seen the divergence in performance between Seattle and Northern California that we're currently experiencing, and our Seattle results have been a huge positive surprise. The economies of Seattle and Northern California have a large tech component and thus unusual -- and thus usually follow a similar path in terms of rent growth. Seattle generates more housing supply, measured as a percentage of stock, which has historically moderated as long-term rent growth, again, relative to Northern California. The cost of this divergence is largely on the demand side, driven by job growth. To demonstrate this, I'm going to refer to nonseasonally adjusted job growth from January to June, primarily because the year-over-year job numbers are significantly influenced by the strong second half of 2015.
Seattle had the strongest job growth for the first half of 2016 compared to each of the past 6 years, and the margin of outperformance is notable. In 2015, which you likely will recall was a very good year, Seattle increased total jobs for the first half of the year by 30,000. The comparable job growth for 2016 was 43,400 or 44% more jobs added relative to 2015. To contrast this with Northern California, in January through June 2016, we added 27,000 jobs, down from 44,100 in the comparable period of 2015. Based on this activity, we are changing our 2016 forecast on Page S-16 of the supplement as follows.
In Seattle, job growth increase is 15% to 55,800 jobs, and our 2016 market rent forecast increases to 8.5% from 6.1%. In Northern California, job growth is reduced from 93,100 to 74,200, and our 2016 market rent forecast goes from 6.5% to 3.8%. We still believe that our apartments located in the centers of technology and innovation will deliver above-average rent growth. This belief is supported by the integration of technology into virtually every part of our lives, resulting in high growth expectation, higher income levels and better wage growth.
Southern California remains on track to achieve our targets for 2016. There are, however, pockets of supply that impact price in certain submarkets. Overall, we had solid results through the Southland, especially in L.A. and San Diego. As a result, we're leaving our 2016 rent growth expectations unchanged. As noted on our last call, apartment supply deliveries are inherently lumpy, which affects market rents based on the concession level and other pricing considerations. Last quarter, we estimated that approximately 70% of the 2016 supply will occur in the second and third quarter of -- in San Francisco, San Jose and Los Angeles. In San Francisco and San Jose, we expect apartment supply to begin to moderate in the fourth quarter of 2016, and we expect new deliveries of apartments in 2017 will fall about 20% to 30% in San Francisco and 30% to 40% in San Jose.
Second topic, investment markets. Our 2016 guidance called for $400 million to $600 million in acquisitions and $200 million to $300 million in dispositions. Through the second quarter, we've acquired around $150 million and disposed of about $110 million, including our pro-rata share of co-investments. We've also added approximately $67 million to the outstanding balance of our preferred equity investments.
We are working on several acquisition deals that we expect to be largely funded through dispositions. With this activity, we should be in the range of our guidance assumptions for acquisitions and at the high end of the range for dispositions. We also have about $50 million in potential preferred equity transactions that are being underwritten.
During the quarter, the stock traded at or marginally below net asset value, making accretive acquisitions and dispositions challenging to execute. We continue to wait for market conditions that allow accretive transactions, strongly preferring that to acquisitions or dispositions that accomplish little with respect to growth in NAV and core FFO per share. We will also continue to selectively cull the portfolio, reinvest it in lower-risk or higher growth opportunities. 
Cap rates have been stable for the last quarter, with A-quality property and locations trading around a 4 to 4.25 cap rate using the Essex methodology. And from time to time, more aggressive buyers will pay sub-4 cap rates. B-quality property and locations typically have cap rates 25 to 50 basis points higher than A-quality property.
While rental growth rates are moderating, so is the cost of debt, such that the percentage of positive leverage on real estate deals is approaching record highs. We continue to see fewer redevelopment starts in Northern California, largely attributable to increased cost of construction and discipline shown by lenders. We expect a small increase in apartment supply in Seattle and Southern California in 2017. 
Market clearing cap rates for development deals typically generate a 4.5% to 4.75% untrended cap rate, which is below our yield threshold. We continue to look for development opportunities that meet our underwriting criteria, and we are not likely to lower targets in the near term.
And then finally, third topic, rent control. Generally, there appears to be less urgency related to rent control now that rents have moderated in Northern California. However, the process started by tenant rights groups in several Northern California cities has led to several ballot initiatives. So far, qualified initiatives exist for the ballot in Northern California cities of Mountain View, Richmond, San Mateo and Alameda. Burlingame remains in the qualification process. Generally, these proposals provide for a CPI-based rent increases on renewals only, subject to a cap. These are in addition to changes to the rent control ordinance in San Jose that I discussed on last quarter's call. 
It is important to note that all local rent control ordinances must comply with state law, which mandates, among other things, that vacant apartments are prohibited from rent control. We believe that these various ordinances will have limited impact on Essex, primarily because of the vast majority of our properties are newer than the rent control cutoff dates and the various stabilization ordinances or state law, whichever applies.
Finally, in our experience, rent control ordinances generally shift the pricing burden from the renewing renter to the new resident. In other words, while rent control reduces renewal rent increases, it also reduces turnover in all rent control property, which means that fewer apartments are available to rent for people looking for a new apartment, which likely pushes rents upward on the vacant and available apartment inventory. Thus, while renewals will often occur at below-market rates, this impact is partially mitigated by higher rents on new leases, reflecting the unintended secondary effect of rent control.
That concludes my comments. Thank you again for joining the call. I'll now turn the call over to John Burkart."

We had another good quarter, delivering total same-store revenue growth of 6.9% and NOI growth of 8.2% relative to the comparable quarter. As Northern California has slowed down due to the factors that Mike mentioned, Seattle has strengthened and Southern California continues to perform.
Now I will share some highlights for each region. The strong demand in Seattle, fueled by the surge in employment for the first half of this year, which is above our expectations, enabled the market to absorb the new supply and continue to grow revenues. Our Seattle portfolio grew revenues 7.5% in the second quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter.
The submarkets performed similar to last year, with the CBD growing revenue about 5.4% and the East side, North and South submarkets, where over 80% of our portfolio is located, growing revenues between 7.7% and 9% for the second quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter.
In the Bay Area, the market has strengthened from the first quarter. July rents are up about 5% from the beginning of the year. However, due to the tough comps from last year, net effective rents are up only about 1/2 percent from last year's rent at this time.
San Francisco and San Jose continue to absorb the supply at a rate of approximately 19 units per month for lease-up and 30 units per month for lease-up, respectively, for AXIO. Concessions have decreased from 6 to 8 weeks, down from 4 to 6 weeks. East Bay has been stronger, however, as the toughest comps for the peak leasing season.
Our 2 lease-ups in the East Bay, The Galloway and Agora, are leasing up as planned, with The Galloway absorbing about 30 units per month and the 49-unit Agora leasing about 15 units per month.
The Bay Area economy continues to be a vibrant economy, benefiting from the ongoing expansion of technology into traditional industries. Numerous corporations have created innovation outposts in the Bay Area such as General Electric, Walmart, BMW, Nissan and General Motors. According to a recent study, there are over 50 corporate innovation outposts located in the Bay Area. The next largest concentration is in London with only 10. 
Office absorption was positive in all 3 Bay Area MSAs, from 321,000 square feet in Oakland MSA to 790,000 square feet in the San Jose MSA. There were numerous leases signed in the Bay Area recently by companies such as Fitbit, Lyft, Stripes, LifeLock, Delta, Uber, and Twitch, a video gaming division of Amazon, all combined, leasing over 1 million square feet of space in the quarter.
Currently, there's approximately 10.8 million square feet of office space under construction in the Bay Area, of which 46% is preleased.
LeEco, the Chinese electronics maker, just purchased nearly 50 acres of land that belonged to Yahoo! near Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. The acquisition adds 3 million square feet of space for LeEco's operations, which spans smartphones, bicycles, virtual reality headsets and, eventually, electric cars and is enough for about 12,000 workers.
Finally, the city of Santa Clarita recently approved related $6.5 billion major project just north of Levi's Stadium, the largest private development in Silicon Valley history. The project includes 5.7 million square feet of office space, 1.1 million square feet of retail space, 1,360 apartment homes, 700 hotel rooms and 450,000 square feet of restaurant and entertainment space. Construction is expected to start in late 2017.
The Southern California region continues to be a solid performer overall. In the L.A. MSA, the CBD grew revenues 3.8% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year's quarter, as it continues to absorb new supply. The Woodland Hills and Tri-Cities submarkets were the strongest in the L.A. MSA, growing revenues over 7% for the second quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter.
Silicon Beach continues to see new investment from technology companies. Google is outgrowing its 100,000 square feet space in Venice and is expanding to the 319,000-square-foot hangar where Howard Hughes assembled a giant wooden seaplane called the Spruce Goose. Google purchased the adjacent 12 acres of empty land, next to the hangar, a couple of years ago.
In the Orange County, in North Orange submarkets -- in Orange County, the North Orange submarket outperformed South Orange submarket in the second quarter of 2016, with revenues growing 5.9% and 3.1%, respectively, over the prior year's quarter. Revenue increased 7.4% in San Diego's MSA, with the Northern submarkets outperforming the CBD and Southern some markets relative to the comparable quarter. Recently, Google signed a 60,000-square-foot office lease in Northern San Diego's tech-heavy Sorrento Mesa area, expanding its Southern California footprint into San Diego for the first time.
Currently, our portfolio is at 96.2%, and our availability 30 days out is at 5.2%. Our renewals are being sent out in the 5% to 6% range in both Northern and Southern California and in the 6 to 8% range in the Pacific Northwest for the third quarter. We are positioned well for the second half of this year, and we look forward to 2017 when we expect the supply to decrease in Northern California.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman."

Once again, our core FFO per share for the quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.08. Although $0.04 of the outperformance primarily related to property tax refunds and timing of expenses, the remaining $0.04 was driven by stronger-than-anticipated operations, capital and investment decisions, which benefited the bottom line.
In addition, our total FFO for the quarter was actually higher than core FFO per share by $0.07. This was primarily attributed to successful insurance recoveries for lost rents due to the MB360 fire, which occurred prior to the BRE merger. 
As for our balance sheet, during the quarter, we issued $450 million of 10-year unsecured bonds at a coupon of 3 3/8 and retired our Series H Preferred Stock. Our only remaining debt maturity this year is a $200 million term loan due in November, which we plan to refinance with a new 5-year unsecured term loan. And we expect to retain a more attractive pricing than the current 2.4%.
 
So far, this year, we have funded our development equity needs with disposition proceeds and have not issued any common equity.
Currently, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is inside of our target range, and we are comfortable with this ratio resting in the high-5s, as this range has proven to have successfully weathered the Great Recession.
With our $1 billion revolver undrawn, a strong balance sheet and numerous sources of equity and debt capital, we continue to be well positioned to -- for future growth.
Turning to our revised guidance for the full year. As Mike commented, even though Northern California is facing headwinds this year, we still expect the region to perform well relative to the nation and produce over 7% same-property revenue growth. However, the lumpiness of supply deliveries in Northern California, coupled with lower job growth in the region, will impact our full year same-store rent growth. Therefore, we have tightened our range and lowered the midpoint.
Our expense growth assumptions remain unchanged at 3.8%. The resulting expected NOI growth is now 8.1% at the midpoint, which remains within the guidance range provided at the beginning of 2016.
From an FFO perspective, the projected reduction to same-property growth rate is approximately $0.05 per share to the full year core FFO. But due to favorable year-to-date results, which have exceeded our original forecast and accretive capital markets and investment transactions completed so far, we are able to raise our full year core FFO midpoint by $0.06 per share to $10.98.
For 2016, we are projecting core FFO growth of 12%, which represents our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions."

It's interesting, when we talk about how unusual this has played out this year, it almost means that we have to determine whether it's a onetime occurrence or it is a part of trends going either direction, both in Northern California and Seattle. And the answer to that is it's, I think, unknowable. And it becomes one of the things we're very focused on trying to figure out. But I think the expectation would be, well, let's go back to where we started the year. We started the year with the expectation that Seattle would have continued good job growth. And because of the supply, there would be pressure on rents. I think we started the year with a rent growth expectation of around 4.9%. So what happened is we got the supply, but we just dramatically exceeded the job growth, as noted in my comments. I suspect that some of those conditions will even out, that, again, I've been here for 30 years, just had my 30th anniversary and here at Essex, and I've never seen this divergence. And so I would say 2 things. One, we don't know. Two, we suspect that we will see a more normal balance, more consistent with 29 of the 30 years I've been here. And number three, we're going to be studying it to try and determine what we think the longer-term trends might be. Does that make sense? So the answer is [indiscernible]."

I think, on the one hand, you have lower growth rates, although, to put that in perspective, the growth rates that we saw over the last 4, 5 years are extraordinary in Northern California.

So I think the growth that we got is -- for over the last several years was an anomaly, not a normal thing. And I don't think, again, that most buyers have that expectation. Having said that, as it relates to the longer-term picture, the private markets tend to be long-term oriented in terms of making these investments. And I think they still see Northern California as one of the strongest long-term CAGRs of rent growth generators that there is in the United States.

A lot of investors out there are 60% or 70% levered. And obviously, that makes a huge difference. So I don't see anything in the near term where you can buy a property that yields somewhere around 4.5%, finance it with a lot of positive leverage with some growth over time. I think, in this environment, that looks like a winner more broadly. And so I wouldn't expect cap rates or evaluations to change very significantly at all."

Again, it's limited because we're not going to deviate outside of our markets, and we're going to continue to look at properties that we could own if things don't end well."

Obviously, that helps us in the flip in San Francisco, for example, where you're going to start regulating them and they're going to put that the other way. It's going to hurt you. So we have not tried to do that, but again, I think there are other factors that are similar to that, to the extent people are doubling up, to the extent that employers are allowing people to work from home x days a week so that they can commute longer distances and/or connect by telecommunication devices, et cetera, and not coming to the office at all. So there's a whole cadre of things we try to capture in our relationship between job growth and demand or households. And so to the extent that Airbnb or any of these other factors might enter into the equation, we would alter our -- it's generally 2:1 relationship. So 2 jobs equal 1 household, and that 1 household covers both the for sale and the rental stocks. So we would start changing that ratio if we thought that any one of these factors became more significant."

They are -- they're increasing and have increased. This is Mike Schall, again. And again, going back to Northern California, last year, for example, where we had an incredible surge in rents, it pushed the affordability in San Francisco to about -- where we've been. It's well over the long-term high. So we have added almost 29%. And the long-term average is 26.5%, and the high is 33.1%. So we're starting to push beyond that range that people can afford. And our view is that affordability, basically, is a constraint. It doesn't mean that if it's super cheap, then that's good. It's just having a very low ratio can mean -- just have too much housing in the marketplace. That's obviously not a good thing either. But there are couple of markets in San Francisco and the Bay Area that are pushing that ratio to a level that we haven't seen in several -- in a couple of decades. So that is an area of concern. Having said that, with rents moderating this year and personal incomes increasing, it helps take pressure off of that ratio. So again, my view is that last year, we got, let's say, 2 years of rent growth in Northern California. And there's a little bit of a breather, part of that is caused by affordability, and part of that is pushing renters into the other markets, the East Bay, for example, where -- which is where we're getting the best rent growth this year. So it's part of the equation that we consider, again, when we start pushing up into the mid-20s. When people are paying 25%, let's say, or higher of the median income in rent or in their rent, then it starts becoming an issue."

In general, so going back to the beginning of the year, we had Seattle as our weakest market. And it wasn't because we thought that there was some implosion intact or even a problem intact. It was just simply -- if you just look at the ratio of supply and demand, it looked like it was more exposed than either Northern California or Southern California. So that's what caused that. Again, we do this based on experience, history and judgment, and sometimes, we're wrong. And so certainly, that's the case in Seattle at this point in time. As to going forward, are we going to continue at 3.5% job growth in Seattle, which will take care of whatever supply the market can produce? I would guess that it's going to continue to be better than we think, but I don't know we can sustain 3.5%. I would -- I still rank our markets as -- in terms of desirability as Northern, Southern California, obviously, those big geography, but Northern and Southern California as being more desirable than Seattle because we've seen supply really get out of whack in Seattle in prior cycles, and so that's how we would judge it. California has all these various other elements where they're trying to convert from a suburban type housing profile to more of an urban high-rise residential around transit. That's going to be a long-term difficult thing to do, and I think it will have the overall impact of muting supply deliveries. So I guess, that's why we give California the urban core coastal California markets a little bit of a positive relative to Seattle. As it relates to the rent-to-median income, Seattle's current ratio is around 21%. The long-term average is around 18%. So this is a good example of the long-term average not being all that meaningful. You might say, ""Yes, there's plenty of room for rents to grow there because it's only 18%."" The problem is it's 18% because there's too much affordable housing in the marketplace. So the lower that ratio gets, the less pricing power you generally have in the marketplace. So that's why I say that rent-to-income acts mainly as a constraint not a sort of a driving force. So there's plenty of room for pricing, though Seattle has very high median household income levels in the $80,000 to $90,000 range, and the rents are pretty attractively priced. So I don't see that as a constraint."

So you need really high rents, and in order to pencil a development deal, and where do you find those really high rents? You find them in San Francisco proper and on the Peninsula and in San Jose, and to some extent, in various parts of L.A., which, again, it has more supply than it's had over the last several years. So that's what moderates construction outside of the core areas. The rents aren't quite as high, and construction costs are pretty darn similar. And I guess, the issue that this brings up is how deep is the, A, tranche of the rental market because now we've had several years of delivering the As into the -- that top tier, how deep is that? How long can you continue to get those, achieve those rents before you're really dipping down into the B part of the renter pool, and you're making some of that top-level of the Bs. You're pushing them into the A product, which is, I think, part of the problem here. So again, we're watching that. I think there's a certain level at which we -- what California needs is more affordable housing. And the current solutions to this situation are to produce more, very high-end luxury housing.

Or is it just there's a little bit of nuance here, and therefore, the markets are still linked over time to tech, but right now, there's just a little bit of decoupling?"

We haven't -- we've seen this one time in 30 years. So now we're going to pay attention to this one divergence and ignore the last 30 years? I mean, that's essentially the dilemma that we're talking about. I mean, tech is tech. It's -- businesses are going to make decisions. People are going to make decisions based on the opportunity before them. They're going to live where they can afford to live in a good place, high quality of life, et cetera, and where would that opportunity present itself, they will find that. People are smart. They're smart when it comes to making rental decisions. They're smart when it comes to making career decisions for the most part. And so I wouldn't see any divergence at all. I think it's -- the market is fluid and things change. I think that you could have some tech companies opening more office space based on where their people want to work. That's a possibility. Having said that, as John said, there's millions of square feet being -- of commercial space being delivered here. And you have these tech giants, which have enormous amounts of cash and enormous financial capabilities that are building -- that are investing in these office buildings. Every part of the Silicon Valley, I think, has been essentially remade in a number of different ways. Well, I'll give you another staff that hasn't come up on these calls before, but there are at least 50 non-tech companies that have innovation centers here. John -- actually, John may have mentioned this in his remarks, but non-tech companies with innovation centers here because technology is so integrated in everything we do. So Alex, our -- my belief is that this is an anomaly, not a trend. And as a result of that, things will go back to a more normal balance between the 2 markets."

Pretty much anything getting delivered these days is A-quality. So the competition is high if you're an A-quality building across the street from a lease-up.

So sellers remember the last 10 transactions, and buyers think the world has changed and so they demand something different. And so that can go on for some period of time, and you would see it in the transaction volumes when the deals are closed. Normally, the things that motivate transactions are financial distress and those types of things, which, in a world of positive leverage, we don't really see that happening, and really great economics as well. So I would say that you would have to see maybe, I'd say, a year before you really saw a real directional change in cap rates because, again, I think you're going to end up with a derth of transactions in the meantime. Maybe the derth of transactions will be the indicator that. Maybe something is changing, but you won't actually see a change for some period of time."

Again, these businesses, our business was not founded upon 6% annual rent growth for long, long periods of time because income levels have to -- have some relationship to rent levels in order for people to afford it. So there are constraints within this industry or within the housing markets that will constrain you ultimately. Again, it doesn't mean that we're going to go from being a great market to a lousy market. And I think that maybe investors are focused on the Great Recession, which I think was an extraordinary period of time or the Internet boom bust period, where that often neglect the fact that rents went up 40% in 2 years, and then went all the way back down in the ensuing 3 years. But nonetheless, those things, I think, are dominant in people's memories, and -- but I think that the normal cycles would not be nearly that extreme. So again, I think Northern California goes back to being a more normal market. What does that mean? It means, let's say, 3% to 4% revenue growth, let's say, we're going to add some value in renovation and maybe we can add some value in transactions, and the business runs well at that, with that."

And welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I'll cover the following topics on the call:",1410,"Thank you, operator, and thank you for joining us today. And welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. John Burkart and Angela Kleiman will follow me with comments, and John Eudy is here for Q&A. I'll cover the following topics on the call: first, our commentary on quarterly results and market conditions; second, an investment market update; and finally, the latest on rent control proposals in California.
So on to the first topic. The second quarter was challenging operationally, as job growth was weaker than expected in several key markets, often coinciding with peaking apartment supply deliveries. With that said, we're pleased that we exceeded our core FFO per share guidance for the quarter and are increasing our 2016 core FFO guidance by $0.06 at the midpoint. We are also tightening the revenue guidance range, leaving the midpoint of our revenue guidance slightly lower, largely attributable to reduced rent growth expectations in Northern California. Once again, I thank the Essex team for their focus and effort in driving bottom line growth in a demanding and changing environment.
Generally speaking, the West Coast economy continues to outpace the slow growth national economy, which we now estimate will produce 2016 job growth of 1.8%, down from our prior estimate of 2%. Throughout our California markets, we have pockets of strength and weakness coinciding with the quantity of new apartment deliveries and the level of concessions being offered by landlords. In response to these conditions, we have lowered our 2016 market rent forecast by 50 basis points to 5.5% on Page S-16 of our supplemental package. Generally, B-quality apartments and locations continue to perform better than As, as lower price points become more important to renters as affordability pressures increase.
In my 30 years at Essex, I have not seen the divergence in performance between Seattle and Northern California that we're currently experiencing, and our Seattle results have been a huge positive surprise. The economies of Seattle and Northern California have a large tech component and thus unusual -- and thus usually follow a similar path in terms of rent growth. Seattle generates more housing supply, measured as a percentage of stock, which has historically moderated as long-term rent growth, again, relative to Northern California. The cost of this divergence is largely on the demand side, driven by job growth. To demonstrate this, I'm going to refer to nonseasonally adjusted job growth from January to June, primarily because the year-over-year job numbers are significantly influenced by the strong second half of 2015.
Seattle had the strongest job growth for the first half of 2016 compared to each of the past 6 years, and the margin of outperformance is notable. In 2015, which you likely will recall was a very good year, Seattle increased total jobs for the first half of the year by 30,000. The comparable job growth for 2016 was 43,400 or 44% more jobs added relative to 2015. To contrast this with Northern California, in January through June 2016, we added 27,000 jobs, down from 44,100 in the comparable period of 2015. Based on this activity, we are changing our 2016 forecast on Page S-16 of the supplement as follows.
In Seattle, job growth increase is 15% to 55,800 jobs, and our 2016 market rent forecast increases to 8.5% from 6.1%. In Northern California, job growth is reduced from 93,100 to 74,200, and our 2016 market rent forecast goes from 6.5% to 3.8%. We still believe that our apartments located in the centers of technology and innovation will deliver above-average rent growth. This belief is supported by the integration of technology into virtually every part of our lives, resulting in high growth expectation, higher income levels and better wage growth.
Southern California remains on track to achieve our targets for 2016. There are, however, pockets of supply that impact price in certain submarkets. Overall, we had solid results through the Southland, especially in L.A. and San Diego. As a result, we're leaving our 2016 rent growth expectations unchanged. As noted on our last call, apartment supply deliveries are inherently lumpy, which affects market rents based on the concession level and other pricing considerations. Last quarter, we estimated that approximately 70% of the 2016 supply will occur in the second and third quarter of -- in San Francisco, San Jose and Los Angeles. In San Francisco and San Jose, we expect apartment supply to begin to moderate in the fourth quarter of 2016, and we expect new deliveries of apartments in 2017 will fall about 20% to 30% in San Francisco and 30% to 40% in San Jose.
Second topic, investment markets. Our 2016 guidance called for $400 million to $600 million in acquisitions and $200 million to $300 million in dispositions. Through the second quarter, we've acquired around $150 million and disposed of about $110 million, including our pro-rata share of co-investments. We've also added approximately $67 million to the outstanding balance of our preferred equity investments.
We are working on several acquisition deals that we expect to be largely funded through dispositions. With this activity, we should be in the range of our guidance assumptions for acquisitions and at the high end of the range for dispositions. We also have about $50 million in potential preferred equity transactions that are being underwritten.
During the quarter, the stock traded at or marginally below net asset value, making accretive acquisitions and dispositions challenging to execute. We continue to wait for market conditions that allow accretive transactions, strongly preferring that to acquisitions or dispositions that accomplish little with respect to growth in NAV and core FFO per share. We will also continue to selectively cull the portfolio, reinvest it in lower-risk or higher growth opportunities. 
Cap rates have been stable for the last quarter, with A-quality property and locations trading around a 4 to 4.25 cap rate using the Essex methodology. And from time to time, more aggressive buyers will pay sub-4 cap rates. B-quality property and locations typically have cap rates 25 to 50 basis points higher than A-quality property.
While rental growth rates are moderating, so is the cost of debt, such that the percentage of positive leverage on real estate deals is approaching record highs. We continue to see fewer redevelopment starts in Northern California, largely attributable to increased cost of construction and discipline shown by lenders. We expect a small increase in apartment supply in Seattle and Southern California in 2017. 
Market clearing cap rates for development deals typically generate a 4.5% to 4.75% untrended cap rate, which is below our yield threshold. We continue to look for development opportunities that meet our underwriting criteria, and we are not likely to lower targets in the near term.
And then finally, third topic, rent control. Generally, there appears to be less urgency related to rent control now that rents have moderated in Northern California. However, the process started by tenant rights groups in several Northern California cities has led to several ballot initiatives. So far, qualified initiatives exist for the ballot in Northern California cities of Mountain View, Richmond, San Mateo and Alameda. Burlingame remains in the qualification process. Generally, these proposals provide for a CPI-based rent increases on renewals only, subject to a cap. These are in addition to changes to the rent control ordinance in San Jose that I discussed on last quarter's call. 
It is important to note that all local rent control ordinances must comply with state law, which mandates, among other things, that vacant apartments are prohibited from rent control. We believe that these various ordinances will have limited impact on Essex, primarily because of the vast majority of our properties are newer than the rent control cutoff dates and the various stabilization ordinances or state law, whichever applies.
Finally, in our experience, rent control ordinances generally shift the pricing burden from the renewing renter to the new resident. In other words, while rent control reduces renewal rent increases, it also reduces turnover in all rent control property, which means that fewer apartments are available to rent for people looking for a new apartment, which likely pushes rents upward on the vacant and available apartment inventory. Thus, while renewals will often occur at below-market rates, this impact is partially mitigated by higher rents on new leases, reflecting the unintended secondary effect of rent control.
That concludes my comments. Thank you again for joining the call. I'll now turn the call over to John Burkart."

We had another good quarter, delivering total same-store revenue growth of 6.9% and NOI growth of 8.2% relative to the comparable quarter. As Northern California has slowed down due to the factors that Mike mentioned, Seattle has strengthened and Southern California continues to perform.
Now I will share some highlights for each region. The strong demand in Seattle, fueled by the surge in employment for the first half of this year, which is above our expectations, enabled the market to absorb the new supply and continue to grow revenues. Our Seattle portfolio grew revenues 7.5% in the second quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter.
The submarkets performed similar to last year, with the CBD growing revenue about 5.4% and the East side, North and South submarkets, where over 80% of our portfolio is located, growing revenues between 7.7% and 9% for the second quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter.
In the Bay Area, the market has strengthened from the first quarter. July rents are up about 5% from the beginning of the year. However, due to the tough comps from last year, net effective rents are up only about 1/2 percent from last year's rent at this time.
San Francisco and San Jose continue to absorb the supply at a rate of approximately 19 units per month for lease-up and 30 units per month for lease-up, respectively, for AXIO. Concessions have decreased from 6 to 8 weeks, down from 4 to 6 weeks. East Bay has been stronger, however, as the toughest comps for the peak leasing season.
Our 2 lease-ups in the East Bay, The Galloway and Agora, are leasing up as planned, with The Galloway absorbing about 30 units per month and the 49-unit Agora leasing about 15 units per month.
The Bay Area economy continues to be a vibrant economy, benefiting from the ongoing expansion of technology into traditional industries. Numerous corporations have created innovation outposts in the Bay Area such as General Electric, Walmart, BMW, Nissan and General Motors. According to a recent study, there are over 50 corporate innovation outposts located in the Bay Area. The next largest concentration is in London with only 10. 
Office absorption was positive in all 3 Bay Area MSAs, from 321,000 square feet in Oakland MSA to 790,000 square feet in the San Jose MSA. There were numerous leases signed in the Bay Area recently by companies such as Fitbit, Lyft, Stripes, LifeLock, Delta, Uber, and Twitch, a video gaming division of Amazon, all combined, leasing over 1 million square feet of space in the quarter.
Currently, there's approximately 10.8 million square feet of office space under construction in the Bay Area, of which 46% is preleased.
LeEco, the Chinese electronics maker, just purchased nearly 50 acres of land that belonged to Yahoo! near Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. The acquisition adds 3 million square feet of space for LeEco's operations, which spans smartphones, bicycles, virtual reality headsets and, eventually, electric cars and is enough for about 12,000 workers.
Finally, the city of Santa Clarita recently approved related $6.5 billion major project just north of Levi's Stadium, the largest private development in Silicon Valley history. The project includes 5.7 million square feet of office space, 1.1 million square feet of retail space, 1,360 apartment homes, 700 hotel rooms and 450,000 square feet of restaurant and entertainment space. Construction is expected to start in late 2017.
The Southern California region continues to be a solid performer overall. In the L.A. MSA, the CBD grew revenues 3.8% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year's quarter, as it continues to absorb new supply. The Woodland Hills and Tri-Cities submarkets were the strongest in the L.A. MSA, growing revenues over 7% for the second quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter.
Silicon Beach continues to see new investment from technology companies. Google is outgrowing its 100,000 square feet space in Venice and is expanding to the 319,000-square-foot hangar where Howard Hughes assembled a giant wooden seaplane called the Spruce Goose. Google purchased the adjacent 12 acres of empty land, next to the hangar, a couple of years ago.
In the Orange County, in North Orange submarkets -- in Orange County, the North Orange submarket outperformed South Orange submarket in the second quarter of 2016, with revenues growing 5.9% and 3.1%, respectively, over the prior year's quarter. Revenue increased 7.4% in San Diego's MSA, with the Northern submarkets outperforming the CBD and Southern some markets relative to the comparable quarter. Recently, Google signed a 60,000-square-foot office lease in Northern San Diego's tech-heavy Sorrento Mesa area, expanding its Southern California footprint into San Diego for the first time.
Currently, our portfolio is at 96.2%, and our availability 30 days out is at 5.2%. Our renewals are being sent out in the 5% to 6% range in both Northern and Southern California and in the 6 to 8% range in the Pacific Northwest for the third quarter. We are positioned well for the second half of this year, and we look forward to 2017 when we expect the supply to decrease in Northern California.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Angela Kleiman."

Once again, our core FFO per share for the quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.08. Although $0.04 of the outperformance primarily related to property tax refunds and timing of expenses, the remaining $0.04 was driven by stronger-than-anticipated operations, capital and investment decisions, which benefited the bottom line.
In addition, our total FFO for the quarter was actually higher than core FFO per share by $0.07. This was primarily attributed to successful insurance recoveries for lost rents due to the MB360 fire, which occurred prior to the BRE merger. 
As for our balance sheet, during the quarter, we issued $450 million of 10-year unsecured bonds at a coupon of 3 3/8 and retired our Series H Preferred Stock. Our only remaining debt maturity this year is a $200 million term loan due in November, which we plan to refinance with a new 5-year unsecured term loan. And we expect to retain a more attractive pricing than the current 2.4%.
 
So far, this year, we have funded our development equity needs with disposition proceeds and have not issued any common equity.
Currently, our debt-to-EBITDA ratio is inside of our target range, and we are comfortable with this ratio resting in the high-5s, as this range has proven to have successfully weathered the Great Recession.
With our $1 billion revolver undrawn, a strong balance sheet and numerous sources of equity and debt capital, we continue to be well positioned to -- for future growth.
Turning to our revised guidance for the full year. As Mike commented, even though Northern California is facing headwinds this year, we still expect the region to perform well relative to the nation and produce over 7% same-property revenue growth. However, the lumpiness of supply deliveries in Northern California, coupled with lower job growth in the region, will impact our full year same-store rent growth. Therefore, we have tightened our range and lowered the midpoint.
Our expense growth assumptions remain unchanged at 3.8%. The resulting expected NOI growth is now 8.1% at the midpoint, which remains within the guidance range provided at the beginning of 2016.
From an FFO perspective, the projected reduction to same-property growth rate is approximately $0.05 per share to the full year core FFO. But due to favorable year-to-date results, which have exceeded our original forecast and accretive capital markets and investment transactions completed so far, we are able to raise our full year core FFO midpoint by $0.06 per share to $10.98.
For 2016, we are projecting core FFO growth of 12%, which represents our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth.
Thank you, and I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions."

It's interesting, when we talk about how unusual this has played out this year, it almost means that we have to determine whether it's a onetime occurrence or it is a part of trends going either direction, both in Northern California and Seattle. And the answer to that is it's, I think, unknowable. And it becomes one of the things we're very focused on trying to figure out. But I think the expectation would be, well, let's go back to where we started the year. We started the year with the expectation that Seattle would have continued good job growth. And because of the supply, there would be pressure on rents. I think we started the year with a rent growth expectation of around 4.9%. So what happened is we got the supply, but we just dramatically exceeded the job growth, as noted in my comments. I suspect that some of those conditions will even out, that, again, I've been here for 30 years, just had my 30th anniversary and here at Essex, and I've never seen this divergence. And so I would say 2 things. One, we don't know. Two, we suspect that we will see a more normal balance, more consistent with 29 of the 30 years I've been here. And number three, we're going to be studying it to try and determine what we think the longer-term trends might be. Does that make sense? So the answer is [indiscernible]."

We have not seen changes in cap rates, and I think you've got -- and as I tried to comment in my prepared remarks, you have 2 forces. I think, on the one hand, you have lower growth rates, although, to put that in perspective, the growth rates that we saw over the last 4, 5 years are extraordinary in Northern California. So I don't think that most of the private investors that were buying property in Northern California had the expectation of the rent growth that they got over the last several years. So I think the growth that we got is -- for over the last several years was an anomaly, not a normal thing. And I don't think, again, that most buyers have that expectation. Having said that, as it relates to the longer-term picture, the private markets tend to be long-term oriented in terms of making these investments. And I think they still see Northern California as one of the strongest long-term CAGRs of rent growth generators that there is in the United States. And so they know that, and they play a long-term game. And so I don't think that the attractiveness in the investment markets of property Northern California has changed very much. And then finally, the third factor is you have debt costs that are lower now. And so the amount of positive leverage you have on apartment properties is pretty extraordinary. And we're 26% levered. A lot of investors out there are 60% or 70% levered. And obviously, that makes a huge difference. So I don't see anything in the near term where you can buy a property that yields somewhere around 4.5%, finance it with a lot of positive leverage with some growth over time. I think, in this environment, that looks like a winner more broadly. And so I wouldn't expect cap rates or evaluations to change very significantly at all."

Obviously, that helps us in the flip in San Francisco, for example, where you're going to start regulating them and they're going to put that the other way. It's going to hurt you. So we have not tried to do that, but again, I think there are other factors that are similar to that, to the extent people are doubling up, to the extent that employers are allowing people to work from home x days a week so that they can commute longer distances and/or connect by telecommunication devices, et cetera, and not coming to the office at all. So there's a whole cadre of things we try to capture in our relationship between job growth and demand or households. And so to the extent that Airbnb or any of these other factors might enter into the equation, we would alter our -- it's generally 2:1 relationship. So 2 jobs equal 1 household, and that 1 household covers both the for sale and the rental stocks.

So there should not be an issue there. And having said that, that's a 2:1 ratio. So our tendency is actually starting to push the 2:1 up to a higher ratio and actually doing that in connection with affordability as well, because people make different decisions based on relative affordability of apartments within marketplace. So it's all part of a discussion, but it's a larger discussion than Airbnb is my point."

They are -- they're increasing and have increased. This is Mike Schall, again. And again, going back to Northern California, last year, for example, where we had an incredible surge in rents, it pushed the affordability in San Francisco to about -- where we've been. It's well over the long-term high. So we have added almost 29%. And the long-term average is 26.5%, and the high is 33.1%. So we're starting to push beyond that range that people can afford. And our view is that affordability, basically, is a constraint. It doesn't mean that if it's super cheap, then that's good. It's just having a very low ratio can mean -- just have too much housing in the marketplace. That's obviously not a good thing either. But there are couple of markets in San Francisco and the Bay Area that are pushing that ratio to a level that we haven't seen in several -- in a couple of decades. So that is an area of concern. Having said that, with rents moderating this year and personal incomes increasing, it helps take pressure off of that ratio. So again, my view is that last year, we got, let's say, 2 years of rent growth in Northern California. And there's a little bit of a breather, part of that is caused by affordability, and part of that is pushing renters into the other markets, the East Bay, for example, where -- which is where we're getting the best rent growth this year. So it's part of the equation that we consider, again, when we start pushing up into the mid-20s. When people are paying 25%, let's say, or higher of the median income in rent or in their rent, then it starts becoming an issue."

In general, so going back to the beginning of the year, we had Seattle as our weakest market. And it wasn't because we thought that there was some implosion intact or even a problem intact. It was just simply -- if you just look at the ratio of supply and demand, it looked like it was more exposed than either Northern California or Southern California. So that's what caused that. Again, we do this based on experience, history and judgment, and sometimes, we're wrong. And so certainly, that's the case in Seattle at this point in time. As to going forward, are we going to continue at 3.5% job growth in Seattle, which will take care of whatever supply the market can produce? I would guess that it's going to continue to be better than we think, but I don't know we can sustain 3.5%. I would -- I still rank our markets as -- in terms of desirability as Northern, Southern California, obviously, those big geography, but Northern and Southern California as being more desirable than Seattle because we've seen supply really get out of whack in Seattle in prior cycles, and so that's how we would judge it. California has all these various other elements where they're trying to convert from a suburban type housing profile to more of an urban high-rise residential around transit. That's going to be a long-term difficult thing to do, and I think it will have the overall impact of muting supply deliveries. So I guess, that's why we give California the urban core coastal California markets a little bit of a positive relative to Seattle. As it relates to the rent-to-median income, Seattle's current ratio is around 21%. The long-term average is around 18%. So this is a good example of the long-term average not being all that meaningful. You might say, ""Yes, there's plenty of room for rents to grow there because it's only 18%."" The problem is it's 18% because there's too much affordable housing in the marketplace. So the lower that ratio gets, the less pricing power you generally have in the marketplace. So that's why I say that rent-to-income acts mainly as a constraint not a sort of a driving force. So there's plenty of room for pricing, though Seattle has very high median household income levels in the $80,000 to $90,000 range, and the rents are pretty attractively priced. So I don't see that as a constraint."

And John Eudy, who heads development and is Chief Investment Officer, along with Craig Zimmerman, can maybe comment on this as well. I think it's just rents and cost to build. So you need really high rents, and in order to pencil a development deal, and where do you find those really high rents? You find them in San Francisco proper and on the Peninsula and in San Jose, and to some extent, in various parts of L.A., which, again, it has more supply than it's had over the last several years. So that's what moderates construction outside of the core areas. The rents aren't quite as high, and construction costs are pretty darn similar. And I guess, the issue that this brings up is how deep is the, A, tranche of the rental market because now we've had several years of delivering the As into the -- that top tier, how deep is that? How long can you continue to get those, achieve those rents before you're really dipping down into the B part of the renter pool, and you're making some of that top-level of the Bs. You're pushing them into the A product, which is, I think, part of the problem here. So again, we're watching that. I think there's a certain level at which we -- what California needs is more affordable housing. And the current solutions to this situation are to produce more, very high-end luxury housing. And so there's an obvious disconnect that needs to play out. Do you have any comments to that one, Mr. Eudy?"

Cap rates tend to be pretty sticky because the first thing that happens is buyers and sellers do not agree on what the price is. So sellers remember the last 10 transactions, and buyers think the world has changed and so they demand something different. And so that can go on for some period of time, and you would see it in the transaction volumes when the deals are closed. Normally, the things that motivate transactions are financial distress and those types of things, which, in a world of positive leverage, we don't really see that happening, and really great economics as well. So I would say that you would have to see maybe, I'd say, a year before you really saw a real directional change in cap rates because, again, I think you're going to end up with a derth of transactions in the meantime. Maybe the derth of transactions will be the indicator that. Maybe something is changing, but you won't actually see a change for some period of time."

I don't follow that logic. I don't think that that's right. I think that we can end up with a more normal growth rate in Northern California, and this business works just fine. So I'd be the first to tell you that getting 12% rent growth in a year, as we did in 2015, it's great while it's happening, but it has a secondary effect. And we're seeing part of that secondary effect this year because, again, it stretches affordabilities. It does -- it has implications beyond that 1 year. So I don't think that the fact that you're seeing a slowdown this year, again, relative to what happened last year, the extraordinary year we had last year, is being somehow indicative of what's going to happen next year.

Again, these businesses, our business was not founded upon 6% annual rent growth for long, long periods of time because income levels have to -- have some relationship to rent levels in order for people to afford it. So there are constraints within this industry or within the housing markets that will constrain you ultimately. Again, it doesn't mean that we're going to go from being a great market to a lousy market. And I think that maybe investors are focused on the Great Recession, which I think was an extraordinary period of time or the Internet boom bust period, where that often neglect the fact that rents went up 40% in 2 years, and then went all the way back down in the ensuing 3 years. But nonetheless, those things, I think, are dominant in people's memories, and -- but I think that the normal cycles would not be nearly that extreme. So again, I think Northern California goes back to being a more normal market. What does that mean? It means, let's say, 3% to 4% revenue growth, let's say, we're going to add some value in renovation and maybe we can add some value in transactions, and the business runs well at that, with that."

We know the buildings very well. We literally drive the buildings and have detailed spreadsheets outlining each building and what's going on.

John Burkart, Angela Kleiman and I will make brief comments, followed by Q&A.

John Burkart, Angela Kleiman and I will make brief comments, followed by Q&A. I will discuss the following 3 topics: the third quarter results and current conditions, our 2017 preliminary market forecast and an update on investment market.
First topic. We are pleased with the company's performance during the quarter in which we reacted opportunistically to rapidly changing conditions. As a result, we exceeded our core FFO per share guidance for the quarter by $0.05. I thank the E-team for their great effort and results. 
Similar to the second quarter, Q3 was challenging from an operations perspective against a very tough comp in 2015. Job growth remains strong relative to the U.S., especially in Seattle, where September month-over-month job growth increased from the prior year to 3.5% in 2016 versus 3.2% at September 2015.
Northern California continues to significantly outperform the U.S. in job growth, although it has decelerated. For example, in San Francisco, September 2016 job growth was reported at 2.6%, significantly below 5.1% reported for September 2015. Southern California job growth was significantly better than the nation in Orange County and San Diego and slightly behind in Los Angeles and Ventura. Overall, against the backdrop of decelerating U.S. job growth, the West Coast economies continue to outperform.
Rent growth continued to be muted in Northern California, which we attribute to the large concessions being offered by lease-up subcommunities. Job quality, ranked by annual salary levels for each industry, was another issue in Northern California, as there were more service jobs and fewer tech jobs being produced. In San Jose, for example, approximately 10% of the jobs created year-to-date were in the highest-paying information and manufacturing industries as compared to about 32% in 2015. Less significant deterioration in job quality occurred in San Francisco and Seattle. 
It's not surprising that more service jobs are being created, given the wealth effect to related to the financial success of so many tech companies and their highly compensated workforce. Our venture-capital contacts tell us that there is considerable movement of personnel within the technology industries as the next wave of new products, services and companies emerge.
Recent loss of pricing power in Northern California and a few other submarkets could indicate that we've achieved equilibrium between housing supply and demand. We don't believe that this is correct, and we use historical data from San Francisco and San Jose metros to demonstrate.
For the period 2011 to 2016, San Francisco and San Jose have produced about 440,000 jobs. Assuming 2 jobs equals 1 household, that would equate to demand for about 220,000 homes. The actual total housing units built over that period was about 65,500 or less than 1/3 of the expected demand that would ordinarily result from 440,000 jobs. 
We experienced exceptional pricing power in San Francisco and San Jose from 2011 to 2015, and the delivery of about 10,000 apartments in 2016, which are included in the 65,500 previously noted, has done little, we believe, to eliminate the pent-up demand from prior years, which leaves us with the question of why such large concessions are required if there is so much pent-up demand. We believe that the answer to that question relates to the concentrations of supply, the fundamentally different financial objectives of the apartment lease-up versus the stabilized community and affordability factors. 
Apartment developers, in an effort to minimize overall free rent over the lease-up period, typically set absorption targets of 25 to 30 leases per month. In some markets, as many as 5 lease-ups are directly competing for this leased volume. That means that over 100 leases per month are needed in that submarket to achieve leasing velocity targets. Recent job growth does not generate sufficient demand, and so large concessions drove renters out of stabilized communities. 
2 months free rent, again, equating to 16% of annual rent, drives that absorption and, at least temporarily, resolves the affordability problem at the same time. We see this as a short-term phenomena that will likely clear the market as supply deliveries decline in 2017.
Higher incomes are probably the most important solution to the affordability issue. Many renters are displaced by large rent increases and search for more affordable housing when rents grow faster than income levels. The opposite occurs when incomes begin to grow faster than rents, which is now happening. In Q3 '16 as compared to the comparable period of 2015, San Francisco and San Jose are estimated to have produced 6% growth in median household income, which is a huge growth rate that improves affordability relative to a year ago. As to supply, we expect about a 20% drop in apartment supply in San Francisco and nearly 30% in San Jose in 2017 and fewer deliveries in each quarter throughout 2017.
Therefore, we expect supply pressures to moderate in Northern California, especially in the second half of the year, assuming, of course, that job growth remains on track. Southern California apartment supply will be similar to 2016 and will decelerate throughout 2017 with the exception of Orange County, which is expected to have a 30% to 40% increase in supply. 
I wanted to provide a quick update on rent control. There are ballot proposals to enact rent control in 5 Northern California cities. While slower rent growth has removed some of the motivation for rent control, there are well-organized finance groups that are pushing ahead. At this point, we expect some, but not all, of the ballot proposals to pass. In any event, these measures are not expected to have a significant impact on the company for reasons provided in previous conference calls.
On to my second topic, market outlook for 2017. Page 16 of the supplement provides an overview of the key housing supply-demand and economic assumptions supporting our market rent growth expectation for 2017. As before, our macroeconomic scenario for the U.S. relies on leading third-party sources. The Essex economics will then estimate how the national economic picture will impact housing supply and demand for each submarket we have selected for potential investment. 
For 2017, the U.S. economy is expected to experience muted growth, with U.S. GDP and job growth of 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively. This year, we made 3 notable changes to our assumptions that are incorporated into F '16, including: first, we've modified our definition of multi-family supply to be similar to AXIOMetrics, which includes multi-family properties under development with at least 50 units and exclude senior, student and 100% affordable communities. We diligence this information by driving each property to understand delivery schedules, phasing and removed project duplication. Therefore, our supply estimate should differ from the data vendors. We have observed that the various research providers estimate supply in a variety of ways, often with materially conflicting conclusions. We hope others will follow our lead with respect to using a similar supply methodology. 
Second, as we approach the top of the cycle, development deliveries are often delayed due to shortages of trained construction personnel. This causes some development deals to be pushed into the following year. Thus, some of our 2016 scheduled deliveries have been moved into 2017, and the same thing may happen at the end of 2017. Therefore, our supply estimates may be too high. 
Third, as noted in my previous comments, the typical relationship between supply and demand disconnected in Northern California in 2016. There is no historical precedent for the adjustments we made to consider affordability that represent our best judgment. 
Notably, on Page S-16, each of our West Coast metros is expected to outperform the national average job growth. In each metro, again, assuming that 2 jobs equals 1 household, housing demand exceeds total expected housing supply that's both rental and for sale. The resulting 2017 market economic rent growth is slightly above the long-term CAGR of rent growth in Southern California and Seattle and slightly below in Northern California. 
In summary, 2017 seems likely to produce a soft landing. Thus, the extraordinary rent growth in last several years should transition to the long-term averages in the Essex portfolio. 
And now the third topic, investments. We experienced a relatively quiet quarter from an investment standpoint, as outlined in the press release. During the quarter, the stock traded mostly at or below net asset value, making accretive acquisitions challenging to execute on a match-funded basis. We expect to be more active in the fourth quarter, with all new deals being funded with disposition proceeds. 
Cap rates remained stable in the last quarter, with 8 quality property and locations trading around the 4% to 4.25% cap rate using the Essex methodology, and from time to time, more aggressive buyers will pay sub-4 cap rates. Generally, there are fewer motivated apartment investors in the market as compared to a year ago. We don't see cap rates changing materially, given the extraordinary amount of positive leverage that is generated when cap rates average around 4.5% and if 7-year fixed rate loan is approximately 3%.
In connection with our preferred equity program, we look at both existings and could-be developed apartment communities that are consistent with the Essex portfolio. Recently, we've noticed an increasing number of development transactions that don't meet our criteria, typically used -- due to increased costs of construction and conservative construction lending practices. This supports our belief that 2017 will represent the peak of supply in Coastal California. 
That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call today. I'll now turn the call over to John Burkart."

Our markets are reaching the point with the strong performance in Southern California will enable the region to outperform Northern California, although this quarter, they both were equal at 6.5% revenue growth. 
In Seattle, the strong demand in the market, fueled by above-expectation employment growth, enabled the market to absorb the new supply and continue to grow revenues. Our Seattle portfolio grew revenues 8.5% in the third quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter. The CBD submarket outperformed expectations, growing revenue approximately 7%. Eastside North and South submarkets, where over 80% of our portfolio is located, all grew revenues between 8.4% and 10.8% in the third quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter.
During the quarter, the market absorbed 950,000 square feet of office space or about 1% of total stock. Amazon continued to expand with over 10,000 posted job openings and signing another 360,000-square-foot office lease for a building under construction located in Bellevue where the company was founded. Currently, there is approximately 7.2 million square feet of office space under construction, with 41% of it preleased. 
In contrast to the strength of Seattle, the Bay Area rental market has been impacted by affordability and aggressive lease-ups. Currently, AXIO shows September rent in San Francisco and the San Jose markets relatively flat compared to the beginning of the year. Submarkets that are most impacted are those with higher levels of new supply and related lease-up concession. 
Concessions in the marketplace vary. They are driven by the concentrations of high-end lease-ups, which are largely podium and high-rise buildings where, in order to obtain this occupancy, the entire property needs to be largely completed, resulting in hundreds of rent-ready units in each property hitting the market simultaneously. Generally, the lease-up managers generously give away concession to achieve certain coupon rent and absorption goals. In certain markets with concentrations of supply such as San Francisco and South San Jose, we are seeing selected cases where managers are providing 2 months free rent or more.
During the quarter, we completed the lease-up of Agora, a 49-unit luxury property in Downtown Walnut Creek, and continued to successfully lease-up The Galloway at Pleasanton, BART station. Currently, Galloway is 63% leased, and in order to maintain leasing velocity, we've increased concessions to about 6 weeks per lease, which is up from 4 weeks offered during the peak demand season of the summer.
Office absorption continues to be positive in all 3 Bay Area markets, with over 800,000 square feet being absorbed in the quarter. Some of the quarter's leasing activity included General Electric expanding their footprint, adding additional 100,000 square feet in San Ramon; and Google signing a lease to occupy the entire Moffatt [ph] Gateway campus, which is approximately 612,000 square feet. Currently, 11.5 million square feet of office space is under construction in the Bay Area, of which 46% is preleased.
Moving down to Southern California. The region continues to be a solid performer overall. In the L.A. market, CBD grew revenues 4% in the third quarter compared to the prior year's quarter, as it continues to absorb the new supply. The Woodland Hills and Tri-Cities submarkets continue to be strongest in the L.A. market, growing revenues about 8%. 
In Orange County, the North Orange submarket continues to outperform the South Orange submarket in the third quarter, with revenues growing 6% and 4.4%, respectively. With 1.9 million square feet of office space under construction, this will support the addition of approximately 11,000 jobs in the Orange County market. 
Finally, revenues increased 8.4% in San Diego, with northern submarkets outperforming the CBD and southern submarkets relative to comparable quarter. 
Third quarter office absorption in these 3 Southern California markets was over 1.4 million square feet, with San Diego leading the way absorbing almost 1% of total stock. 
Currently, our portfolio occupancy is at 96.7%, and our availability 30 days out is 4.4%. Our renewals on average are being sent out at about 4.5% for Northern California, a little over 5% for Southern California and about 6.3% in the Pacific Northwest.

We are pleased to report that our core FFO per share exceeded the high end of our guidance. The outperformance this quarter was primarily attributed to favorable operation, accretive investments and lower G&A, some of which is timing-related. 
Turning to the full year outlook. We are reaffirming the mid-point of our same-property guidance of 6.8% revenue growth and 8.1% NOI growth. As for core FFO, we have increased the mid-point by $0.05 per share to $11.03. We are now projecting a 12.3% year-over-year core FFO growth, which represents our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. 
On to the balance sheet. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 5.7x this quarter from 5.9x last quarter, primarily due to continued growth in EBITDA. In addition, we received an upgrade on our senior unsecured debt rating for Moody's to Baa1 AND FROM S&P to BBB+, with stable outlook. The upgrades substantiated the strength of our balance sheet and our improved debt metric. The rating agencies also based their upgrade on the solid operating track records and long-term favorable economic fundamentals in our select West Coast markets. We believe this upgrade will enhance our cost of debt capital going forward. 
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions."

And again, I think that there's a lot of deals being discussed here on the West Coast. The issue is, because of construction cost increases, delays in the cities are very busy and the construction lending environment, which is becoming more and more conservative, that is starting to make deals push them off or and/or they're not achieving the level of return required to make the deals work. So we're seeing those deals being pushed off. And so that is -- that gives us confidence that the supply that's underway is -- will be delivered and will be delivered late, and hence, the movement from supply from 2016 into 2017.

Again, we think that tech is going through essentially a retrenchment or, really, defining what the next chapter is going to be in tech, which is a variety of things. For example, the Internet of Things, the use of Big Data, more mobile applications, sensors and security devices as it relates to many, many applications, including apartments, for example, sustainability and fiber.

So yes, if you look at September alone, you say, ""Okay, that -- let us extrapolate and figure out where things are going from there,"" I think you end up with a bad answer because I would say, what impact, as of September, that seasonality have on the overall result? We already know that we have affordability issue, we have too much supply in the form of these lease-ups to offering typically 16% off on your annual rents. And then now we have thus affordability factor layered on top of that. No one can disaggregate what each of those pieces mean. So by focusing exclusively on September, I think that you're making an implicit assumption that, hey, this is the way it's going, and it's going to continue that way. We don't believe that if you look at -- just look at the AXIO chart for San Francisco, San Jose, any of the Northern California markets, there was a point at which we were getting 2% to 3% -- 2% to 4% rent growth. And again, trying to stagger leases so we could take advantage of that, made good decisions with respect to building occupancy during the ride period of time allows you to have some ability to manage around that. And so I wouldn't focus too much on the one September number but look more broadly at where rents have gone this year. And I would assume that next year, again, will be a little bit challenging in Q1 and Q2 because we're going to be dealing with this issue of too much supply and big discount because lease-up operator is heavily incentivized, they've got a bunch of other units, to discount and absorb apartment. And he does so by stealing from the stabilized. I think that, that dynamic is not going to change, and that will have the effect of dampening our results. However, we start building demand in February, March and we would expect that to happen. And that will temper that. So again, we try to understand these relationships and how these -- how the rents vary throughout the year and try to make the decisions and execute well around what we expect to happen."

And I think that it's very difficult to look out too far out there because conditions change. And back to the point I was trying to make before there are no straight lines in this industry the react based on what we see happening on the market day in and day out. And again, what we see, and what we see a lot of this, with good visibility into what's going on in the development deals because of our preferred equity program where we are coming in at that 55% to 85% loan-to-cost ratio on development deals. And so we have seen a lot of deals, and we're originating these preferred equity loans on properties that we would -- that would be very consistent with the Essex portfolio. But I guess, the point is that a number of those are ready to go, development deals that don't hit yield thresholds that make them viable of the marketplace. And therefore, they are being pushed off, and they don't qualify for our program. And a lot of that is when you get into the discussion of reconciling costs, I think a lot of the land owners think that the costs are much lower than they really are when they sit down and actually price things out. And that process, I don't think it's going to change anytime soon. It's possible, for example, that the construction industry will have less -- fewer projects, and they will become more competitive from a cost standpoint, and some of these land deals will start working. But we're certainly not seeing that at this point in time. So what we have before us is a number of, let's say, half to deals that were scheduled or could come to market are actually getting done because of, again, these constraints, the cost rising issue, the city delays from being planning departments that are really busy and the impediments from conservative construction lenders. So as long as those circumstances remain in place, I think we're going to see the development pipeline moderate as we model for 2017, and you would not expect it to get any better in 2018. Hope that answered the question."

I think that, again, we've never seen it perform that didn't have the right numbers on it. And so we see lots of performers that have untrended cap rates for development deals in the 5 to 5.25. But again, when you actually sit down with someone to price that out, it is coming out to be somewhere in the 4.5 to 4.75 range. And that pressures the numbers in terms of how much equity you need and some of the other constraints. And so -- and again, very conservative lenders, lenders that unless you have a huge balance sheet that are somewhere in the 55% to 60% loan-to-cost ratio, et cetera. So I don't see that changing. I don't see construction cost moderation happening in the very short term. Again, if developers become -- or if developers become less busy -- I'm sorry, contractors become less busy and costs go down, then maybe some of these deals will make it through. But again, right now, I feel pretty confident in our forecast in terms of first half of '17 being a bit heavy and then abating each quarter throughout '17 and the second half of the year being much better. So I feel very confident in that. Although, again, like we've seen before, there could be some movement of projects from quarter-to-quarter as delays and other things happen."

And so, it is not like we have 30 deals and we're picking the best of them. It's more like we're looking at a lot of deals and somewhere around half of them may consent with the other half are, again, not producing the returns one would normally expect if you're going to take development risks. And I would that's against the context of working through an acquisition. An acquisition, you can lock in somewhere around a 4.5 cap rate with 7-year loan in around 3% range. You have a huge amount of positive leverage. So I guess, I would say, why want to take all the development risk when there's so much positive leverage on existing acquisition, all things being equal? I think that the alternatives with respect to where capital gets allocated are pretty interesting. And it means that development deals, it can't flow into the development deals at lower yields because there's another alternative out there that is better economic and certainly the risk reward."

I mean, the one thing I would add that is a continual conversation between [indiscernible] and me is that it isn't like we can sell our whole portfolio, primarily because of Prop. 13 tax planning, et cetera. We have somewhere around $1 billion we can sell relatively easily and either pay a special dividend and/or buy shares back. We don't really care about which of those we might want to do. But I guess, the point is there some assets, that are many assets that we've had huge gains on and there's a large Prop. 13 difference between what we pay as property taxes and what the buyer pays as property taxes. And then the buyer will cap out that difference and get a lower value. So there's something -- there is a headwind in California to large-scale dispositions and repurchase transactions. And so we have essentially gone through our portfolio and categorized them by type. And so we have a list of assets that we know we can sell. We have a [indiscernible] portfolio.

That has plus the market strength has led to loss-to-lease growth over time and over the last year. As we said earlier, about a year ago, we were about 7.2% loss-to-lease.

We think it feels kind of like it's starting to be late cycle. And so that is one element of caution. The recent GDP report looks great, but the jobs are decelerating. So we see a lot of inconsistencies out there in the marketplace, and that caused us a great deal of concern. We feel pretty good about the supply projections. We spend a lot of time on them. If we miss that, it's our bad. So the broader issue, I think, is what goes on in the economy. And we're always concerned about that, and especially the last several years where we've just -- every time it seems like we're getting a little bit of a momentum, something comes out of the woodwork to knock it down. And so I guess, cautious optimism is what I would get. As it relates back to supply, just look back, so you get, what's it been? 7% to 12% rent growth in Northern California for 4 years. Guess what's going to happen. Every piece of land that's available, you can put some apartments on it. It's going to be built. And that is predictable. And so the current pipeline deliveries is really a function of the extraordinary rent growth we had over the last several years. Normally, half of those sites or some portions of the site would not have been buildable. And so -- and then this is what always seems to happen is they get delivered in a different economic environment and soften conditions furthers. So this is what causes the greater volatility of Northern California and Seattle again with better, long-term growth rates over time. So I think it's just really a function of what happened, as a function of history, again, huge rent growth, making every deal work and then having all of that, hit the development pipeline at the same time and then delivered at the same time. As you -- again, as you're looking at a development deal today versus looking at it 2 or 3 years ago, it's a completely different world out there. You don't have the expectation of rent growth that you had a couple of years ago. You don't have the financing infrastructure from the banks, especially they're becoming much more conservative. And you've got backlog in the cities and a variety of other constraints. So we feel very comfortable that we're not materially off as it relates to the current conditional and what's going to be built that comes out of this for those reasons. So again, from our perspective, it's all about the economy."

Developers, there is a limit on which they can offer concessions. And that limit, in effect, what it does is it pressures the first renewal to a huge extent. And in essence, it becomes something that fills up their buildings quickly, sometimes with the wrong tenant. And so when their first lease renewal comes, you end up with either another concession or people that have to leave in internally large numbers. So I'm not sure exactly how that's going to play out. I think that, that has been a big problem, a lot of people that are moving into San Francisco, for example, or San Jose because they can now afford it. And even though they're relying on that 16% concession in order to make those numbers work, I think you're going to see a change because each of those newly developed apartment communities go from being a lease-up with their very unique financial equation to being a stabilized owner. And when they do, I think there's going to be a lot of people who are going to be shocked within their resident pool. In our experience, at 1 month, it's no problem. At 2 months, it begins to be a problem as it relates to your tenants base cannot generally pay market rent. And so you end up with this problem on the renewal. And when you start getting above 2 months, you end up with the real problem. And I think that we are starting to see that, as John noted in his comments, there are some 2-plus month concessions out there by the time you add free parking and a variety of other things. And I think that's going to make for a very ugly first renewal on those buildings."

I think it's all better because, net-net, the places that have the properties, the best locations and the best properties will go back to having the pricing power that they normally have, whereas the secondary or tertiary areas are going to have people move into them that they will probably -- they will underperform, and the better areas will recover the 16% rent that they lost or some portion of it.

John Burkart, Angela Kleiman, and I will make brief comments followed by Q&A. I will discuss the following 3 topics: the third quarter results and current conditions, our 2017 preliminary market forecast and an update on investment market.
First topic. We are pleased with the company's performance during the quarter, in which we reacted opportunistically to rapidly changing condition. As a result, we exceeded our core FFO per share guidance for the quarter by $0.05. I thank the E-team for their great effort and results. 
Similar to the second quarter, Q3 was challenging from an operations perspective against a very tough comp in 2015. Job growth remains strong relative to the U.S., especially in Seattle, where September month-over-month job growth increased from the prior year to 3.5% in 2016 versus 3.2% at September 2015.
Northern California continues to significantly outperform the U.S. in job growth, although it has decelerated. For example, in San Francisco, September 2016 job growth was reported at 2.6%, significantly below 5.1% reported for September 2015. Southern California job growth was significantly better than the nation in Orange County and San Diego and slightly behind in Los Angeles and Ventura. Overall, against the backdrop of decelerating U.S. job growth, the West Coast economies continue to outperform.
Rent growth continued to be muted in Northern California, which we attribute to the large concessions being offered by lease-up communities. Job quality, ranked by annual salary levels for each industry, was another issue in Northern California, as there were more service jobs and fewer tech jobs being produced. In San Jose, for example, approximately 10% of the jobs created year-to-date were in the highest-paying information and manufacturing industries as compared to about 32% in 2015. Less significant deterioration in job quality occurred in San Francisco and Seattle.
It's not surprising that more service jobs are being created, given the wealth effect related to the financial success of so many tech companies and their highly compensated workforce. Our venture-capital contacts tell us that there is considerable movement of personnel within the technology industries as the next wave of new products, services and companies emerge.
Recent loss of pricing power in Northern California and a few other submarkets could indicate that we've achieved equilibrium between housing supply and demand. We don't believe that this is correct, and we use historical data from San Francisco and San Jose metros to demonstrate. For the period 2011 to 2016, San Francisco and San Jose have produced about 440,000 jobs. Assuming 2 jobs equals 1 household, that would equate to demand for about 220,000 homes. The actual total housing units built over that period was about 65,500 or less than 1/3 of the expected demand that would ordinarily result from 440,000 jobs.
We experienced exceptional pricing power in San Francisco and San Jose from 2011 to 2015, and the delivery of about 10,000 apartments in 2016, which are included in the 65,500 previously noted that has done little, we believe, to eliminate the pent-up demand from prior years, which leaves us with the question of why such large concessions are required if there is so much pent-up demand. We believe that the answer to that question relates to the concentrations of supply, the fundamentally different financial objectives of an apartment lease-up versus the stabilized community and affordability factors. Apartment developers, in an effort to minimize overall free rent over the lease-up period, typically set absorption targets of 25 to 30 leases per month. In some markets, as many as 5 lease-ups are directly competing for this lease volume. That means that over 100 leases per month are needed in that submarket to achieve leasing velocity targets. Recent job growth does not generate sufficient demand, and so large concessions drove renters out of stabilized communities.
2 months free rent, again, equating to 16% of annual rent, drives that absorption and, at least temporarily, resolves the affordability problem at the same time. We see this as a short-term phenomena that will likely clear the market, as supply deliveries decline in 2017.
Higher incomes are probably the most important solution to the affordability issue. Many renters are displaced by large rent increases and search for more affordable housing, when rents grow faster than income levels. The opposite occurs when incomes begin to grow faster than rents, which is now happening. In Q3 '16 as compared to the comparable period of 2015, San Francisco and San Jose are estimated to have produced 6% growth in median household income, which is a huge growth rate that improves affordability relative to a year ago. As to supply, we expect about a 20% drop in apartment supply in San Francisco and nearly 30% in San Jose in 2017 and fewer deliveries in each quarter throughout 2017.
Therefore, we expect supply pressures to moderate in Northern California, especially in the second half of the year, assuming, of course, that job growth remains on track. Southern California apartment supply will be similar to 2016 and will decelerate throughout 2017 with the exception of Orange County, which is expected to have a 30% to 40% increase in supply.
I wanted to provide a quick update on rent control. There are ballot proposals to enact rent control in 5 Northern California cities. While slower rent growth has removed some of the motivation for rent control, there are well-organized and finance groups that are pushing ahead. At this point, we expect some, but not all, of the ballot proposals to pass. In any event, these measures are not expected to have a significant impact on the company for reasons provided in previous conference calls.
On to my second topic, market outlook for 2017. Page S-16 of the supplement provides an overview of the key housing supply-demand and economic assumptions supporting our market rent growth expectation for 2017. As before, our macroeconomic scenario for the U.S. relies on leading third-party sources. The Essex economics group then estimates how the national economic picture will impact housing supply and demand for each submarket we have selected for potential investment.
For 2017, the U.S. economy is expected to experience muted growth, with U.S. GDP and job growth of 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively. This year, we made 3 notable changes to our assumptions that are incorporated into S-16, including: first, we've modified our definition of multi-family supply to be similar to AXIOMetrics, which includes multi-family properties under development with at least 50 units and exclude senior, student and 100% affordable communities. We diligent this information by driving each property to understand delivery schedules, phasing and removed project duplication. Therefore, our supply estimate should differ from the data vendors. We have observed that the various research providers estimate supply in a variety of ways, often with materially conflicting conclusion. We hope others will follow our lead with respect to using a similar supply methodology.
Second, as we approach the top of the cycle, development deliveries are often delayed due to shortages of trained construction personnel. This causes some development deals to be pushed into the following year. Thus, some of our 2016 scheduled deliveries have been moved into 2017, and the same thing may happen at the end of 2017. Therefore, our supply estimates may be too high.
Third, as noted in my previous comments, the typical relationship between supply and demand disconnected in Northern California in 2016. There is no historical precedent for the adjustments we made to consider affordability that represent our best judgment.
Notably, on Page S-16, each of our West Coast metros is expected to outperform the national average job growth. In each metro, again, assuming that 2 jobs equals 1 household, housing demand exceeds total expected housing supply that's both rental and for sale. The resulting 2017 market economic rent growth is slightly above the long-term CAGR of rent growth in Southern California and Seattle and slightly below in Northern California. In summary, 2017 seems likely to produce a soft landing. Thus, the extraordinary rent growth from last several years should transition to the long-term averages in the Essex portfolio.
And now the third topic, investments. We experienced a relatively quiet quarter from an investment standpoint, as outlined in the press release. During the quarter, the stock traded mostly at or below net asset value, making accretive acquisitions challenging to execute on a match-funded basis. We expect to be more active in the fourth quarter, with all new deals being funded with disposition proceeds.
Cap rates remained stable in the last quarter, with A quality property and locations trading around the 4% to 4.25% cap rate using the Essex methodology, and from time-to-time, more aggressive buyers will pay sub-4 cap rates. Generally, there are fewer motivated apartment investors in the market as compared to a year ago. We don't see cap rates changing materially, given the extraordinary amount of positive leverage that is generated when cap rates average around 4.5% and if 7-year fixed rate loan is approximately 3%.
In connection with our preferred equity program, we look at both existing and to-be developed apartment communities that are consistent with the Essex portfolio. Recently, we've noticed an increasing number of development transactions that don't meet our criteria, typically used -- due to increased cost of construction and conservative construction lending practices. This supports our belief that 2017 will represent the peak of supply in Coastal California. 
That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call today. I'll now turn the call over to John Burkart."

The Essex team had another good quarter, delivering total same-store revenue growth of 6.9% and NOI growth of 8.3% relative to the comparable quarter. I want to thank our associates for their daily commitment in providing exceptional customer service and for their enthusiasm in achieving our company objectives and helping make this possible.
Our markets are reaching the point where the strong performance in Southern California will enable the region to outperform Northern California, although this quarter, they both were equal at 6.5% revenue growth.
In Seattle, the strong demand in the market, fueled by above-expectation employment growth, enabled the market to absorb the new supply and continue to grow revenues. Our Seattle portfolio grew revenues 8.5% in the third quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter. The CBD submarket outperformed expectations, growing revenue approximately 7%. Eastside North and South submarkets, where over 80% of our portfolio is located, all grew revenues between 8.4% and 10.8% in the third quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter.
During the quarter, the market absorbed 950,000 square feet of office space or about 1% of total stock. Amazon continued to expand with over 10,000 posted job openings and signing another 360,000-square-foot office lease for a building under construction located in Bellevue where the company was founded. Currently, there is approximately 7.2 million square feet of office space under construction, with 41% of it preleased.
In contrast to the strength of Seattle, the Bay Area rental market has been impacted by affordability and aggressive lease-ups. Currently, AXIO shows September rents in San Francisco and the San Jose markets relatively flat compared to the beginning of the year. Submarkets that are most impacted are those with higher levels of new supply and related lease-up concession.
Concessions in the marketplace vary. They are driven by the concentrations of high-end lease-ups, which are largely podium and high-rise buildings where, in order to obtain this occupancy, the entire property needs to be largely completed, resulting in hundreds of rent-ready units with each property hitting the market simultaneously. Generally, the lease-up managers generously give away concession to achieve certain coupon rents and absorption goals. In certain markets with concentrations of supply, such as San Francisco and South San Jose, we are seeing selected cases where managers are providing 2 months free rent or more.
During the quarter, we completed the lease-up of Agora, a 49-unit luxury property in Downtown Walnut Creek, and continued to successfully lease-up The Galloway at Pleasanton, BART station. Currently, Galloway is 63% leased, and in order to maintain leasing velocity, we've increased concessions to about 6 weeks per lease, which is up from 4 weeks offered during the peak demand season of the summer.
Office absorption continues to be positive in all 3 Bay Area markets, with over 800,000 square feet being absorbed in the quarter. Some of the quarter's leasing activity included General Electric expanding their footprint, adding an additional 100,000 square feet in San Ramon; and Google signing a lease to occupy the entire Moffett Gateway campus, which is approximately 612,000 square feet. Currently, 11.5 million square feet of office space is under construction in the Bay Area, of which 46% is preleased.
Moving down to Southern California. The region continues to be a solid performer overall. In the L.A. market, CBD grew revenues 4% in the third quarter compared to the prior year's quarter, as it continues to absorb the new supply. The Woodland Hills and Tri-Cities submarkets continue to be strongest in the L.A. market, growing revenues about 8%.
In Orange County, the North Orange submarket continues to outperform the South Orange submarket in the third quarter, with revenues growing 6% and 4.4%, respectively. With 1.9 million square feet of office space under construction, this will support the addition of approximately 11,000 jobs in the Orange County market.
Finally, revenues increased 8.4% in San Diego, with northern submarkets outperforming the CBD and southern submarkets relative to comparable quarter. 
Third quarter office absorption in these 3 Southern California markets was over 1.4 million square feet, with San Diego leading the way absorbing almost 1% of total stock.
Currently, our portfolio occupancy is at 96.7%, and our availability 30 days out is 4.4%. Our renewals on average are being sent out at about 4.5% for Northern California, a little over 5% for Southern California and about 6.3% in the Pacific Northwest. 
We are positioned well for the end of the year and 2017.
Thank you, and I will turn the call over to Angela Kleiman."

We are pleased to report that our core FFO per share exceeded the high end of our guidance. The outperformance this quarter was primarily attributed to favorable operations, accretive investments and lower G&A, some of which is timing-related.
Turning to the full year outlook. We are reaffirming the mid-point of our same-property guidance of 6.8% revenue growth and 8.1% NOI growth. As for core FFO, we have increased the mid-point by $0.05 per share to $11.03. We are now projecting a 12.3% year-over-year core FFO growth, which represents our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. 
On to the balance sheet. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 5.7x this quarter from 5.9x last quarter, primarily due to continued growth in EBITDA. In addition, we received an upgrade on our senior unsecured debt rating from Moody's to Baa1 and from S&P to BBB+, with stable outlook. The upgrades substantiated the strength of our balance sheet and our improved debt metric. The rating agencies also based their upgrade on the solid operating track record and long-term favorable economic fundamentals in our select West Coast markets. We believe this upgrade will enhance our cost of debt capital going forward.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions."

And again, I think that there's a lot of deals being discussed here on the West Coast. The issue is, because of construction cost increases, delays in the cities, because the cities are very busy, and the construction lending environment, which is becoming more and more conservative that is starting to make deals push them off or and/or they're not achieving the level of return required to make the deals work. So we're seeing those deals being pushed off. And so that is -- that gives us confidence that the supply that's underway is -- will be delivered and it will be delivered late, and hence, the movement from supply from 2016 into 2017.

We think that there will continue to be more service jobs created and more services consumed for the reasons noted, mainly that we have a very high-income workforce and they're going to consume more services. So we feel pretty confident with that. We do think that there'll be more tech jobs. Again, we think that tech is going through essentially a retrenchment or, really, defining what the next chapter is going to be in tech, which is a variety of things. For example, the Internet of Things, the use of Big Data, more mobile applications, sensors and security devices as it relates to, many, many applications, including apartments, for example, sustainability and fiber. So there's a whole bunch of things that are happening in the tech world that are being pursued, but we're not really seeing it in the job numbers yet.

So I think that's always the case. I don't think there's anything unique about right now. Southern California is closer to the U.S. economy. Northern California has the ability to move aggressively, a little bit aggressively in both directions. And you're seeing part of that. I mean, affordability is the concern about Northern California because demand grew so quickly, and we have such great pricing power that rents were growing much faster than incomes.

So yes, if you look at September alone, you say, ""Okay, that -- let's just extrapolate and figure out where things are going from there,"" I think you'll end up with a bad answer, because I would say, what impact, as of September, the seasonality has on the overall results? We already know that we have affordability issues, we have too much supply in the form of these lease-ups to offering, typically 16% off on your annual rents. And then now we have this affordability factor layered on top of that. No one can disaggregate what each of those pieces mean. So by focusing exclusively on September, I think that you're making an implicit assumption that, hey, this is the way it's going, and it's going to continue that way. We don't believe that if you look at -- just look at the AXIO chart for San Francisco, San Jose, any of the Northern California markets, there was a point at which we were getting 2% to 3% -- 2% to 4% rent growth. And again, trying to stagger leases so we could take advantage of that, and make good decisions with respect to building occupancy during the right period of time allows you to have some ability to manage around that. And so I wouldn't focus too much on the one September number, but look more broadly at where rents have gone this year. And I would assume that next year, again, will be a little bit challenging in Q1 and Q2 because we're going to be dealing with this issue of too much supply and big discount, because lease-up operator is heavily incentivized, it's got a bunch of vacant units, to discount and absorb apartment. And he does so by stealing from the stabilized. I think that, that dynamic is not going to change, and that will have the effect of dampening our results. However, we start building demand in February, March, and we would expect that to happen and that will temper that. So again, we try to understand these relationships and how these -- how the rents vary throughout the year and try to make good decisions and execute well around what we expect to happen."

And I think that -- it's very difficult to look out too far out there because conditions change. And back to the point I was trying to make before, there are no straight lines in this industry. We react based on what we see happening on the market day in and day out. And again, what we see, and we see a lot of this, with good visibility into what's going on in the development deals because of our preferred equity program where we are coming in at that 55% to 85% loan-to-cost ratio on development deals. And so we have seen a lot of deals, and we're originating these preferred equity loans on properties that we would -- that would be very consistent with the Essex portfolio. But I guess, the point is that a number of those are ready-to-go development deals that don't hit yield thresholds that make them viable in the marketplace. And therefore, they are being pushed off, and they don't qualify for our program. And a lot of that is when you get into the discussion of reconciling costs. I think a lot of the land owners think that the costs are much lower than they really are when they sit down and actually price things out. And that process, I don't think is going to change anytime soon. It's possible, for example, that the construction industry will have less -- fewer projects, and they will become more competitive from a cost standpoint, and some of these land deals will start working. But we're certainly not seeing that at this point in time. So what we have before us is a number of, let's say, half the deals that were scheduled or could come to market are actually getting done because of, again, these constraints, the cost rising issue, the city delays from [indiscernible] planning departments that are really busy and the impediments from conservative construction lenders. So as long as those circumstances remain in place, I think we're going to see the development pipeline moderate as we model for 2017, and you would not expect it to get any better in 2018. Hope that answers the question."

I think that, again, we've never seen a pro forma that didn't have the right numbers on it. And so we see lots of pro formas that have untrended cap rates for development deals in the 5 to 5.25. But again, when you actually sit down with someone to price that out, it is coming out to be somewhere in the 4.5 to 4.75 range. And that pressures the numbers in terms of how much equity you need and some of the other constraints. And so -- and again, very conservative lenders, lenders that -- unless you have a huge balance sheet that are somewhere in the 55% to 60% loan-to-cost ratio, et cetera. So I don't see that changing. I don't see construction cost moderation happening in the very short term. Again, if developers become -- or if developers become less busy -- I'm sorry, contractors become less busy and costs go down, then maybe some of these deals will make it through. But again, right now, I feel pretty confident in our forecast in terms of first half of '17 being a bit heavy and then abating each quarter throughout '17 and the second half of the year being much better. So I feel very confident in that. Although, again, like we've seen before, there could be some movement of projects from quarter-to-quarter as delays and other things happen."

It's more like we're looking at a lot of deals and somewhere around half of them may consent from the other half are, again, not producing the returns one would normally expect if you're going to take development risk. And I would -- that's against the context of looking at an acquisition. On an acquisition, you can lock in somewhere around 4.5 cap rate with 7-year loan around 3% range. You have a huge amount of positive leverage. So I guess, I would say, why would you take all that development risk when there's so much positive leverage on existing acquisitions, all things being equal? So I think that the alternatives with respect to where capital gets allocated are pretty interesting. And it means that development deals [indiscernible] can't flow into development deals at lower yields because there's another alternative out there that is better economically and certainly risk reward."

We have somewhere around $1 billion that we can fill relatively easily and either pay a special dividend and/or buy shares back. We don't really care about which of those we might want to do. But I guess, the point is there some assets, that are many assets that we've had huge gains on, that there's a large Prop. 13 difference between what we pay as property taxes and what the buyer pays as property taxes. And then the buyer will cap out that difference and get a lower value. So there's something -- there is a headwind in California to large-scale dispositions and repurchase transactions. And so we have essentially gone through our portfolio and categorized them by type. And so we have a list of assets that we know we can sell. We have a calling portfolio. We have an opportunistic sale portfolio. And again, we're just trying to the get relationships right. But we're not going to do it if it has a very small impact.

I would say, it's -- we are cautiously optimistic. But I think we are cautiously optimistic. We think it feels kind of like it's starting to be late cycle. And so that is one element of caution. The recent GDP report looks great, but the jobs are decelerating. So we're -- we see a lot of inconsistencies out there in the marketplace, and that caused us a great deal of concern. We feel pretty good about the supply projections. We spend a lot of time on them. If we miss that, it's our bad. So the broader issue, I think, is what goes on in the economy. And we're always concerned about that, and especially the last several years, where we've just -- every time it seems like we're getting a little bit of a momentum, something comes out of the woodwork to knock it down. And so I guess, cautious optimism is what I would get. As it relates back to supply, just look back. So if you get, what's it been? 7% to 12% rent growth in Northern California for 4 years. Guess what's going to happen? Every piece of land that's available, you can put some apartments on it. It's going to be built. And that is predictable. And so the current pipeline deliveries is really a function of the extraordinary rent growth we had over the last several years. Normally, half of those sites or some portion of those sites would not have been buildable. And so -- and then this is what always seems to happen is they get delivered in a different economic environment and soften conditions furthers. So this is what causes the greater volatility of Northern California and Seattle, again, with better long-term growth rates over time. So I think it's just really a function of what happened as a function of history. Again, huge rent growth, making every deal work and then having all of that hit the development pipeline at the same time and then delivered at the same time. As you -- again, as you're looking at a development deal today versus looking at it 2 or 3 years ago, it's a completely different world out there. You don't have the expectation of rent growth that you had a couple of years ago. You don't have the financing infrastructure from the banks, especially they're becoming much more conservative. And you've got backlog in the cities and a variety of other constraints. So we feel very comfortable that we're not materially off as it relates to the current conditions and what's going to be built that comes out of this for those reasons. So again, from our perspective, it's all about the economy."

But I don't really -- and again, this is where our asset bubbles, something to keep you awake at night because we just didn't see that asset bubble develop, and we didn't see it blowing up as it did. When you go back into the Internet boom bust period, we were becoming a lot more conservative. We were moving our portfolio pretty dramatically from Northern California to Southern California, because we didn't believe in the rents, and we didn't believe in the sustainability. And so I actually think that we played that one pretty well. But again, did we see the magnitude of the economic sort of disaster that happened when the Internet companies imploded? No, I don't think we got that one right, either."

Developers, there is a limit on which they can offer concessions. And that limit, in effect, what it does is it pressures the first renewal to a huge extent. And in essence, it becomes something that fills up their buildings quickly sometimes with the wrong tenants. And so when their first lease renewal comes, you end up with either another concession or people that have to leave in fairly large numbers. So I'm not sure exactly how that's going to play out. I think that, that has been a big problem. A lot of people that are moving into San Francisco, for example, or San Jose, because they can now afford it. And even though they're relying on that 16% concession in order to make those numbers work, I think you're going to see a change because each of those newly developed apartment communities go from being a lease-up with their very unique financial equation to being a stabilized owner. And when they do, I think there's going to be a lot of people who are going to be shocked within their resident pool. In our experience, at 1 month, it's no problem. At 2 months, it begins to be a problem as it relates to your tenants base cannot generally pay market rent, and so you end up with this problem on the renewal. And when you start getting above 3 months, you end up with the real problem. And I think that we are starting to see that, as John noted in his comments. There are some 2-plus month concessions out there by the time you add free parking and a variety of other things. And I think that's going to make for a very ugly first renewal on those buildings."

You've got 2 different constituency with dramatically different financial objectives. So as soon as they become a stabilized owner, they're interested in generating the most rent they can. They are going to have a messy situation in dealing with the people that they let in, that can't afford to pay market rents. And you're just going to see another transition within the renter pool. I think it's all better because, net-net, the places that have the properties, the best locations and the best properties, will go back to having the pricing power that they normally have. Whereas the secondary or tertiary areas are going to have people move into them that they will probably -- they will underperform, and the better areas will recover the 16% rent that they lost or some portion of it.

John Burkart, Angela Kleiman, and I will make brief comments followed by Q&A. I will discuss the following 3 topics: the third quarter results and current conditions, our 2017 preliminary market forecast and an update on investment markets.
First topic. We are pleased with the company's performance during the quarter, in which we reacted opportunistically to rapidly changing condition. As a result, we exceeded our core FFO per share guidance for the quarter by $0.05. I thank the E-team for their great effort and results. 
Similar to the second quarter, Q3 was challenging from an operations perspective against a very tough comp in 2015. Job growth remains strong relative to the U.S., especially in Seattle, where September month-over-month job growth increased from the prior year to 3.5% in 2016 versus 3.2% at September 2015.
Northern California continues to significantly outperform the U.S. in job growth, although it has decelerated. For example, in San Francisco, September 2016 job growth was reported at 2.6%, significantly below 5.1% reported for September 2015. Southern California job growth was significantly better than the nation in Orange County and San Diego and slightly behind in Los Angeles and Ventura. Overall, against the backdrop of decelerating U.S. job growth, the West Coast economies continue to outperform.
Rent growth continued to be muted in Northern California, which we attribute to the large concessions being offered by lease-up communities. Job quality, ranked by annual salary levels for each industry, was another issue in Northern California, as there were more service jobs and fewer tech jobs being produced. In San Jose, for example, approximately 10% of the jobs created year-to-date were in the highest paying information and manufacturing industries as compared to about 32% in 2015. Less significant deterioration in job quality occurred in San Francisco and Seattle.
It's not surprising that more service jobs are being created, given the wealth effect related to the financial success of so many tech companies and their highly compensated workforce. Our venture capital contacts tell us that there is considerable movement of personnel within the technology industries as the next wave of new products, services and companies emerge.
Recent loss of pricing power in Northern California and a few other submarkets could indicate that we've achieved equilibrium between housing supply and demand. We don't believe that this is correct, and we use historical data from San Francisco and San Jose metros to demonstrate. For the period 2011 to 2016, San Francisco and San Jose have produced about 440,000 jobs. Assuming 2 jobs equals 1 household, that would equate to demand for about 220,000 homes. The actual total housing units built over that period was about 65,500 or less than 1/3 of the expected demand that would ordinarily result from 440,000 jobs.
We experienced exceptional pricing power in San Francisco and San Jose from 2011 to 2015, and the delivery of about 10,000 apartments in 2016, which are included in the 65,500 previously noted, has done little, we believe, to eliminate the pent-up demand from prior years. Which leaves us with the question of why such large concessions are required if there is so much pent-up demand. We believe that the answer to that question relates to the concentrations of supply, the fundamentally different financial objectives of an apartment lease-up versus the stabilized community and affordability factors. Apartment developers, in an effort to minimize overall free rent over the lease-up period, typically set absorption targets of 25 to 30 leases per month. In some markets, as many as 5 lease-ups are directly competing for this lease volume. That means that over 100 leases per month are needed in that submarket to achieve leasing velocity targets. Recent job growth does not generate sufficient demand, and so large concessions drove renters out of stabilized communities.
2 months free rent, again, equating to 16% of annual rent, drives that absorption and, at least temporarily, resolves the affordability problem at the same time. We see this as a short-term phenomena that will likely clear the market, as supply deliveries decline in 2017.
Higher incomes are probably the most important solution to the affordability issue. Many renters are displaced by large rent increases and search for more affordable housing, when rents grow faster than income levels. The opposite occurs when incomes begin to grow faster than rents, which is now happening. In Q3 '16 as compared to the comparable period of 2015, San Francisco and San Jose are estimated to have produced 6% growth in median household income, which is a huge growth rate that improves affordability relative to a year ago. As to supply, we expect about a 20% drop in apartment supply in San Francisco and nearly 30% in San Jose in 2017 and fewer deliveries in each quarter throughout 2017.
Therefore, we expect supply pressures to moderate in Northern California, especially in the second half of the year, assuming, of course, that job growth remains on track. Southern California apartment supply will be similar to 2016 and will decelerate throughout 2017 with the exception of Orange County, which is expected to have a 30% to 40% increase in supply.
I wanted to provide a quick update on rent control. There are ballot proposals to enact rent control in 5 Northern California cities. While slower rent growth has removed some of the motivation for rent control, there are well organized and finance groups that are pushing ahead. At this point, we expect some, but not all, of the ballot proposals to pass. In any event, these measures are not expected to have a significant impact on the company for reasons provided in previous conference calls.
On to my second topic, market outlook for 2017. Page S-16 of the supplement provides an overview of the key housing supply demand and economic assumptions supporting our market rent growth expectation for 2017. As before, our macroeconomic scenario for the U.S. relies on leading third-party sources. The Essex economics group that estimates how the national economic picture will impact housing supply and demand for each submarket we have selected for potential investment.
For 2017, the U.S. economy is expected to experience muted growth, with U.S. GDP and job growth of 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively. This year, we made 3 notable changes to our assumptions that are incorporated into S-16, including: first, we've modified our definition of multi-family supply to be similar to AXIOMetrics, which includes multi-family properties under development with at least 50 units and excludes senior, student and 100% affordable communities. We diligence this information by driving each property to understand delivery schedules, phasing and removed project duplication. Therefore, our supply estimate should differ from the data vendors. We have observed that the various research providers estimate supply in a variety of ways, often with materially conflicting conclusions. We hope others will follow our lead with respect to using a similar supply methodology.
Second, as we approach the top of the cycle, development deliveries are often delayed due to shortages of trained construction personnel. This causes some development deals to be pushed into the following year. Thus, some of our 2016 scheduled deliveries have been moved into 2017, and the same thing may happen at the end of 2017. Therefore, our supply estimates may be too high.
Third, as noted in my previous comments, the typical relationship between supply and demand disconnected in Northern California in 2016. There is no historical precedent for the adjustments we made to consider affordability that represent our best judgment.
Notably, on Page S-16, each of our West Coast metros is expected to outperform the national average job growth. In each metro, again, assuming that 2 jobs equals 1 household, housing demand exceeds total expected housing supply that's both rental and for sale. The resulting 2017 market economic rent growth is slightly above the long-term CAGR of rent growth in Southern California and Seattle and slightly below in Northern California. In summary, 2017 seems likely to produce a soft landing. Thus, the extraordinary rent growth from last several years should transition to the long-term averages in the Essex portfolio.
And now the third topic, investments. We experienced a relatively quiet quarter from an investment standpoint, as outlined in the press release. During the quarter, the stock traded mostly at or below net asset value, making accretive acquisitions challenging to execute on a match funded basis. We expect to be more active in the fourth quarter, with all new deals being funded with disposition proceeds.
Cap rates remained stable in the last quarter, with A quality property and locations trading around the 4% to 4.25% cap rate using the Essex methodology, and from time to time, more aggressive buyers will pay sub-4 cap rates. Generally, there are fewer motivated apartment investors in the market as compared to a year ago. We don't see cap rates changing materially, given the extraordinary amount of positive leverage that is generated when cap rates average around 4.5% and if 7-year fixed rate loan is approximately 3%.
In connection with our preferred equity program, we look at both existing and to be developed apartment communities that are consistent with the Essex portfolio. Recently, we've noticed an increasing number of development transactions that don't meet our criteria, typically used -- due to increased cost of construction and conservative construction lending practices. This supports our belief that 2017 will represent the peak of supply in Coastal California. 
That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call today. I'll now turn the call over to John Burkart."

The Essex team had another good quarter, delivering total same-store revenue growth of 6.9% and NOI growth of 8.3% relative to the comparable quarter. I want to thank our associates for their daily commitment in providing exceptional customer service and for their enthusiasm in achieving our company objectives and helping make this possible.
Our markets are reaching the point where the strong performance in Southern California will enable the region to outperform Northern California, although this quarter, they both were equal at 6.5% revenue growth.
In Seattle, the strong demand in the market, fueled by above expectation employment growth, enabled the market to absorb the new supply and continue to grow revenues. Our Seattle portfolio grew revenues 8.5% in the third quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter. The CBD submarket outperformed expectations, growing revenue approximately 7%. Eastside North and South submarkets, where over 80% of our portfolio is located, all grew revenues between 8.4% and 10.8% in the third quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter.
During the quarter, the market absorbed 950,000 square feet of office space or about 1% of total stock. Amazon continued to expand with over 10,000 posted job openings and signing another 360,000 square foot office lease for a building under construction located in Bellevue where the company was founded. Currently, there is approximately 7.2 million square feet of office space under construction, with 41% of it pre-leased.
In contrast to the strength of Seattle, the Bay Area rental market has been impacted by affordability and aggressive lease ups. Currently, AXIO shows September rents in San Francisco and the San Jose markets relatively flat compared to the beginning of the year. Submarkets that are most impacted are those with higher levels of new supply and related lease up concession.
Concessions in the marketplace vary. They are driven by the concentrations of high-end lease ups, which are largely podium and high-rise buildings where, in order to obtain this occupancy, the entire property needs to be largely completed, resulting in hundreds of rent ready units with each property hitting the market simultaneously. Generally, the lease up managers generously give away concession to achieve certain coupon rents and absorption goals. In certain markets with concentrations of supply, such as San Francisco and South San Jose, we are seeing selected cases where managers are providing 2 months free rent or more.
During the quarter, we completed the lease up of Agora, a 49-unit luxury property in Downtown Walnut Creek, and continued to successfully lease up The Galloway at Pleasanton, BART station. Currently, Galloway is 63% leased, and in order to maintain leasing velocity, we've increased concessions to about 6 weeks per lease, which is up from 4 weeks offered during the peak demand season of the summer.
Office absorption continues to be positive in all 3 Bay Area markets, with over 800,000 square feet being absorbed in the quarter. Some of the quarter's leasing activity included General Electric expanding their footprint, adding an additional 100,000 square feet in San Ramon; and Google signing a lease to occupy the entire Moffett Gateway campus, which is approximately 612,000 square feet. Currently, 11.5 million square feet of office space is under construction in the Bay Area, of which 46% is pre-leased.
Moving down to Southern California. The region continues to be a solid performer overall. In the L.A. market, CBD grew revenues 4% in the third quarter compared to the prior year's quarter, as it continues to absorb the new supply. The Woodland Hills and Tri-Cities submarkets continue to be strongest in the L.A. market, growing revenues about 8%.
In Orange County, the North Orange submarket continues to outperform the South Orange submarket in the third quarter, with revenues growing 6% and 4.4%, respectively. With 1.9 million square feet of office space under construction, this will support the addition of approximately 11,000 jobs in the Orange County market.
Finally, revenues increased 8.4% in San Diego, with northern submarkets outperforming the CBD and southern submarkets relative to comparable quarter. 
Third quarter office absorption in these 3 Southern California markets was over 1.4 million square feet, with San Diego leading the way absorbing almost 1% of total stock.
Currently, our portfolio occupancy is at 96.7%, and our availability 30 days out is 4.4%. Our renewals on average are being sent out at about 4.5% for Northern California, a little over 5% for Southern California and about 6.3% in the Pacific Northwest. 
We are positioned well for the end of the year and 2017.
Thank you, and I will turn the call over to Angela Kleiman."

We are pleased to report that our core FFO per share exceeded the high end of our guidance. The outperformance this quarter was primarily attributed to favorable operations, accretive investments and lower G&A, some of which is timing related.
Turning to the full year outlook. We are reaffirming the mid-point of our same property guidance of 6.8% revenue growth and 8.1% NOI growth. As for core FFO, we have increased the mid-point by $0.05 per share to $11.03. We are now projecting a 12.3% year-over-year core FFO growth, which represents our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. 
On to the balance sheet. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 5.7x this quarter from 5.9x last quarter, primarily due to continued growth in EBITDA. In addition, we received an upgrade on our senior unsecured debt rating from Moody's to Baa1 and from S&P to BBB+, with stable outlook. The upgrades substantiated the strength of our balance sheet and our improved debt metric. The rating agencies also based their upgrade on the solid operating track record and long-term favorable economic fundamentals in our select West Coast markets. We believe this upgrade will enhance our cost of debt capital going forward.
That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to the operator for questions."

And again, I think that there's a lot of deals being discussed here on the West Coast. The issue is, because of construction cost increases, delays in the cities, because the cities are very busy, and the construction lending environment, which is becoming more and more conservative that is starting to make deals push them off or and/or they're not achieving the level of return required to make the deals work. So we're seeing those deals being pushed off. And so that is -- that gives us confidence that the supply that's underway is -- will be delivered and it will be delivered late, and hence, the movement from supply from 2016 into 2017.

So we feel pretty confident with that. We do think that there'll be more tech jobs. Again, we think that tech is going through essentially a retrenchment or, really, defining what the next chapter is going to be in tech, which is a variety of things. For example, the Internet of Things, the use of big data, more mobile applications, sensors and security devices as it relates to, many, many applications, including apartments, for example, sustainability and fiber. So there's a whole bunch of things that are happening in the tech world that are being pursued, but we're not really seeing it in the job numbers yet.

And pretty much, the answer is none. They don't act in a straight line, they move. So yes, if you look at September alone, you say, ""Okay, that -- let's just extrapolate and figure out where things are going from there,"" I think you'll end up with a bad answer, because I would say, what impact, as of September, the seasonality has on the overall results? We already know that we have affordability issues, we have too much supply in the form of these lease ups to offering, typically 16% off on your annual rents. And then now we have this affordability factor layered on top of that. No one can disaggregate what each of those pieces mean. So by focusing exclusively on September, I think that you're making an implicit assumption that, hey, this is the way it's going, and it's going to continue that way. We don't believe that if you look at -- just look at the AXIO chart for San Francisco, San Jose, any of the Northern California markets, there was a point at which we were getting 2% to 3% -- 2% to 4% rent growth. And again, trying to stagger leases so we could take advantage of that, and make good decisions with respect to building occupancy during the right period of time allows you to have some ability to manage around that. And so I wouldn't focus too much on the one September number, but look more broadly at where rents have gone this year. And I would assume that next year, again, will be a little bit challenging in Q1 and Q2 because we're going to be dealing with this issue of too much supply and big discount, because lease up operator is heavily incentivized, it's got a bunch of vacant units, to discount and absorb apartment. And he does so by stealing from the stabilized. I think that, that dynamic is not going to change, and that will have the effect of dampening our results. However, we start building demand in February, March, and we would expect that to happen and that will temper that. So again, we try to understand these relationships and how these -- how the rents vary throughout the year and try to make good decisions and execute well around what we expect to happen."

And I think that -- it's very difficult to look out too far out there because conditions change. And back to the point I was trying to make before, there are no straight lines in this industry. We react based on what we see happening on the market day in and day out. And again, what we see, and we see a lot of this, with good visibility into what's going on in the development deals because of our preferred equity program where we are coming in at that 55% to 85% loan-to-cost ratio on development deals. And so we have seen a lot of deals, and we're originating these preferred equity loans on properties that we would -- that would be very consistent with the Essex portfolio. But I guess, the point is that a number of those are ready to go development deals that don't hit yield thresholds that make them viable in the marketplace. And therefore, they are being pushed off, and they don't qualify for our program. And a lot of that is when you get into the discussion of reconciling costs. I think a lot of the land owners think that the costs are much lower than they really are when they sit down and actually price things out. And that process, I don't think is going to change anytime soon. It's possible, for example, that the construction industry will have less -- fewer projects, and they will become more competitive from a cost standpoint, and some of these land deals will start working. But we're certainly not seeing that at this point in time. So what we have before us is a number of, let's say, half the deals that were scheduled or could come to market are actually getting done because of, again, these constraints, the cost rising issue, the city delays from [indiscernible] planning departments that are really busy and the impediments from conservative construction lenders. So as long as those circumstances remain in place, I think we're going to see the development pipeline moderate as we model for 2017, and you would not expect it to get any better in 2018. Hope that answers the question."

I think that, again, we've never seen a pro forma that didn't have the right numbers on it. And so we see lots of pro formas that have untrended cap rates for development deals in the 5 to 5.25. But again, when you actually sit down with someone to price that out, it is coming out to be somewhere in the 4.5 to 4.75 range. And that pressures the numbers in terms of how much equity you need and some of the other constraints. And so -- and again, very conservative lenders, lenders that -- unless you have a huge balance sheet that are somewhere in the 55% to 60% loan to cost ratio, et cetera. So I don't see that changing. I don't see construction cost moderation happening in the very short term. Again, if developers become -- or if developers become less busy -- I'm sorry, contractors become less busy and costs go down, then maybe some of these deals will make it through. But again, right now, I feel pretty confident in our forecast in terms of first half of '17 being a bit heavy and then abating each quarter throughout '17 and the second half of the year being much better. So I feel very confident in that. Although, again, like we've seen before, there could be some movement of projects from quarter to quarter as delays and other things happen."

And so it is not like we have 30 deals, and we're picking the best of them. It's more like we're looking at a lot of deals and somewhere around half of them are making sense and the other half are, again, not producing the returns one would normally expect if you're going to take development risk. And I would -- that's against the context of looking at an acquisition. On an acquisition, you can lock in somewhere around 4.5 cap rate with 7-year loan around 3% range. You have a huge amount of positive leverage. So I guess, I would say, why would you take all that development risk when there's so much positive leverage on existing acquisitions, all things being equal? So I think that the alternatives with respect to where capital gets allocated are pretty interesting. And it means that development deals, money can't flow into development deals at lower yields because there's another alternative out there that is better economically and certainly risk reward."

But I guess, the point is there some assets, that are many assets that we've had huge gains on, that there's a large Prop. 13 difference between what we pay as property taxes and what the buyer pays as property taxes. And then the buyer will cap out that difference and get a lower value. So there's something -- there is a headwind in California to large-scale dispositions and repurchase transactions. And so we have essentially gone through our portfolio and categorized them by type. And so we have a list of assets that we know we can sell. We have a calling portfolio. We have an opportunistic sale portfolio. And again, we're just trying to the get relationships right. But we're not going to do it if it has a very small impact.

The recent GDP report looks great, but the jobs are decelerating. So we're -- we see a lot of inconsistencies out there in the marketplace, and that caused us a great deal of concern. We feel pretty good about the supply projections. We spend a lot of time on them. If we miss that, it's our bad. So the broader issue, I think, is what goes on in the economy. And we're always concerned about that, and especially the last several years, where we've just -- every time it seems like we're getting a little bit of a momentum, something comes out of the woodwork to knock it down. And so I guess, cautious optimism is what I would get. As it relates back to supply, just look back. So if you get, what's it been? 7% to 12% rent growth in Northern California for 4 years. Guess what's going to happen? Every piece of land that's available, you can put some apartments on it. It's going to be built. And that is predictable. And so the current pipeline deliveries is really a function of the extraordinary rent growth we had over the last several years. Normally, half of those sites or some portion of those sites would not have been buildable. And so -- and then this is what always seems to happen is they get delivered in a different economic environment and soften conditions further. So this is what causes the greater volatility of Northern California and Seattle, again, with better long-term growth rates over time. So I think it's just really a function of what happened as a function of history. Again, huge rent growth, making every deal work and then having all of that hit the development pipeline at the same time and then delivered at the same time. As you -- again, as you're looking at a development deal today versus looking at it 2 or 3 years ago, it's a completely different world out there. You don't have the expectation of rent growth that you had a couple of years ago. You don't have the financing infrastructure from the banks, especially they're becoming much more conservative. And you've got backlog in the cities and a variety of other constraints. So we feel very comfortable that we're not materially off as it relates to the current conditions and what's going to be built that comes out of this for those reasons. So again, from our perspective, it's all about the economy."

But I don't really -- and again, this is where asset bubbles are something to keep you awake at night because we just didn't see that asset bubble develop, and we didn't see it blowing up as it did. When you go back into the Internet boom bust period, we were becoming a lot more conservative. We were moving our portfolio pretty dramatically from Northern California to Southern California, because we didn't believe in the rents, and we didn't believe in the sustainability. And so I actually think that we played that one pretty well. But again, did we see the magnitude of the economic sort of disaster that happened when the Internet companies imploded? No, I don't think we got that one right, either."

Developers, there is a limit on which they can offer concessions. And that limit, in effect, what it does is it pressures the first renewal to a huge extent. And in essence, it becomes something that fills up their buildings quickly sometimes with the wrong tenants. And so when their first lease renewal comes, you end up with either another concession or people that have to leave in fairly large numbers. So I'm not sure exactly how that's going to play out. I think that, that has been a big problem. A lot of people that are moving into San Francisco, for example, or San Jose, because they can now afford it. And even though they're relying on that 16% concession in order to make those numbers work, I think you're going to see a change because each of those newly developed apartment communities go from being a lease up with their very unique financial equation to being a stabilized owner. And when they do, I think there's going to be a lot of people who are going to be shocked within their resident pool. In our experience, at 1 month, it's no problem. At 2 months, it begins to be a problem as it relates to your tenants base cannot generally pay market rent, and so you end up with this problem on the renewal. And when you start getting above 2 months, you end up with the real problem. And I think that we are starting to see that, as John noted in his comments. There are some 2-plus month concessions out there by the time you add free parking and a variety of other things. And I think that's going to make for a very ugly first renewal on those buildings."

People that can't afford it have to move into more affordable housing, which means longer commutes for them and/or double ups. And so I think it's a good thing for us because, again, they become a stabilized owner. Right now, they're disconnected from the stabilized ownership. You've got 2 different constituency with dramatically different financial objectives. So as soon as they become a stabilized owner, they're interested in generating the most rent they can. They are going to have a messy situation in dealing with the people that they let in, that can't afford to pay market rents. And you're just going to see another transition within the renter pool. I think it's all better because, net-net, the places that have the properties, the best locations and the best properties, will go back to having the pricing power that they normally have. Whereas the secondary or tertiary areas are going to have people move into them that they will probably -- they will underperform, and the better areas will recover the 16% rent that they lost or some portion of it.

Effectively, it's going up at about 7.5% rate a year. It's not the same each year, but effectively, that's what's happening for several years.

The cities are trying to increase fees, increase affordability [ph] requirements, have greater say in the product that's being built.

John Burkart, Angela Kleiman, and I will make brief comments followed by Q&A. I will discuss the following 3 topics: the third quarter results and current conditions, our 2017 preliminary market forecast and an update on investment markets.
First topic. We are pleased with the company's performance during the quarter, in which we reacted opportunistically to rapidly changing condition. As a result, we exceeded our core FFO per share guidance for the quarter by $0.05. I thank the E-team for their great effort and results. 
Similar to the second quarter, Q3 was challenging from an operations perspective against a very tough comp in 2015. Job growth remains strong relative to the U.S., especially in Seattle, where September month-over-month job growth increased from the prior year to 3.5% in 2016 versus 3.2% at September 2015.
Northern California continues to significantly outperform the U.S. in job growth, although it has decelerated. For example, in San Francisco, September 2016 job growth was reported at 2.6%, significantly below 5.1% reported for September 2015. Southern California job growth was significantly better than the nation in Orange County and San Diego and slightly behind in Los Angeles and Ventura. Overall, against the backdrop of decelerating U.S. job growth, the West Coast economies continue to outperform.
Rent growth continued to be muted in Northern California, which we attribute to the large concessions being offered by lease-up communities. Job quality, ranked by annual salary levels for each industry, was another issue in Northern California, as there were more service jobs and fewer tech jobs being produced. In San Jose, for example, approximately 10% of the jobs created year-to-date were in the highest paying information and manufacturing industries as compared to about 32% in 2015. Less significant deterioration in job quality occurred in San Francisco and Seattle.
It's not surprising that more service jobs are being created, given the wealth effect related to the financial success of so many tech companies and their highly compensated workforce. Our venture capital contacts tell us that there is considerable movement of personnel within the technology industries as the next wave of new products, services and companies emerge.
Recent loss of pricing power in Northern California and a few other submarkets could indicate that we've achieved equilibrium between housing supply and demand. We don't believe that this is correct, and we use historical data from San Francisco and San Jose metros to demonstrate. For the period 2011 to 2016, San Francisco and San Jose have produced about 440,000 jobs. Assuming 2 jobs equals 1 household, that would equate to demand for about 220,000 homes. The actual total housing units built over that period was about 65,500 or less than 1/3 of the expected demand that would ordinarily result from 440,000 jobs.
We experienced exceptional pricing power in San Francisco and San Jose from 2011 to 2015, and the delivery of about 10,000 apartments in 2016, which are included in the 65,500 previously noted, has done little, we believe, to eliminate the pent-up demand from prior years. Which leaves us with the question of why such large concessions are required if there is so much pent-up demand. We believe that the answer to that question relates to the concentrations of supply, the fundamentally different financial objectives of an apartment lease-up versus the stabilized community and affordability factors. Apartment developers, in an effort to minimize overall free rent over the lease-up period, typically set absorption targets of 25 to 30 leases per month. In some markets, as many as 5 lease-ups are directly competing for this lease volume. That means that over 100 leases per month are needed in that submarket to achieve leasing velocity targets. Recent job growth does not generate sufficient demand, and so large concessions drove renters out of stabilized communities.
2 months free rent, again, equating to 16% of annual rent, drives that absorption and, at least temporarily, resolves the affordability problem at the same time. We see this as a short-term phenomena that will likely clear the market, as supply deliveries decline in 2017.
Higher incomes are probably the most important solution to the affordability issue. Many renters are displaced by large rent increases and search for more affordable housing, when rents grow faster than income levels. The opposite occurs when incomes begin to grow faster than rents, which is now happening. In Q3 '16 as compared to the comparable period of 2015, San Francisco and San Jose are estimated to have produced 6% growth in median household income, which is a huge growth rate that improves affordability relative to a year ago. As to supply, we expect about a 20% drop in apartment supply in San Francisco and nearly 30% in San Jose in 2017 and fewer deliveries in each quarter throughout 2017.
Therefore, we expect supply pressures to moderate in Northern California, especially in the second half of the year, assuming, of course, that job growth remains on track. Southern California apartment supply will be similar to 2016 and will decelerate throughout 2017 with the exception of Orange County, which is expected to have a 30% to 40% increase in supply.
I wanted to provide a quick update on rent control. There are ballot proposals to enact rent control in 5 Northern California cities. While slower rent growth has removed some of the motivation for rent control, there are well organized and finance groups that are pushing ahead. At this point, we expect some, but not all, of the ballot proposals to pass. In any event, these measures are not expected to have a significant impact on the company for reasons provided in previous conference calls.
On to my second topic, market outlook for 2017. Page S-16 of the supplement provides an overview of the key housing supply demand and economic assumptions supporting our market rent growth expectation for 2017. As before, our macroeconomic scenario for the U.S. relies on leading third-party sources. The Essex economics group that estimates how the national economic picture will impact housing supply and demand for each submarket we have selected for potential investment.
For 2017, the U.S. economy is expected to experience muted growth, with U.S. GDP and job growth of 2.2% and 1.6%, respectively. This year, we made 3 notable changes to our assumptions that are incorporated into S-16, including: first, we've modified our definition of multi-family supply to be similar to AXIOMetrics, which includes multi-family properties under development with at least 50 units and excludes senior, student and 100% affordable communities. We diligence this information by driving each property to understand delivery schedules, phasing and removed project duplication. Therefore, our supply estimate should differ from the data vendors. We have observed that the various research providers estimate supply in a variety of ways, often with materially conflicting conclusions. We hope others will follow our lead with respect to using a similar supply methodology.
Second, as we approach the top of the cycle, development deliveries are often delayed due to shortages of trained construction personnel. This causes some development deals to be pushed into the following year. Thus, some of our 2016 scheduled deliveries have been moved into 2017, and the same thing may happen at the end of 2017. Therefore, our supply estimates may be too high.
Third, as noted in my previous comments, the typical relationship between supply and demand disconnected in Northern California in 2016. There is no historical precedent for the adjustments we made to consider affordability that represent our best judgment.
Notably, on Page S-16, each of our West Coast metros is expected to outperform the national average job growth. In each metro, again, assuming that 2 jobs equals 1 household, housing demand exceeds total expected housing supply that's both rental and for sale. The resulting 2017 market economic rent growth is slightly above the long-term CAGR of rent growth in Southern California and Seattle and slightly below in Northern California. In summary, 2017 seems likely to produce a soft landing. Thus, the extraordinary rent growth from last several years should transition to the long-term averages in the Essex portfolio.
And now the third topic, investments. We experienced a relatively quiet quarter from an investment standpoint, as outlined in the press release. During the quarter, the stock traded mostly at or below net asset value, making accretive acquisitions challenging to execute on a match funded basis. We expect to be more active in the fourth quarter, with all new deals being funded with disposition proceeds.
Cap rates remained stable in the last quarter, with A quality property and locations trading around the 4% to 4.25% cap rate using the Essex methodology, and from time to time, more aggressive buyers will pay sub-4 cap rates. Generally, there are fewer motivated apartment investors in the market as compared to a year ago. We don't see cap rates changing materially, given the extraordinary amount of positive leverage that is generated when cap rates average around 4.5% and if 7-year fixed rate loan is approximately 3%.
In connection with our preferred equity program, we look at both existing and to be developed apartment communities that are consistent with the Essex portfolio. Recently, we've noticed an increasing number of development transactions that don't meet our criteria, typically used -- due to increased cost of construction and conservative construction lending practices. This supports our belief that 2017 will represent the peak of supply in Coastal California. 
That concludes my comments. Thank you for joining our call today. I'll now turn the call over to John Burkart."

I want to thank our associates for their daily commitment in providing exceptional customer service and for their enthusiasm in achieving our company objectives and helping make this possible.
Our markets are reaching the point where the strong performance in Southern California will enable the region to outperform Northern California, although this quarter, they both were equal at 6.5% revenue growth.
In Seattle, the strong demand in the market, fueled by above expectation employment growth, enabled the market to absorb the new supply and continue to grow revenues. Our Seattle portfolio grew revenues 8.5% in the third quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter. The CBD submarket outperformed expectations, growing revenue approximately 7%. Eastside North and South submarkets, where over 80% of our portfolio is located, all grew revenues between 8.4% and 10.8% in the third quarter of 2016 relative to the comparable quarter.
During the quarter, the market absorbed 950,000 square feet of office space or about 1% of total stock. Amazon continued to expand with over 10,000 posted job openings and signing another 360,000 square foot office lease for a building under construction located in Bellevue where the company was founded. Currently, there is approximately 7.2 million square feet of office space under construction, with 41% of it pre-leased.
In contrast to the strength of Seattle, the Bay Area rental market has been impacted by affordability and aggressive lease ups. Currently, AXIO shows September rents in San Francisco and the San Jose markets relatively flat compared to the beginning of the year. Submarkets that are most impacted are those with higher levels of new supply and related lease up concession.
Concessions in the marketplace vary. They are driven by the concentrations of high-end lease ups, which are largely podium and high-rise buildings where, in order to obtain this occupancy, the entire property needs to be largely completed, resulting in hundreds of rent ready units with each property hitting the market simultaneously. Generally, the lease up managers generously give away concession to achieve certain coupon rents and absorption goals. In certain markets with concentrations of supply, such as San Francisco and South San Jose, we are seeing selected cases where managers are providing 2 months free rent or more.
During the quarter, we completed the lease up of Agora, a 49-unit luxury property in Downtown Walnut Creek, and continued to successfully lease up The Galloway at Pleasanton, BART station. Currently, Galloway is 63% leased, and in order to maintain leasing velocity, we've increased concessions to about 6 weeks per lease, which is up from 4 weeks offered during the peak demand season of the summer.
Office absorption continues to be positive in all 3 Bay Area markets, with over 800,000 square feet being absorbed in the quarter. Some of the quarter's leasing activity included General Electric expanding their footprint, adding an additional 100,000 square feet in San Ramon; and Google signing a lease to occupy the entire Moffett Gateway campus, which is approximately 612,000 square feet. Currently, 11.5 million square feet of office space is under construction in the Bay Area, of which 46% is pre-leased.
Moving down to Southern California. The region continues to be a solid performer overall. In the L.A. market, CBD grew revenues 4% in the third quarter compared to the prior year's quarter, as it continues to absorb the new supply. The Woodland Hills and Tri-Cities submarkets continue to be strongest in the L.A. market, growing revenues about 8%.
In Orange County, the North Orange submarket continues to outperform the South Orange submarket in the third quarter, with revenues growing 6% and 4.4%, respectively. With 1.9 million square feet of office space under construction, this will support the addition of approximately 11,000 jobs in the Orange County market.
Finally, revenues increased 8.4% in San Diego, with northern submarkets outperforming the CBD and southern submarkets relative to comparable quarter. 
Third quarter office absorption in these 3 Southern California markets was over 1.4 million square feet, with San Diego leading the way absorbing almost 1% of total stock.
Currently, our portfolio occupancy is at 96.7%, and our availability 30 days out is 4.4%. Our renewals on average are being sent out at about 4.5% for Northern California, a little over 5% for Southern California and about 6.3% in the Pacific Northwest. 
We are positioned well for the end of the year and 2017.

We are pleased to report that our core FFO per share exceeded the high end of our guidance. The outperformance this quarter was primarily attributed to favorable operations, accretive investments and lower G&A, some of which is timing related.
Turning to the full year outlook. We are reaffirming the mid-point of our same property guidance of 6.8% revenue growth and 8.1% NOI growth. As for core FFO, we have increased the mid-point by $0.05 per share to $11.03. We are now projecting a 12.3% year-over-year core FFO growth, which represents our sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. 
On to the balance sheet. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 5.7x this quarter from 5.9x last quarter, primarily due to continued growth in EBITDA. In addition, we received an upgrade on our senior unsecured debt rating from Moody's to Baa1 and from S&P to BBB+, with stable outlook. The upgrades substantiated the strength of our balance sheet and our improved debt metric. The rating agencies also based their upgrade on the solid operating track record and long-term favorable economic fundamentals in our select West Coast markets. We believe this upgrade will enhance our cost of debt capital going forward.

And again, I think that there's a lot of deals being discussed here on the West Coast. The issue is, because of construction cost increases, delays in the cities, because the cities are very busy, and the construction lending environment, which is becoming more and more conservative that is starting to make deals push them off or and/or they're not achieving the level of return required to make the deals work. So we're seeing those deals being pushed off.

Again, we think that tech is going through essentially a retrenchment or, really, defining what the next chapter is going to be in tech, which is a variety of things.

And pretty much, the answer is none. They don't act in a straight line, they move. So yes, if you look at September alone, you say, ""Okay, that -- let's just extrapolate and figure out where things are going from there,"" I think you'll end up with a bad answer, because I would say, what impact, as of September, the seasonality has on the overall results? We already know that we have affordability issues, we have too much supply in the form of these lease ups to offering, typically 16% off on your annual rents. And then now we have this affordability factor layered on top of that. No one can disaggregate what each of those pieces mean. So by focusing exclusively on September, I think that you're making an implicit assumption that, hey, this is the way it's going, and it's going to continue that way. We don't believe that if you look at -- just look at the AXIO chart for San Francisco, San Jose, any of the Northern California markets, there was a point at which we were getting 2% to 3% -- 2% to 4% rent growth. And again, trying to stagger leases so we could take advantage of that, and make good decisions with respect to building occupancy during the right period of time allows you to have some ability to manage around that. And so I wouldn't focus too much on the one September number, but look more broadly at where rents have gone this year. And I would assume that next year, again, will be a little bit challenging in Q1 and Q2 because we're going to be dealing with this issue of too much supply and big discount, because lease up operator is heavily incentivized, it's got a bunch of vacant units, to discount and absorb apartment. And he does so by stealing from the stabilized. I think that, that dynamic is not going to change, and that will have the effect of dampening our results. However, we start building demand in February, March, and we would expect that to happen and that will temper that. So again, we try to understand these relationships and how these -- how the rents vary throughout the year and try to make good decisions and execute well around what we expect to happen."

And I think that -- it's very difficult to look out too far out there because conditions change. And back to the point I was trying to make before, there are no straight lines in this industry. We react based on what we see happening on the market day in and day out. And again, what we see, and we see a lot of this, with good visibility into what's going on in the development deals because of our preferred equity program where we are coming in at that 55% to 85% loan-to-cost ratio on development deals. And so we have seen a lot of deals, and we're originating these preferred equity loans on properties that we would -- that would be very consistent with the Essex portfolio. But I guess, the point is that a number of those are ready to go development deals that don't hit yield thresholds that make them viable in the marketplace. And therefore, they are being pushed off, and they don't qualify for our program. And a lot of that is when you get into the discussion of reconciling costs. I think a lot of the land owners think that the costs are much lower than they really are when they sit down and actually price things out. And that process, I don't think is going to change anytime soon. It's possible, for example, that the construction industry will have less -- fewer projects, and they will become more competitive from a cost standpoint, and some of these land deals will start working. But we're certainly not seeing that at this point in time. So what we have before us is a number of, let's say, half the deals that were scheduled or could come to market are actually getting done because of, again, these constraints, the cost rising issue, the city delays from [indiscernible] planning departments that are really busy and the impediments from conservative construction lenders. So as long as those circumstances remain in place, I think we're going to see the development pipeline moderate as we model for 2017, and you would not expect it to get any better in 2018. Hope that answers the question."

I think that, again, we've never seen a pro forma that didn't have the right numbers on it. And so we see lots of pro formas that have untrended cap rates for development deals in the 5 to 5.25. But again, when you actually sit down with someone to price that out, it is coming out to be somewhere in the 4.5 to 4.75 range. And that pressures the numbers in terms of how much equity you need and some of the other constraints. And so -- and again, very conservative lenders, lenders that -- unless you have a huge balance sheet that are somewhere in the 55% to 60% loan to cost ratio, et cetera. So I don't see that changing. I don't see construction cost moderation happening in the very short term. Again, if developers become -- or if developers become less busy -- I'm sorry, contractors become less busy and costs go down, then maybe some of these deals will make it through. But again, right now, I feel pretty confident in our forecast in terms of first half of '17 being a bit heavy and then abating each quarter throughout '17 and the second half of the year being much better. So I feel very confident in that. Although, again, like we've seen before, there could be some movement of projects from quarter to quarter as delays and other things happen."

And so it is not like we have 30 deals, and we're picking the best of them. It's more like we're looking at a lot of deals and somewhere around half of them are making sense and the other half are, again, not producing the returns one would normally expect if you're going to take development risk. And I would -- that's against the context of looking at an acquisition. On an acquisition, you can lock in somewhere around 4.5 cap rate with 7-year loan around 3% range. You have a huge amount of positive leverage. So I guess, I would say, why would you take all that development risk when there's so much positive leverage on existing acquisitions, all things being equal? So I think that the alternatives with respect to where capital gets allocated are pretty interesting. And it means that development deals, money can't flow into development deals at lower yields because there's another alternative out there that is better economically and certainly risk reward."

But I guess, the point is there some assets, that are many assets that we've had huge gains on, that there's a large Prop. 13 difference between what we pay as property taxes and what the buyer pays as property taxes. And then the buyer will cap out that difference and get a lower value. So there's something -- there is a headwind in California to large-scale dispositions and repurchase transactions. And so we have essentially gone through our portfolio and categorized them by type. And so we have a list of assets that we know we can sell. We have a calling portfolio. We have an opportunistic sale portfolio. And again, we're just trying to the get relationships right. But we're not going to do it if it has a very small impact.

But so often, our expectations of whatever happens in the future -- it's hard to identify until they actually happen. So the point is I know you mentioned behaviors of municipalities and behaviors of lenders to kind of cut off the supply chain to some degree. But is that all that's kind of hinging on what could either pivot from being a soft landing to something materially worse than that? Because if you were to kind of just plot how your view has changed over the past year, it would suggest that it's going to be something worse than a soft landing in 2017."

I would say, it's -- we are cautiously optimistic. But I think we are cautiously optimistic. We think it feels kind of like it's starting to be late cycle. And so that is one element of caution. The recent GDP report looks great, but the jobs are decelerating. So we're -- we see a lot of inconsistencies out there in the marketplace, and that caused us a great deal of concern. We feel pretty good about the supply projections. We spend a lot of time on them. If we miss that, it's our bad. So the broader issue, I think, is what goes on in the economy. And we're always concerned about that, and especially the last several years, where we've just -- every time it seems like we're getting a little bit of a momentum, something comes out of the woodwork to knock it down. And so I guess, cautious optimism is what I would get. As it relates back to supply, just look back. So if you get, what's it been? 7% to 12% rent growth in Northern California for 4 years. Guess what's going to happen? Every piece of land that's available, you can put some apartments on it. It's going to be built. And that is predictable. And so the current pipeline deliveries is really a function of the extraordinary rent growth we had over the last several years. Normally, half of those sites or some portion of those sites would not have been buildable. And so -- and then this is what always seems to happen is they get delivered in a different economic environment and soften conditions further. So this is what causes the greater volatility of Northern California and Seattle, again, with better long-term growth rates over time. So I think it's just really a function of what happened as a function of history. Again, huge rent growth, making every deal work and then having all of that hit the development pipeline at the same time and then delivered at the same time. As you -- again, as you're looking at a development deal today versus looking at it 2 or 3 years ago, it's a completely different world out there. You don't have the expectation of rent growth that you had a couple of years ago. You don't have the financing infrastructure from the banks, especially they're becoming much more conservative. And you've got backlog in the cities and a variety of other constraints. So we feel very comfortable that we're not materially off as it relates to the current conditions and what's going to be built that comes out of this for those reasons. So again, from our perspective, it's all about the economy."

But I don't really -- and again, this is where asset bubbles are something to keep you awake at night because we just didn't see that asset bubble develop, and we didn't see it blowing up as it did. When you go back into the Internet boom bust period, we were becoming a lot more conservative. We were moving our portfolio pretty dramatically from Northern California to Southern California, because we didn't believe in the rents, and we didn't believe in the sustainability. And so I actually think that we played that one pretty well. But again, did we see the magnitude of the economic sort of disaster that happened when the Internet companies imploded?

Developers, there is a limit on which they can offer concessions. And that limit, in effect, what it does is it pressures the first renewal to a huge extent. And in essence, it becomes something that fills up their buildings quickly sometimes with the wrong tenants. And so when their first lease renewal comes, you end up with either another concession or people that have to leave in fairly large numbers. So I'm not sure exactly how that's going to play out. I think that, that has been a big problem. A lot of people that are moving into San Francisco, for example, or San Jose, because they can now afford it. And even though they're relying on that 16% concession in order to make those numbers work, I think you're going to see a change because each of those newly developed apartment communities go from being a lease up with their very unique financial equation to being a stabilized owner. And when they do, I think there's going to be a lot of people who are going to be shocked within their resident pool. In our experience, at 1 month, it's no problem. At 2 months, it begins to be a problem as it relates to your tenants base cannot generally pay market rent, and so you end up with this problem on the renewal. And when you start getting above 2 months, you end up with the real problem. And I think that we are starting to see that, as John noted in his comments. There are some 2-plus month concessions out there by the time you add free parking and a variety of other things. And I think that's going to make for a very ugly first renewal on those buildings."

And so I think it's a good thing for us because, again, they become a stabilized owner. Right now, they're disconnected from the stabilized ownership. You've got 2 different constituency with dramatically different financial objectives. So as soon as they become a stabilized owner, they're interested in generating the most rent they can. They are going to have a messy situation in dealing with the people that they let in, that can't afford to pay market rents. And you're just going to see another transition within the renter pool. I think it's all better because, net-net, the places that have the properties, the best locations and the best properties, will go back to having the pricing power that they normally have. Whereas the secondary or tertiary areas are going to have people move into them that they will probably -- they will underperform, and the better areas will recover the 16% rent that they lost or some portion of it.

Effectively, it's going up at about 7.5% rate a year. It's not the same each year, but effectively, that's what's happening for several years.
