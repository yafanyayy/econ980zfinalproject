We're very pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. In short, the company is off to a good start to the year. We are executing on our key top line growth drivers and exceeding expectations on the bottom line based on the tremendous earnings power of the company, which has become even stronger over time than I initially thought possible. In the first quarter, total revenue grew 8.1% in constant-currency terms, driven by double-digit growth in the United States, our largest and most profitable market. Our U.S. businesses turned around more rapidly than anyone anticipated based on better commercial execution and the quality of our products. And over the last few quarters, our domestic sales and marketing teams have kicked it up a notch, generating robust growth from our key brands. This commercial improvement has led to significant benefits up and down our income statement. For example, in the first quarter, we posted non-GAAP gross and operating margins that were significantly higher than in the prior-year period. We are clearly demonstrating that despite our already sector-leading profitability, we can generate additional operating leverage by driving the growth of our most profitable products. 
Working down the income statement, earnings per share were $0.46 in the first quarter, beating our expectations again. In addition, we increased EPS at a pace that was nearly 3x the rate of revenue growth. With that introduction, let me discuss the details of our first quarter revenue performance, then Bob will take you through the rest of the income statement, the balance sheet and our updated guidance. Total revenues were $695.2 million in the first quarter, an increase of 6.5% on a reported basis and 8.1% in constant-currency terms. Geographically, our U.S. businesses performed exceptionally well in the quarter. We posted 12.8% revenue growth domestically, a slight acceleration over the fourth quarter despite a more difficult comp. This strong U.S. performance outweighed what was a mixed bag internationally in the first quarter. We showed good continued progress in cytology, molecular diagnostics and surgical outside the United States. In constant-currency terms, cytology grew high single digits. Molecular posted modest growth for the second consecutive quarter and surgical grew in the midteens, albeit from a small base. In contrast, we saw weakness in our international blood screening business, which was largely expected and which resulted mainly from fluctuations in ordering patterns by our commercial partner, Grifols. In addition, our international Breast Health results confirmed, as we have highlighted before, that we are a long way from optimizing our relationships with our dealers and distributors. Lower Breast Health and blood screening sales OUS contributed to total international sales declining 11.5% in the quarter or 5.4% in constant-currency terms. We are moving decisively to strengthen the International Breast business, drawing on the same toolkit that we employed to turn around our domestic franchises. We are unifying leadership of all global commercial activities under our COO Eric Compton so that we may share some of our U.S. best practices internationally. As part of this process, our head of international has left the company, along with our head of European Breast Health sales. In their place, Eric is diving deep to optimize our go-to-market strategy in key markets around the globe. We are highly focused on identifying the right commercial model for each country in which we operate. While there may be some short-term volatility, we remain bullish on our international opportunities in Breast Health, and we look forward to sharing more details about our plans as they come together. 
Now let's provide some more color on our divisional revenue performance in the first quarter. Our biggest division, Diagnostics, posted sales of $310.7 million in the quarter, a growth rate of 3.7% in constant-currency terms. But the 3 franchises within Diagnostics demonstrated very different results. In molecular diagnostics and cytology, where we control the commercial channel, our results were very good. The blood screening sales declined. Let's discuss each piece in turn. In molecular diagnostics, quarterly sales of $129.6 million increased 9.9% in constant-currency, our best growth rate since the GenProbe acquisition. Domestic revenues increased a stellar 11.5% and the formula was similar to recent quarters, strong placements of our fully automated Panther instrument, a healthy number of competitive wins and growing utilization of our women's health assays. We said at a recent healthcare conference that the average Panther system globally now generates more than $170,000 in annual assay revenue, despite being less than 30% utilized. This demonstrates both the current value of the system and its future potential for customers and Hologic, as we add new tests for viral load and other targets in the years ahead. Outside the United States, sales of our molecular diagnostics products grew nominally on a constant-currency basis for the second consecutive quarter as the business stabilizes after an extended period of decline. 
We're also pleased with the performance of ThinPrep, one of our largest and most profitable franchises. Global sales of cytology and perinatal products totaled $120.4 million in the first quarter. U.S. sales actually increased by a modest 0.5% as market share gains more than offset headwinds from longer screening intervals. And internationally, we are encouraged that revenue grew 8.7% in constant-currency. This drove global growth of 3.1%, our second consecutive quarter of decent constant-currency growth. Our commercial team deserves much credit for transforming a business that was declining at a high single-digit rate as recently as 2014 into a modest growth globally. 
In blood screening, worldwide sales were $60.7 million in the first quarter. This was roughly flat sequentially as sales have normalized without the benefit of growth from the Japanese Red Cross contract. Compared to the prior year however, blood screening sales declined 6.5% on a constant-currency basis. This reflects heavier ordering by our partner, Grifols, a year ago and general declines in blood usage that we are seeing in the United States and other markets. 
Now let's turn to Breast Health, where we continue to see strong adoption of our Genius 3D mammography exam in the United States. Domestic sales of breast imaging products, including our Genius systems, increased 18.7% compared to the 8.9% constant-currency decline we saw internationally. Global sales of interventional breast products increased slightly on a constant-currency basis and we are optimistic that new products will help stimulate growth in this category over the next couple of years. All this added up to total Breast Health sales of $262.2 million in the quarter, up 9.9% in constant-currency terms. We also remain enthusiastic about our future prospects in the mammography market. We continue to gain share in the United States based on a superior product profile and excellent customer service. Our prices are stable despite increasing competition, which indicates that our marketing programs are working and that our systems are providing value to customers, and Congressional action has prohibited any near term insurance changes arising from the controversial screening recommendations by the USPSTF. All in all, we have a lengthy runway ahead of us to continue upgrading older, less effective technologies to our Genius 3D exams. 
To round out the revenue discussion, we are thrilled with the progress being made by our surgical team. Although the December quarter is typically a seasonally strong one, we certainly did not predict sales of $98.8 million or a constant-currency growth rate of 18.8%. These are truly outstanding results, our best overall performance in the last several years, so congratulations to the commercial teams and new leaders who are making it happen. It's worth mentioning that surgical is Hologic's most profitable division on a gross and operating margin basis, so the magnitude of the top line growth we're now seeing is having a nice positive impact on the company's gross and operating margins, as well as earnings per share. Specifically, our MyoSure product for hysteroscopic tissue removal posted total revenue of $36.9 million in the first quarter, with accelerating growth of 46.1% in constant-currency terms. Equally impressive, global NovaSure sales of $61.7 million increased by 7.5% on a constant-currency basis. We do believe NovaSure sales benefited from the recall of the competitive product but estimate that this benefit was relatively small in the context of overall quarterly sales. 
Finally, worldwide Skeletal sales were $23.5 million in the quarter, an increase of 7.7% on a constant-currency basis, driven by continued growth of our new Horizon bone density scanner, a very solid performance. 
Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me conclude by saying that this quarter illustrates the value that our portfolio of products can provide to shareholders. Although Breast Health and blood screening declined outside the United States, we more than compensated by posting strong growth in mammography, molecular diagnostics and surgical. The net effect was top line performance slightly ahead of expectations, and a significant increase in profitability. All in all, we're off to good a good start in 2016 and remain excited about the future. 
Now I will hand the call over to Bob."

I'm going to walk through the rest of our first quarter income statement, the balance sheet and our updated financial guidance for 2016. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and",1550,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to walk through the rest of our first quarter income statement, the balance sheet and our updated financial guidance for 2016. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. As Steve mentioned, we delivered another solid quarter on the top line, with 12.8% sales growth in the U.S., more than offsetting the international choppiness we saw in Breast Health and blood screening. Strengthened domestic revenue, combined with the early returns of our productivity effort helped drive margin improvement at the gross and operating levels, contributing to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.46, a 17 9% increase over the prior-year period. Even with headwinds from share count and currency, EPS grew at a rate nearly 3x faster than sales. 
Moving down the income statement, our first quarter gross margin of 65.2% increased 190 basis points compared to the prior-year period. Gross margin benefited from mix, both geographic and product, and from our cost-reduction initiatives. Not only did revenue grow at a double-digit rate at the U.S., some of our highest margin products also performed well, including our ThinPrep, NovaSure and Aptima franchises; and I should point out that pricing remains stable across our product lines as our commercial teams focus on selling the clinical and economic value that our products provide. In addition, our operations and procurement teams are executing well, driving efficiencies and reducing the costs to make our products. Total operating expenses of $221 million increased by 11.3% in the first quarter. This increase was driven primarily by sales and marketing expense, which increased 15.6%. We continue to invest to extend our leadership in the mammography market and to explain like cotesting is the best route to protect women from cervical cancer. Despite these investments, better gross margins drove profitability improvement down to the operating line. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.4% in the quarter, an increase of 50 basis points from last year. Although our operating margin is already among the highest in our sector, the last several quarters have clearly demonstrated that they can expand further even as we fund key growth drivers. 
Moving further down the income statement, we are beginning to reap the benefits of our efforts to reduce and refinance debt. In the first quarter interest expense was $32.8 million, a reduction of 25% versus the prior-year period. In addition, we are pleased that a lot of hard work to reduce our tax rate has begun to pay off earlier than expected. We now estimate that our effective tax rate will be around 33% in fiscal 2016, lower than our initial guidance and this added about $0.01 to EPS in the first quarter. Although this is just the first step in our multiyear tax improvement strategy, we are encouraged by the progress we've made so far. 
Finally, diluted shares outstanding were 292 million in the first quarter. As you know, we are focused on minimizing share count dilution by eliminating convertible notes from our capital structure. In the fourth quarter, for example, we repurchased $300 million in principal of our most dilutive convertible notes, and this had a beneficial effect on share count in the first quarter. In addition, the recent decline in our share price had the rather perverse effect of further reducing dilution from the converts. The combined effect boosted EPS by almost $0.01 in the quarter. 
Now let's talk about cash flows in the balance sheet. Operating cash flow was strong again in the first quarter at $163.3 million [ph], an increase of 7% over the prior-year period. We spent $19.7 million on capital in the quarter, leading the free cash flow of $144.6 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the first fiscal quarter with $650 million in cash, a 19.5% improvement over the prior-year period. This strong cash position provides us with dry powder, of potential tuck-in acquisitions even as we continue to pay down debt. At the end of the first quarter, we had total debt outstanding of $3.6 billion, a decrease of $322 million compared to a year ago, and net debt of $2.98 billion. Our leverage ratio net debt over EBITDA now stands at 3.1x and we are on track to achieve our goal of lowering our leverage ratio to 2.5x by the end of fiscal 2017. 
To wrap up the historical discussion, adjusted EBITDA was $252 million in the first quarter, up 8.1% compared to the prior-year period and we're tracking to generate EBITDA of more than $1 billion for the full year. Our consistency in delivering strong profit growth and lowering debt has allowed us to steadily improve our return on invested capital. As of our first fiscal quarter, ROIC was 11.3% on a trailing 12-month basis, 160-basis point increase over the prior year. 
Now let's shift gears and turn to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and second quarter. We are updating our guidance based on our solid performance in the first quarter, a stronger U.S. dollar and greater than expected earnings dollar. As always, this guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates. As you know, the dollar has strengthened since we provided our initial 2016 guidance. Compared to last year, we now expect currency to represent a $25 million top line headwind in 2016. This equates to roughly $0.03 in earnings per share. And, importantly, compared to when we initially guided in November, the stronger dollar is subtracting an incremental $11 million from our top line. So for the 2016 fiscal year, we are maintaining our guidance for constant-currency growth of between 4.4% and 5.5%, but on a reported basis, we are updating our guidance to reflect the additional currency headwind. So based solely on the stronger dollar, we now expect reported revenues of $2.8 billion to $2.83 billion, representing reported growth of 3.5% to 4.6%. As Steve said earlier, we continue to forecast improvements on both the gross and operating margin lines based on favorable geographic and product mix, as well as early returns from our productivity efforts. 
In addition, as you probably read, the Omnibus Budget Bill that was passed by Congress in December included a 2-year moratorium on medical device excise tax among other key provisions. We're thrilled that Congress has recognized the negative effects of this tax on domestic innovation and job growth. In fiscal 2015, we paid $23.6 million under this tax, which was reported under general and administrative expenses. It's important to note 2 points, however. First, since the moratorium took effect on January 1, we only recognize 3/4 [ph] of this benefit in our 2016 fiscal year. In addition, we plan to reinvest most of the benefit in some of our more attractive R&D and commercial programs. Continuing with our full year guidance, we now expect our effective tax rate to improve to approximately 33% for the year and believe diluted shares outstanding will total between $296 million and $298 million for the full year. 
Given these updates and our strong first quarter results, we are increasing our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. For the full year, we now expect EPS of $1.86 to $1.90. This translates to growth of 13.1% to 15.5% in constant-currency terms with reported growth between 11.4% and 13.8%. So despite currency and share count headwinds, we anticipate growing EPS at more than double the rate of sales, demonstrating bottom line growth and operating leverage that seems unlikely at best just a few quarters ago. 
Turning to guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenues of $680 million to $690 million. Compared to the prior-year period, this range reflects revenue growth of 4.5% to 6% on a constant-currency basis and reported revenue growth of 3.7% to 5.3%. We expect a sequential decline in revenue for 2 main reasons. First, our surgical business is seasonally weakest in the March quarter, especially in comparison to the strength we saw in the December period. Second, we're allowing for some potential choppiness in our international business. In terms of the bottom line, we forecast diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.45 to $0.46 in the second quarter. This represents growth of 11.2% to 13.6% in constant-currency terms or 9.8% to 12.2% on a reported basis. It's worth mentioning that we anticipate a substantial R&D increase in spending in the second fiscal quarter based mainly on the timing of projects. 
Before opening the call for questions, I'd like to reiterate that Hologic is off to a good start in 2016. In the first quarter, our momentum continued with Genius 3D mammography and our surgical and molecular diagnostics business is provides us upside. As a whole, our domestic businesses performed great. These positives outweighed weaker than expected results in our international mammography business, which we're dealing with aggressively. In the middle of the income statement, we are demonstrating the tremendous earnings power of the company by improving gross and operating margins. And below the line, we are beginning to see the benefits from our efforts to reduce debt, as well as our effective tax rate. 
With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're ready for some of those questions."

And I think as we go back and look at it, clearly, our fourth fiscal quarter was really strong and followed by a weaker quarter. And that's not what we want to be delivering and don't have that sustained relationships. So we're making some changes internally, and we're not going to blame the dealers. We can always look at ourselves and I'll say that we need to be a little closer to it. But it's the only little piece of the puzzle I think right now for us to continue to work on.

The company was built historically on every 8 years will launch a mega product like 2D and then 3D tomo and a lot of what we are looking at is how do we cushion the blow in between and looking at some smaller things that we can be doing to bring in between those big cycles. And on the diagnostics business, it's about building out menu. In the Breast Health business, it's not just what's the replacement for 3D tomo, there's a lot of other stuff we can bring in, IDS and other stuff along the way. So I think what you'll start to see, and as you know, with me, stylistically, I'd like to get a few points on the board before we start talking about them. And given an organization we inherited that had a few launches on the table that we have to scrap when we got here because they weren't really ready for primetime, you want to make sure we have our ducks in a row before we, a, start talking about more.

And they're doing that with just 2 products today. We stopped the declines in NovaSure, you know it better than most, just 2 years ago, NovaSure was a high digit decliner. We stopped that one and actually turned it into a positive. And in MyoSure, I know when I first came here, it was growing at 20%. People figured we were about maxed out last year we went to 30%, and just had a 40% growth in the quarter. That's asked us in the markets size a year or 2 ago. And I couldn't quite answer it, I think we are seeing there may be more potential there. And then it's a great sales team that clearly could take on another product. So I think that's an area we're very willing and stepping up our activities when looking at bolt-on acquisitions. It's an area we're in the nascent stages, frankly started to expand internationally. And it's a business that can do a lot for the profit pmargin and profitability profile of the company. So it's one we're more and more excited about. I'd still model single-digit growth, but like everything, we're certainly aspiring to continue the great trend. But clearly we did mention there was a competitive recall we think helped us in that last quarter. And so that we certainly don't see the 18.8% growth as sustainable.

We're very pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. In short, the company is off to a good start to the year.

We're very pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. In short, the company is off to a good start to the year. We are executing on our key top line growth drivers and exceeding expectations on the bottom line based on the tremendous earnings power of the company, which has become even stronger over time than I initially thought possible. 
In the first quarter, total revenue grew 8.1% in constant currency terms, driven by double-digit growth in the United States, our largest and most profitable market. Our U.S. businesses have turned around more rapidly than anyone anticipated, based on better commercial execution and the quality of our products. And over the last few quarters, our domestic sales and marketing teams have kicked it up a notch, generating robust growth from our key brands. 
This commercial improvement has led to significant benefits up and down our income statement. For example, in the first quarter, we posted non-GAAP gross and operating margins that were significantly higher than in the prior-year period. We are clearly demonstrating that despite our already sector-leading profitability, we can generate additional operating leverage by driving the growth of our most profitable products. 
Working down the income statement, earnings per share were $0.46 in the first quarter, beating our expectations again. In addition, we increased EPS at a pace that was nearly 3x the rate of revenue growth. 
With that introduction, let me discuss the details of our first quarter revenue performance. Then Bob will take you through the rest of the income statement, the balance sheet and our updated guidance. 
Total revenues were $695.2 million in the first quarter, an increase of 6.5% on a reported basis and 8.1% in constant currency terms. 
Geographically, our U.S. businesses performed exceptionally well in the quarter. We posted 12.8% revenue growth domestically, a slight acceleration over the fourth quarter despite a more difficult comp. 
This strong U.S. performance outweighed what was a mixed bag internationally in the first quarter. We showed good continued progress in cytology, molecular diagnostics and surgical outside the United States. In constant currency terms, cytology grew high single digits. Molecular posted modest growth for the second consecutive quarter, and surgical grew in the mid-teens, albeit from a small base. In contrast, we saw weakness in our international blood screening business, which was largely expected and which resulted mainly from fluctuations in ordering patterns by our commercial partner, Grifols. 
In addition, our international Breast Health results confirmed, as we have highlighted before, that we are a long way from optimizing our relationships with our dealers and distributors. Lower Breast Health and blood screening sales OUS contributed to total international sales declining 11.5% in the quarter, or 5.4% in constant currency terms. 
We are moving decisively to strengthen the international breast business, drawing on the same toolkit that we employed to turn around our domestic franchises. We are unifying leadership of all global commercial activities under our COO, Eric Compton, so that we may share some of our U.S. best practices internationally. 
As part of this process, our head of international has left the company, along with our head of European Breast Health sales. In their place, Eric is diving deep to optimize our go-to-market strategy in key markets around the globe. 
We are highly focused on identifying the right commercial model for each country in which we operate. While there may be some short-term volatility, we remain bullish on our international opportunities in Breast Health, and we look forward to sharing more details about our plans as they come together. 
Now let's provide some more color on our divisional revenue performance in the first quarter. 
Our biggest division, Diagnostics, posted sales of $310.7 million in the quarter, a growth rate of 3.7% in constant currency terms. But the 3 franchises within Diagnostics demonstrated very different results. In molecular diagnostics and cytology, where we control the commercial channel, our results were very good. But blood screening sales declined. Let's discuss each piece in turn. 
In molecular diagnostics, quarterly sales of $129.6 million increased 9.9% in constant currency, our best growth rate since the GenProbe acquisition. Domestic revenues increased a stellar 11.5%, and the formula was similar to recent quarters: strong placements of our fully automated Panther instrument, a healthy number of competitive wins and growing utilization of our women's health assays. 
We said at a recent healthcare conference that the average Panther system globally now generates more than $170,000 in annual assay revenue, despite being less than 30% utilized. This demonstrates both the current value of the system and its future potential for customers and Hologic, as we add new tests for viral load and other targets in the years ahead. Outside the United States, sales of our molecular diagnostics products grew nominally on a constant currency basis for the second consecutive quarter, as the business stabilizes after an extended period of decline. 
We're also pleased with the performance of ThinPrep, one of our largest and most profitable franchises. Global sales of cytology and perinatal products totaled $120.4 million in the first quarter. U.S. sales actually increased by a modest 0.5%, as market share gains more than offset headwinds from longer screening intervals. And internationally, we are encouraged that revenue grew 8.7% in constant currency. This drove global growth of 3.1%, our second consecutive quarter of decent constant currency growth. Our commercial team deserves much credit for transforming a business that was declining at a high single-digit rate as recently as 2014, into a modest grower globally. 
In blood screening, worldwide sales were $60.7 million in the first quarter. This was roughly flat sequentially, as sales have normalized without the benefit of growth from the Japanese Red Cross contract. Compared to the prior year, however, blood screening sales declined 6.5% on a constant currency basis. This reflects heavier ordering by our partner Grifols a year ago and general declines in blood usage that we are seeing in the United States and other markets. 
Now let's turn to Breast Health, where we continue to see strong adoption of our Genius 3D Mammography exams in the United States. Domestic sales of breast imaging products, including our Genius systems, increased 18.7% compared to the 8.9% constant currency decline we saw internationally. Global sales of interventional breast products increased slightly on a constant currency basis, and we are optimistic that new products will help stimulate growth in this category over the next couple of years. All this added up to total Breast Health sales of $262.2 million in the quarter, up 9.9% in constant currency terms. 
We also remain enthusiastic about our future prospects in the mammography market. We continue to gain share in the United States based on a superior product profile and excellent customer service. Our prices are stable despite increasing competition, which indicates that our marketing programs are working and that our systems are providing value to customers. And Congressional action has prohibited any near-term insurance changes arising from the controversial screening recommendations by the USPSTF. All in all, we have a lengthy runway ahead of us to continue upgrading older, less effective technologies to our Genius 3D exams. 
To round out the revenue discussion, we are thrilled with the progress being made by our surgical team. Although the December quarter is typically a seasonally strong one, we certainly did not predict sales of $98.8 million, or a constant currency growth rate of 18.8%. These are truly outstanding results, our best overall performance in the last several years, so congratulations to the commercial teams and new leaders who are making it happen. 
It's worth mentioning that surgical is Hologic's most profitable division on a gross and operating margin basis, so the magnitude of the top line growth we're now seeing is having a nice positive impact on the company's gross and operating margins, as well as earnings per share. Specifically, our MyoSure product for hysteroscopic tissue removal posted total revenue of $36.9 million in the first quarter, with accelerating growth of 46.1% in constant currency terms. Equally impressive, global NovaSure sales of $61.7 million increased by 7.5% on a constant currency basis. We do believe NovaSure sales benefited from the recall of a competitive product, but estimate that this benefit was relatively small in the context of overall quarterly sales. 
Finally, worldwide Skeletal sales were $23.5 million in the quarter, an increase of 7.7% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued growth of our new Horizon bone density scanner, a very solid performance. 
Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me conclude by saying that this quarter illustrates the value that our portfolio of products can provide to shareholders. Although Breast Health and blood screening declined outside the United States, we more than compensated by posting strong growth in mammography, molecular diagnostics and surgical. The net effect was top line performance slightly ahead of expectations, and a significant increase in profitability. All in all, we're off to good a good start in 2016, and remain excited about the future. 
Now I will hand the call over to Bob."

I'm going to walk through the rest of our first quarter income statement, the balance sheet and our updated financial guidance for 2016. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and",1561,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to walk through the rest of our first quarter income statement, the balance sheet and our updated financial guidance for 2016. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. 
As Steve mentioned, we delivered another solid quarter on the top line, with 12.8% sales growth in the U.S. more than offsetting the international choppiness we saw in Breast Health and blood screening. Strengthen in domestic revenue, combined with the early returns of our productivity efforts, helped drive margin improvement at the gross and operating levels, contributing to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.46, a 17.9% increase over the prior year period. Even with headwinds from share count and currency, EPS grew at a rate nearly 3x faster than sales. 
Moving down the income statement, our first quarter gross margin of 65.2% increased 190 basis points compared to the prior year period. Gross margin benefited from mix, both geographic and product, and from our cost reduction initiatives. Not only did revenue grow at a double-digit rate in U.S., some of our highest margin products also performed well, including our ThinPrep, NovaSure and Aptima franchises. And I should point out that pricing remains stable across our product lines as our commercial teams focus on selling the clinical and economic value that our products provide. In addition, our operations and procurement teams are executing well, driving efficiencies and reducing the cost to make our products. 
Total operating expenses of $221 million increased by 11.3% in the first quarter. This increase was driven primarily by sales and marketing expense, which increased 15.6%. We continue to invest to extend our leadership in the mammography market, and to explain why co-testing is the best way to protect women from cervical cancer. 
Despite these investments, better gross margins drove profitability improvement down to the operating line. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.4% in the quarter, an increase of 50 basis points from last year. Although our operating margin is already among the highest in our sector, the last several quarters have clearly demonstrated that they can expand further even as we fund key growth drivers. 
Moving further down the income statement, we are beginning to reap the benefits of our efforts to reduce and refinance debt. In the first quarter, interest expense was $32.8 million, a reduction of 25% versus the prior year period. 
In addition, we are pleased that a lot of hard work to reduce our tax rate has begun to pay off earlier than expected. We now estimate that our effective tax rate will be around 33% in fiscal 2016, lower than our initial guidance, and this added about $0.01 to EPS in the first quarter. Although this is just a first step in our multi-year tax improvement strategy, we are encouraged by the progress we've made so far. 
Finally, diluted shares outstanding were 292 million in the first quarter. As you know, we are focused on minimizing share count dilution by eliminating the convertible notes from our capital structure. In the fourth quarter, for example, we repurchased $300 million in principal of our most dilutive convertible notes, and this had a beneficial effect on share count in the first quarter. In addition, the recent decline in our share price had the rather perverse effect of further reducing dilution from the converts. The combined effect boosted EPS by almost $0.01 in the quarter. 
Now let's talk about cash flows and the balance sheet. 
Operating cash flow was strong again in the first quarter at $164.3 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year period. We spent $19.7 million on capital in the quarter, leading to free cash flow of $144.6 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the first fiscal quarter with $650 million in cash, a 19.5% improvement over the prior year period. This strong cash position provides us with dry powder for potential tuck-in acquisitions, even as we continue to pay down debt. 
At the end of the first quarter, we had total debt outstanding of $3.6 billion, a decrease of $322 million compared to a year ago, and net debt of $2.98 billion. Our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, now stands at 3.1x. And we are on track to achieve our goal of lowering our leverage ratio to 2.5x by the end of fiscal 2017. 
To wrap up the historical discussion, adjusted EBITDA was $252 million in the first quarter, up 8.1% compared to the prior year period, and we're tracking to generate EBITDA of more than $1 billion for the full year. 
Our consistency in delivering strong profit growth and lowering debt has allowed us to steadily improve our return on invested capital. As of our first fiscal quarter, ROIC was 11.3% on a trailing 12-month basis, a 160 basis point increase over the prior year. 
Now let's shift gears and turn to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and second quarter. 
We are updating our guidance based on our solid performance in the first quarter, a stronger U.S. dollar and greater than expected earnings power. 
As always, this guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates. As you know, the dollar has strengthened since we provided our initial 2016 guidance. Compared to last year, we now expect currency to represent a $25 million top line headwind in 2016. This equates to roughly $0.03 in earnings per share. And importantly, compared to when we initially guided in November, the stronger dollar is subtracting an incremental $11 million from our top line. 
So for the 2016 fiscal year, we are maintaining our guidance for constant currency growth of between 4.4% and 5.5%. But on a reported basis, we are updating our guidance to reflect the additional currency headwind. So based solely on the stronger dollar, we now expect reported revenues of $2.8 billion to $2.83 billion, representing reported growth of 3.5% to 4.6%. 
As Steve said earlier, we continue to forecast improvements on both the gross and operating margin lines, based on favorable geographic and product mix, as well as early returns from our productivity efforts. 
In addition, as you probably read, the omnibus budget bill that was passed by Congress in December included a 2-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax among other key provisions. We're thrilled that Congress has recognized the negative effects of this tax on domestic innovation and job growth. In fiscal 2015, we paid $23.6 million under this tax, which was reported under general and administrative expenses. It's important to note 2 points, however: first, since the moratorium took effect on January 1, we only recognize 3/4 of this benefit in our 2016 fiscal year. In addition, we plan to reinvest most of the benefit in some of our more attractive R&D and commercial programs. 
Continuing with our full year guidance, we now expect our effective tax rate to improve to approximately 33% for the year, and believe diluted shares outstanding will total between $296 million and $298 million for the full year. 
Given these updates and our strong first quarter results, we are increasing our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. For the full year, we now expect EPS of $1.86 to $1.90. This translates to growth of 13.1% to 15.5% in constant currency terms, or reported growth between 11.4% and 13.8%. So despite currency and share count headwinds, we anticipate growing EPS at more than double the rate of sales, demonstrating bottom line growth and operating leverage that seems unlikely, at best, just a few quarters ago. 
Turning to guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect revenues of $680 million to $690 million. Compared to the prior year period, this range reflects revenue growth of 4.5% to 6% on a constant currency basis, and reported revenue growth of 3.7% to 5.3%. 
We expect a sequential decline in revenue for 2 main reasons. First, our surgical business is seasonally weakest in the March quarter, especially in comparison to the strength we saw in the December period. Second, we are allowing for some potential choppiness in our international business. 
In terms of the bottom line, we forecast diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.45 to $0.46 in the second quarter. This represents growth of 11.2% to 13.6% in constant currency terms, or 9.8% to 12.2% on a reported basis. It's worth mentioning that we anticipate a substantial R&D increase in spending in the second fiscal quarter based mainly on the timing of projects. 
Before opening the call for questions, I'd like to reiterate that Hologic is off to a good start in 2016. In the first quarter, our momentum continued with Genius 3D Mammography and our surgical and molecular diagnostics business surprised to the upside. As a whole, our domestic businesses performed great. These positives outweighed weaker-than-expected results in our international mammography business, which we're dealing with aggressively. In the middle of the income statement, we are demonstrating the tremendous earnings power of the company by improving gross and operating margins. And below the line, we are beginning to see the benefits from our efforts to reduce debt, as well as our effective tax rate. 
With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're ready for the first question."

And we have a lot of work to do even on building our relationships with the dealers. And I think as we go back and look at it, clearly, our fourth fiscal quarter was really strong and followed by a weaker quarter, and that's not what we want to be delivering and don't have that sustained relationships. So we're making some changes internally, and we're not going to blame the dealers. We can always look at ourselves, and I'll say that we need to be a little closer to it. But it's the only little piece of the puzzle, I think, right now for us to continue to work on. I'd also say, I think, we're all accustomed to not every business is always firing on every cylinder.

And it's part of the hidden piece I think that we're seeing in our gross margin expansion. As we talk about the gross margin piece, clearly, it's the -- the incredible progress we're making on the operational side, it's a mix benefit but also, frankly, I think much better pricing discipline.

And I would say it was a fairly meaningful component of the gross margin expansion, obviously with our U.S. business driving significant growth. That also had a big impact as well.

Clearly, the primary focus has been on rebuilding the organic growth pipeline.

The other piece that I'd start to give you a little bit of a tidbit in is a lot of what we're working on are what I'd call singles and doubles. And -- the company was built historically, and every 8 years we launch a mega product like 2D and then 3D tomo, and a lot of what we are looking at is how do we cushion the blow in between and looking at some smaller things that we can be doing to bring in between those big cycles. And on the diagnostics business, it's about building out menu. In the Breast Health business, it's not just what's the replacement for 3D tomo, there's a lot of other stuff we can bring out in IBS and other stuff along the way. So I think what you'll start to see, and as you know, with me, stylistically, I'd like to get a few points on the board before we start talking about them. And given an organization we inherited that had a few launches on the table that we had to scrap when I got here because they weren't really ready for prime time. You want to make sure we really have our ducks in a row before we, a, start talking a lot more. But I'll tell you we feel better and better but it's going to be more singles and doubles than probably triples and home runs.

And I'm more bullish and excited the team that Eric has put in place there is really, really good, and they're doing that with just 2 products today. We stopped the declines in NovaSure. You know it better than most. Just 2 years ago NovaSure was a high single-digit decliner. We stopped that one and actually turned it into a positive. And the -- in MyoSure, I know when I first came here, it was growing at 20%. People figured we were about maxed out. Last year it went to 30%, and we just had a 46% growth quarter, and that's even when the people asked us the market size 1 year or 2 ago. And I couldn't quite answer it. I think we are seeing there may be more potential there. And then it's a great sales team that clearly could take on another product. So I think that's an area we're very willing and stepping up our activities of looking at bolt-on acquisitions. It's an area we're in the nascent stages, frankly, have started to expand internationally. And it's a business that can do a lot for the profit margin and profitability profile of the company. So it's one we're more and more excited about. I'd still model single-digit growth, but like everything, we're certainly aspiring to continue the great trend. But clearly we did mention, there was a competitive recall we think helped us in that last quarter, and so that we certainly don't see the 18.8% growth as sustainable. Aspirational, yes, and we'll take it back to the division head, set that as a new goal, but pragmatically speaking, we're not that good yet."

We're very pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. In short, the company is off to a good start to the year. We are executing on our key top line growth drivers an",1524,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're very pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2016. In short, the company is off to a good start to the year. We are executing on our key top line growth drivers and exceeding expectations on the bottom line based on the tremendous earnings power of the company, which has become even stronger over time than I initially thought possible. 
In the first quarter, total revenue grew 8.1% in constant currency terms, driven by double-digit growth in the United States, our largest and most profitable market. Our U.S. businesses have turned around more rapidly than anyone anticipated, based on better commercial execution and the quality of our products. And over the last few quarters, our domestic sales and marketing teams have kicked it up a notch, generating robust growth from our key brands. 
This commercial improvement has led to significant benefits up and down our income statement. For example, in the first quarter, we posted non-GAAP gross and operating margins that were significantly higher than in the prior-year period. We are clearly demonstrating that despite our already sector-leading profitability, we can generate additional operating leverage by driving the growth of our most profitable products. 
Working down the income statement, earnings per share were $0.46 in the first quarter, beating our expectations again. In addition, we increased EPS at a pace that was nearly 3x the rate of revenue growth. 
With that introduction, let me discuss the details of our first quarter revenue performance. Then Bob will take you through the rest of the income statement, the balance sheet and our updated guidance. 
Total revenues were $695.2 million in the first quarter, an increase of 6.5% on a reported basis and 8.1% in constant currency terms. 
Geographically, our U.S. businesses performed exceptionally well in the quarter. We posted 12.8% revenue growth domestically, a slight acceleration over the fourth quarter despite a more difficult comp. 
This strong U.S. performance outweighed what was a mixed bag internationally in the first quarter. We showed good continued progress in cytology, molecular diagnostics and surgical outside the United States. In constant currency terms, cytology grew high single digits. Molecular posted modest growth for the second consecutive quarter, and surgical grew in the mid-teens, albeit from a small base. In contrast, we saw weakness in our international blood screening business, which was largely expected and which resulted mainly from fluctuations in ordering patterns by our commercial partner, Grifols. 
In addition, our international Breast Health results confirmed, as we have highlighted before, that we are a long way from optimizing our relationships with our dealers and distributors. Lower Breast Health and blood screening sales OUS contributed to total international sales declining 11.5% in the quarter, or 5.4% in constant currency terms. 
We are moving decisively to strengthen the international breast business, drawing on the same toolkit that we employed to turn around our domestic franchises. We are unifying leadership of all global commercial activities under our COO, Eric Compton, so that we may share some of our U.S. best practices internationally. 
As part of this process, our head of international has left the company, along with our head of European Breast Health sales. In their place, Eric is diving deep to optimize our go-to-market strategy in key markets around the globe. 
We are highly focused on identifying the right commercial model for each country in which we operate. While there may be some short-term volatility, we remain bullish on our international opportunities in Breast Health, and we look forward to sharing more details about our plans as they come together. 
Now let's provide some more color on our divisional revenue performance in the first quarter. 
Our biggest division, Diagnostics, posted sales of $310.7 million in the quarter, a growth rate of 3.7% in constant currency terms. But the 3 franchises within Diagnostics demonstrated very different results. In molecular diagnostics and cytology, where we control the commercial channel, our results were very good. But blood screening sales declined. Let's discuss each piece in turn. 
In molecular diagnostics, quarterly sales of $129.6 million increased 9.9% in constant currency, our best growth rate since the GenProbe acquisition. Domestic revenues increased a stellar 11.5%, and the formula was similar to recent quarters: strong placements of our fully automated Panther instrument, a healthy number of competitive wins and growing utilization of our women's health assays. 
We said at a recent healthcare conference that the average Panther system globally now generates more than $170,000 in annual assay revenue, despite being less than 30% utilized. This demonstrates both the current value of the system and its future potential for customers and Hologic, as we add new tests for viral load and other targets in the years ahead. Outside the United States, sales of our molecular diagnostics products grew nominally on a constant currency basis for the second consecutive quarter, as the business stabilizes after an extended period of decline. 
We're also pleased with the performance of ThinPrep, one of our largest and most profitable franchises. Global sales of cytology and perinatal products totaled $120.4 million in the first quarter. U.S. sales actually increased by a modest 0.5%, as market share gains more than offset headwinds from longer screening intervals. And internationally, we are encouraged that revenue grew 8.7% in constant currency. This drove global growth of 3.1%, our second consecutive quarter of decent constant currency growth. Our commercial team deserves much credit for transforming a business that was declining at a high single-digit rate as recently as 2014, into a modest grower globally. 
In blood screening, worldwide sales were $60.7 million in the first quarter. This was roughly flat sequentially, as sales have normalized without the benefit of growth from the Japanese Red Cross contract. Compared to the prior year, however, blood screening sales declined 6.5% on a constant currency basis. This reflects heavier ordering by our partner Grifols a year ago and general declines in blood usage that we are seeing in the United States and other markets. 
Now let's turn to Breast Health, where we continue to see strong adoption of our Genius 3D Mammography exams in the United States. Domestic sales of breast imaging products, including our Genius systems, increased 18.7% compared to the 8.9% constant currency decline we saw internationally. Global sales of interventional breast products increased slightly on a constant currency basis, and we are optimistic that new products will help stimulate growth in this category over the next couple of years. All this added up to total Breast Health sales of $262.2 million in the quarter, up 9.9% in constant currency terms. 
We also remain enthusiastic about our future prospects in the mammography market. We continue to gain share in the United States based on a superior product profile and excellent customer service. Our prices are stable despite increasing competition, which indicates that our marketing programs are working and that our systems are providing value to customers. And Congressional action has prohibited any near-term insurance changes arising from the controversial screening recommendations by the USPSTF. All in all, we have a lengthy runway ahead of us to continue upgrading older, less effective technologies to our Genius 3D exams. 
To round out the revenue discussion, we are thrilled with the progress being made by our surgical team. Although the December quarter is typically a seasonally strong one, we certainly did not predict sales of $98.8 million, or a constant currency growth rate of 18.8%. These are truly outstanding results, our best overall performance in the last several years, so congratulations to the commercial teams and new leaders who are making it happen. 
It's worth mentioning that surgical is Hologic's most profitable division on a gross and operating margin basis, so the magnitude of the top line growth we're now seeing is having a nice positive impact on the company's gross and operating margins, as well as earnings per share. Specifically, our MyoSure product for hysteroscopic tissue removal posted total revenue of $36.9 million in the first quarter, with accelerating growth of 46.1% in constant currency terms. Equally impressive, global NovaSure sales of $61.7 million increased by 7.5% on a constant currency basis. We do believe NovaSure sales benefited from the recall of a competitive product, but estimate that this benefit was relatively small in the context of overall quarterly sales. 
Finally, worldwide Skeletal sales were $23.5 million in the quarter, an increase of 7.7% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued growth of our new Horizon bone density scanner, a very solid performance. 
Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me conclude by saying that this quarter illustrates the value that our portfolio of products can provide to shareholders. Although Breast Health and blood screening declined outside the United States, we more than compensated by posting strong growth in mammography, molecular diagnostics and surgical. The net effect was top line performance slightly ahead of expectations, and a significant increase in profitability. All in all, we're off to good a good start in 2016, and remain excited about the future. 
Now I will hand the call over to Bob."

I'm going to walk through the rest of our first quarter income statement, the balance sheet and our updated financial guidance for 2016. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and",1562,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to walk through the rest of our first quarter income statement, the balance sheet and our updated financial guidance for 2016. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. 
As Steve mentioned, we delivered another solid quarter on the top line, with 12.8% sales growth in the U.S. more than offsetting the international choppiness we saw in Breast Health and blood screening. Strength in domestic revenue, combined with the early returns of our productivity efforts, helped drive margin improvement at the gross and operating levels, contributing to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.46, a 17.9% increase over the prior year period. Even with headwinds from share count and currency, EPS grew at a rate nearly 3x faster than sales. 
Moving down the income statement, our first quarter gross margin of 65.2% increased 190 basis points compared to the prior year period. Gross margin benefited from mix, both geographic and product, and from our cost reduction initiatives. Not only did revenue grow at a double-digit rate in the U.S., some of our highest margin products also performed well, including our ThinPrep, NovaSure and Aptima franchises. And I should point out that pricing remains stable across our product lines as our commercial teams focus on selling the clinical and economic value that our products provide. In addition, our operations and procurement teams are executing well, driving efficiencies and reducing the cost to make our products. 
Total operating expenses of $221 million increased by 11.3% in the first quarter. This increase was driven primarily by sales and marketing expense, which increased 15.6%. We continue to invest to extend our leadership in the mammography market, and to explain why co-testing is the best way to protect women from cervical cancer. 
Despite these investments, better gross margins drove profitability improvement down to the operating line. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 33.4% in the quarter, an increase of 50 basis points from last year. Although our operating margin is already among the highest in our sector, the last several quarters have clearly demonstrated that they can expand further even as we fund key growth drivers. 
Moving further down the income statement, we are beginning to reap the benefits of our efforts to reduce and refinance debt. In the first quarter, interest expense was $32.8 million, a reduction of 25% versus the prior year period. 
In addition, we are pleased that a lot of hard work to reduce our tax rate has begun to pay off earlier than expected. We now estimate that our effective tax rate will be around 33% in fiscal 2016, lower than our initial guidance, and this added about $0.01 to EPS in the first quarter. Although this is just a first step in our multi-year tax improvement strategy, we are encouraged by the progress we've made so far. 
Finally, diluted shares outstanding were 292 million in the first quarter. As you know, we are focused on minimizing share count dilution by eliminating the convertible notes from our capital structure. In the fourth quarter, for example, we repurchased $300 million in principal of our most dilutive convertible notes, and this had a beneficial effect on share count in the first quarter. In addition, the recent decline in our share price had the rather perverse effect of further reducing dilution from the converts. The combined effect boosted EPS by almost $0.01 in the quarter. 
Now let's talk about cash flows and the balance sheet. 
Operating cash flow was strong again in the first quarter at $164.3 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year period. We spent $19.7 million on capital in the quarter, leading to free cash flow of $144.6 million. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the first fiscal quarter with $650 million in cash, a 19.5% improvement over the prior year period. This strong cash position provides us with dry powder for potential tuck-in acquisitions, even as we continue to pay down debt. 
At the end of the first quarter, we had total debt outstanding of $3.6 billion, a decrease of $322 million compared to a year ago, and net debt of $2.98 billion. Our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, now stands at 3.1x. And we are on track to achieve our goal of lowering our leverage ratio to 2.5x by the end of fiscal 2017. 
To wrap up the historical discussion, adjusted EBITDA was $252 million in the first quarter, up 8.1% compared to the prior year period, and we're tracking to generate EBITDA of more than $1 billion for the full year. 
Our consistency in delivering strong profit growth and lowering debt has allowed us to steadily improve our return on invested capital. As of our first fiscal quarter, ROIC was 11.3% on a trailing 12-month basis, a 160 basis point increase over the prior year. 
Now let's shift gears and turn to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and second quarter. 
We are updating our guidance based on our solid performance in the first quarter, a stronger U.S. dollar and greater than expected earnings power. 
As always, this guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates. As you know, the dollar has strengthened since we provided our initial 2016 guidance. Compared to last year, we now expect currency to represent a $25 million top line headwind in 2016. This equates to roughly $0.03 in earnings per share. And importantly, compared to when we initially guided in November, the stronger dollar is subtracting an incremental $11 million from our top line. 
So for the 2016 fiscal year, we are maintaining our guidance for constant currency growth of between 4.4% and 5.5%. But on a reported basis, we are updating our guidance to reflect the additional currency headwind. So based solely on the stronger dollar, we now expect reported revenues of $2.8 billion to $2.83 billion, representing reported growth of 3.5% to 4.6%. 
As Steve said earlier, we continue to forecast improvements on both the gross and operating margin lines, based on favorable geographic and product mix, as well as early returns from our productivity efforts. 
In addition, as you probably read, the omnibus budget bill that was passed by Congress in December included a 2-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax among other key provisions. We're thrilled that Congress has recognized the negative effects of this tax on domestic innovation and job growth. In fiscal 2015, we paid $23.6 million under this tax, which was reported under general and administrative expenses. It's important to note 2 points, however: first, since the moratorium took effect on January 1, we only recognize 3/4 of this benefit in our 2016 fiscal year. In addition, we plan to reinvest most of the benefit in some of our more attractive R&D and commercial programs. 
Continuing with our full year guidance, we now expect our effective tax rate to improve to approximately 33% for the year, and believe diluted shares outstanding will total between $296 million and $298 million for the full year. 
Given these updates and our strong first quarter results, we are increasing our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance. For the full year, we now expect EPS of $1.86 to $1.90. This translates to growth of 13.1% to 15.5% in constant currency terms, or reported growth between 11.4% and 13.8%. So despite currency and share count headwinds, we anticipate growing EPS at more than double the rate of sales, demonstrating bottom line growth and operating leverage that seemed unlikely, at best, just a few quarters ago. 
Turning to guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect revenues of $680 million to $690 million. Compared to the prior year period, this range reflects revenue growth of 4.5% to 6% on a constant currency basis, and reported revenue growth of 3.7% to 5.3%. 
We expect a sequential decline in revenue for 2 main reasons. First, our surgical business is seasonally weakest in the March quarter, especially in comparison to the strength we saw in the December period. Second, we are allowing for some potential choppiness in our international business. 
In terms of the bottom line, we forecast diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.45 to $0.46 in the second quarter. This represents growth of 11.2% to 13.6% in constant currency terms, or 9.8% to 12.2% on a reported basis. It's worth mentioning that we anticipate a substantial R&D increase in spending in the second fiscal quarter based mainly on the timing of projects. 
Before opening the call for questions, I'd like to reiterate that Hologic is off to a good start in 2016. In the first quarter, our momentum continued with Genius 3D Mammography and our surgical and molecular diagnostics business surprised to the upside. As a whole, our domestic businesses performed great. These positives outweighed weaker-than-expected results in our international mammography business, which we're dealing with aggressively. In the middle of the income statement, we are demonstrating the tremendous earnings power of the company by improving gross and operating margins. And below the line, we are beginning to see the benefits from our efforts to reduce debt, as well as our effective tax rate. 
With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're ready for the first question."

And we have a lot of work to do even on building our relationships with the dealers. And I think as we go back and look at it, clearly, our fourth fiscal quarter was really strong and followed by a weaker quarter, and that's not what we want to be delivering and don't have that sustained relationships. So we're making some changes internally, and we're not going to blame the dealers. We can always look at ourselves, and I'll say that we need to be a little closer to it. But it's the only little piece of the puzzle, I think, right now for us to continue to work on. I'd also say, I think, we're all accustomed to not every business is always firing on every cylinder. The day it does, we're probably in trouble. This is kind of one of our areas of opportunity. I think the next couple of quarters will probably be a little bit softer. We're going to plan for that while we get to the right longer-term plays. But as Eric -- as Eric Compton, after his first reviews of it, said, it obviously reminds him a little bit of when you walked in the door of Hologic 2 years ago and sort of the same rebuilding needs to occur, and things like pricing discipline, marketing, market access, just a lot of the fundamentals that we've never put in place."

And I would say it was a fairly meaningful component of the gross margin expansion, obviously with our U.S. business driving significant growth. That also had a big impact as well. And as we're thinking about the way that the U.S. business grew with the higher margin products in our surgical business and so forth, that actually helped us overall as well.

The other piece that I'd start to give you a little bit of a tidbit in is a lot of what we're working on are what I'd call singles and doubles. And -- the company was built historically, and every 8 years we launch a mega product like 2D and then 3D tomo, and a lot of what we are looking at is how do we cushion the blow in between and looking at some smaller things that we can be doing to bring in between those big cycles. And on the diagnostics business, it's about building out menu. In the Breast Health business, it's not just what's the replacement for 3D tomo, there's a lot of other stuff we can bring out in IBS and other stuff along the way. So I think what you'll start to see, and as you know, with me, stylistically, I'd like to get a few points on the board before we start talking about them. And given an organization we inherited that had a few launches on the table that we had to scrap when I got here because they weren't really ready for prime time. You want to make sure we really have our ducks in a row before we, a, start talking a lot more. But I'll tell you we feel better and better, but it's going to be more singles and doubles than probably triples and home runs.

And I'm more bullish and excited. The team that Eric has put in place there is really, really good, and they're doing that with just 2 products today. We stopped the declines on NovaSure. You know it better than most. Just 2 years ago NovaSure was a high single-digit decliner. We stopped that one and actually turned it into a positive. And the -- in MyoSure, I know when I first came here, it was growing at 20%. People figured we were about maxed out. Last year it went to 30%, and we just had a 46% growth quarter, and that's even when the people asked us the market size 1 year or 2 ago. And I couldn't quite answer it. I think we are seeing there may be more potential there. And then it's a great sales team that clearly could take on another product. So I think that's an area we're very willing and stepping up our activities of looking at bolt-on acquisitions. It's an area we're in the nascent stages, frankly, of starting to expand internationally. And it's a business that can do a lot for the profit margin and profitability profile of the company. So it's one we're more and more excited about. I'd still model single-digit growth, but like everything, we're certainly aspiring to continue the great trend. But clearly we did mention, there was a competitive recall we think helped us in that last quarter, and so that we certainly don't see the 18.8% growth as sustainable. Aspirational, yes, and we'll take it back to the division head, set that as his new goal, but pragmatically speaking, we're not that good yet."

The strength of our",1803,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. We posted very good results overall, highlighted by 14.6% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. The strength of our business model was evident on 3 levels in the quarter. First, our U.S. businesses grew revenue at a low double-digit rate, continuing a recent pattern of outstanding commercial execution. Second, we again improved both gross and operating margins while making significant investments in our future. And third, we entered a new phase of our capital allocation strategy by repurchasing our common stock while continuing to pay down our convertible notes. Together, these strategic actions drove EPS growth more than double the rate of sales. More specifically, domestic revenue increased 10.6% in the quarter led by strong performances by our Breast Health and Surgical businesses. International sales were lower, mainly due to expected declines in blood screening and the discontinued products we discussed in our initial guidance. But international Breast Health showed signs of stabilization, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Globally, total revenues grew 5.8% on a reported basis or 6.3% in constant-currency terms. And if we were to exclude the headwind from discontinued products, second quarter revenue would have increased more than 7% in constant-currency. Non-GAAP gross margin was 65.8% in the quarter, a significant improvement of 240 basis points compared to the prior-year period. We reinvested much of this incremental profitability for future growth and will continue to do so in the future, but still increased non-GAAP operating margin to 33.9% in the quarter, 40 basis points higher than last year. At the same time, our strong cash flows enabled us to be opportunistic in buying back our common stock as well as our convertible debt to continue improving our capital structure and to enhance future earnings power. Bob will cover the details in a moment, but net income represented a very robust 19.6% of sales and grew 14.1%, while non-GAAP EPS totaled $0.47, up 14.6% compared to the prior year. 
With that introduction and overview out of the way, I'd like to cover 5 subjects in my comments today. The first 2 have been topical over the last quarter, our Domestic and International Breast Health businesses, and obviously, these franchises will continue to be important to our future as well. But as we write new chapters in the Hologic story, the discourse is broadening as we build on our successes and add new strategic tools. With that in mind, today, I'd like to highlight our Surgical business, gross margin improvement opportunities and the research and development pipeline. Hopefully, this discussion will provide a little incremental color into the multiple levers we can pull to generate sustainable revenue and earnings growth over time. 
Let's start with our Domestic Breast Health business, which grew a very solid 11.2% based on continued adoption of our Genius 3D mammography systems. Genius placements were strong, increasing both sequentially and year-over-year, and we saw a good increase in service revenue as well. We continue to gain market share, and our investments in customer marketing are enabling us to do that while maintaining stable prices amid fierce competition. As a result, domestic imaging sales grew at a healthy midteens rate. We believe we still have runway ahead of us as our 3D systems are only about 1/3 penetrated into our own installed base and roughly 20% into the market as a whole. We remain confident in the long-term opportunity as customer interest and orders in house remain high and as clinical evidence continues to mount on the benefits of Hologic's exams for patients and physicians. Specifically, a longitudinal study published in February in the peer-reviewed journal gem oncology, showed that the benefits of our Genius exams, fewer recalls and improved cancer detection can be sustained and even improved over time, with consecutive use. In addition, a separate study published just yesterday in JAMA showed that these benefits held true for women with both dense and non-dense breasts, further bolstering the case for widespread adoption. 
Now let's turn to our International Breast Health business, which generated a lot of attention last quarter. While we still have a significant amount of work to do here, we did see signs of stabilization in the second quarter and are optimistic that we will see further signs of progress and predictability in the quarters ahead. While revenue declined by low single digits on a constant-currency basis in the second quarter, it's important to note that last year's results benefited from sales of products that we have since discontinued. If we back out this headwind, International Breast Health sales would have increased at a mid-single digit rate in constant-currency, a materially better performance than the decline we saw last quarter. As always, business improvement starts with people, and our Chief Operating Officer, Eric Compton, has made several important organizational changes internationally in recent months. We moved one of our key U.S. Breast Health leaders to Europe, and he is now in charge of building stronger, mutually productive relationships with our dealer network. Toward that end, we have signed several new performance-based contract with our top dealers. In addition, we've hired a new European head of service, which we have identified as a critical role to support our dealers and direct customers. We also have brought on new leaders of marketing, molecular diagnostics, surgical and regulatory. So the team is coming together nicely. 
Now let me turn to those 3 new topics, Surgical, gross margins and R&D. Let's cover Surgical first. Global sales were $90.9 million in the quarter and grew 15.9% in constant-currency. Surgical has exemplified the tremendous commercial turnaround that has occurred at Hologic, with the second quarter representing the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in the United States. It wasn't too long ago that surgical was viewed as a non-strategic asset that should be divested. Today, however, surgical is a vibrant business with strong profitability and cash flows plus good growth potential, and I couldn't be prouder of the team who has made it happen. Their formula for success has been straightforward. Stabilization of our NovaSure franchise, which was declining at a high single-digit rate only a couple of years ago, combined with excellent growth from our MyoSure products for uterine fibroid removal. We remain enthusiastic about the potential for MyoSure as we seek to expand the addressable market and replace all their treatments. And now, with the market withdrawal of a competitor to NovaSure, we have an opportunity to drive material growth for that product as well. We believe that NovaSure sales benefited from the competitive recall by a few million dollars in the quarter, and we are investing in marketing and physician outreach programs to ensure this continues for the balance of the year. 
The second topic I want to cover is our ability to improve gross margins. A year ago, we weren't overly bullish in this regard, but our operations team deserves a tremendous amount of credit for improving upon already strong profitability. To highlight what we've been able to achieve, in the second quarter, non-GAAP cost of goods sold for our products was lower in absolute terms than it was in the prior-year period despite an increase in sales. This is far bigger than a mix shift story. It is reflecting tremendous work by our teams. To make this possible, new leadership has instituted productivity improvement targets for each of our plants, and local managers have responded with scores of specific projects. We are closing our Bedford facility, our former corporate headquarters and moving the skeletal manufacturing that was done there to a contract manufacturer. And as we have discussed previously, we are doing a much better job of leveraging our corporate purchasing power across the business. 
The third area I want to discuss is our research and development pipeline, and it's important to begin with a bit of context. The unfortunate truth is that our R&D pipeline was weak, reflecting years of a growth by acquisition mindset. Too often, R&D spending was viewed as a plug in the income statement. The amount that was left over while attempting to meet short term financial goals. To reverse this mentality, we have been adding talent and rebuilding processes across the company to make R&D a driver of sustainable growth again. Although this process is far from complete, we are beginning to see the fruits of our labor. In diagnostics, for example, we now have a robust menu of molecular assays available on Panther in Europe, spanning women's health as well as virology. Recently we have secured CE Marks for new tests for HIV-1, hepatitis C, hepatitis B and the sexually transmitted disease called mycoplasma genitalia. In the United States, we are already the leader in women's health. We have filed the premarket approval application for our HIV viral load assay, and the PMA for our hepatitis C assay is scheduled to be submitted late this calendar year. Finally, our Panther Fusion platform, which will provide customers the flexibility to perform PCR testing in a single unit dose format is on track to be introduced internationally next year. 
In Surgical, we are now in the process of launching a line extension called MyoSure Reach. MyoSure Reach increases clinical utility by providing surgeons access to polyps and fibroids in more areas of the uterus, and we believe it will play an important role in extending our leadership position in the field. Finally, in Breast Health, we are excited about 2 new biopsy products that will further build on our position as the innovative leader in the market. Our new 3D-enabled Affirm Prone Biopsy system was introduced in Europe in March, and is being launched domestically now. Affirm represents the first real innovation in the biopsy space in roughly 20 years and leverages our growing installed base of Genius systems by enabling physicians to perform a more accurate biopsy using 3D technology. To further enhance our biopsy business, we expect to launch an entirely new biopsy tool named Brevera next year. Brevera has breakthrough potential as it allows realtime analysis of the biopsy sample, thereby vastly improving the patient experience. Stay tuned for more information on this. 
Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me conclude by saying that we are pleased with our second quarter financial results, which in some ways opened a new chapter in the Hologic story. As in recent quarters, our commercial teams generated robust growth in the United States. At the same time, we generated operating leverage through productivity improvements, while simultaneously investing for the future. And we boosted our bottom line performance by opportunistically deploying capital. All in all, a solid, well-rounded performance.

Unless otherwise noted, my remar",1836,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I am going to highlight our other divisional sales drivers then some key financial metrics and then wrap up with our updated financial guidance for 2016. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. Overall, we had a strong second quarter, with double-digit growth in the U.S. In addition, 3 of our 4 businesses demonstrated global growth in the quarter. Steve already discussed Breast Health and Surgical, so I will focus on Diagnostics and Skeletal. Diagnostics, our largest business, reported sales of $304.4 million in the second quarter, growing 3.2% in constant-currency terms. We're pleased to report another positive quarter on our cytology and perinatal business, which generated $116.1 million in sales, growing 3.5% in constant-currency. U.S. sales grew in mid-single digits, which was by far, our highest growth in several years, even with lingering headwinds from pap interval extension. 
Turning to mammography diagnostics, we posted sales up $126.1 million, up 5.8% in constant-currency. Domestic sales increased at a faster rate as our fully automated Panther system continues to accumulate new placements and competitive wins. In addition, utilization and sales of our assays for Trichomonas, HPV and chlamydia and gonorrhea continue to grow. Internationally, we had another solid quarter of Panther placements. This keeps us optimistic about our future growth potential in Europe, where we now have a full menu of women's health and viral load assays, as Steve mentioned. In blood screening, worldwide revenue of $62.2 million decreased 2.4% in constant-currency as expected. While there were some geography shifts as our partner Grifols balanced inventory, the overall decline was mainly due to stronger ordering in the prior-year period to support the rollout of our business with the Japanese Red Cross. We do continue to see however trends towards lower blood utilization worldwide, and therefore, anticipate that quarterly blood screening sales will settle in the mid-$50 million range as the market and customer usage patterns mature. 
In Skeletal Health, we had $22.2 million in global sales, a decline of 8.2% in constant-currency. Domestically, sales increased at a low single-digit rate, but international sales were negatively affected by distributor ordering patterns. Because this business is so small, it is not uncommon to see these kinds of fluctuations, and we do expect that Skeletal will be a solid contributor to growth over time. 
Now let me switch gears and discuss operating expenses in the second quarter. Total expenses of $221.2 million increased 12.9%, mainly as a result of our continued investment in Breast Health and diagnostic marketing programs, along with the timing of R&D programs which we foreshadowed last quarter. This increase in spending, which will continue into the second half of the year is planned and deliberate and a key component of our strategy to generate long-term sustainable growth. Two factors contribute to our willingness to support these incremental investments. First, and most importantly, we see good returns on the specific projects we're pursuing. For example, our investments in consumer marketing for Genius are enabling us to gain market share while maintaining stable price in the face of new competition. Second, we already have an industry-leading operating margin and have shown that we can and will increase this margin over time. But our goal is not to drive operating margins to unprecedented levels for our industry. Instead, we want to steadily improve them while also investing appropriately in DCF positive projects for long-term growth. At the same time, our goal is to allocate capital to enhance shareholder returns, and during the second quarter, we accelerated our efforts in this regard. For the last few years, our primary use of excess cash has been to pay down debt, and our long-standing goal of reducing net debt to 2.5x EBITDA by the end of '17 remains in effect. As evidence of this, we spent $311.4 million in the second quarter to repurchase convertible notes with the principal value of $226.6 million. While our convertible debt totaled over $1.3 billion in principle less than 12 months ago, it is now down to $793.3 million, a reduction of more than $0.5 billion. And given the continuing strength of our cash flows, we are in a position to supplement debt reduction with opportunistic repurchases of our common stock. Specifically in the second quarter, we bought back 4.3 million shares of our stock for $148.8 million. While stock buybacks have always been part of our long-term plan, market weakness in the second quarter enabled us to pounce a little earlier than expected. These strategic actions enabled us to sequentially reduce our share count in the second quarter, the first time in a long while that our diluted share count declined. In fact, diluted shares outstanding of 288 million were basically flat compared to the prior-year period, no longer diluting EPS growth. Specifically non-GAAP EPS increased 14.6%, about 2.5x the rate of sales. 
Let me just emphasize that our debt reduction and buyback activities will not prohibit us from seeking out opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions. Our divisional business development teams are settling in, and while no transactions are imminent, we are actively evaluating opportunities across our businesses. 
Before I move on to guidance, let me cover a few other financial metrics from the second quarter. Improvements made to our balance sheet contributed to a total debt outstanding of $3.4 billion, a decrease of $534.1 million compared to a year ago and net debt of $3.1 billion. Our leverage ratio net debt over EBITDA now stands at 3.1x. In the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $253.8 million, up 6.4% compared to the prior-year period. In addition, our trailing 12-month EBITDA surpassed $1 billion this quarter, a nice milestone for the company. Our ability to generate strong profits while lowering debt has again allowed us to increase return on invested capital. As our second fiscal quarter, ROIC was 11.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, 170 basis point improvement over the prior year. 
Finally, let's turn to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and third quarter. Starting with the full year, we are raising the low end of our revenue guidance by $12 million to reflect the solid performance in the first half of the year. We now expect reported revenue of $2.81 billion to $2.83 billion in fiscal 2016, representing reported growth of 3.9% to 4.6%. Based on recent exchange rates, this equates to constant-currency growth of between 4.6% and 5.4%. Compared to our last guidance, there are a few puts and takes related to revenue. On the positive side, the market withdrawal of a competing surgical products should provide a tailwind to NovaSure and the dollar has weakened slightly. The currency benefit for us is less than you might expect however, since much of the dollar weakeningis  related to the Japanese yen and other currencies where we have minimal exposure. In terms of headwinds, we are more cautious on near-term blood screening revenue given macro trends in the market and we derisked our international forecast slightly. I should also mention we have made a voluntary decision to stop selling PF in flex, our test for cystic fibrosis due to manufacturing quality issues at a key component supplier that recently resulted in a recall. This would represent a headwind of several million dollars to our U.S. molecular diagnostics revenue in the second half of the year but shouldn't have much effect on margins. 
In terms of earnings for the full year, we now expect EPS of between $1.89 and $1.91, which translates to reported growth between 13.2% and 14.4%, a constant-currency growth of 15.6% to 15.8%. This is based on an effective tax rate of approximately 33% and diluted shares outstanding of roughly $292 million for the full year. As you work through your models, you will see that our increased EPS guidance implies a healthy expansion of already industry-leading operating margins, while accommodating increased investment. Specifically, we intend to continue investing behind our Genius campaign in breast health and surgical cancer cotesting and diagnostics. We will aggressively fund the commercial activities to launch important new products such as our Affirm Probe biopsy systems and capitalize on the competitive investment environment surrendering NovaSure. We also expect to make some key hires in our international business which typically come in with initial sign-on costs for relocation and the like. And we are pursuing some entirely new R&D initiatives, such as developing a blood screening test for the Zika virus while also seeking out opportunities to accelerate R&D timelines for existing initiatives, for example, by increasing the breadth of outside support. Not all of these investments are permanent in nature, but we do expect them to push operating expenses upward in the second half of the year. At the same time however our capital deployment activities are effectively offsetting the impact of these strategic investments on the bottom line. 
Now turning to guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenues of $695 million to $705 million. Compared to the prior-year period, this range reflects a reported growth of 0.2% to 1.6% or 0.6% to 2% on a constant-currency basis. As a reminder, these lower growth rates are due to a much tougher comparable in the prior-year period when revenue jumped almost $40 million on a sequential basis. In terms of the bottom line, we forecast diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47 to $0.48 in the third quarter. This represents continued strong growth of 9.3% to 11.6% on a reported basis or 10.1% to 12.4% in constant-currency terms. Our full year guidance obviously implies a sequential step up in the fourth quarter revenue. This is due to normal sequential business momentum that we expect, contributions from new product launches and the timing of some royalty revenue that is expected later this year. 
Before opening up the call for questions, I would like to reiterate that our view on the second quarter is one of a good multilevel execution. Revenue grew at a solid rate based on continued outperformance domestically and stabilization outside the United States. We improved already strong operating margins while accommodating increased investment in key growth drivers. And our capital deployment activities helped to pay for these investments at the EPS line while setting the stage for leveraged growth over the long term. 
Now that we're halfway through our fiscal year, we're optimistic about our full year forecast. We're anticipating solid mid-single digit revenue growth in line with our original expectations as strength in the U.S. offsets the weakness we have seen internationally. We forecast solid expansion of operating margins while simultaneously investing for the future; and we expect the acceleration of our capital redeployment activities to allow us leverage operating gains all the way down to EPS, which should grow at a midteens rate. 
With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're ready for the first question"

I think what we see is we still feel very good about the order trends and about, frankly, the biggest piece I think we're incredibly excited about it, is the way we're holding pricing. And the demand still looks very good. Having said that, we're going against obviously now as we go into this third quarter. We're going against the huge comps and therefore, again as we try to signal in July of last year the absolute growth rates will probably be slower here for the U.S. Breast Health business, certainly as we go into the coming quarters. But I still feeling really good that there's a lot of runway ahead. And I think when we talked to investors, I think people often think there's going to be a peak and a huge trough.

We have very soft decline in that segment of the business at some point of time as opposed to a real cliff. Part of what we have coming I think is in biopsy and frankly [indiscernible] is running that business for us. Have long good track record of being able to put even some singles and doubles on the board in addition to just the every 5 or 8 year homerun that we tended to have in this business. So I would tell you I'm feeling incrementally better everytime Bob and I and Eric Compton are down meeting our business what's happened in our pipeline and we'll talk more and more about that certainly in the coming quarters and years. But I think we're feeling better about being able to mitigate that. The other piece, I just want to jump back even on your question on margin to Bob, because you know I was very adamant early on when I came, I was probably not expecting much margin expansion. This has been one of the very positive surprises to me, and I think the big piece that I want to be clear on is we're going to use a lot of this gross margin expansion to continue to invest into the business, which leads to the second part of your follow-up question there, which is as we go forward, we're certainly spending more on R&D, more on marketing and it will allow us to do tuck-in acquisitions based on the cash generation. And so I think we're really opening up a new leg in the stool where we got more levers available to us than we did 2 years ago. Two years ago, we were still hamstrung with debt and the converts and everything else, we didn't have really an ability to potentially manage, because as we all know, we're going to see some ups and downs in the rate of sales growth. We're going to continue to grow. We are going to have some period where it will be a little bit slower while we wait for the next new products to come through. I think we're feeling better and better that we're going to be able to deliver very strong earnings growth consistently and in the periods when we're growing faster, we'll probably reinvest a little bit more in the periods that are smaller. We may not have quite the accelerated investments in that time. So, hopefully, that will start to give a little more longer-term of what we're thinking about."

I think if we look, Jack, at the global market, let's take it by U.S. The U.S., clearly hospitals are getting better and better at managing their inventory at minimally invasive surgery, at being able to limit their use of blood. So I think we're forecasting that the U.S. is a slight decliner. This quarter, our U.S. business was actually up fairly significantly in blood, that was more an inventory  correction. But I think the way we're thinking about it is that this is a low single-digit decliner. Internationally, I think we see the business very slight grower, but globally, I think because of the declines in the U.S., we think about blood screening as a flattish to slightly down business. And that's -- you go back to the headwinds we had as a company facing us a few years ago. It was blood, it was NovaSure, it was MyoSure -- I'm sorry, it was blood, NovaSure and ThinPrep. The 2 that we control the commercial channel, feel great about changing the long-term trajectory. I don't think we're quite as ready to declare a change in the trajectory of blood screening."

The strength of our",1798,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. We posted very good results overall, highlighted by 14.6% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. The strength of our business model was evident on 3 levels in the quarter. First, our U.S. businesses grew revenue at a low double-digit rate, continuing a recent pattern of outstanding commercial execution. Second, we again improved both gross and operating margins, while making significant investments in our future. And third, we entered a new phase of our capital allocation strategy by repurchasing our common stock, while continuing to pay down our convertible notes. Together, these strategic actions drove EPS growth more than double the rate of sales. More specifically, domestic revenue increased 10.6% in the quarter, led by strong performances by our Breast Health and Surgical businesses. International sales were lower, mainly due to expected declines in blood screening and the discontinued products we discussed in our initial guidance. But international Breast Health showed signs of stabilization, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Globally, total revenues grew 5.8% on a reported basis or 6.3% in constant-currency terms. And if we were to exclude the headwind from discontinued products, second quarter revenue would have increased more than 7% in constant-currency. Non-GAAP gross margin was 65.8% in the quarter, a significant improvement of 240 basis points compared to the prior year period. We reinvested much of this incremental profitability for future growth and will continue to do so in the future, but still increased non-GAAP operating margin to 33.9% in the quarter, 40 basis points higher than last year. At the same time, our strong cash flows enabled us to be opportunistic in buying back our common stock, as well as our convertible debt to continue improving our capital structure and to enhance future earnings power. Bob will cover the details in a moment, but net income represented a very robust 19.6% of sales and grew 14.1%, while non-GAAP EPS totaled $0.47, up 14.6% compared to the prior year. 
With that introduction and overview out of the way, I'd like to cover 5 subjects in my comments today. The first 2 have been topical over the last quarter, our domestic and international Breast Health businesses, and obviously, these franchises will continue to be important to our future as well. But as we write new chapters in the Hologic story, the discourse is broadening as we build on our successes and add new strategic tools. With that in mind, today, I'd like to highlight our Surgical business, gross margin improvement opportunities and the research and development pipeline. Hopefully, this discussion will provide a little incremental color into the multiple levers we can pull to generate sustainable revenue and earnings growth over time. 
Let's start with our domestic Breast Health business, which grew a very solid 11.2% based on continued adoption of our Genius 3D Mammography systems. Genius placements were strong, increasing both sequentially and year-over-year, and we saw a good increase in service revenue as well. We continue to gain market share, and our investments in customer marketing are enabling us to do that, while maintaining stable prices amid fierce competition. As a result, domestic imaging sales grew at a healthy mid-teens rate. We believe we still have runway ahead of us as our 3D systems are only about 1/3 penetrated into our own installed base, and roughly 20% into the market as a whole. We remain confident in the long-term opportunity as customer interest and orders in-house remain high, and as clinical evidence continues to mount on the benefits of Hologic's exams for patients and physicians. Specifically, a longitudinal study published in February in the peer-reviewed journal, JAMA Oncology, showed that the benefits of our Genius exams, fewer recalls and improved cancer detection can be sustained and even improved over time with consecutive use. In addition, a separate study published just yesterday in JAMA showed that these benefits hold true for women with both dense and non-dense breasts, further bolstering the case for widespread adoption. 
Now let's turn to our international Breast Health business, which generated a lot of attention last quarter. While we still have a significant amount of work to do here, we do see signs of stabilization in the second quarter and are optimistic that we will see further signs of progress and predictability in the quarters ahead. While revenue declined by low single digits on a constant-currency basis in the second quarter, it's important to note that last year's results benefited from sales of products that we have since discontinued. If we back out this headwind, international Breast Health sales would have increased at a mid-single-digit rate in constant currency, a materially better performance than the decline we saw last quarter. As always, business improvement starts with people, and our Chief Operating Officer, Eric Compton, has made several important organizational changes internationally in recent months. We moved one of our key U.S. Breast Health leaders to Europe, and he is now in-charge of building stronger, mutually productive relationships with our dealer network. Towards that end, we have signed several new performance-based contracts with our top dealers. In addition, we've hired a new European head of service, which we have identified as a critical role to support our dealers and direct customers. We also have brought on new leaders of marketing, molecular diagnostics, surgical and regulatory. So the team is coming together nicely. 
Now let me turn to those 3 new topics: Surgical, gross margins and R&D. Let's cover Surgical first. Global sales were $90.9 million in the quarter and grew 15.9% in constant-currency. Surgical has exemplified the tremendous commercial turnaround that has occurred at Hologic, with the second quarter representing the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in the United States. It wasn't too long ago that surgical was viewed as a non-strategic asset that should be divested. Today, however, surgical is a vibrant business with strong profitability and cash flows plus good growth potential, and I couldn't be prouder of the team who has made it happen. Their formula for success has been straightforward. Stabilization of our NovaSure franchise, which was declining at a high single-digit rate only a couple of years ago, combined with excellent growth from our MyoSure products for uterine fibroid removal. We remain enthusiastic about the potential for MyoSure as we seek to expand the addressable market and replace older treatments. And now, with the market withdrawal of a competitor to NovaSure, we have an opportunity to drive material growth for that product as well. We believe that NovaSure sales benefited from the competitive recall by a few million dollars in the quarter, and we are investing in marketing and physician outreach programs to ensure this continues for the balance of the year. 
The second topic I want to cover is our ability to improve gross margins. A year ago, we weren't overly bullish in this regard, but our operations team deserves a tremendous amount of credit for improving upon already strong profitability. To highlight what we've been able to achieve, in the second quarter, non-GAAP cost of goods sold for our products was lower in absolute terms than it was in the prior year period despite an increase in sales. This is far bigger than a mix shift story. It is reflecting tremendous work by our teams. To make this possible, new leadership has instituted productivity improvement targets for each of our plants, and local managers have responded with scores of specific projects. We are closing our Bedford facility, our former corporate headquarters, and moving the skeletal manufacturing that was done there to a contract manufacturer. And as we have discussed previously, we are doing a much better job of leveraging our corporate purchasing power across the business. 
The third area I want to discuss is our research and development pipeline, and it's important to begin with a bit of context. The unfortunate truth is that our R&D pipeline was weak, reflecting years of a growth by acquisition mindset. Too often, R&D spending was viewed as a plug in the income statement. The amount that was left over, while attempting to meet short-term financial goals. To reverse this mentality, we have been adding talent and rebuilding processes across the company to make R&D a driver of sustainable growth again. Although this process is far from complete, we are beginning to see the fruits of our labor. In diagnostics, for example, we now have a robust menu of molecular assays available on Panther in Europe, spanning women's health as well as virology. Recently, we have secured CE-marks for new tests for HIV-1, hepatitis C, hepatitis B and a sexually transmitted disease called Mycoplasma genitalium. In the United States, we are already the leader in women's health. We have filed the premarket approval application for our HIV viral load assay, and the PMA for our hepatitis C assay is scheduled to be submitted late this calendar year. Finally, our Panther Fusion platform, which will provide customers the flexibility to perform PCR testing in a single-unit-dose format, is on track to be introduced internationally next year. 
In Surgical, we are now in the process of launching a line extension called MyoSure Reach. MyoSure Reach increases clinical utility by providing surgeons access to polyps and fibroids in more areas of the uterus, and we believe it will play an important role in extending our leadership position in the field. Finally, in Breast Health, we are excited about 2 new biopsy products that will further build on our position as the innovative leader in the market. Our new 3D-enabled Affirm prone biopsy system was introduced in Europe in March, and is being launched domestically now. Affirm represents the first real innovation in the biopsy space in roughly 20 years and leverages our growing installed base of Genius systems by enabling physicians to perform a more accurate biopsy using 3D technology. To further enhance our biopsy business, we expect to launch an entirely new biopsy tool named Brevera next year. Brevera has breakthrough potential as it allows real-time analysis of the biopsy sample, thereby vastly improving the patient experience. Stay tuned for more information on this. 
Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me conclude by saying that we are pleased with our second quarter financial results, which in some ways opened a new chapter in the Hologic story. As in recent quarters, our commercial teams generated robust growth in the United States. At the same time, we generated operating leverage through productivity improvements, while simultaneously investing for the future. And we boosted our bottom line performance by opportunistically deploying capital. All in all, a solid, well-rounded performance. 
Now I will hand the call over to Bob"
108544,329827217,965179,"Hologic Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Hologic, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I am going to highlight our other divisional sales drivers, then some key financial metrics and then wrap up with our updated financial guidance for 2016. Unless otherwise noted, my rema",1837,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I am going to highlight our other divisional sales drivers, then some key financial metrics and then wrap up with our updated financial guidance for 2016. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. Overall, we had a strong second quarter, with double-digit growth in the U.S. In addition, 3 of our 4 businesses demonstrated global growth in the quarter. Steve already discussed Breast Health and Surgical, so I will focus on Diagnostics and Skeletal. Diagnostics, our largest business, reported sales of $304.4 million in the second quarter, growing 3.2% in constant-currency terms. We're pleased to report another positive quarter on our cytology and perinatal business, which generated $116.1 million in sales, growing 3.5% in constant currency. U.S. sales grew mid-single digits, which was by far our highest growth in several years, even with lingering headwinds from Pap interval expansion. 
Turning to the molecular diagnostics. We posted sales of $126.1 million, up 5.8% in constant currency. Domestic sales increased at a faster rate as our fully automated Panther system continues to accumulate new placements and competitive wins. In addition, utilization and sales of our assays for Trichomonas, HPV and chlamydia and gonorrhea continue to grow. Internationally, we had another solid quarter of Panther placements. This keeps us optimistic about our future growth potential in Europe, where we now have a full menu of women's health and viral load assays, as Steve mentioned. In blood screening, worldwide revenue of $62.2 million, decreased 2.4% in constant currency, as expected. While there were some geography shifts as our partner Grifols balanced inventory, the overall decline was mainly due to stronger ordering in the prior year period to support the rollout of our business with the Japanese Red Cross. We do continue to see, however, trends towards lower blood utilization worldwide, and therefore, anticipate that quarterly blood screening sales will settle in the mid-$50 million range as the market and customer usage patterns mature. 
In Skeletal Health, we had $22.2 million in global sales, a decline of 8.2% in constant currency. Domestically, sales increased at a low single-digit rate, but international sales were negatively affected by distributor ordering patterns. Because this business is so small, it is not uncommon to see these kinds of fluctuations, and we do expect that Skeletal will be a solid contributor to growth over time. 
Now let me switch gears and discuss operating expenses in the second quarter. Total expenses of $221.2 million, increased 12.9%, mainly as a result of our continued investments in Breast Health and diagnostic marketing programs, along with the timing of R&D programs which we foreshadowed last quarter. This increase in spending, which will continue into the second half of the year, is planned and deliberate, and a key component of our strategy to generate long-term sustainable growth. Two factors contribute to our willingness to support these incremental investments. First, and most importantly, we see good returns on the specific projects we're pursuing. For example, our investments in consumer marketing for Genius are enabling us to gain market share, while maintaining stable price in the face of new competition. Second, we already have an industry-leading operating margin and have shown that we can and will increase this margin over time. But our goal is not to drive operating margins to unprecedented levels for our industry. Instead, we want to steadily improve them, while also investing appropriately in DCF-positive projects for long-term growth. At the same time, our goal is to allocate capital to enhance shareholder returns, and during the second quarter, we accelerated our efforts in this regard. For the last few years, our primary use of excess cash has been to pay down debt, and our longstanding goal of reducing net debt to 2.5x EBITDA by the end of 2017 remains in effect. As evidence of this, we spent $311.4 million in the second quarter to repurchase convertible notes with the principal value of $226.6 million. While our convertible debt totaled over $1.3 billion in principle less than 12 months ago, it is now down to $793.3 million, a reduction of more than $0.5 billion. And given the continuing strength of our cash flows, we are in a position to supplement debt reduction with opportunistic repurchases of our common stock. Specifically in the second quarter, we bought back 4.3 million shares of our stock for $148.8 million. While stock buybacks have always been part of our long-term plan, market weakness in the second quarter enabled us to pounce a little earlier than expected. These strategic actions enabled us to sequentially reduce our share count in the second quarter, the first time in a long while that our diluted share count declined. In fact, diluted shares outstanding of 288 million were basically flat compared to the prior year period, no longer diluting EPS growth. Specifically, non-GAAP EPS increased 14.6%, about 2.5x the rate of sales. 
Let me just emphasize that our debt reduction and buyback activities will not prohibit us from seeking out opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions. Our divisional business development teams are settling in, and while no transactions are imminent, we are actively evaluating opportunities across our businesses. 
Before I move on to guidance, let me cover a few other financial metrics from the second quarter. Improvements made to our balance sheet contributed to a total debt outstanding of $3.4 billion, a decrease of $534.1 million compared to a year ago, and net debt of $3.1 billion. Our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, now stands at 3.1x. In the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $253.8 million, up 6.4% compared to the prior year period. In addition, our trailing 12-month EBITDA surpassed $1 billion this quarter, a nice milestone for the company. Our ability to generate strong profits, while lowering debt, has again allowed us to increase return on invested capital. As our second fiscal quarter, ROIC was 11.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, 170 basis point improvement over the prior year. 
Finally, let's turn to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and third quarter. Starting with the full year, we are raising the low end of our revenue guidance by $10 million to reflect the solid performance in the first half of the year. We now expect reported revenue of $2.81 billion to $2.83 billion in fiscal 2016, representing reported growth of 3.9% to 4.6%. Based on recent exchange rates, this equates to constant-currency growth of between 4.6% and 5.4%. Compared to our last guidance, there are a few puts and takes related to revenue. On the positive side, the market withdrawal of a competing surgical products should provide a tailwind to NovaSure, and the dollar has weakened slightly. The currency benefit for us is less than you might expect, however, since much of the dollar weakening has been relative to the Japanese yen and other currencies where we have minimal exposure. In terms of headwinds, we are more cautious on near-term blood screening revenue given macro trends in the market, and we've derisked our international forecast slightly. I should also mention we have made a voluntary decision to stop selling CF InPlex, our test for cystic fibrosis, due to manufacturing quality issues at a key component supplier that recently resulted in a recall. This will represent a headwind of several million dollars to our U.S. molecular diagnostics revenue in the second half of the year, but shouldn't have much effect on margins. 
In terms of earnings for the full year, we now expect EPS of between $1.89 and $1.91, which translates to reported growth between 13.2% and 14.4%, or constant-currency growth of 14.6% to 15.8%. This is based on an effective tax rate of approximately 33% and diluted shares outstanding of roughly $292 million for the full year. As you work through your models, you will see that our increased EPS guidance implies a healthy expansion of already industry-leading operating margins, while accommodating increased investment. Specifically, we intend to continue investing behind our Genius campaign in Breast Health and cervical cancer co-testing in Diagnostics. We will aggressively fund the commercial activities to launch important new products, such as our Affirm prone biopsy system, and capitalize on the competitive investment environment surrounding NovaSure. We also expect to make some key hires in our international business, which typically come in with initial sign-on costs for relocation and the like. And we are pursuing some entirely new R&D initiatives, such as developing a blood screening test for the Zika virus, while also seeking out opportunities to accelerate R&D time lines for existing initiatives, for example, by increasing the breadth of outside support. Not all of these investments are permanent in nature, but we do expect them to push operating expenses upward in the second half of the year. At the same time, however, our capital deployment activities are effectively offsetting the impact of these strategic investments on the bottom line. 
Now turning to guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenues of $695 million to $705 million. Compared to the prior year period, this range reflects a reported growth of 0.2% to 1.6% or 0.6% to 2% on a constant-currency basis. As a reminder, these lower growth rates are due to a much tougher comparable in the prior year period when revenue jumped almost $40 million on a sequential basis. In terms of the bottom line, we forecast diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47 to $0.48 in the third quarter. This represents continued strong growth of 9.3% to 11.6% on a reported basis or 10.1% to 12.4% in constant-currency terms. Our full year guidance obviously implies a sequential step up in the fourth quarter revenue. This is due to normal sequential business momentum that we expect, contributions from new product launches and the timing of some royalty revenue that is expected later this year. 
Before opening up the call for questions, I would like to reiterate that our view on the second quarter is one of a good multilevel execution. Revenue grew at a solid rate based on continued outperformance domestically and stabilization outside the United States. We improved already strong operating margins, while accommodating increased investment in key growth drivers. And our capital deployment activities helped to pay for these investments at the EPS line, while setting the stage for leveraged growth over the long term. 
Now that we're halfway through our fiscal year, we're optimistic about our full year forecast. We're anticipating solid mid-single-digit revenue growth in line with our original expectations as strength in the U.S. offsets the weakness we have seen internationally. We forecast solid expansion of operating margins, while simultaneously investing for the future, and we expect the acceleration of our capital redeployment activities to allow us to leverage operating gains all the way down to EPS, which should grow at a mid-teens rate. 
With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions."

I think -- if you go back 2 years, and I described it at that time that we probably saw it building as a freight train, clearly, I think the combination of better reimbursement and especially our consumer marketing efforts and our own sales efforts really dramatically accelerated that, and instead of a freight train, it definitely looked more like an airplane, I think, taking off.

And the demand still looks very good. Having said that, we're going against obviously now as we go into this third quarter. We're going against the huge comps and therefore, again as we try to signal in July of last year, the absolute growth rates will probably be slower here for the U.S. Breast Health business, certainly as we go into the coming quarters.

We have been very focused on what happened with the 2D curve and everything else, and by thinking about how we extend out and do some line extensions and other things, that's been a huge part of our focus to be able to have more of a plateau where a very soft decline in that segment of the business at some point of time as opposed to a real cliff. I think it's part of what we have coming. I think is in biopsy and frankly, Pete Valenti is running that business for us. He has had a long good track record of being able to put even some singles and doubles on the board in addition to just the every 5 or 8 year homerun that we've tended to have in this business. So I would tell you I'm feeling incrementally better. Everytime Bob and I and Eric Compton are down meeting with that business on what's happening in our pipeline, and we'll talk more and more about that certainly in the coming quarters and years. But I think we're feeling better about being able to mitigate that. The other piece, I just want to jump back even on your question on margin to Bob, because you know I was very adamant early on when I came, I was probably not expecting much margin expansion. This has been one of the very positive surprises to me, and I think the big piece that I want to be clear on is we're going to use a lot of this gross margin expansion to continue to invest into the business, which leads to the second part of your follow-up question there, which is as we go forward, we're certainly spending more on R&D, more on marketing and it will allow us to do tuck-in acquisitions based on the cash generation. And so I think we're really opening up a new leg in the stool where we've got more levers available to us than we did 2 years ago. Two years ago, we were still hamstrung with debt and the converts and everything else. We didn't have really an ability to potentially manage, because as we all know, we're going to see some ups and downs in the rate of sales growth. We're going to continue to grow. We are going to have some periods where it will be a little bit slower, while we wait for the next new products to come through. I think we're feeling better and better that we're going to be able to deliver very strong earnings growth consistently, and in the periods when we're growing faster, we'll probably reinvest a little bit more into the periods that are slower. We may not have quite the accelerated investments in that time. So hopefully, that will start to give a little more of longer-term of what we're thinking about."

I think if we look, Jack, at the global market, let's take it by U.S. The U.S., clearly hospitals are getting better and better at managing their inventory at minimally invasive surgery, at being able to limit their use of blood. So I think we're forecasting that the U.S. is a slight decliner. This quarter, our U.S. business was actually up fairly significantly in blood, that was more an inventory correction. But I think the way we're thinking about it is this is a low single-digit decliner. Internationally, I think we see the business very slight grower, but globally, I think because of the declines in the U.S., we think about blood screening as a flattish to slightly down business. And that's -- you go back to the headwinds we had as a company facing us a few years ago. It was blood, it was NovaSure, it was MyoSure -- I'm sorry, it was blood, NovaSure and ThinPrep. The 2 that we control the commercial channel, feel great about changing the long-term trajectory. I don't think we're quite as ready to declare a change in the trajectory of blood screening."

The strength of our",1801,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2016. We posted very good results overall, highlighted by 14.6% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. The strength of our business model was evident on 3 levels in the quarter. First, our U.S. businesses grew revenue at a low double-digit rate, continuing a recent pattern of outstanding commercial execution. Second, we again improved both gross and operating margins, while making significant investments in our future. And third, we entered a new phase of our capital allocation strategy by repurchasing our common stock, while continuing to pay down our convertible notes. Together, these strategic actions drove EPS growth more than double the rate of sales. More specifically, domestic revenue increased 10.6% in the quarter, led by strong performances by our Breast Health and Surgical businesses. International sales were lower, mainly due to expected declines in blood screening and the discontinued products we discussed in our initial guidance. But international Breast Health showed signs of stabilization, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Globally, total revenues grew 5.8% on a reported basis or 6.3% in constant-currency terms. And if we were to exclude the headwind from discontinued products, second quarter revenue would have increased more than 7% in constant-currency. Non-GAAP gross margin was 65.8% in the quarter, a significant improvement of 240 basis points compared to the prior year period. We reinvested much of this incremental profitability for future growth and will continue to do so in the future, but still increased non-GAAP operating margin to 33.9% in the quarter, 40 basis points higher than last year. At the same time, our strong cash flows enabled us to be opportunistic in buying back our common stock, as well as our convertible debt to continue improving our capital structure and to enhance future earnings power. Bob will cover the details in a moment, but net income represented a very robust 19.6% of sales and grew 14.1%, while non-GAAP EPS totaled $0.47, up 14.6% compared to the prior year. 
With that introduction and overview out of the way, I'd like to cover 5 subjects in my comments today. The first 2 have been topical over the last quarter, our domestic and international Breast Health businesses, and obviously, these franchises will continue to be important to our future as well. But as we write new chapters in the Hologic story, the discourse is broadening as we build on our successes and add new strategic tools. With that in mind, today I'd like to highlight our Surgical business, gross margin improvement opportunities and the research and development pipeline. Hopefully, this discussion will provide a little incremental color into the multiple levers we can pull to generate sustainable revenue and earnings growth over time. 
Let's start with our domestic Breast Health business, which grew a very solid 11.2% based on continued adoption of our Genius 3D Mammography systems. Genius placements were strong, increasing both sequentially and year-over-year, and we saw a good increase in service revenue as well. We continue to gain market share, and our investments in customer marketing are enabling us to do that, while maintaining stable prices amid fierce competition. As a result, domestic imaging sales grew at a healthy mid-teens rate. We believe we still have runway ahead of us as our 3D systems are only about 1/3 penetrated into our own installed base, and roughly 20% into the market as a whole. We remain confident in the long-term opportunity as customer interest and orders in-house remain high, and as clinical evidence continues to mount on the benefits of Hologic's exams for patients and physicians. Specifically, a longitudinal study published in February in the peer-review journal, JAMA Oncology, showed that the benefits of our Genius exams, fewer recalls and improved cancer detection can be sustained and even improved over time with consecutive use. In addition, a separate study published just yesterday in JAMA showed that these benefits hold true for women with both dense and non-dense breasts, further bolstering the case for widespread adoption. 
Now let's turn to our international Breast Health business, which generated a lot of attention last quarter. While we still have a significant amount of work to do here, we do see signs of stabilization in the second quarter and are optimistic that we will see further signs of progress and predictability in the quarters ahead. While revenue declined by low single digits on a constant-currency basis in the second quarter, it's important to note that last year's results benefited from sales of products that we have since discontinued. If we back out this headwind, international Breast Health sales would have increased at a mid-single-digit rate in constant currency, a materially better performance than the decline we saw last quarter. As always, business improvement starts with people, and our Chief Operating Officer, Eric Compton, has made several important organizational changes internationally in recent months. We moved one of our key U.S. Breast Health leaders to Europe, and he is now in charge of building stronger, mutually productive relationships with our dealer network. Toward that end, we have signed several new performance-based contracts with our top dealers. In addition, we've hired a new European head of service, which we have identified as a critical role to support our dealers and direct customers. We also have brought on new leaders of marketing, molecular diagnostics, surgical and regulatory. So the team is coming together nicely. 
Now let me turn to those 3 new topics: Surgical, gross margins and R&D. Let's cover Surgical first. Global sales were $90.9 million in the quarter and grew 15.9% in constant currency. Surgical has exemplified the tremendous commercial turnaround that has occurred at Hologic, with the second quarter representing the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in the United States. It wasn't too long ago that surgical was viewed as a non-strategic asset that should be divested. Today, however, surgical is a vibrant business with strong profitability and cash flows plus good growth potential, and I couldn't be prouder of the team who has made it happen. Their formula for success has been straightforward: stabilization of our NovaSure franchise, which was declining at a high single-digit rate only a couple of years ago, combined with excellent growth from our MyoSure products for uterine fibroid removal. We remain enthusiastic about the potential for MyoSure as we seek to expand the addressable market and replace older treatments. And now, with the market withdrawal of a competitor to NovaSure, we have an opportunity to drive material growth for that product as well. We believe that NovaSure sales benefited from the competitive recall by a few million dollars in the quarter, and we are investing in marketing and physician outreach programs to ensure that this continues for the balance of the year. 
The second topic I want to cover is our ability to improve gross margins. A year ago, we weren't overly bullish in this regard, but our operations team deserves a tremendous amount of credit for improving upon already strong profitability. To highlight what we've been able to achieve, in the second quarter  non-GAAP cost of goods sold for our products was lower in absolute terms than it was in the prior year period despite an increase in sales. This is far bigger than a mix shift story. It is reflecting tremendous work by our teams. To make this possible, new leadership has instituted productivity improvement targets for each of our plants, and local managers have responded with scores of specific projects. We are closing our Bedford facility, our former corporate headquarters, and moving the skeletal manufacturing that was done there to a contract manufacturer. And as we have discussed previously, we are doing a much better job of leveraging our corporate purchasing power across the business. 
The third area I want to discuss is our research and development pipeline, and it's important to begin with a bit of context. The unfortunate truth is that our R&D pipeline was weak, reflecting years of a growth by acquisition mindset. Too often, R&D spending was viewed as a plug in the income statement; the amount that was left over, while attempting to meet short-term financial goals. To reverse this mentality, we have been adding talent and rebuilding processes across the company to make R&D a driver of sustainable growth again. Although this process is far from complete, we are beginning to see the fruits of our labor. In diagnostics, for example, we now have a robust menu of molecular assays available on Panther in Europe, spanning women's health as well as virology. Recently, we have secured CE-marks for new tests for HIV-1, hepatitis C, hepatitis B and a sexually transmitted disease called Mycoplasma genitalium. In the United States, we are already the leader in women's health. We have filed the premarket approval application for our HIV viral load assay, and the PMA for our hepatitis C assay is scheduled to be submitted late this calendar year. Finally, our Panther Fusion platform, which will provide customers the flexibility to perform PCR testing in a single-unit-dose format, is on track to be introduced internationally next year. 
In Surgical, we are now in the process of launching a line extension called MyoSure Reach. MyoSure Reach increases clinical utility by providing surgeons access to polyps and fibroids in more areas of the uterus, and we believe it will play an important role in extending our leadership position in the field. Finally, in Breast Health, we are excited about 2 new biopsy products that will further build on our position as the innovative leader in the market. Our new 3D-enabled Affirm prone biopsy system was introduced in Europe in March and is being launched domestically now. Affirm represents the first real innovation in the biopsy space in roughly 20 years and leverages our growing installed base of Genius systems by enabling physicians to perform a more accurate biopsy using 3D technology. To further enhance our biopsy business, we expect to launch an entirely new biopsy tool named Brevera next year. Brevera has breakthrough potential as it allows real-time analysis of the biopsy sample, thereby vastly improving the patient experience. Stay tuned for more information on this. 
Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me conclude by saying that we are pleased with our second quarter financial results, which in some ways opened a new chapter in the Hologic story. As in recent quarters, our commercial teams generated robust growth in the United States. At the same time, we generated operating leverage through productivity improvements, while simultaneously investing for the future. And we boosted our bottom line performance by opportunistically deploying capital. All in all, a solid, well-rounded performance. 
Now I will hand the call over to Bob."
108544,329827217,965257,"Hologic Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Hologic, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I am going to highlight our other divisional sales drivers, then some key financial metrics and then wrap up with our updated financial guidance for 2016. Unless otherwise noted, my rema",1863,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I am going to highlight our other divisional sales drivers, then some key financial metrics and then wrap up with our updated financial guidance for 2016. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. Overall, we had a strong second quarter, with double-digit growth in the U.S. In addition, 3 of our 4 businesses demonstrated global growth in the quarter. Steve already discussed Breast Health and Surgical, so I will focus on Diagnostics and Skeletal. Diagnostics, our largest business, reported sales of $304.4 million in the second quarter, growing 3.2% in constant currency terms. We're pleased to report another positive quarter on our cytology and perinatal business, which generated $116.1 million in sales, growing 3.5% in constant currency. U.S. sales grew mid-single digits, which was by far our highest growth in several years, even with lingering headwinds from Pap interval expansion. 
Turning to the molecular diagnostics. We posted sales of $126.1 million, up 5.8% in constant currency. Domestic sales increased at a faster rate as our fully automated Panther system continues to accumulate new placements and competitive wins. In addition, utilization and sales of our assays for Trichomonas, HPV and chlamydia and gonorrhea continue to grow. Internationally, we had another solid quarter of Panther placements. This keeps us optimistic about our future growth potential in Europe, where we now have a full menu of women's health and viral load assays, as Steve mentioned. In blood screening, worldwide revenue of $62.2 million, decreased 2.4% in constant currency, as expected. While there were some geography shifts as our partner Grifols balanced inventory, the overall decline was mainly due to stronger ordering in the prior year period to support the rollout of our business with the Japanese Red Cross. We do continue to see, however, trends towards lower blood utilization worldwide, and therefore, anticipate that quarterly blood screening sales will settle in the mid-$50 million range as the market and customer usage patterns mature. 
In Skeletal Health, we had $22.2 million in global sales, a decline of 8.2% in constant currency. Domestically, sales increased at a low single-digit rate, but international sales were negatively affected by distributor ordering patterns. Because this business is so small, it is not uncommon to see these kinds of fluctuations, and we do expect that Skeletal will be a solid contributor to growth over time. 
Now let me switch gears and discuss operating expenses in the second quarter. Total expenses of $221.2 million increased 12.9%, mainly as a result of our continued investments in Breast Health and diagnostic marketing programs, along with the timing of R&D programs which we foreshadowed last quarter. This increase in spending, which will continue into the second half of the year, is planned and deliberate, and a key component of our strategy to generate long-term sustainable growth. Two factors contribute to our willingness to support these incremental investments. First, and most importantly, we see good returns on the specific projects we're pursuing. For example, our investments in consumer marketing for Genius are enabling us to gain market share, while maintaining stable price in the face of new competition. Second, we already have an industry-leading operating margin and have shown that we can and will increase this margin over time. But our goal is not to drive operating margins to unprecedented levels for our industry. Instead, we want to steadily improve them, while also investing appropriately in DCF-positive projects for long-term growth. At the same time, our goal is to allocate capital to enhance shareholder returns, and during the second quarter, we accelerated our efforts in this regard. For the last few years, our primary use of excess cash has been to pay down debt, and our longstanding goal of reducing net debt to 2.5x EBITDA by the end of 2017 remains in effect. As evidence of this, we spent $311.4 million in the second quarter to repurchase convertible notes with the principal value of $226.6 million. While our convertible debt totaled over $1.3 billion in principle less than 12 months ago, it is now down to $793.3 million, a reduction of more than $0.5 billion. And given the continuing strength of our cash flows, we are in a position to supplement debt reduction with opportunistic repurchases of our common stock. Specifically in the second quarter, we bought back 4.3 million shares of our stock for $148.8 million. While stock buybacks have always been part of our long-term plan, market weakness in the second quarter enabled us to pounce a little earlier than expected. These strategic actions enabled us to sequentially reduce our share count in the second quarter, the first time in a long while that our diluted share count declined. In fact, diluted shares outstanding of 288 million were basically flat compared to the prior year period, no longer diluting EPS growth. Specifically, non-GAAP EPS increased 14.6%, about 2.5x the rate of sales. 
Let me just emphasize that our debt reduction and buyback activities will not prohibit us from seeking out opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions. Our divisional business development teams are settling in, and while no transactions are imminent, we are actively evaluating opportunities across our businesses. 
Before I move on to guidance, let me cover a few other financial metrics from the second quarter. Improvements made to our balance sheet contributed to a total debt outstanding of $3.4 billion, a decrease of $534.1 million compared to a year ago, and net debt of $3.1 billion. Our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, now stands at 3.1x. In the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $253.8 million, up 6.4% compared to the prior year period. In addition, our trailing 12-month EBITDA surpassed $1 billion this quarter, a nice milestone for the company. Our ability to generate strong profits, while lowering debt, has again allowed us to increase return on invested capital. As our second fiscal quarter, ROIC was 11.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, 170 basis point improvement over the prior year. 
Finally, let's turn to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and third quarter. Starting with the full year, we are raising the low end of our revenue guidance by $10 million to reflect the solid performance in the first half of the year. We now expect reported revenue of $2.81 billion to $2.83 billion in fiscal 2016, representing reported growth of 3.9% to 4.6%. Based on recent exchange rates, this equates to constant currency growth of between 4.6% and 5.4%. Compared to our last guidance, there are a few puts and takes related to revenue. On the positive side, the market withdrawal of a competing surgical products should provide a tailwind to NovaSure, and the dollar has weakened slightly. The currency benefit for us is less than you might expect, however, since much of the dollar weakening has been relative to the Japanese yen and other currencies where we have minimal exposure. 
In terms of headwinds, we are more cautious on near-term blood screening revenue given macro trends in the market, and we've derisked our international forecast slightly. I should also mention we have made a voluntary decision to stop selling CF InPlex, our test for cystic fibrosis, due to manufacturing quality issues at a key component supplier that recently resulted in a recall. This will represent a headwind of several million dollars to our U.S. molecular diagnostics revenue in the second half of the year, but shouldn't have much effect on margins. 
In terms of earnings for the full year, we now expect EPS of between $1.89 and $1.91, which translates to reported growth between 13.2% and 14.4%, or constant currency growth of 14.6% to 15.8%. This is based on an effective tax rate of approximately 33% and diluted shares outstanding of roughly $292 million for the full year. As you work through your models, you will see that our increased EPS guidance implies a healthy expansion of already industry-leading operating margins, while accommodating increased investment. Specifically, we intend to continue investing behind our Genius campaign in Breast Health and cervical cancer co-testing in Diagnostics. We will aggressively fund commercial activities to launch important new products, such as our Affirm prone biopsy system, and capitalize on the competitive investment environment surrounding NovaSure. We also expect to make some key hires in our international business, which typically come in with initial sign-on costs for relocation and the like. And we are pursuing some entirely new R&D initiatives, such as developing a blood screening test for the Zika virus, while also seeking out opportunities to accelerate R&D time lines for existing initiatives; for example, by increasing the breadth of outside support. Not all of these investments are permanent in nature, but we do expect them to push operating expenses upward in the second half of the year. At the same time, however, our capital deployment activities are effectively offsetting the impact of these strategic investments on the bottom line. 
Now turning to guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenues of $695 million to $705 million. Compared to the prior year period, this range reflects a reported growth of 0.2% to 1.6% or 0.6% to 2% on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, these lower growth rates are due to a much tougher comparable in the prior year period when revenue jumped almost $40 million on a sequential basis. In terms of the bottom line, we forecast diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47 to $0.48 in the third quarter. This represents continued strong growth of 9.3% to 11.6% on a reported basis or 10.1% to 12.4% in constant-currency terms. Our full year guidance obviously implies a sequential step up in the fourth quarter revenue. This is due to normal sequential business momentum that we expect, contributions from new product launches and the timing of some royalty revenue that is expected later this year. 
Before opening up the call for questions, I would like to reiterate that our view on the second quarter is one of a good multilevel execution. Revenue grew at a solid rate based on continued outperformance domestically and stabilization outside the United States. We improved already strong operating margins, while accommodating increased investment in key growth drivers. And our capital deployment activities helped to pay for these investments at the EPS line, while setting the stage for leveraged growth over the long term. 
Now that we're halfway through our fiscal year, we're optimistic about our full year forecast. We're anticipating solid mid-single-digit revenue growth in line with our original expectations as strength in the U.S. offsets the weakness we have seen internationally. We forecast solid expansion of operating margins, while simultaneously investing for the future, and we expect the acceleration of our capital redeployment activities to allow us to leverage operating gains all the way down to EPS, which should grow at a mid-teens rate. 
With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. 
Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. 
Operator, we are ready for the first question."

Having said that, we're going against obviously -- now as we go into this third quarter, we're going against the huge comps and therefore, again as we try to signal in July of last year, the absolute growth rates will probably be slower here for the U.S. Breast Health business, certainly as we go into the coming quarters.

Our operations teams are really executing well, and identifying opportunities to continue to improve efficiencies, and obviously, as our sales growth drives more units to the factory, that also helps as well."

First of all, I'm going to try to sway you from using the word ""cliff"" because we have been working very hard to make sure that it won't be a cliff, and I say that in all seriousness. We have been very focused on what happened with the 2D curve and everything else, and by thinking about how we extend out and do some line extensions and other things, that's been a huge part of our focus to be able to have more of a plateau or a very soft decline in that segment of the business at some point of time as opposed to a real cliff. I think it's part of what we have coming, things in biopsy and, frankly, Pete Valenti is running that business for us. He has had a long good track record of being able to put even some singles and doubles on the board in addition to just the every 5 or 8 year home run that we've tended to have in this business. So I would tell you I'm feeling incrementally better. Every time Bob and I and Eric Compton are down meeting with that business on what's happening in their pipeline, and we'll talk more and more about that certainly in the coming quarters and years. But I think we're feeling better about being able to mitigate that. 
The other piece -- I just want to jump back even on your question on margin to Bob, because you know I was very adamant early on when I came. I was probably not expecting much margin expansion. This has been one of the very positive surprises to me, and I think the big piece that I want to be clear on is we're going to use a lot of this gross margin expansion to continue to invest into the business, which leads to the second part of your follow-up question there, which is as we go forward, we're certainly spending more on R&D, more on marketing and it will allow us to do tuck-in acquisitions based on the cash generation. And so I think we're really opening up a new leg in the stool where we've got more levers available to us than we did 2 years ago. Two years ago, we were so hamstrung with the debt and the converts and everything else, we didn't have really an ability to potentially manage, because as we all know, we're going to see some ups and downs in the rate of sales growth. We're going to continue to grow. We are going to have some periods where it will be a little bit slower, while we wait for the next new products to come through. I think we're feeling better and better that we're going to be able to deliver very strong earnings growth consistently. And in the periods when we're growing faster, we'll probably reinvest a little bit more into the periods that are slower. We may not have quite the accelerated investments in that time. So hopefully, that should start to give a little more of a longer-term view of what we're thinking about."

I think if we look, Jack, at the global market, let's take it by U.S. The U.S. -- clearly, hospitals are getting better and better at managing their inventory at minimally invasive surgery, at being able to limit their use of blood.

But I think the way we're thinking about it is this is a low single-digit decliner. Internationally, I think we see the business very slight grower, but globally, I think because of the declines in the U.S., we think about blood screening as a flattish to slightly down business. And that's -- you go back to the headwinds we had as a company facing us a few years ago. It was blood, it was NovaSure, it was MyoSure -- I'm sorry, it was blood, NovaSure and ThinPrep.

We posted very good results overall, highlighted by 14.6% growth in non-GAAP earnings per share. The strength of our business model was evident on 3 levels in the quarter. First, our U.S. businesses grew revenue at a low double-digit rate, continuing a recent pattern of outstanding commercial execution. Second, we again improved both gross and operating margins, while making significant investments in our future. And third, we entered a new phase of our capital allocation strategy by repurchasing our common stock, while continuing to pay down our convertible notes. Together, these strategic actions drove EPS growth more than double the rate of sales. More specifically, domestic revenue increased 10.6% in the quarter, led by strong performances by our Breast Health and Surgical businesses. International sales were lower, mainly due to expected declines in blood screening and the discontinued products we discussed in our initial guidance. But international Breast Health showed signs of stabilization, which I'll discuss in a moment. 
Globally, total revenues grew 5.8% on a reported basis or 6.3% in constant-currency terms. And if we were to exclude the headwind from discontinued products, second quarter revenue would have increased more than 7% in constant-currency. Non-GAAP gross margin was 65.8% in the quarter, a significant improvement of 240 basis points compared to the prior year period. We reinvested much of this incremental profitability for future growth and will continue to do so in the future, but still increased non-GAAP operating margin to 33.9% in the quarter, 40 basis points higher than last year. At the same time, our strong cash flows enabled us to be opportunistic in buying back our common stock, as well as our convertible debt to continue improving our capital structure and to enhance future earnings power. Bob will cover the details in a moment, but net income represented a very robust 19.6% of sales and grew 14.1%, while non-GAAP EPS totaled $0.47, up 14.6% compared to the prior year. 
With that introduction and overview out of the way, I'd like to cover 5 subjects in my comments today. The first 2 have been topical over the last quarter, our domestic and international Breast Health businesses, and obviously, these franchises will continue to be important to our future as well. But as we write new chapters in the Hologic story, the discourse is broadening as we build on our successes and add new strategic tools. With that in mind, today I'd like to highlight our Surgical business, gross margin improvement opportunities and the research and development pipeline. Hopefully, this discussion will provide a little incremental color into the multiple levers we can pull to generate sustainable revenue and earnings growth over time. 
Let's start with our domestic Breast Health business, which grew a very solid 11.2% based on continued adoption of our Genius 3D Mammography systems. Genius placements were strong, increasing both sequentially and year-over-year, and we saw a good increase in service revenue as well. We continue to gain market share, and our investments in customer marketing are enabling us to do that, while maintaining stable prices amid fierce competition. As a result, domestic imaging sales grew at a healthy mid-teens rate. We believe we still have runway ahead of us as our 3D systems are only about 1/3 penetrated into our own installed base, and roughly 20% into the market as a whole. We remain confident in the long-term opportunity as customer interest and orders in-house remain high, and as clinical evidence continues to mount on the benefits of Hologic's exams for patients and physicians. Specifically, a longitudinal study published in February in the peer-review journal, JAMA Oncology, showed that the benefits of our Genius exams, fewer recalls and improved cancer detection can be sustained and even improved over time with consecutive use. In addition, a separate study published just yesterday in JAMA showed that these benefits hold true for women with both dense and non-dense breasts, further bolstering the case for widespread adoption. 
Now let's turn to our international Breast Health business, which generated a lot of attention last quarter. While we still have a significant amount of work to do here, we do see signs of stabilization in the second quarter and are optimistic that we will see further signs of progress and predictability in the quarters ahead. While revenue declined by low single digits on a constant-currency basis in the second quarter, it's important to note that last year's results benefited from sales of products that we have since discontinued. If we back out this headwind, international Breast Health sales would have increased at a mid-single-digit rate in constant currency, a materially better performance than the decline we saw last quarter. As always, business improvement starts with people, and our Chief Operating Officer, Eric Compton, has made several important organizational changes internationally in recent months. We moved one of our key U.S. Breast Health leaders to Europe, and he is now in charge of building stronger, mutually productive relationships with our dealer network. Toward that end, we have signed several new performance-based contracts with our top dealers. In addition, we've hired a new European head of service, which we have identified as a critical role to support our dealers and direct customers. We also have brought on new leaders of marketing, molecular diagnostics, surgical and regulatory. So the team is coming together nicely. 
Now let me turn to those 3 new topics: Surgical, gross margins and R&D. Let's cover Surgical first. Global sales were $90.9 million in the quarter and grew 15.9% in constant currency. Surgical has exemplified the tremendous commercial turnaround that has occurred at Hologic, with the second quarter representing the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in the United States. It wasn't too long ago that surgical was viewed as a non-strategic asset that should be divested. Today, however, surgical is a vibrant business with strong profitability and cash flows plus good growth potential, and I couldn't be prouder of the team who has made it happen. Their formula for success has been straightforward: stabilization of our NovaSure franchise, which was declining at a high single-digit rate only a couple of years ago, combined with excellent growth from our MyoSure products for uterine fibroid removal. We remain enthusiastic about the potential for MyoSure as we seek to expand the addressable market and replace older treatments. And now, with the market withdrawal of a competitor to NovaSure, we have an opportunity to drive material growth for that product as well. We believe that NovaSure sales benefited from the competitive recall by a few million dollars in the quarter, and we are investing in marketing and physician outreach programs to ensure that this continues for the balance of the year. 
The second topic I want to cover is our ability to improve gross margins. A year ago, we weren't overly bullish in this regard, but our operations team deserves a tremendous amount of credit for improving upon already strong profitability. To highlight what we've been able to achieve, in the second quarter non-GAAP cost of goods sold for our products was lower in absolute terms than it was in the prior year period despite an increase in sales. This is far bigger than a mix shift story. It is reflecting tremendous work by our teams. To make this possible, new leadership has instituted productivity improvement targets for each of our plants, and local managers have responded with scores of specific projects. We are closing our Bedford facility, our former corporate headquarters, and moving the skeletal manufacturing that was done there to a contract manufacturer. And as we have discussed previously, we are doing a much better job of leveraging our corporate purchasing power across the business. 
The third area I want to discuss is our research and development pipeline, and it's important to begin with a bit of context. The unfortunate truth is that our R&D pipeline was weak, reflecting years of a growth by acquisition mindset. Too often, R&D spending was viewed as a plug in the income statement; the amount that was left over, while attempting to meet short-term financial goals. To reverse this mentality, we have been adding talent and rebuilding processes across the company to make R&D a driver of sustainable growth again. Although this process is far from complete, we are beginning to see the fruits of our labor. In diagnostics, for example, we now have a robust menu of molecular assays available on Panther in Europe, spanning women's health as well as virology. Recently, we have secured CE-marks for new tests for HIV-1, hepatitis C, hepatitis B and a sexually transmitted disease called Mycoplasma genitalium. In the United States, we are already the leader in women's health. We have filed the premarket approval application for our HIV viral load assay, and the PMA for our hepatitis C assay is scheduled to be submitted late this calendar year. Finally, our Panther Fusion platform, which will provide customers the flexibility to perform PCR testing in a single-unit-dose format, is on track to be introduced internationally next year. 
In Surgical, we are now in the process of launching a line extension called MyoSure Reach. MyoSure Reach increases clinical utility by providing surgeons access to polyps and fibroids in more areas of the uterus, and we believe it will play an important role in extending our leadership position in the field. Finally, in Breast Health, we are excited about 2 new biopsy products that will further build on our position as the innovative leader in the market. Our new 3D-enabled Affirm prone biopsy system was introduced in Europe in March and is being launched domestically now. Affirm represents the first real innovation in the biopsy space in roughly 20 years and leverages our growing installed base of Genius systems by enabling physicians to perform a more accurate biopsy using 3D technology. To further enhance our biopsy business, we expect to launch an entirely new biopsy tool named Brevera next year. Brevera has breakthrough potential as it allows real-time analysis of the biopsy sample, thereby vastly improving the patient experience. Stay tuned for more information on this. 
Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me conclude by saying that we are pleased with our second quarter financial results, which in some ways opened a new chapter in the Hologic story. As in recent quarters, our commercial teams generated robust growth in the United States. At the same time, we generated operating leverage through productivity improvements, while simultaneously investing for the future. And we boosted our bottom line performance by opportunistically deploying capital. All in all, a solid, well-rounded performance. 
Now I will hand the call over to Bob."
108544,329827217,965927,"Hologic Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Hologic, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone.

Unless otherwise noted, my rema",1863,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I am going to highlight our other divisional sales drivers, then some key financial metrics and then wrap up with our updated financial guidance for 2016. Unless otherwise noted, my remarks will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. Overall, we had a strong second quarter, with double-digit growth in the U.S. In addition, 3 of our 4 businesses demonstrated global growth in the quarter. Steve already discussed Breast Health and Surgical, so I will focus on Diagnostics and Skeletal. Diagnostics, our largest business, reported sales of $304.4 million in the second quarter, growing 3.2% in constant currency terms. We're pleased to report another positive quarter on our cytology and perinatal business, which generated $116.1 million in sales, growing 3.5% in constant currency. U.S. sales grew mid-single digits, which was by far our highest growth in several years, even with lingering headwinds from Pap interval expansion. 
Turning to the molecular diagnostics. We posted sales of $126.1 million, up 5.8% in constant currency. Domestic sales increased at a faster rate as our fully automated Panther system continues to accumulate new placements and competitive wins. In addition, utilization and sales of our assays for Trichomonas, HPV and chlamydia and gonorrhea continue to grow. Internationally, we had another solid quarter of Panther placements. This keeps us optimistic about our future growth potential in Europe, where we now have a full menu of women's health and viral load assays, as Steve mentioned. In blood screening, worldwide revenue of $62.2 million, decreased 2.4% in constant currency, as expected. While there were some geography shifts as our partner Grifols balanced inventory, the overall decline was mainly due to stronger ordering in the prior year period to support the rollout of our business with the Japanese Red Cross. We do continue to see, however, trends towards lower blood utilization worldwide, and therefore, anticipate that quarterly blood screening sales will settle in the mid-$50 million range as the market and customer usage patterns mature. 
In Skeletal Health, we had $22.2 million in global sales, a decline of 8.2% in constant currency. Domestically, sales increased at a low single-digit rate, but international sales were negatively affected by distributor ordering patterns. Because this business is so small, it is not uncommon to see these kinds of fluctuations, and we do expect that Skeletal will be a solid contributor to growth over time. 
Now let me switch gears and discuss operating expenses in the second quarter. Total expenses of $221.2 million increased 12.9%, mainly as a result of our continued investments in Breast Health and diagnostic marketing programs, along with the timing of R&D programs which we foreshadowed last quarter. This increase in spending, which will continue into the second half of the year, is planned and deliberate, and a key component of our strategy to generate long-term sustainable growth. Two factors contribute to our willingness to support these incremental investments. First, and most importantly, we see good returns on the specific projects we're pursuing. For example, our investments in consumer marketing for Genius are enabling us to gain market share, while maintaining stable price in the face of new competition. Second, we already have an industry-leading operating margin and have shown that we can and will increase this margin over time. But our goal is not to drive operating margins to unprecedented levels for our industry. Instead, we want to steadily improve them, while also investing appropriately in DCF-positive projects for long-term growth. At the same time, our goal is to allocate capital to enhance shareholder returns, and during the second quarter, we accelerated our efforts in this regard. For the last few years, our primary use of excess cash has been to pay down debt, and our longstanding goal of reducing net debt to 2.5x EBITDA by the end of 2017 remains in effect. As evidence of this, we spent $311.4 million in the second quarter to repurchase convertible notes with the principal value of $226.6 million. While our convertible debt totaled over $1.3 billion in principle less than 12 months ago, it is now down to $793.3 million, a reduction of more than $0.5 billion. And given the continuing strength of our cash flows, we are in a position to supplement debt reduction with opportunistic repurchases of our common stock. Specifically in the second quarter, we bought back 4.3 million shares of our stock for $148.8 million. While stock buybacks have always been part of our long-term plan, market weakness in the second quarter enabled us to pounce a little earlier than expected. These strategic actions enabled us to sequentially reduce our share count in the second quarter, the first time in a long while that our diluted share count declined. In fact, diluted shares outstanding of 288 million were basically flat compared to the prior year period, no longer diluting EPS growth. Specifically, non-GAAP EPS increased 14.6%, about 2.5x the rate of sales. 
Let me just emphasize that our debt reduction and buyback activities will not prohibit us from seeking out opportunities for tuck-in acquisitions. Our divisional business development teams are settling in, and while no transactions are imminent, we are actively evaluating opportunities across our businesses. 
Before I move on to guidance, let me cover a few other financial metrics from the second quarter. Improvements made to our balance sheet contributed to a total debt outstanding of $3.4 billion, a decrease of $534.1 million compared to a year ago, and net debt of $3.1 billion. Our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, now stands at 3.1x. In the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $253.8 million, up 6.4% compared to the prior year period. In addition, our trailing 12-month EBITDA surpassed $1 billion this quarter, a nice milestone for the company. Our ability to generate strong profits, while lowering debt, has again allowed us to increase return on invested capital. As our second fiscal quarter, ROIC was 11.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, 170 basis point improvement over the prior year. 
Finally, let's turn to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full year and third quarter. Starting with the full year, we are raising the low end of our revenue guidance by $10 million to reflect the solid performance in the first half of the year. We now expect reported revenue of $2.81 billion to $2.83 billion in fiscal 2016, representing reported growth of 3.9% to 4.6%. Based on recent exchange rates, this equates to constant currency growth of between 4.6% and 5.4%. Compared to our last guidance, there are a few puts and takes related to revenue. On the positive side, the market withdrawal of a competing surgical products should provide a tailwind to NovaSure, and the dollar has weakened slightly. The currency benefit for us is less than you might expect, however, since much of the dollar weakening has been relative to the Japanese yen and other currencies where we have minimal exposure. 
In terms of headwinds, we are more cautious on near-term blood screening revenue given macro trends in the market, and we've derisked our international forecast slightly. I should also mention we have made a voluntary decision to stop selling CF InPlex, our test for cystic fibrosis, due to manufacturing quality issues at a key component supplier that recently resulted in a recall. This will represent a headwind of several million dollars to our U.S. molecular diagnostics revenue in the second half of the year, but shouldn't have much effect on margins. 
In terms of earnings for the full year, we now expect EPS of between $1.89 and $1.91, which translates to reported growth between 13.2% and 14.4%, or constant currency growth of 14.6% to 15.8%. This is based on an effective tax rate of approximately 33% and diluted shares outstanding of roughly $292 million for the full year. As you work through your models, you will see that our increased EPS guidance implies a healthy expansion of already industry-leading operating margins, while accommodating increased investment. Specifically, we intend to continue investing behind our Genius campaign in Breast Health and cervical cancer co-testing in Diagnostics. We will aggressively fund commercial activities to launch important new products, such as our Affirm prone biopsy system, and capitalize on the competitive investment environment surrounding NovaSure. We also expect to make some key hires in our international business, which typically come in with initial sign-on costs for relocation and the like. And we are pursuing some entirely new R&D initiatives, such as developing a blood screening test for the Zika virus, while also seeking out opportunities to accelerate R&D time lines for existing initiatives; for example, by increasing the breadth of outside support. Not all of these investments are permanent in nature, but we do expect them to push operating expenses upward in the second half of the year. At the same time, however, our capital deployment activities are effectively offsetting the impact of these strategic investments on the bottom line. 
Now turning to guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we expect revenues of $695 million to $705 million. Compared to the prior year period, this range reflects a reported growth of 0.2% to 1.6% or 0.6% to 2% on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, these lower growth rates are due to a much tougher comparable in the prior year period when revenue jumped almost $40 million on a sequential basis. In terms of the bottom line, we forecast diluted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.47 to $0.48 in the third quarter. This represents continued strong growth of 9.3% to 11.6% on a reported basis or 10.1% to 12.4% in constant-currency terms. Our full year guidance obviously implies a sequential step up in the fourth quarter revenue. This is due to normal sequential business momentum that we expect, contributions from new product launches and the timing of some royalty revenue that is expected later this year. 
Before opening up the call for questions, I would like to reiterate that our view on the second quarter is one of a good multilevel execution. Revenue grew at a solid rate based on continued outperformance domestically and stabilization outside the United States. We improved already strong operating margins, while accommodating increased investment in key growth drivers. And our capital deployment activities helped to pay for these investments at the EPS line, while setting the stage for leveraged growth over the long term. 
Now that we're halfway through our fiscal year, we're optimistic about our full year forecast. We're anticipating solid mid-single-digit revenue growth in line with our original expectations as strength in the U.S. offsets the weakness we have seen internationally. We forecast solid expansion of operating margins, while simultaneously investing for the future, and we expect the acceleration of our capital redeployment activities to allow us to leverage operating gains all the way down to EPS, which should grow at a mid-teens rate. 
With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. 
Please limit your questions to one plus a related follow-up, then return to the queue. 
Operator, we are ready for the first question."

First of all, I'm going to try to sway you from using the word ""cliff"" because we have been working very hard to make sure that it won't be a cliff, and I say that in all seriousness. We have been very focused on what happened with the 2D curve and everything else, and by thinking about how we extend out and do some line extensions and other things, that's been a huge part of our focus to be able to have more of a plateau or a very soft decline in that segment of the business at some point of time as opposed to a real cliff. I think it's part of what we have coming, things in biopsy and, frankly, Pete Valenti is running that business for us. He has had a long good track record of being able to put even some singles and doubles on the board in addition to just the every 5 or 8 year home run that we've tended to have in this business. So I would tell you I'm feeling incrementally better. Every time Bob and I and Eric Compton are down meeting with that business on what's happening in their pipeline, and we'll talk more and more about that certainly in the coming quarters and years. But I think we're feeling better about being able to mitigate that. 
The other piece -- I just want to jump back even on your question on margin to Bob, because you know I was very adamant early on when I came. I was probably not expecting much margin expansion. This has been one of the very positive surprises to me, and I think the big piece that I want to be clear on is we're going to use a lot of this gross margin expansion to continue to invest into the business, which leads to the second part of your follow-up question there, which is as we go forward, we're certainly spending more on R&D, more on marketing and it will allow us to do tuck-in acquisitions based on the cash generation. And so I think we're really opening up a new leg in the stool where we've got more levers available to us than we did 2 years ago. Two years ago, we were so hamstrung with the debt and the converts and everything else, we didn't have really an ability to potentially manage, because as we all know, we're going to see some ups and downs in the rate of sales growth. We're going to continue to grow. We are going to have some periods where it will be a little bit slower, while we wait for the next new products to come through. I think we're feeling better and better that we're going to be able to deliver very strong earnings growth consistently. And in the periods when we're growing faster, we'll probably reinvest a little bit more into the periods that are slower. We may not have quite the accelerated investments in that time. So hopefully, that should start to give a little more of a longer-term view of what we're thinking about."

But I think the way we're thinking about it is this is a low single-digit decliner. Internationally, I think we see the business very slight grower, but globally, I think because of the declines in the U.S., we think about blood screening as a flattish to slightly down business.

But we're still just doing a lot of cleaning up through the company, and we've consistently said we've made a lot of progress in the last couple of years, and there's still a lot of opportunity ahead to be better on so many fronts."

We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Our results were very solid and illustrate how far we've come and how quickly we're progressing on our journey from t",2327,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Our results were very solid and illustrate how far we've come and how quickly we're progressing on our journey from turnaround story to sustainable growth company. 
Revenues of $717.4 million exceeded expectations as all 4 of our businesses grew on a global basis, despite a difficult comparison resulting from very strong results in the prior year period. 
In our last call, we focused on the emergence of our surgical business as a growth driver. This quarter, surgical lead the way with exceptional performance. But we're also pleased with how our breast imaging, molecular diagnostics and cytology businesses performed. And we made progress in strengthening our international franchises, which we believe will be important contributors to future growth.
Our performance this quarter highlighted the breadth of our top line growth drivers, which is often overlooked. Even as performance has improved ahead of schedule in many areas, new drivers are beginning to emerge, thanks to the deliberate and proactive efforts of our team. And while this quarter is only a single data point, our results do give us increased confidence that revenue growth can continue at a healthy pace in the future. 
Our third quarter results also demonstrated once again our ability to increase profitability above and beyond already high levels. We boosted both gross and the operating margins even while reinvesting aggressively to drive future growth. We've been pleasantly surprised that our ability to achieve productivity gains and enjoying many other levers to drive earnings growth.
For example, strategies that we had expected to play out over the longer term horizon are materializing sooner than expected. Various internal restructuring yielded a lower tax rate in the quarter. And the combination of strong cash flows and market volatility enabled us to buy back more shares. Together, all these efforts led to a very robust net margin of 20.2% in the quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.51 and excellent EPS growth of 18.6% on a non-GAAP basis.
Based on the strong earnings performance, we are raising our financial guidance for the year and now expect non-GAAP EPS of between $1.93 and $1.94. As a reminder, the mid-point of this new guidance is roughly $0.12 above our guidance at the beginning of our year. We're clearly exceeding our own expectations for sustainable bottom line growth and feel good about our future prospects in this regard as well.
With that introduction out of the way, I'd like to walk through our revenue highlights in the balance of my remarks, then Bob will discuss expenses, the rest of our financials and our updated guidance. Unless otherwise noted, percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. 
Starting with the big picture. Total revenues were $717.4 million in the third quarter, an increase of 3.4% on a reported basis or 3.6% in constant currency terms. These figures include a roughly $8 million headwind from divested and discontinued products, such as sentinel breast coils and the molecular test for cystic fibrosis. If we were to back out this headwind, total revenues would have been grown 4.8% in constant currency terms.
These growth rates are stacked on top of a very difficult comp from the prior year. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2015, total revenues increased 12.2% in constant currency. So our ability to jump over a high bar this quarter gives us increasing confidence in the ability of our commercial organization to drive solid growth next year and beyond.
In terms of geography. U.S. sales grew 4.7% in the third quarter, continuing a string of good results and indicating the improvements we've made in commercial execution. We continued to enjoy strong leadership positions and good momentum in the domestic marketplace. 
International sales declined 1.2% on a reported basis, driven primarily by blood screening, as expected. In constant currency, international sales declined 0.4%, essentially flat. And if we were to normalize for divested and discontinued products, international sales would have increased slightly. It's also worth mentioning that international sales increased sequentially as well, an encouraging sign. 
Overall, we believe our international results in the third quarter show we are building a foundation for strong and consistent growth over time. Toward that end, our Chief Operating Officer, Eric Compton, has made good progress filling out our international leadership team in recent months. In last quarter's call, we highlighted new executives in charge of European Breast Health and Service, as well as marketing, molecular diagnostics, surgical and regulatory. More recently, we have added new geographic sales leaders to run Latin America, Canada and Asia Pacific. So our efforts to upgrade talent are coming together nicely. 
Shifting to the types of revenue we generate. I want to emphasize that for all the attention our mammography systems receive, capital equipment represented just 23.4% of revenue in the third quarter. Said another way, more than 76% of our sales were recurring. More specifically, disposables, such as our diagnostic assays and surgical tools, represented 60.4% of sales, while service and other totaled 16.2% of sales.
Now let me discuss divisional revenues in the third quarter. I'll start with the growth leader in the quarter, our GYN Surgical business. A couple of years ago, no one would have said those words in the same sentence. But today, our team has achieved what others thought impossible. Worldwide surgical sales were $102 million, surpassing $100 million on a quarterly basis for the first time. Sales grew 19.8% in constant currency, the fastest growth rate for this division in recent memory. 
In the United States, the team delivered double-digit growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. And internationally, the business grew by nearly 40%, albeit off of very small base. 
As many of you know, a competitor recently withdrew its endo mistral oblation product from the market. And to capitalize on this, we increased marketing and sales activities in the quarter. As a result, global sales for our NovaSure product totaled $61 million, an increase of 14.6% in constant currency. Not to be overlooked, sales of our MyoSure product for urine fibrin removal also continued to show strength. Global MyoSure sales of $40.8 million increased 29.8% in constant currency. 
Now let's turn to Breast Health, which has received a lot of attention in recent months. While this is understandable and appropriate, it's just as important to appreciate that Hologic is much more than a mammography company today. Hopefully, our results this quarter help illustrate that point and provide confidence that the entire company can continue to grow revenue solidly and EPS much faster even as growth from 3D adoption naturally slows.
We're very pleased with our Breast Health performance in the quarter. Global sales of $282.5 million increased 1.1%. Breast imaging sales totaled $239.3 million, up 2.3% in constant currency, driven by continued adoption of our Genius 3D Mammography systems. Domestic imaging sales grew more rapidly and exceeded our internal expectations based on Genius placements, which increased both sequentially and year-over-year. 
We estimate the Genius systems are continuing to gain market share while our investments in customer marketing help us maintain stable prices amid fierce competition. We still have lots to look forward to in Breast Health. Genius systems represent less than 40% of our own mammography installed base today and by our estimate, less than 25% of the market as a whole. And we remain confident in the long-term conversion opportunity as evidence continues to mount on the benefits of Hologic's Genius exams for patients and physicians and as we differentiate ourselves competitively.
As evidence of this, mammography customers recently surveyed by the independent market research firm KLAS scored Hologic highest in overall product satisfaction. One Director of radiology said, ""Hologic seems to be the only company that really understands the tomosynthesis market. It was clear from our implementation and our usage of this system that they are a full generation ahead of other vendors. Everybody else is playing catch-up."" This is only one anecdotal comment, but it's consistent with the customer feedback we receive every day and validates our leadership position. 
As our installed base Genius 3D systems grows, our sales and marketing programs are focusing on ways to leverage this leadership position. For example, service revenue is becoming increasingly important and represents an annuity that complements and smooths out our capital sales. Some of you may not appreciate the size of our service business in Breast Health. To frame it for you, service revenue in this business exceeded $100 million in the quarter for the first time and grew at a mid single-digit rate.
Similarly, we have revamped our research and development efforts to capitalize on our growing Genius footprint and generated more continuous stream of product innovations. For example, we recently launched our new Affirm prone biopsy system, which provides a better patient experience and enables doctors to capitalize on the increased sensitivity of 3D technology. Although it's still early days, customer feedback on this system has been positive, both in the United States and internationally.
Another component of future growth in Breast Health will be our international business. While we still have a lot of work to do here, we are making good progress and are optimistic that the business is becoming healthier and more predictable as we create the foundation for solid growth in 2017 and beyond. In the third quarter, international Breast Health sales declined 2.9% in constant currency. But if we back out the headwind from divested and discontinued price, sales would have been flat. And on a sequential basis, sales increased slightly.
With this in mind, I want to remind everyone that last year's international Breast Health number was exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we anticipate a year-over-year decline in the coming quarter before the business returns to growth in 2017. As we move into 2017, we do believe that the combination of multiple tailwinds are still underpenetrated 3D opportunity, growing service revenue, a revitalized R&D effort and international expansion will enable Breast Health to be an important contributor to corporate growth.
Now let's cover diagnostics, which is our largest business and greatest source of non-GAAP operating profit. Diagnostics reported sales of $309.9 million in the third quarter, growing 1.2% in constant currency. Within diagnostics, our cytology and molecular businesses performed well while our blood screening business declined as expected. Global sales of cytology in perinatal products totaled $122.2 million, growing 3.9% on a constant currency basis. Breaking this down a little further, both our ThinPrep and retail fibronectin franchises grew in the United States and internationally despite lingering headwinds from Pap interval expansion domestically.
Turning to molecular diagnostics. We posted global sales of $131.8 million, up 6.0% in constant currency. Excluding sales of our discontinued cystic fibrosis product, molecular sales would have grown at a high single-digit rate. Our domestic business was solid as our fully automated Panther system continues to accumulate new placements and competitive wins and as utilization of our assays for Trichomonas, HPV and chlamydia gonorrhea continues to grow. 
But the real standout here was our international business. Over the last couple of quarters, international molecular sales have turned slightly positive under new leadership, and we had added viral load assays to the Panther menu. Building on this, the business took a significant step ahead in the third quarter with constant currency growth exceeding 20%. 
In addition, we had a record quarter of Panther placements outside the United States, coupled with a significant step-up in per instrument utilization. All these data points have us feeling good about the potential for international molecular diagnostics to become a new driver of growth for the company over time.
Shifting back to the United States for a moment. During the third quarter, we gained an emergency use authorization for our Zika virus test for diagnostic use. In addition, blood banks began testing donated blood for Zika with our Procleix under our investigation new drug protocol. While we do not expect significant sales from these 2 new products, both of which run on the Panther system, our ability to rapidly develop of these test shows we can react quickly to public health emergencies in close cooperation with regulators and customers. In addition, should the Zika virus spread in the United States, we will be well positioned in the marketplace.
Apart from the highlight of the Zika IND, our blood screening business declined in the quarter as expected. Worldwide sales of blood screening products were $55.9 million, down 12.9%, with all the decline coming outside the United States. As in the second quarter, this decline was mainly due to stronger ordering in the prior year period to support testing at the Japanese Red Cross combined with continued trends toward lower blood utilization.
Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me wrap up the review of product sales by mentioning that our Skeletal Health division posted revenues of $23.0 million in the quarter. This represented a constant currency increase of 4.8% with growth both domestically and overseas primarily driven by our horizon bone density standard.
So in conclusion, we are very pleased with our third quarter financial results and with the progress we've made toward building a sustainable growth company. Despite very challenging prior year comps, all 4 of our businesses grew in the quarter, reflecting the many growth drivers at our disposal. 
Sales growth in the U.S. Breast Health slowed to a challenging prior year comp, but remained healthy. At the same time, strong results in surgical, molecular diagnostics and cytology demonstrated that Hologic is much more than a mammography company. We continue to execute well in the United States and made good progress building a foundation for international growth. We once again expanded profit margins and redeployed capital, contributing to EPS growth at the highest rate in many years. 
Now I will hand the call over to Bob."

I'm going to walk through the rest of our third quarter income statement, highlight a few balance sheet and cash flow items, and then wrap up with updated financial guidance for 2016. As a reminder, I will",1498,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to walk through the rest of our third quarter income statement, highlight a few balance sheet and cash flow items, and then wrap up with updated financial guidance for 2016. 
As a reminder, I will focus on non-GAAP results and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. As Steve discussed, our revenue performance in the third quarter exceeded expectations, highlighted by global growth in all 4 business segments. This growth, coupled with favorable product mix and productivity gains, again drove improvements in gross and operating margins. At the same time, we continue to invest in initiatives that position us for long-term sustainable growth. Net-net, we delivered EPS growth well in excess of sales, reflecting the impact of operational improvements, capital deployment and in lower effective tax rate.
Now let's dive deeper into the third quarter income statement. Gross margin of 65.7% increased 50 basis points and benefited from the growth of our surgical, cytology and perinatal and Aptima franchises. We continue to manage pricing well as we focus on commercial excellence and our marketing initiatives highlight the clinical and economic value of our products. 
In addition, our operations teams continue to drive efficiencies and reduce cost across our supply chains. Total operating expenses of $229.2 million increased 3.1% in the third quarter. This increase was driven primarily by sales and marketing expense, which increased 15.5%.
Given our gross margin expansion, we have invested deliberately and opportunistically in commercial areas where we see a good return. This include our Genius marketing campaign in Breast Health, our cervical cancer co-testing initiatives in Diagnostics and efforts to gain competitive market share with NovaSure. These strategic initiatives are paying off through increased brand awareness, market share gains and price stability, all of which contribute to higher sales.
Despite the increased sales and marketing spending, operating margins improved 60 basis points in the quarter, slightly more than gross margins based primarily on leverage in general and administrative expenses. 
Moving down the P&L. Interest expense of $33.9 million was 12% lower than in prior year, due to our efforts to both reduce and restructure our debt. And in addition, our tax rate is improving earlier than expected based on changes in our in comics an internal restructurings implemented this year and last. We know estimate that our effective tax rate will be around 32% for the full year 2016.
We chewed up to this rate in the third quarter, reducing our effective rate to 30.6%, but expect the rate to normalize back to 32% in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, our tax rate was 34.25% just last year. So we are making good progress.
We are pleased that these efforts have enabled us to grow net profits even faster than operating profit. Our net margin was 20.2% in the quarter, a very strong level and an improvement of 190 basis points over the prior year. 
To wrap up the income statement review, diluted shares outstanding were 282 million in the third quarter, roughly 10 million lower than a year ago. Over the course of this year, we have worked to pay down a portion of the in-the-money converts to reduce the dilutive effects. And more recently, we have taken advantage of market volatilities to repurchase our common stock. 
In the third quarter, we bought back 3 million shares of stock for $101.2 million, which exhausted our prior $250 million repurchase authorization. Recently, our Board of Directors has approved an additional $500 million repurchase program, and we're very pleased to have that arrow in our quiver going forward. 
While we're pleased with the progress we've made, thus far in improving our capital structure and achieving a more competitive tax rate compared to other med tech companies, we know we can continue to improve. And we believe these improvements will help us deliver EPS growth much faster than revenue over an extended period of time.
Now I'd like to highlight a few balance sheet and cash flow items, beginning with inventory. Inventory decreased by $14.5 million or 4.9% compared to a year ago despite a 3.4% increase in sales. This speaks to strong alignment between the operations and sales teams, who know that every dollar saved in inventory serves as dry powder for debt reduction, acquisitions or share repurchase. 
And speaking of our debt, at the end of the third quarter, total debt outstanding was $3.4 billion, a decrease of more than $0.5 billion from the year ago. During the quarter, we paid off $175 million that had been outstanding on our $1 billion revolving line of credit using proceeds borrowed at a lower interest rate under a new $200 million accounts receivable securitization program.
Adjusted non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, totaled $262.5 million in the third quarter, an increase of 5.1%. Based on EBITDA of more than $1 billion over the last 12 months, our leverage ratio calculated as net principal debt over EBITDA, stands at 2.97, the first time this ratio has fallen below 3 since the Gen-Probe acquisition.
In addition, we are well on our way to achieving our target leverage ratio of 2.5x by the end of fiscal 2017. Strong profit growth and lower debt have continued to improve our return on invested capital, or ROIC, which was 12.3% on a trailing 12-month basis, a 170 basis points increase over the prior year. 
Robust cash flows and minimal capital expenditures continue to be hallmarks of Hologic's financial performance. Operating cash flow was $246.2 million in the third quarter, an increase of 1.6%. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $225.1 million. Notably, free cash flow was 55.1% higher than non-GAAP net income. Our financial health clearly extends well beyond our P&L as we continue to focus on working capital and control our capital expenditures.
Now let's turn to our updated financial guidance for the full year and fourth quarter. At the midpoint, we are raising both revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance based on the company's strong performance in the third quarter. Let's cover the revenue guidance first. 
For the full year, we are increasing our previous guidance by $10 million at the low end and now expect total revenues of between $2.82 billion and $2.83 billion for fiscal 2016. This represents solid mid single-digit growth of 4.3% to 4.6% on a reported basis, or 5% to 5.3% in constant currency terms, despite the headwind from divested in discontinued products. 
With only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance obviously implies revenues of $714 million to $724 million in the fourth quarter. Compared to the prior year period, which is another tough comp, this range reflects revenue growth of 1.6% to 3.0% on a reported basis, or 2.1% to 3.6% in constant currency terms. In addition, our guidance includes an expected headwind of roughly $4.5 million from divested and discontinued products, which depresses our constant currency guidance by about 60 basis points.
Based on our revenue range, our fourth quarter guidance implies that revenues will be about the same or slightly above our third quarter actuals. We no longer expect the significant sequential step-up implied by our prior guidance as some revenue that we originally forecast in the fourth quarter materialize a little earlier than expected. In addition, we forecast another quarter of incremental softness in blood screening sales as inventories and ordering patterns continues to normalize.
Turning to our updated bottom line guidance. We now forecast non-GAAP EPS of between $1.93 and $1.94 for the full year. This translates to reported growth between 15.6% and 16.2% and constant currency growth between 16.9% and 17.5%. This earnings guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates, a full year tax rate of 32% and diluted shares outstanding approximately 280 million for the full year.
This full year guidance translates to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.49 to $0.50 in the fourth quarter. This represents growth of 14% to 16.3% on a reported basis or 15% to 17.3% in constant currency terms. Implicit in our fourth quarter guidance is a sequential increase in operating expenses, several million dollars of which relate to a change in the retirement provisions of our equity plan that will make it more consistent with peers. 
Before opening up the call for questions, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with the financial results we achieved so far in fiscal 2016. From a revenue perspective, our surgical business continues to exceed expectations. We still enjoy momentum with Genius 3D Mammography, remains pleased with our molecular diagnostics and ThinPrep businesses and are turning the corner internationally. And from an earnings perspective, we continue to generate tremendous growth through gross and operating margin improvement and lower tax rate and capital deployment.
With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are ready for the first question."

We got the clearance, if you recall, early this year, really, early this calendar year, to the viral loads. We've got the HCV, HPV and HIV. So they're rolling out in conjunction with the new leadership team and the Panther placements. And those things are really driving it. Zika, by the way, is not in those numbers. So that's really just our core women's health assays, plus the viral load. So I think what we're excited about, as we started to look forward in Diagnostics -- molecular is effectively been nonexistent outside the U.S., and not nonexistent, but pretty small. And now we're really getting that footprint. And as we are placing this Panther, starting feel like, okay, this is the beginning of the something that is really is sustainable and has good growth ahead of it. As well, the cytology business continues to take along as well with some modest growth outside the U.S. also."

Yes, just anecdotally, Bob and I happen to be in Japan last week. And again, half of our employees in Japan have been with us less than 1 year. So it truly is we look at the company of our size from the outside and think, okay, you just have to get it going and turn around what's there. This really is building it out. So I think we've seen some emerging signs in Diagnostics over the last couple of quarters, didn't want to quite say yet until we thought, okay, this is now sustainable. And I think we're in the same infrastructure building in Breast Health and other stuff. Breast Health because more dealers involved. We'll probably take a little longer. But I will tell you, underneath the surface, we're feeling very good where, as I always say, the infrastructure gets better before the numbers show that. And I think that's kind of the stages that we're in right now."

So that business had turned it around and strength and erratically and was then well-poised when they -- in the competitive issue happened. So we're taking advantage of it. My issue continues to grow. And I think the way we think about our guided GYN serve business is we're not ready to declare it a sustainable double-digit grower, but it's clearly a very solid grower. And again, this is one where internationally, we're just in a very early stages as well. So again, it's moved from what I'd call an appendage on the company a couple of years ago to something you can actually start to meaningfully contribute to our total growth. It's also hugely accretive to our gross margin, operating margin. It's a great cash generator. There's a lot of good things, and it's helping on our tax rate, frankly."

There's just -- I kind of remind people, there's a fundamental limitation to how many systems can be installed. Use the auto industry as an example, right? If every company launch a new product next year, auto sales don't suddenly jump up from 16 million to 20 million. There's just natural rate of replacement that is still happening here.

Our results were very solid and illustrate how far we've come and how quickly we're progressing on our journey from t",2331,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Our results were very solid and illustrate how far we've come and how quickly we're progressing on our journey from turnaround story to sustainable growth company. 
Revenues of $717.4 million exceeded expectations as all 4 of our businesses grew on a global basis, despite a difficult comparison resulting from very strong results in the prior year period. 
In our last call, we focused on the emergence of our surgical business as a growth driver. This quarter, surgical led the way with exceptional performance, but we're also pleased with how our breast imaging, molecular diagnostics and cytology businesses performed. And we made progress in strengthening our international franchises, which we believe will be important contributors to future growth.
Our performance this quarter highlighted the breadth of our top line growth drivers, which is often overlooked. Even as performance has improved ahead of schedule in many areas, new drivers are beginning to emerge, thanks to the deliberate and proactive efforts of our team. And while this quarter is only a single data point, our results do give us increased confidence that revenue growth can continue at a healthy pace in the future. 
Our third quarter results also demonstrated once again our ability to increase profitability above and beyond already high levels. We boosted both gross and the operating margins even while reinvesting aggressively to drive future growth. We've been pleasantly surprised at our ability to achieve productivity gains and enjoying many other levers to drive earnings growth.
For example, strategies that we had expected to play out over the longer-term horizon are materializing sooner than expected. Various internal restructuring yielded a lower tax rate in the quarter. And the combination of strong cash flows and market volatility enabled us to buy back more shares. Together, all these efforts led to a very robust net margin of 20.2% in the quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.51 and excellent EPS growth of 18.6% on a non-GAAP basis.
Based on the strong earnings performance, we are raising our financial guidance for the year and now expect non-GAAP EPS of between $1.93 and $1.94. As a reminder, the mid-point of this new guidance is roughly $0.12 above our guidance at the beginning of the year. We're clearly exceeding our own expectations for a sustainable bottom line growth and feel good about our future prospects in this regard as well.
With that introduction out of the way, I'd like to walk through our revenue highlights in the balance of my remarks. Then Bob will discuss expenses, the rest of our financials and our updated guidance. Unless otherwise noted, percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. 
Starting with the big picture. Total revenues were $717.4 million in the third quarter, an increase of 3.4% on a reported basis or 3.6% in constant currency terms. These figures include a roughly $8 million headwind from divested and discontinued products, such as Sentinelle breast coils and the molecular test for cystic fibrosis. If we were to back out this headwind, total revenues would have been grown 4.8% in constant currency terms.
These growth rates are stacked on top of a very difficult comp from the prior year. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2015, total revenues increased 12.2% in constant currency. So our ability to jump over a high bar this quarter gives us increasing confidence in the ability of our commercial organization to drive solid growth next year and beyond.
In terms of geography. U.S. sales grew 4.7% in the third quarter, continuing a string of good results and indicating the improvements we've made in commercial execution. We continued to enjoy strong leadership positions and good momentum in the domestic marketplace. 
International sales declined 1.2% on a reported basis, driven primarily by blood screening, as expected. In constant currency, international sales declined 0.4%, essentially flat. And if we were to normalize for divested and discontinued products, international sales would have increased slightly. It's also worth mentioning that international sales increased sequentially as well, an encouraging sign. 
Overall, we believe our international results in the third quarter show we are building a foundation for strong and consistent growth over time. Toward that end, our Chief Operating Officer, Eric Compton, has made good progress in filling out our international leadership team in recent months. In last quarter's call, we highlighted new executives in charge of European Breast Health and service as well as marketing, molecular diagnostics, surgical and regulatory. More recently, we have added new geographic sales leaders to run Latin America, Canada and Asia Pacific. So our efforts to upgrade talent are coming together nicely. 
Shifting to the types of revenue we generate. I want to emphasize that for all the attention our mammography systems receive, capital equipment represented just 23.4% of revenue in the third quarter. Said another way, more than 76% of our sales were recurring. More specifically, disposables, such as our diagnostic assays and surgical tools, represented 60.4%, 6-0 point 4 percent of sales, while service and other totaled 16.2% of sales.
Now let me discuss divisional revenues in the third quarter. I'll start with the growth leader in the quarter, our GYN Surgical business. A couple of years ago, no one would have said those words in the same sentence. But today, our team has achieved what others thought impossible. Worldwide surgical sales were $102 million, surpassing $100 million on a quarterly basis for the first time. Sales grew 19.8% in constant currency, the fastest growth rate for this division in recent memory. 
In the United States, the team delivered double-digit growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. And internationally, the business grew by nearly 40%, albeit off a very small base. 
As many of you know, a competitor recently withdrew its endometrial ablation product from the market. And to capitalize on this, we increased marketing and sales activities in the quarter. As a result, global sales of our NovaSure product totaled $61 million, an increase of 14.6% in constant currency. Not to be overlooked, sales of our MyoSure product for uterine fibroid removal also continued to show strength. Global MyoSure sales of $40.8 million increased 29.8% in constant currency. 
Now let's turn to Breast Health, which has received a lot of attention in recent months. While this is understandable and appropriate, it's just as important to appreciate that Hologic is much more than a mammography company today. Hopefully, our results this quarter help illustrate that point and provide confidence that the entire company can continue to grow revenue solidly and EPS much faster even as growth from 3D adoption naturally slows.
We're very pleased with our Breast Health performance in the quarter. Global sales of $282.5 million increased 1.1%. Breast imaging sales totaled $239.3 million, up 2.3% in constant currency, driven by continued adoption of our Genius 3D Mammography systems. Domestic imaging sales grew more rapidly and exceeded our internal expectations based on Genius placements, which increased both sequentially and year-over-year. 
We estimate the Genius systems are continuing to gain market share while our investments in customer marketing help us maintain stable prices amid fierce competition. We still have lots to look forward to in Breast Health. Genius systems represent less than 40% of our own mammography installed base today, and by our estimate, less than 25% of the market as a whole. And we remain confident in the long-term conversion opportunity as evidence continues to mount on the benefits of Hologic's Genius exams for patients and physicians and as we differentiate ourselves competitively.
As evidence of this, mammography customers recently surveyed by the independent market research firm KLAS scored Hologic highest in overall product satisfaction. One Director of radiology said, ""Hologic seems to be the only company that really understands the tomosynthesis market. It was clear from our implementation and our usage of their system that they are a full generation ahead of other vendors. Everybody else is playing catch-up."" This is only one anecdotal comment, but it's consistent with the customer feedback we receive every day and validates our leadership position. 
As our installed base Genius 3D systems grows, our sales and marketing programs are focusing on ways to leverage this leadership position. For example, service revenue is becoming increasingly important and represents an annuity that complements and smooths out our capital sales. Some of you may not appreciate the size of our service business in Breast Health. To frame it for you, service revenue in this business exceeded $100 million in the quarter for the first time and grew at a mid single-digit rate.
Similarly, we have revamped our research and development efforts to capitalize on our growing Genius footprint and generated more continuous stream of product innovations. For example, we recently launched our new Affirm prone biopsy system, which provides a better patient experience and enables doctors to capitalize on the increased sensitivity of 3D technology. Although it's still early days, customer feedback on this system has been positive, both in the United States and internationally.
Another component of future growth in Breast Health will be our international business. While we still have a lot of work to do here, we are making good progress and are optimistic that the business is becoming healthier and more predictable as we create the foundation for solid growth in 2017 and beyond. In the third quarter, international Breast Health sales declined 2.9% in constant currency. But if we back out the headwind from divested and discontinued products, sales would have been flat. And on a sequential basis, sales increased slightly.
With this in mind, I want to remind everyone that last year's international Breast Health number was exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we anticipate a year-over-year decline in the coming quarter before the business returns to growth in 2017. As we move into 2017, we do believe that the combination of multiple tailwinds are still underpenetrated 3D opportunity, growing service revenue, a revitalized R&D effort and international expansion will enable Breast Health to be an important contributor to corporate growth.
Now let's cover diagnostics, which is our largest business and greatest source of non-GAAP operating profit. Diagnostics reported sales of $309.9 million in the third quarter, growing 1.2% in constant currency. Within diagnostics, our cytology and molecular businesses performed well while our blood screening business declined as expected. Global sales of cytology in perinatal products totaled $122.2 million, growing 3.9% on a constant currency basis. Breaking this down a little further, both our ThinPrep and fetal fibronectin franchises grew in the United States and internationally despite lingering headwinds from Pap interval expansion domestically.
Turning to molecular diagnostics. We posted global sales of $131.8 million, up 6.0% in constant currency. Excluding sales of our discontinued cystic fibrosis product, molecular sales would have grown at a high single-digit rate. Our domestic business was solid as our fully automated Panther system continues to accumulate new placements and competitive wins and as utilization of our assays for Trichomonas, HPV and chlamydia gonorrhea continues to grow. 
But the real standout here was our international business. Over the last couple of quarters, international molecular sales have turned slightly positive under new leadership, and we had added viral load assays to the Panther menu. Building on this, the business took a significant step ahead in the third quarter with constant currency growth exceeding 20%. 
In addition, we had a record quarter of Panther placements outside the United States, coupled with a significant step-up in per instrument utilization. All these data points have us feeling good about the potential for international molecular diagnostics to become a new driver of growth for the company over time.
Shifting back to the United States for a moment. During the third quarter, we gained an emergency use authorization for our Zika virus test for diagnostic use. In addition, blood banks began testing donated blood for Zika with our Procleix assay under an investigational new drug protocol. While we do not expect significant sales from these 2 new products, both of which run on the Panther system, our ability to rapidly develop these test shows we can react quickly to public health emergencies in close cooperation with regulators and customers. In addition, should the Zika virus spread in the United States, we will be well positioned in the marketplace.
Apart from the highlight of the Zika IND, our blood screening business declined in the quarter as expected. Worldwide sales of blood screening products were $55.9 million, down 12.9%, with all the decline coming outside the United States. As in the second quarter, this decline was mainly due to stronger ordering in the prior year period to support testing at the Japanese Red Cross combined with continued trends toward lower blood utilization.
Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me wrap up the review of product sales by mentioning that our Skeletal Health division posted revenues of $23.0 million in the quarter. This represented a constant currency increase of 4.8% with growth both domestically and overseas, primarily driven by our Horizon bone density scanner.
So in conclusion, we are very pleased with our third quarter financial results and with the progress we've made toward building a sustainable growth company. Despite very challenging prior year comps, all 4 of our businesses grew in the quarter, reflecting the many growth drivers at our disposal. 
Sales growth in the U.S. Breast Health slowed to a challenging prior year comp, but remained healthy. At the same time, strong results in surgical, molecular diagnostics and cytology demonstrated that Hologic is much more than a mammography company. We continued to execute well in the United States and made good progress building a foundation for international growth. We once again expanded profit margins and redeployed capital, contributing to EPS growth at the highest rate in many years. 
Now I will hand the call over to Bob."

I'm going to walk through the rest of our third quarter income statement, highlight a few balance sheet and cash flow items, and then wrap up with updated financial guidance for 2016. As a reminder, I will",1504,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to walk through the rest of our third quarter income statement, highlight a few balance sheet and cash flow items, and then wrap up with updated financial guidance for 2016. 
As a reminder, I will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. As Steve discussed, our revenue performance in the third quarter exceeded expectations, highlighted by global growth in all 4 business segments. This growth, coupled with favorable product mix and productivity gains, again drove improvements in gross and operating margins. At the same time, we continued to invest in initiatives that position us for long-term sustainable growth. Net-net, we delivered EPS growth well in excess of sales, reflecting the impact of operational improvements, capital deployment and in lower effective tax rate.
Now let's dive deeper into the third quarter income statement. Gross margin of 65.7% increased 50 basis points and benefited from the growth of our surgical, cytology and perinatal and Aptima franchises. We continue to manage pricing well as we focus on commercial excellence, and our marketing initiatives highlight the clinical and economic value of our products. 
In addition, our operations teams continue to drive efficiencies and reduce cost across our supply chain. Total operating expenses of $229.2 million increased 3.1% in the third quarter. This increase was driven primarily by sales and marketing expense, which increased 15.5%.
Given our gross margin expansion, we have invested deliberately and opportunistically in commercial areas where we see a good return. These include our Genius marketing campaign in Breast Health, our cervical cancer co-testing initiatives in Diagnostics and efforts to gain competitive market share with NovaSure. These strategic initiatives are paying off through increased brand awareness, market share gains and price stability, all of which contribute to higher sales.
Despite the increased sales and marketing spending, operating margins improved 60 basis points in the quarter, slightly more than gross margins based primarily on leverage in general and administrative expenses. 
Moving down the P&L. Interest expense of $33.9 million was 12% lower than in prior year due to our efforts to both reduce and restructure our debt. And in addition, our tax rate is improving earlier than expected based on changes in our income mix and internal restructurings implemented this year and last. We now estimate that our effective tax rate will be around 32% for the full year 2016.
We trued up to this rate in the third quarter, reducing our effective rate to 30.6%, but we expect the rate to normalize back to 32% in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, our tax rate was 34.25% just last year. So we are making good progress.
We are pleased that these efforts have enabled us to grow net profits even faster than operating profit. Our net margin was 20.2% in the quarter, a very strong level and an improvement of 190 basis points over the prior year. 
To wrap up the income statement review, diluted shares outstanding were 282 million in the third quarter, roughly 10 million lower than a year ago. Over the course of this year, we have worked to pay down a portion of the in-the-money converts to reduce the dilutive effects. And more recently, we have taken advantage of market volatility to repurchase our common stock. 
In the third quarter, we bought back 3 million shares of stock for $101.2 million, which exhausted our prior $250 million repurchase authorization. Recently, our Board of Directors has approved an additional $500 million repurchase program, and we're very pleased to have that arrow in our quiver going forward. 
While we're pleased with the progress we've made, thus far, in improving our capital structure and achieving a more competitive tax rate compared to other med tech companies, we know we can continue to improve. And we believe these improvements will help us deliver EPS growth much faster than revenue over an extended period of time.
Now I'd like to highlight a few balance sheet and cash flow items, beginning with inventory. Inventory decreased by $14.5 million or 4.9% compared to a year ago despite a 3.4% increase in sales. This speaks to the strong alignment between the operations and sales teams, who know that every dollar saved in the inventory serves as dry powder for debt reduction, acquisitions or share repurchase. 
And speaking of our debt, at the end of the third quarter, total debt outstanding was $3.4 billion, a decrease of more than $0.5 billion from the year ago. During the quarter, we paid off $175 million that had been outstanding on our $1 billion revolving line of credit using proceeds borrowed at a lower interest rate under a new $200 million accounts receivable securitization program.
Adjusted non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, totaled $262.5 million in the third quarter, an increase of 5.1%. Based on EBITDA of more than $1 billion over the last 12 months, our leverage ratio calculated as net principal debt over EBITDA, stands at 2.97. The first time this ratio has fallen below 3 since the Gen-Probe acquisition.
In addition, we are well on our way to achieving our target leverage ratio of 2.5x by the end of fiscal 2017. Strong profit growth and lower debt have continued to improve our return on invested capital, or ROIC, which was 12.3% on a trailing 12-month basis, a 170 basis points increase over the prior year. 
Robust cash flows and minimal capital expenditures continue to be hallmarks of Hologic's financial performance. Operating cash flow was $246.2 million in the third quarter, an increase of 1.6%. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $225.1 million. Notably, free cash flow was 55.1% higher than non-GAAP net income. Our financial health clearly extends well beyond our P&L as we continue to focus on working capital and control our capital expenditures.
Now let's turn to our updated financial guidance for the full year and fourth quarter. At the midpoint, we are raising both revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance based on the company's strong performance in the third quarter. Let's cover the revenue guidance first. 
For the full year, we are increasing our previous guidance by $10 million at the low end and now expect total revenues of between $2.82 billion and $2.83 billion for fiscal 2016. This represents solid mid-single-digit growth of 4.3% to 4.6% on a reported basis, or 5% to 5.3% in constant currency terms, despite the headwind from divested and discontinued products. 
With only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance obviously implies revenues of $714 million to $724 million in the fourth quarter. Compared to the prior year period, which is another tough comp, this range reflects revenue growth of 1.6% to 3.0% on a reported basis, or 2.1% to 3.6% in constant currency terms. In addition, our guidance includes an expected headwind of roughly $4.5 million from divested and discontinued products, which depresses our constant currency guidance by about 60 basis points.
Based on our revenue range, our fourth quarter guidance implies that revenues will be about the same or slightly above our third quarter actuals. We no longer expect the significant sequential step-up implied by our prior guidance as some revenue that we originally forecast in the fourth quarter materialize a little bit earlier than expected. In addition, we forecast another quarter of incremental softness in blood screening sales as inventories and ordering patterns continue to normalize.
Turning to our updated bottom line guidance. We now forecast non-GAAP EPS of between $1.93 and $1.94 for the full year. This translates to reported growth between 15.5%-- 15 .6% and 16.2%, and constant currency growth between 16.9% and 17.5%. This earnings guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates, a full year tax rate of 32% and diluted shares outstanding approximately 288 million for the full year.
This full year guidance translates to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.49 to $0.50 in the fourth quarter. This represents growth of 14% to 16.3% on a reported basis or 15% to 17.3% in constant currency terms. Implicit in our fourth quarter guidance is a sequential increase in operating expenses, several million dollars of which relate to a change in the retirement provisions of our equity plan that will make it more consistent with peers. 
Before opening up the call for questions, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with the financial results we achieved so far in fiscal 2016. From a revenue perspective, our surgical business continues to exceed expectations. We still enjoy a momentum with Genius 3D Mammography, remain pleased with our molecular diagnostics and ThinPrep businesses and are turning the corner internationally. And from an earnings perspective, we continue to generate tremendous growth through gross and operating margin improvement and lower tax rate and capital deployment.
With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are ready for the first question."

We got the clearance, if you recall, early this year, what, really, early this calendar year, to the viral loads. We've got the HCV, HPV and HIV. So they're rolling out in conjunction with the new leadership team and the Panther placements. And those things are really driving it. Zika, by the way, is not in those numbers. So that's really just our core women's health assays, plus the viral load. So I think what we're excited about, as we started to look forward in Diagnostics -- molecular is effectively been nonexistent outside the U.S. and -- not nonexistent, but pretty small. And now we're really getting that footprint. And as we're placing this Panther, it's starting feel like, okay, this is the beginning of something that really is sustainable and have some good growth ahead of it. As well, the cytology business continues to tick along as well with some modest growth outside the U.S. also."

He's changed some out, gotten the others to operate up, but really is starting to build it up. And I think that's what Eric Compton has really been driving, especially this year, is getting the right people in place for the longer term. Yes, just anecdotally, Bob and I happen to be in Japan last week. And again, half of our employees in Japan have been with us less than a year. So it truly is, we look at the company of our size from the outside and think, okay, they just have to get it going and turn around what's there. This really is building it out. So I think we've seen some emerging signs in Diagnostics over the last couple of quarters, didn't want to quite say yet until we thought, okay, this is now sustainable. And I think we're in the same infrastructure building in Breast Health and other stuff. Breast Health because more dealers involved. We'll probably take a little bit longer. But I will tell you underneath the surface, we're feeling very good where, as I always say, the infrastructure gets better before the numbers show it.

I think we should say it's candidly coming from a competitive recall, which we still have another, call it, quarter, 1.5-ish quarter ahead of us with that. Having said that, I'd remind everybody. As we said, this was our sixth straight quarter of double-digit growth, both domestically and globally, for our GYN surge business. So that business had turned it around, had strengthened dramatically and was then well poised when they -- competitive issue happened. So we're taking advantage of it. MyoSure continues to grow. And I think the way we think about our GYN surge business here is we're not ready to declare it a sustainable double-digit grower, but it's clearly a very solid grower. And again, this is one, where, internationally, we're just in the very early stages as well. So again, it's moved from, what I'd call, an appendage on the company a couple of years ago to something that can actually start to meaningfully contribute to our total growth. It's also hugely accretive to our gross margin, operating margin. It's a great cash generator. There's a lot of good things, and it's helping on our tax rate, frankly."

So we will have likely one much sooner. But by the time we have HPV, HCV and HIV, it'll be later on in '18. And by that point, we'll be launching in the U.S. from a much bigger installed base, much stronger position overall. So I think the fact we're able to even have some success in Europe than other people's backyards is already an increasingly encouraging sign for it when we do come to the States."

I think as we go into '17, feeling better and better that we'll be finding some things that we will be saying yes to. But certainly, some maybe distribution, some will be outright acquisition. I wouldn't view that as the model of what we'll necessarily be doing. We'll just be flexible."

Would it be fair to say you feel a bit better about your ability to power through the impact of U.S. 3D growth plateauing than you did maybe even a quarter ago?

And then beyond that, we do see potential for incremental kind of sequential weakness within our blood screening businesses. That business continues to normalize from an inventory perspective. So that said, our fourth quarter guidance still implies solid year-over-year growth despite another challenging comparison and a headwind of about 60 basis points from those divested and discontinued products, so we feel good about the guidance.

And having said that, just like prior to getting the incremental reimbursement from CMS, we're not sitting there waiting for this to come to sell our systems."

We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Our results were very solid and illustrate how far we've come and how quickly we're progressing on our journey from t",2330,"Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Our results were very solid and illustrate how far we've come and how quickly we're progressing on our journey from turnaround story to sustainable growth company. 
Revenues of $717.4 million exceeded expectations as all 4 of our businesses grew on a global basis, despite a difficult comparison resulting from very strong results in the prior year period. 
In our last call, we focused on the emergence of our surgical business as a growth driver. This quarter, surgical led the way with exceptional performance, but we're also pleased with how our breast imaging, molecular diagnostics and cytology businesses performed. And we made progress in strengthening our international franchises, which we believe will be important contributors to future growth.
Our performance this quarter highlighted the breadth of our top line growth drivers, which is often overlooked. Even as performance has improved ahead of schedule in many areas, new drivers are beginning to emerge, thanks to the deliberate and proactive efforts of our team. And while this quarter is only a single data point, our results do give us increased confidence that revenue growth can continue at a healthy pace in the future. 
Our third quarter results also demonstrated once again our ability to increase profitability above and beyond already high levels. We boosted both gross and operating margins even while reinvesting aggressively to drive future growth. We've been pleasantly surprised at our ability to achieve productivity gains and enjoying many other levers to drive earnings growth.
For example, strategies that we had expected to play out over the longer-term horizon are materializing sooner than expected. Various internal restructuring yielded a lower tax rate in the quarter. And the combination of strong cash flows and market volatility enabled us to buy back more shares. Together, all these efforts led to a very robust net margin of 20.2% in the quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.51 and excellent EPS growth of 18.6% on a non-GAAP basis.
Based on the strong earnings performance, we are raising our financial guidance for the year and now expect non-GAAP EPS of between $1.93 and $1.94. As a reminder, the mid-point of this new guidance is roughly $0.12 above our guidance at the beginning of the year. We're clearly exceeding our own expectations for a sustainable bottom line growth and feel good about our future prospects in this regard as well.
With that introduction out of the way, I'd like to walk through our revenue highlights in the balance of my remarks. Then Bob will discuss expenses, the rest of our financials and our updated guidance. Unless otherwise noted, percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. 
Starting with the big picture. Total revenues were $717.4 million in the third quarter, an increase of 3.4% on a reported basis or 3.6% in constant currency terms. These figures include a roughly $8 million headwind from divested and discontinued products, such as Sentinelle breast coils and the molecular test for cystic fibrosis. If we were to back out this headwind, total revenues would have been grown 4.8% in constant currency terms.
These growth rates are stacked on top of a very difficult comp from the prior year. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2015, total revenues increased 12.2% in constant currency. So our ability to jump over a high bar this quarter gives us increasing confidence in the ability of our commercial organization to drive solid growth next year and beyond.
In terms of geography. U.S. sales grew 4.7% in the third quarter, continuing a string of good results and indicating the improvements we've made in commercial execution. We continue to enjoy strong leadership positions and good momentum in the domestic marketplace. 
International sales declined 1.2% on a reported basis, driven primarily by blood screening, as expected. In constant currency, international sales declined 0.4%, essentially flat. And if we were to normalize for divested and discontinued products, international sales would have increased slightly. It's also worth mentioning that international sales increased sequentially as well, an encouraging sign. 
Overall, we believe our international results in the third quarter show we are building a foundation for strong and consistent growth over time. Toward that end, our Chief Operating Officer, Eric Compton, has made good progress in filling out our international leadership team in recent months. In last quarter's call, we highlighted new executives in charge of European Breast Health and Service as well as marketing, molecular diagnostics, surgical and regulatory. More recently, we have added new geographic sales leaders to run Latin America, Canada and Asia Pacific. So our efforts to upgrade talent are coming together nicely. 
Shifting to the types of revenue we generate. I want to emphasize that for all the attention our mammography systems receive, capital equipment represented just 23.4% of revenue in the third quarter. Said another way, more than 76% of our sales were recurring. More specifically, disposables, such as our diagnostic assays and surgical tools, represented 60.4%, 6-0 point 4 percent of sales, while service and other totaled 16.2% of sales.
Now let me discuss divisional revenues in the third quarter. I'll start with the growth leader in the quarter, our GYN Surgical business. A couple of years ago, no one would have said those words in the same sentence. But today, our team has achieved what others thought impossible. Worldwide surgical sales were $102 million, surpassing $100 million on a quarterly basis for the first time. Sales grew 19.8% in constant currency, the fastest growth rate for this division in recent memory. 
In the United States, the team delivered double-digit growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. And internationally, the business grew by nearly 40%, albeit off a very small base. 
As many of you know, a competitor recently withdrew its endometrial ablation product from the market. And to capitalize on this, we increased marketing and sales activities in the quarter. As a result, global sales of our NovaSure product totaled $61 million, an increase of 14.6% in constant currency. Not to be overlooked, sales of our MyoSure product for uterine fibroid removal also continued to show strength. Global MyoSure sales of $40.8 million increased 29.8% in constant currency. 
Now let's turn to Breast Health, which has received a lot of attention in recent months. While this is understandable and appropriate, it's just as important to appreciate that Hologic is much more than a mammography company today. Hopefully, our results this quarter help illustrate that point and provide confidence that the entire company can continue to grow revenue solidly and EPS much faster even as growth from 3D adoption naturally slows.
We're very pleased with our Breast Health performance in the quarter. Global sales of $282.5 million increased 1.1%. Breast imaging sales totaled $239.3 million, up 2.3% in constant currency, driven by continued adoption of our Genius 3D Mammography systems. Domestic imaging sales grew more rapidly and exceeded our internal expectations based on Genius placements, which increased both sequentially and year-over-year. 
We estimate the Genius systems are continuing to gain market share while our investments in customer marketing help us maintain stable prices amid fierce competition. We still have lots to look forward to in Breast Health. Genius systems represent less than 40% of our own mammography installed base today, and by our estimate, less than 25% of the market as a whole. And we remain confident in the long-term conversion opportunity as evidence continues to mount on the benefits of Hologic's Genius exams for patients and physicians and as we differentiate ourselves competitively.
As evidence of this, mammography customers recently surveyed by the independent market research firm KLAS scored Hologic highest in overall product satisfaction. One Director of radiology said, ""Hologic seems to be the only company that really understands the tomosynthesis market. It was clear from our implementation and our usage of their system that they are a full generation ahead of other vendors. Everybody else is playing catch-up."" This is only one anecdotal comment, but it's consistent with the customer feedback we receive every day and validates our leadership position. 
As our installed base Genius 3D systems grows, our sales and marketing programs are focusing on ways to leverage this leadership position. For example, service revenue is becoming increasingly important and represents an annuity that complements and smooths out our capital sales. Some of you may not appreciate the size of our service business in Breast Health. To frame it for you, service revenue in this business exceeded $100 million in the quarter for the first time and grew at a mid single-digit rate.
Similarly, we have revamped our research and development efforts to capitalize on our growing Genius footprint and generated more continuous stream of product innovations. For example, we recently launched our new Affirm prone biopsy system, which provides a better patient experience and enables doctors to capitalize on the increased sensitivity of 3D technology. Although it's still early days, customer feedback on this system has been positive, both in the United States and internationally.
Another component of future growth in Breast Health will be our international business. While we still have a lot of work to do here, we are making good progress and are optimistic that the business is becoming healthier and more predictable as we create the foundation for solid growth in 2017 and beyond. In the third quarter, international Breast Health sales declined 2.9% in constant currency. But if we back out the headwind from divested and discontinued products, sales would have been flat. And on a sequential basis, sales increased slightly.
With this in mind, I want to remind everyone that last year's international Breast Health number was exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we anticipate a year-over-year decline in the coming quarter before the business returns to growth in 2017. As we move into 2017, we do believe that the combination of multiple tailwinds, our still underpenetrated 3D opportunity, growing service revenue, a revitalized R&D effort and international expansion will enable Breast Health to be an important contributor to corporate growth.
Now let's cover diagnostics, which is our largest business and greatest source of non-GAAP operating profit. Diagnostics reported sales of $309.9 million in the third quarter, growing 1.2% in constant currency. Within diagnostics, our cytology and molecular businesses performed well while our blood screening business declined as expected. Global sales of cytology in perinatal products totaled $122.2 million, growing 3.9% on a constant currency basis. Breaking this down a little further, both our ThinPrep and fetal fibronectin franchises grew in the United States and internationally despite lingering headwinds from Pap interval expansion domestically.
Turning to molecular diagnostics. We posted global sales of $131.8 million, up 6.0% in constant currency. Excluding sales of our discontinued cystic fibrosis product, molecular sales would have grown at a high single-digit rate. Our domestic business was solid as our fully automated Panther system continues to accumulate new placements and competitive wins and as utilization of our assays for Trichomonas, HPV and chlamydia gonorrhea continues to grow. 
But the real standout here was our international business. Over the last couple of quarters, international molecular sales have turned slightly positive under new leadership, and we had added viral load assays to the Panther menu. Building on this, the business took a significant step ahead in the third quarter with constant currency growth exceeding 20%. 
In addition, we had a record quarter of Panther placements outside the United States, coupled with a significant step-up in per instrument utilization. All these data points have us feeling good about the potential for international molecular diagnostics to become a new driver of growth for the company over time.
Shifting back to the United States for a moment. During the third quarter, we gained an emergency use authorization for our Zika virus test for diagnostic use. In addition, blood banks began testing donated blood for Zika with our Procleix assay under an investigational new drug protocol. While we do not expect significant sales from these 2 new products, both of which run on the Panther system, our ability to rapidly develop these test shows we can react quickly to public health emergencies in close cooperation with regulators and customers. In addition, should the Zika virus spread in the United States, we will be well positioned in the marketplace.
Apart from the highlight of the Zika IND, our blood screening business declined in the quarter as expected. Worldwide sales of blood screening products were $55.9 million, down 12.9%, with all the decline coming outside the United States. As in the second quarter, this decline was mainly due to stronger ordering in the prior year period to support testing at the Japanese Red Cross combined with continued trends toward lower blood utilization.
Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me wrap up the review of product sales by mentioning that our Skeletal Health division posted revenues of $23.0 million in the quarter. This represented a constant currency increase of 4.8% with growth both domestically and overseas, primarily driven by our Horizon bone density scanner.
So in conclusion, we are very pleased with our third quarter financial results and with the progress we've made toward building a sustainable growth company. Despite very challenging prior year comps, all 4 of our businesses grew in the quarter, reflecting the many growth drivers at our disposal. 
Sales growth in the U.S. Breast Health slowed to a challenging prior year comp, but remained healthy. At the same time, strong results in surgical, molecular diagnostics and cytology demonstrated that Hologic is much more than a mammography company. We continued to execute well in the United States and made good progress building a foundation for international growth. We once again expanded profit margins and redeployed capital, contributing to EPS growth at the highest rate in many years. 
Now I will hand the call over to Bob."

I'm going to walk through the rest of our third quarter income statement, highlight a few balance sheet and cash flow items, and then wrap up with updated financial guidance for 2016. As a reminder, I will",1503,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to walk through the rest of our third quarter income statement, highlight a few balance sheet and cash flow items, and then wrap up with updated financial guidance for 2016. 
As a reminder, I will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. As Steve discussed, our revenue performance in the third quarter exceeded expectations, highlighted by global growth in all 4 business segments. This growth, coupled with favorable product mix and productivity gains, again drove improvements in gross and operating margins. At the same time, we continued to invest in initiatives that position us for long-term sustainable growth. Net-net, we delivered EPS growth well in excess of sales, reflecting the impact of operational improvements, capital deployment and a lower effective tax rate.
Now let's dive deeper into the third quarter income statement. Gross margin of 65.7% increased 50 basis points and benefited from the growth of our surgical, cytology and perinatal and Aptima franchises. We continue to manage pricing well as we focus on commercial excellence, and our marketing initiatives highlight the clinical and economic value of our products. 
In addition, our operations teams continue to drive efficiencies and reduce cost across our supply chain. Total operating expenses of $229.2 million increased 3.1% in the third quarter. This increase was driven primarily by sales and marketing expense, which increased 15.5%.
Given our gross margin expansion, we have invested deliberately and opportunistically in commercial areas where we see a good return. These include our Genius marketing campaign in Breast Health, our cervical cancer co-testing initiatives in Diagnostics and efforts to gain competitive market share with NovaSure. These strategic initiatives are paying off through increased brand awareness, market share gains and price stability, all of which contribute to higher sales.
Despite the increased sales and marketing spending, operating margins improved 60 basis points in the quarter, slightly more than gross margins based primarily on leverage in general and administrative expenses. 
Moving down the P&L. Interest expense of $33.9 million was 12% lower than in prior year due to our efforts to both reduce and restructure our debt. And in addition, our tax rate is improving earlier than expected based on changes in our income mix and internal restructurings implemented this year and last. We now estimate that our effective tax rate will be around 32% for the full year 2016.
We trued up to this rate in the third quarter, reducing our effective rate to 30.6%, but we expect the rate to normalize back to 32% in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, our tax rate was 34.25% just last year. So we are making good progress.
We are pleased that these efforts have enabled us to grow net profits even faster than operating profit. Our net margin was 20.2% in the quarter, a very strong level and an improvement of 190 basis points over the prior year. 
To wrap up the income statement review, diluted shares outstanding were 282 million in the third quarter, roughly 10 million lower than a year ago. Over the course of this year, we have worked to pay down a portion of the in-the-money converts to reduce the dilutive effects. And more recently, we have taken advantage of market volatility to repurchase our common stock. 
In the third quarter, we bought back 3 million shares of stock for $101.2 million, which exhausted our prior $250 million repurchase authorization. Recently, our Board of Directors has approved an additional $500 million repurchase program, and we're very pleased to have that arrow in our quiver going forward. 
While we're pleased with the progress we've made, thus far, in improving our capital structure and achieving a more competitive tax rate compared to other med tech companies, we know we can continue to improve. And we believe these improvements will help us deliver EPS growth much faster than revenue over an extended period of time.
Now I'd like to highlight a few balance sheet and cash flow items, beginning with inventory. Inventory decreased by $14.5 million or 4.9% compared to a year ago despite a 3.4% increase in sales. This speaks to the strong alignment between the operations and sales teams, who know that every dollar saved in the inventory serves as dry powder for debt reduction, acquisitions or share repurchase. 
And speaking of our debt, at the end of the third quarter, total debt outstanding was $3.4 billion, a decrease of more than $0.5 billion from a year ago. During the quarter, we paid off $175 million that had been outstanding on our $1 billion revolving line of credit using proceeds borrowed at a lower interest rate under a new $200 million accounts receivable securitization program.
Adjusted non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, totaled $262.5 million in the third quarter, an increase of 5.1%. Based on EBITDA of more than $1 billion over the last 12 months, our leverage ratio calculated as net principal debt over EBITDA, stands at 2.97. The first time this ratio has fallen below 3 since the Gen-Probe acquisition.
In addition, we are well on our way to achieving our target leverage ratio of 2.5x by the end of fiscal 2017. Strong profit growth and lower debt have continued to improve our return on invested capital, or ROIC, which was 12.3% on a trailing 12-month basis, a 170 basis points increase over the prior year. 
Robust cash flows and minimal capital expenditures continue to be hallmarks of Hologic's financial performance. Operating cash flow was $246.2 million in the third quarter, an increase of 1.6%. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $225.1 million. Notably, free cash flow was 55.1% higher than non-GAAP net income. Our financial health clearly extends well beyond our P&L as we continue to focus on working capital and control our capital expenditures.
Now let's turn to our updated financial guidance for the full year and fourth quarter. At the midpoint, we are raising both revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance based on the company's strong performance in the third quarter. Let's cover the revenue guidance first. 
For the full year, we are increasing our previous guidance by $10 million at the low end and now expect total revenues of between $2.82 billion and $2.83 billion for fiscal 2016. This represents solid mid-single-digit growth of 4.3% to 4.6% on a reported basis, or 5% to 5.3% in constant currency terms, despite the headwind from divested and discontinued products. 
With only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance obviously implies revenues of $714 million to $724 million in the fourth quarter. Compared to the prior year period, which is another tough comp, this range reflects revenue growth of 1.6% to 3.0% on a reported basis, or 2.1% to 3.6% in constant currency terms. In addition, our guidance includes an expected headwind of roughly $4.5 million from divested and discontinued products, which depresses our constant currency guidance by about 60 basis points.
Based on our revenue range, our fourth quarter guidance implies that revenues will be about the same or slightly above our third quarter actuals. We no longer expect the significant sequential step-up implied by our prior guidance as some revenue that we originally forecast in the fourth quarter materialized a little bit earlier than expected. In addition, we forecast another quarter of incremental softness in blood screening sales as inventories and ordering patterns continue to normalize.
Turning to our updated bottom line guidance. We now forecast non-GAAP EPS of between $1.93 and $1.94 for the full year. This translates to reported growth between 15.5%-- 15 .6% and 16.2% in constant currency growth between 16.9% and 17.5%. This earnings guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates, a full year tax rate of 32% and diluted shares outstanding approximately 288 million for the full year.
This full year guidance translates to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.49 to $0.50 in the fourth quarter. This represents growth of 14% to 16.3% on a reported basis or 15% to 17.3% in constant currency terms. Implicit in our fourth quarter guidance is a sequential increase in operating expenses, several million dollars of which relate to a change in the retirement provisions of our equity plan that will make it more consistent with peers. 
Before opening up the call for questions, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with the financial results we achieved so far in fiscal 2016. From a revenue perspective, our surgical business continues to exceed expectations. We still enjoy momentum with Genius 3D Mammography, remain pleased with our molecular diagnostics and ThinPrep businesses and are turning the corner internationally. And from an earnings perspective, we continue to generate tremendous growth through gross and operating margin improvement and lower tax rate and capital deployment.
With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are ready for the first question."

We actually hired a new leader for our European diagnostics business really just about a year ago. It was last summer. And he has been revamping the team, getting up to speed. And then we did launch-- we got the clearance, if you recall, early this year, what, really, early this calendar year, to the viral loads. We've got the HCV, HPV and HIV. So they're rolling out in conjunction with the new leadership team and the Panther placements. And those things are really driving it. Zika, by the way, is not in those numbers. So that's really just our core women's health assays, plus the viral load. So I think what we're excited about, as we start to look forward in Diagnostics -- molecular is effectively been nonexistent outside the U.S. and -- not nonexistent, but pretty small. And now we're really getting that footprint. And as we're placing this Panther, it's starting feel like, okay, this is the beginning of something that really is sustainable and have some good growth ahead of it. As well, the cytology business continues to tick along as well with some modest growth outside the U.S. also."

I think what we've seen, the new leader within the European diagnostics business, he's bringing a level of focus. He's building out a team. There were some people there. He's changed some out, gotten the others to operate up, but really is starting to build it up. And I think that's what Eric Compton has really been driving, especially this year, is getting the right people in place for the longer term. Yes, just anecdotally, Bob and I happened to be in Japan last week. And again, half of our employees in Japan have been with us less than a year. So it truly is, we look at a company of our size from the outside and think, okay, they just have to get it going and turn around what's there. This really is building it out. So I think we've seen some emerging signs in Diagnostics over the last couple of quarters, didn't want to quite say yet until we thought, okay, this is now sustainable. And I think we're in the same infrastructure building in Breast Health and other stuff. Breast Health because more dealers involved, we'll probably take a little bit longer. But I will tell you underneath the surface, we're feeling very good where, as I always say, the infrastructure gets better before the numbers show it.

Having said that, I'd remind everybody. As we said, this was our sixth straight quarter of double-digit growth, both domestically and globally, for our GYN surge business. So that business had turned it around, had strengthened dramatically and was then well poised when they -- competitive issue happened. So we're taking advantage of it. MyoSure continues to grow. And I think the way we think about our GYN surge business here is we're not ready to declare it a sustainable double-digit grower, but it's clearly a very solid grower. And again, this is one, where, internationally, we're just in the very early stages as well. So again, it's moved from, what I'd call, an appendage on the company a couple of years ago to something that can actually start to meaningfully contribute to our total growth. It's also hugely accretive to our gross margin, operating margin. It's a great cash generator. There's a lot of good things, and it's helping on our tax rate, frankly."

So when we bring the viral loads, which to the second part of your question, is really an '18, a fiscal 2018 and probably really second half-ish of '18 by the time we have all 3. So we will have likely one much sooner. But by the time we have HPV, HCV and HIV, it'll be later on in '18. And by that point, we'll be launching in the U.S. from a much bigger installed base,a much stronger position overall. So I think the fact we're able to even have some success in Europe than other people's backyards is already an increasingly encouraging sign for it when we do come to the States."

So whatever -- and I think the bigger point I was trying to make last time is, by the way, wherever revenue guidance ends up, we believe we'll deliver EPS growth at a multiple of that. I think that was the broader point I was trying to make that held better. We're feeling about the earnings growth, but do feel incrementally better about the sales growth."

Or given what you see on cash flow and what Bob said about the levels of debt by the end of '17, is next year a year where M&A can become more active in terms of deal consummation?

And we made progress in strengthening our international franchises, which we believe will be important contributors to future growth.
Our performance this quarter highlighted the breadth of our top line growth drivers, which is often overlooked. Even as performance has improved ahead of schedule in many areas, new drivers are beginning to emerge, thanks to the deliberate and proactive efforts of our team. And while this quarter is only a single data point, our results do give us increased confidence that revenue growth can continue at a healthy pace in the future. 
Our third quarter results also demonstrated once again our ability to increase profitability above and beyond already high levels. We boosted both gross and operating margins even while reinvesting aggressively to drive future growth. We've been pleasantly surprised at our ability to achieve productivity gains and enjoying many other levers to drive earnings growth.
For example, strategies that we had expected to play out over the longer-term horizon are materializing sooner than expected. Various internal restructuring yielded a lower tax rate in the quarter. And the combination of strong cash flows and market volatility enabled us to buy back more shares. Together, all these efforts led to a very robust net margin of 20.2% in the quarter, non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.51 and excellent EPS growth of 18.6% on a non-GAAP basis.
Based on the strong earnings performance, we are raising our financial guidance for the year and now expect non-GAAP EPS of between $1.93 and $1.94. As a reminder, the mid-point of this new guidance is roughly $0.12 above our guidance at the beginning of the year. We're clearly exceeding our own expectations for a sustainable bottom line growth and feel good about our future prospects in this regard as well.
With that introduction out of the way, I'd like to walk through our revenue highlights in the balance of my remarks. Then Bob will discuss expenses, the rest of our financials and our updated guidance. Unless otherwise noted, percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis. 
Starting with the big picture. Total revenues were $717.4 million in the third quarter, an increase of 3.4% on a reported basis or 3.6% in constant currency terms. These figures include a roughly $8 million headwind from divested and discontinued products, such as Sentinelle breast coils and the molecular test for cystic fibrosis. If we were to back out this headwind, total revenues would have been grown 4.8% in constant currency terms.
These growth rates are stacked on top of a very difficult comp from the prior year. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2015, total revenues increased 12.2% in constant currency. So our ability to jump over a high bar this quarter gives us increasing confidence in the ability of our commercial organization to drive solid growth next year and beyond.
In terms of geography. U.S. sales grew 4.7% in the third quarter, continuing a string of good results and indicating the improvements we've made in commercial execution. We continue to enjoy strong leadership positions and good momentum in the domestic marketplace. 
International sales declined 1.2% on a reported basis, driven primarily by blood screening, as expected. In constant currency, international sales declined 0.4%, essentially flat. And if we were to normalize for divested and discontinued products, international sales would have increased slightly. It's also worth mentioning that international sales increased sequentially as well, an encouraging sign. 
Overall, we believe our international results in the third quarter show we are building a foundation for strong and consistent growth over time. Toward that end, our Chief Operating Officer, Eric Compton, has made good progress in filling out our international leadership team in recent months. In last quarter's call, we highlighted new executives in charge of European Breast Health and Service as well as marketing, molecular diagnostics, surgical and regulatory. More recently, we have added new geographic sales leaders to run Latin America, Canada and Asia Pacific. So our efforts to upgrade talent are coming together nicely. 
Shifting to the types of revenue we generate. I want to emphasize that for all the attention our mammography systems receive, capital equipment represented just 23.4% of revenue in the third quarter. Said another way, more than 76% of our sales were recurring. More specifically, disposables, such as our diagnostic assays and surgical tools, represented 60.4%, 6-0 point 4 percent of sales, while service and other totaled 16.2% of sales.
Now let me discuss divisional revenues in the third quarter. I'll start with the growth leader in the quarter, our GYN Surgical business. A couple of years ago, no one would have said those words in the same sentence. But today, our team has achieved what others thought impossible. Worldwide surgical sales were $102 million, surpassing $100 million on a quarterly basis for the first time. Sales grew 19.8% in constant currency, the fastest growth rate for this division in recent memory. 
In the United States, the team delivered double-digit growth for the sixth consecutive quarter. And internationally, the business grew by nearly 40%, albeit off a very small base. 
As many of you know, a competitor recently withdrew its endometrial ablation product from the market. And to capitalize on this, we increased marketing and sales activities in the quarter. As a result, global sales of our NovaSure product totaled $61 million, an increase of 14.6% in constant currency. Not to be overlooked, sales of our MyoSure product for uterine fibroid removal also continued to show strength. Global MyoSure sales of $40.8 million increased 29.8% in constant currency. 
Now let's turn to Breast Health, which has received a lot of attention in recent months. While this is understandable and appropriate, it's just as important to appreciate that Hologic is much more than a mammography company today. Hopefully, our results this quarter help illustrate that point and provide confidence that the entire company can continue to grow revenue solidly and EPS much faster even as growth from 3D adoption naturally slows.
We're very pleased with our Breast Health performance in the quarter. Global sales of $282.5 million increased 1.1%. Breast imaging sales totaled $239.3 million, up 2.3% in constant currency, driven by continued adoption of our Genius 3D Mammography systems. Domestic imaging sales grew more rapidly and exceeded our internal expectations based on Genius placements, which increased both sequentially and year-over-year. 
We estimate the Genius systems are continuing to gain market share while our investments in customer marketing help us maintain stable prices amid fierce competition. We still have lots to look forward to in Breast Health. Genius systems represent less than 40% of our own mammography installed base today, and by our estimate, less than 25% of the market as a whole. And we remain confident in the long-term conversion opportunity as evidence continues to mount on the benefits of Hologic's Genius exams for patients and physicians and as we differentiate ourselves competitively.
As evidence of this, mammography customers recently surveyed by the independent market research firm KLAS scored Hologic highest in overall product satisfaction. One Director of radiology said, ""Hologic seems to be the only company that really understands the tomosynthesis market. It was clear from our implementation and our usage of their system that they are a full generation ahead of other vendors. Everybody else is playing catch-up."" This is only one anecdotal comment, but it's consistent with the customer feedback we receive every day and validates our leadership position. 
As our installed base Genius 3D systems grows, our sales and marketing programs are focusing on ways to leverage this leadership position. For example, service revenue is becoming increasingly important and represents an annuity that complements and smooths out our capital sales. Some of you may not appreciate the size of our service business in Breast Health. To frame it for you, service revenue in this business exceeded $100 million in the quarter for the first time and grew at a mid single-digit rate.
Similarly, we have revamped our research and development efforts to capitalize on our growing Genius footprint and generated more continuous stream of product innovations. For example, we recently launched our new Affirm prone biopsy system, which provides a better patient experience and enables doctors to capitalize on the increased sensitivity of 3D technology. Although it's still early days, customer feedback on this system has been positive, both in the United States and internationally.
Another component of future growth in Breast Health will be our international business. While we still have a lot of work to do here, we are making good progress and are optimistic that the business is becoming healthier and more predictable as we create the foundation for solid growth in 2017 and beyond. In the third quarter, international Breast Health sales declined 2.9% in constant currency. But if we back out the headwind from divested and discontinued products, sales would have been flat. And on a sequential basis, sales increased slightly.
With this in mind, I want to remind everyone that last year's international Breast Health number was exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter. And as a result, we anticipate a year-over-year decline in the coming quarter before the business returns to growth in 2017. As we move into 2017, we do believe that the combination of multiple tailwinds, our still underpenetrated 3D opportunity, growing service revenue, a revitalized R&D effort and international expansion will enable Breast Health to be an important contributor to corporate growth.
Now let's cover diagnostics, which is our largest business and greatest source of non-GAAP operating profit. Diagnostics reported sales of $309.9 million in the third quarter, growing 1.2% in constant currency. Within diagnostics, our cytology and molecular businesses performed well while our blood screening business declined as expected. Global sales of cytology in perinatal products totaled $122.2 million, growing 3.9% on a constant currency basis. Breaking this down a little further, both our ThinPrep and fetal fibronectin franchises grew in the United States and internationally despite lingering headwinds from Pap interval expansion domestically.
Turning to molecular diagnostics. We posted global sales of $131.8 million, up 6.0% in constant currency. Excluding sales of our discontinued cystic fibrosis product, molecular sales would have grown at a high single-digit rate. Our domestic business was solid as our fully automated Panther system continues to accumulate new placements and competitive wins and as utilization of our assays for Trichomonas, HPV and chlamydia gonorrhea continues to grow. 
But the real standout here was our international business. Over the last couple of quarters, international molecular sales have turned slightly positive under new leadership, and we had added viral load assays to the Panther menu. Building on this, the business took a significant step ahead in the third quarter with constant currency growth exceeding 20%. 
In addition, we had a record quarter of Panther placements outside the United States, coupled with a significant step-up in per instrument utilization. All these data points have us feeling good about the potential for international molecular diagnostics to become a new driver of growth for the company over time.
Shifting back to the United States for a moment. During the third quarter, we gained an emergency use authorization for our Zika virus test for diagnostic use. In addition, blood banks began testing donated blood for Zika with our Procleix assay under an investigational new drug protocol. While we do not expect significant sales from these 2 new products, both of which run on the Panther system, our ability to rapidly develop these test shows we can react quickly to public health emergencies in close cooperation with regulators and customers. In addition, should the Zika virus spread in the United States, we will be well positioned in the marketplace.
Apart from the highlight of the Zika IND, our blood screening business declined in the quarter as expected. Worldwide sales of blood screening products were $55.9 million, down 12.9%, with all the decline coming outside the United States. As in the second quarter, this decline was mainly due to stronger ordering in the prior year period to support testing at the Japanese Red Cross combined with continued trends toward lower blood utilization.
Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me wrap up the review of product sales by mentioning that our Skeletal Health division posted revenues of $23.0 million in the quarter. This represented a constant currency increase of 4.8% with growth both domestically and overseas, primarily driven by our Horizon bone density scanner.
So in conclusion, we are very pleased with our third quarter financial results and with the progress we've made toward building a sustainable growth company. Despite very challenging prior year comps, all 4 of our businesses grew in the quarter, reflecting the many growth drivers at our disposal. 
Sales growth in the U.S. Breast Health slowed to a challenging prior year comp, but remained healthy. At the same time, strong results in surgical, molecular diagnostics and cytology demonstrated that Hologic is much more than a mammography company. We continued to execute well in the United States and made good progress building a foundation for international growth. We once again expanded profit margins and redeployed capital, contributing to EPS growth at the highest rate in many years. 
Now I will hand the call over to Bob."
108544,370563080,1014846,"Hologic Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Hologic, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to walk through the rest of our third quarter income statement, highlight a few balance sheet and cash flow items, and then wrap up with updated financial guidance for 2016. As a reminder, I will",1503,"Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to walk through the rest of our third quarter income statement, highlight a few balance sheet and cash flow items, and then wrap up with updated financial guidance for 2016. 
As a reminder, I will focus on non-GAAP results, and percentage changes will be on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. As Steve discussed, our revenue performance in the third quarter exceeded expectations, highlighted by global growth in all 4 business segments. This growth, coupled with favorable product mix and productivity gains, again drove improvements in gross and operating margins. At the same time, we continued to invest in initiatives that position us for long-term sustainable growth. Net-net, we delivered EPS growth well in excess of sales, reflecting the impact of operational improvements, capital deployment and a lower effective tax rate.
Now let's dive deeper into the third quarter income statement. Gross margin of 65.7% increased 50 basis points and benefited from the growth of our surgical, cytology and perinatal and Aptima franchises. We continue to manage pricing well as we focus on commercial excellence, and our marketing initiatives highlight the clinical and economic value of our products. 
In addition, our operations teams continue to drive efficiencies and reduce cost across our supply chain. Total operating expenses of $229.2 million increased 3.1% in the third quarter. This increase was driven primarily by sales and marketing expense, which increased 15.5%.
Given our gross margin expansion, we have invested deliberately and opportunistically in commercial areas where we see a good return. These include our Genius marketing campaign in Breast Health, our cervical cancer co-testing initiatives in Diagnostics and efforts to gain competitive market share with NovaSure. These strategic initiatives are paying off through increased brand awareness, market share gains and price stability, all of which contribute to higher sales.
Despite the increased sales and marketing spending, operating margins improved 60 basis points in the quarter, slightly more than gross margins based primarily on leverage in general and administrative expenses. 
Moving down the P&L. Interest expense of $33.9 million was 12% lower than in prior year due to our efforts to both reduce and restructure our debt. And in addition, our tax rate is improving earlier than expected based on changes in our income mix and internal restructurings implemented this year and last. We now estimate that our effective tax rate will be around 32% for the full year 2016.
We trued up to this rate in the third quarter, reducing our effective rate to 30.6%, but we expect the rate to normalize back to 32% in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, our tax rate was 34.25% just last year. So we are making good progress.
We are pleased that these efforts have enabled us to grow net profits even faster than operating profit. Our net margin was 20.2% in the quarter, a very strong level and an improvement of 190 basis points over the prior year. 
To wrap up the income statement review, diluted shares outstanding were 282 million in the third quarter, roughly 10 million lower than a year ago. Over the course of this year, we have worked to pay down a portion of the in-the-money converts to reduce the dilutive effects. And more recently, we have taken advantage of market volatility to repurchase our common stock. 
In the third quarter, we bought back 3 million shares of stock for $101.2 million, which exhausted our prior $250 million repurchase authorization. Recently, our Board of Directors has approved an additional $500 million repurchase program, and we're very pleased to have that arrow in our quiver going forward. 
While we're pleased with the progress we've made, thus far, in improving our capital structure and achieving a more competitive tax rate compared to other med tech companies, we know we can continue to improve. And we believe these improvements will help us deliver EPS growth much faster than revenue over an extended period of time.
Now I'd like to highlight a few balance sheet and cash flow items, beginning with inventory. Inventory decreased by $14.5 million or 4.9% compared to a year ago despite a 3.4% increase in sales. This speaks to the strong alignment between the operations and sales teams, who know that every dollar saved in the inventory serves as dry powder for debt reduction, acquisitions or share repurchase. 
And speaking of our debt, at the end of the third quarter, total debt outstanding was $3.4 billion, a decrease of more than $0.5 billion from a year ago. During the quarter, we paid off $175 million that had been outstanding on our $1 billion revolving line of credit using proceeds borrowed at a lower interest rate under a new $200 million accounts receivable securitization program.
Adjusted non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, totaled $262.5 million in the third quarter, an increase of 5.1%. Based on EBITDA of more than $1 billion over the last 12 months, our leverage ratio calculated as net principal debt over EBITDA, stands at 2.97. The first time this ratio has fallen below 3 since the Gen-Probe acquisition.
In addition, we are well on our way to achieving our target leverage ratio of 2.5x by the end of fiscal 2017. Strong profit growth and lower debt have continued to improve our return on invested capital, or ROIC, which was 12.3% on a trailing 12-month basis, a 170 basis points increase over the prior year. 
Robust cash flows and minimal capital expenditures continue to be hallmarks of Hologic's financial performance. Operating cash flow was $246.2 million in the third quarter, an increase of 1.6%. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, was $225.1 million. Notably, free cash flow was 55.1% higher than non-GAAP net income. Our financial health clearly extends well beyond our P&L as we continue to focus on working capital and control our capital expenditures.
Now let's turn to our updated financial guidance for the full year and fourth quarter. At the midpoint, we are raising both revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance based on the company's strong performance in the third quarter. Let's cover the revenue guidance first. 
For the full year, we are increasing our previous guidance by $10 million at the low end and now expect total revenues of between $2.82 billion and $2.83 billion for fiscal 2016. This represents solid mid-single-digit growth of 4.3% to 4.6% on a reported basis, or 5% to 5.3% in constant currency terms, despite the headwind from divested and discontinued products. 
With only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance obviously implies revenues of $714 million to $724 million in the fourth quarter. Compared to the prior year period, which is another tough comp, this range reflects revenue growth of 1.6% to 3.0% on a reported basis, or 2.1% to 3.6% in constant currency terms. In addition, our guidance includes an expected headwind of roughly $4.5 million from divested and discontinued products, which depresses our constant currency guidance by about 60 basis points.
Based on our revenue range, our fourth quarter guidance implies that revenues will be about the same or slightly above our third quarter actuals. We no longer expect the significant sequential step-up implied by our prior guidance as some revenue that we originally forecast in the fourth quarter materialized a little bit earlier than expected. In addition, we forecast another quarter of incremental softness in blood screening sales as inventories and ordering patterns continue to normalize.
Turning to our updated bottom line guidance. We now forecast non-GAAP EPS of between $1.93 and $1.94 for the full year. This translates to reported growth between 15.5%-- 15 .6% and 16.2% in constant currency growth between 16.9% and 17.5%. This earnings guidance is based on recent foreign exchange rates, a full year tax rate of 32% and diluted shares outstanding approximately 288 million for the full year.
This full year guidance translates to non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.49 to $0.50 in the fourth quarter. This represents growth of 14% to 16.3% on a reported basis or 15% to 17.3% in constant currency terms. Implicit in our fourth quarter guidance is a sequential increase in operating expenses, several million dollars of which relate to a change in the retirement provisions of our equity plan that will make it more consistent with peers. 
Before opening up the call for questions, I want to reiterate how pleased we are with the financial results we achieved so far in fiscal 2016. From a revenue perspective, our surgical business continues to exceed expectations. We still enjoy momentum with Genius 3D Mammography, remain pleased with our molecular diagnostics and ThinPrep businesses and are turning the corner internationally. And from an earnings perspective, we continue to generate tremendous growth through gross and operating margin improvement and lower tax rate and capital deployment.
With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are ready for the first question."

So they're rolling out in conjunction with the new leadership team and the Panther placements. And those things are really driving it. Zika, by the way, is not in those numbers. So that's really just our core women's health assays, plus the viral load. So I think what we're excited about, as we start to look forward in Diagnostics -- molecular is effectively been nonexistent outside the U.S. and -- not nonexistent, but pretty small. And now we're really getting that footprint. And as we're placing this Panther, it's starting feel like, okay, this is the beginning of something that really is sustainable and have some good growth ahead of it. As well, the cytology business continues to tick along as well with some modest growth outside the U.S. also."

He's changed some out, gotten the others to operate up, but really is starting to build it up. And I think that's what Eric Compton has really been driving, especially this year, is getting the right people in place for the longer term. Yes, just anecdotally, Bob and I happened to be in Japan last week. And again, half of our employees in Japan have been with us less than a year. So it truly is, we look at a company of our size from the outside and think, okay, they just have to get it going and turn around what's there. This really is building it out. So I think we've seen some emerging signs in Diagnostics over the last couple of quarters, didn't want to quite say yet until we thought, okay, this is now sustainable. And I think we're in the same infrastructure building in Breast Health and other stuff. Breast Health because more dealers involved, we'll probably take a little bit longer. But I will tell you underneath the surface, we're feeling very good where, as I always say, the infrastructure gets better before the numbers show it. And I think that's kind of the stages that we're in right now."

Having said that, I'd remind everybody. As we said, this was our sixth straight quarter of double-digit growth, both domestically and globally, for our GYN surge business. So that business had turned it around, had strengthened dramatically and was then well poised when they -- competitive issue happened. So we're taking advantage of it. MyoSure continues to grow. And I think the way we think about our GYN surge business here is we're not ready to declare it a sustainable double-digit grower, but it's clearly a very solid grower. And again, this is one, where, internationally, we're just in the very early stages as well. So again, it's moved from, what I'd call, an appendage on the company a couple of years ago to something that can actually start to meaningfully contribute to our total growth.

So that's some of the -- we think that there still is legs there, as Steve said. But that ramp has actually happened nicely for us in the third quarter."

So when we bring the viral loads, which to the second part of your question, is really an '18, a fiscal 2018 and probably really second half-ish of '18 by the time we have all 3. So we will have likely one much sooner. But by the time we have HPV, HCV and HIV, it'll be later on in '18. And by that point, we'll be launching in the U.S. from a much bigger installed base,a much stronger position overall.

I would say on the business development front, everybody should know, we've gotten much more active. We've said no to a number of things over the last quarter or 2, and I think a lot of that has been our teams getting very much more disciplined about what we're looking at, and more active.

And I think that's what leads us back to the stronger for longer that, A, the market's not going to grow by 25% this year. But it's going to be there, and it's there for us as we keep converting."

We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We once again posted strong results that illustrate the progress we're making toward building a sustainable growth company. In addition, our results capped off a very good fiscal 2016, in which we delivered on our commitments. Today, our I'll first provide a high-level overview of our fourth quarter results. But since it's the end of our fiscal year, we'd also like to provide a strategic update on the journey we've shared over the last 3 years. We'll focus on a revenue and financial drivers for the full year and provide some color on the behind-the-scenes progress we're making in research and development. 
Let's start with our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $726.8 million grew 3.4% on a reported basis or 3.8% in constant currency, a healthy performance despite a difficult comparison to the prior year period. We also absorbed a headwind of nearly $4 million from divested and discontinued products. Net of these, total revenues would have grown 4.4% in constant currency. 
Our Surgical business again, set the pace with its seventh straight quarter of double-digit growth globally. We are also pleased with how our breast imaging and molecular diagnostics businesses performed and encouraged that new products began to contribute to growth. We'll come back to this point in a minute. 
In terms of geography, U.S. sales grew 7.4% in the quarter, continuing a string of strong results. Even if we exclude the $5 million royalty payment from our fourth quarter results, our growth rate accelerated on a sequential basis. 
As expected, international sales declined 9.6% as reported, or 7.8% in constant currency versus a difficult comparison in the prior year period. Apart from this tough comp, international Breast Health was stable sequentially in the quarter. There were also some pockets of strength globally namely molecular diagnostics and Surgical, both of which posted double-digit growth. Although these businesses are relatively small today outside the U.S., we believe they will be important growth drivers in 2017 and beyond. 
Profit margins remained robust in the quarter. Most importantly, non-GAAP net income grew 14.6%, more than 3x faster than sales. And our net margin of 20% increased by 190 basis points. With the benefit of additional capital deployment, we posted non-GAAP EPS of $0.52, or 20.9% better than in the prior year period. So all in all, we posted a very strong fourth quarter that exceeded expectations and capped off an excellent year. 
Thinking about the year as a whole, we made good progress in our journey from turnaround story to sustainable growth company. To date, our successes have been most visible in domestic sales execution, which in turn has driven the improved financial performance of the company. One of the first goals we established 3 years ago was to stabilize 2 highly profitable products that had been declining sharply: ThinPrep and NovaSure. In 2016, these products were more than stable, they returned to solid growth. Cytology and perinatal sales increased 2% on the year in constant currency. Even more impressive, NovaSure sales grew 10% in constant currency as our team capitalized on the market withdrawal of a competing product. 
As we stabilized ThinPrep and NovaSure, we also set out to maximize growth drivers such as Genius 3D Mammography systems and the Panther platform in molecular diagnostics. Both of these product performed well in 2016. 
Genius drove 5.2% constant-currency growth in total Breast Health sales in 2016 and we remained bullish on the opportunity ahead of us. While, there has been lots of debate about a key consistent placements, we have a fundamentally different and more positive view of the future. The 3D curve is very different than the 2D curve for a number of reasons. And we believe Breast Health sales will be stronger for longer than many anticipate. 
Although we placed about 3,600 systems in the United States as of the end of the fiscal year, the market is still underpenetrated. For example, 3D installations represent a little more than 40% of total Hologic mammography systems. And if you look at MQSA statistics, 3D installations represented just 1/4 of total systems. We have been placing roughly 300 units per quarter in the U.S. recently, and at this stage should enjoy many more quarters of solid performance. 
We are also gaining significant market share from our competitors. While our innovative marketing strategies enable us to maintain stable pricing. 
As our domestic installed base 3D units has grown, so is the related service opportunity. Breast Health service revenue again, exceeded $100 million in the quarter, and increased at a high single-digit rate boosting overall growth. This increase in service revenue, combined with the potential of new products, gives us confidence that Breast Health can continue to grow even as 3D adoption matures. 
Now let's turn to a second major growth driver, the Panther system, our fully automated diagnostics instrument. Panther helped our molecular business growth 7.8% in constant currency in 2016. Beyond increase sales of women's health test for chlamydia gonorrhea, HPV and Trichomonas. By the end of fiscal 2016, we have shipped more than 1,000 Panther units just to Diagnostics customers. And we are encouraged that a growing number of these placements are coming internationally. Panther shipments to customers outside the United States grew dramatically in 2016, and we believe we are just scratching the surface of this long-term opportunity. 
At the same time, our sales team is partnering with lab and physician customers to ensure that patients are tested according to the best clinical guidelines, providing better care, while increasing organic volumes. In fact, on a global basis, the average Panther generated more than $190,000 in assay revenue in 2016, a high single digit increase in utilization. And we are optimistic that this number will increase further as we roll out viral load assays in Europe and the United States. 
As we look back on fiscal 2016, the stabilization of ThinPrep and NovaSure, combined with strong growth Genius and Panther, drove excellent fully results. You might recall that 12 months ago, our initial guidance called for revenue of $2.81 billion to $2.84 billion for the year. We finished at $2.83 billion, so we delivered on our commitment. 
At the same time, we achieved significant margin improvement in 2016. For the year, non-GAAP gross margin was 65.6%, an impressive 140 basis points better than last year. This enabled us to make incremental investments in marketing and R&D to drive future growth, while still delivering operating income of 33.6%, 30 basis points better than in 2015. Combined with a lower tax rate and repurchases of both convertible debt and common shares, we posted non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.96 in 2016. This was 17.4% higher than in the prior year, and comfortably ahead of our original guidance. 
Looking beyond earnings, we're also very pleased with our cash flow in 2016, which is often underappreciated. We generated $787.2 million in operating cash with only $94.5 million in CapEx. And roughly half of this CapEx went toward revenue-generating instruments such as our Panther systems. As a result, free cash flow for the year was $692.7 million, 23.3% higher than non-GAAP net income. Our operations and finance teams deserve tremendous credit for making this happen. As one measure of their success, inventories at year-end 2016 were $8.4 million less than a year ago, even though product revenues were about $109 million higher. Taking a step further, inventories are now below the levels of even 2 years ago demonstrating tremendous progress by our team. 
Obviously these strong cash flows gave us the flexibility to continue improving our capital structure in 2016. We repurchased $274.2 million of convertible notes for $392.8 million during the year as well as 7.3 million shares of common stock for $250 million. As a result, our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, has fallen to 2.8x, a little more than half what it was at the time of the Gen-Probe acquisition. In addition, diluted shares outstanding were slightly lower in 2016 than in the prior year, providing a boost to EPS. 
Before I turn the call over to Bob, I want to emphasize that strong cash flows also enabled us to invest appropriately and consistently in research and development, which increased about 8% this year, and we are just beginning to see the fruits of our labor. In the fourth quarter 2016, sales of key new products exceeded $10 million in revenue for the first time. These new products include viral assays in Diagnostics, the Affirm biopsy system in Breast Health and [indiscernible] in surgical. We recognize that $10 million is still small in the context of overall Hologic, but it's a good start. And we are optimistic about the potential of these products in 2017. 
In addition, our R&D pipeline is building behind the first wave of new products. In Diagnostic, we recently filed for regulatory approval of our Aptima hepatitis C viral load test in the United States, and anticipate launching it commercially in 2017 following the introduction of our HIV viral load assay. Sales of these products will become more meaningful in 2018 when we also have a hepatitis B assay available. We also filed recently for U.S. regulatory approval of our herpes test, which will compliment our existing portfolio of women's health products on the Panther system. And finally, we are beginning clinical trials for our respiratory assays on the next generation Panther Fusion system. 
In Breast Health, we have fundamentally reshaped our R&D strategy away from the boom-and-bust approach of the past toward a model that strives for continuous innovation, built around our leadership position in 3D mammography. The Affirm prone biopsy system fits in this vein; as does our upcoming Brevera product, which will provide realtime specimen radiography to improve breast biopsy workflow and the patient experience. We are hopeful that Brevera will begin to contribute to growth late in 2017 and more meaningfully in 2018. 
Finally, in Surgical, we are encouraged by the early success of our MyoSure REACH line extension, which is providing new capabilities to customers and therefore, helping expand the market. In the same way, we are working to leverage our market-leading position in endometrial ablation by launching internationally in next-generation NovaSure device that will improve patient comfort as well as physician usability. 
Compared to the dramatic improvement you've seen in U.S. sales execution, our progress in research and development is just becoming invisible. We have a lot of work to do in these areas but are excited about our early progress. In some ways, domestic sales execution represents the tip of the iceberg in terms of what's possible here. Below the surface, we are working diligently to boost new product innovation, build our international capabilities and further enhance profitability. As our new leadership team settles in and as talented, engaged employees at all levels of the organization continue to do their thing, we look forward to sharing more successes with you in 2017 and beyond. 
Now I will hand the call over to Bob."

I'm going to provide more detail on our divisional revenue performance, review the rest of our fourth quarter financials and then discuss our revenue -- our financial guidance for 2017.

I'm going to provide more detail on our divisional revenue performance, review the rest of our fourth quarter financials and then discuss our revenue -- our financial guidance for 2017. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary will focus on non-GAAP results and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency. 
We closed out our fiscal year with results that surpassed expectations. Revenue grew at a healthy rate, and favorable gross margins allowed us to reinvest opportunistically in the business while still delivering strong bottom line growth. 
Albeit begin by discussing our surgical division, which remains the growth leader in the quarter with the sales of $101.5 million and growth of 17.6%. Fueling this growth was MyoSure where sales of $42.6 million grew 33.4%, thanks to the outstanding efforts of our commercial teams. In addition, NovaSure sales grew 8.7% as we continue to gain market share and capitalize on a competitive withdrawal. 
Now moving to Diagnostics. We posted sales of $311.9 million in the quarter, a solid growth rate of 3.1%. In molecular diagnostics, quarterly sales of $134.3 million increased 9.6%. As Steve noted, we booked a $5 million royalty payment this quarter but at the same time, we also absorbed a headwind of almost $3 million from our discontinued fibrosis product line. So the underlying trend in the business remained strong, and we continue to gain share and increased utilization of women's health assays on the fully automated Panther instrument.  In addition, international sales grew at a mid-teens rate, and we posted yet another record quarter of Panther placement outside the U.S., providing a strong platform for future growth. 
Elsewhere in Diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal products posted sales of $121 million, and increased slightly compared to the prior year period. Share gains for our ThinPrep product line continue to offset headwinds from longer cervical cancer screening interval. 
And finally, our blood business declined 6% as expected as we continue to see the impact of lower blood utilization and fluctuating order partners by our Grifols. Partially offsetting these headwinds were initiative sales of our Zika products. As we enter 2017, we believe macro trends toward lower blood utilization will continue to be a drag on sales growth. 
Now moving to Breast Health. We posted global sales of $292.3 million, and solid growth of 2.3% over another challenging comp. In the U.S., continued adoption of Genius 3D systems was supplemented by growing service annuity and our sales of our new Affirm prone biopsy system driving an increase of 7.2% in sales. Over the last 2 quarters, our U.S. Breast Health results have clearly illustrated a point we've made repeatedly in recent months, that the business can continue to grow despite increasingly challenging comps. 
And to round out our revenue discussion, Skeletal Health revenue is of $21.2 million decreased 17.3% in constant currency, due mainly to lower volumes of our floor scan mini C-arm products. 
Now moving down the income statement. Fourth quarter gross margins of 65.7% increased 110 basis points compared to the prior year period. Gross margins benefited from both geographic and product mix as well as continued pricing discipline and operational improvements. 
Total operating expenses of $235.5 million increased 7.7% in the fourth quarter. We continue to take advantage of improving gross margins to reinvest strategically in the business. For example, quarterly R&D spending increased 16.3%, and we're beginning to see some of the benefits as Steve discussed. In addition, as we mentioned last quarter, our change in the retirement provisions of our equity plan drove an additional $4 million of expense. Despite these investments, our non-GAAP operating margin remained a healthy 33.3% in the quarter. 
Below the line, we continue to make good progress in 2 areas that have been a priority for our financial organization. Based on lower debt levels, interest expense of $32.9 million in the fourth quarter declined 14.8%. At the same time, our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 31% in the quarter was more than 300 basis points lower than a year ago. While we are very pleased with the results we produced in a short amount of time, we are still beginning stages of this process and see continued opportunity ahead. 
And finally, to wrap up the fourth quarter income statement, non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 grew 20.9% compared to a year ago, much faster than sales growth. The multiple levers used to drive EPS growth in the quarter give us comfort in our ability to continue growing EPS at a multiple sales. 
Now let me turn to cash flows and the balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $263.9 million improved 5.2%. We continue to focus on reducing our convertible debt. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $47.6 million in principle of our 2037 notes for $81.3 million, and intend to redeem the remaining $12 million in cash when the notes are callable this December. Despite retiring a portion of our convertible debt and repurchasing shares over the course of 2016, we ended the year with $548.4 million in cash, an increase of $57.1 million compared to the prior year. We finished the year with total debt of $3.3 billion, a reduction of $0.3 billion compared to the prior year. And our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, currently sits at 2.8x, close to our target of 2.5x. This combination of strong profit growth and lower debt not continues to drive improvement to return on invested capital. As of year-end, ROIC was 12.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 180 basis points over the prior year. 
Now I'd like to cover our non-GAAP financial guidance for fiscal 2017. We are forecasting mid-single-digit revenue growth in '17 on top of increasingly challenging comps. We expect an improving operating margin and lower tax rate to drive EPS growth at roughly double the rate of sales growth. Specifically, we anticipate constant-currency revenue growth of between 4% and 5.5% in fiscal 2017. At recent exchange rates, this equates to sales of $2.94 billion to $2.98 billion on a reported basis with reported growth rates between 3.8% and 5.2%. As you update your forecast, we would encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance range at this early stage as we've tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate those potential upsides and downsides. 
Our guidance includes the net benefit of 3 extra selling days based on our fiscal calendar. Compared to the prior year period, we will gain 4 selling days in the first quarter. Although this will be the historically slow week between Christmas and New Year's, while we loose 1 day in the fourth quarter. We estimate this benefit to be between 50 and 70 basis points of sales growth with a negligible effect on EPS. At the same time, our guidance also includes a roughly $5 million headwind from products that we have either divested or recently decided to discontinue. In other words, our guidance would have been about 20 basis points higher if these products remained in our portfolio. 
In terms of divisional growth for 2017. Our guidance contemplates low to mid-single-digit in Diagnostic and Skeletal, mid-single-digit growth in Breast Health, and slightly higher growth in Surgical. In Diagnostics, molecular should leave the charge behind Panther in an expanded international menu, including urology assays. We forecast the cytology and perinatal sales will be flat to up slightly and we also expect blood to be flat to up slightly as new Zika sales offset negative macro trends. 
In Breast Health, we expect continued growth in Genius 3D Mammography, a growing service annuity, contributions from new products including the Affirm prone biopsy system and Brevera toward the end of the year, as well as a return to growth for our international business. 
In Surgical, we expect growth to be driven by MyoSure market expansion efforts and NovaSure share gains as well as international sales. 
Geographically, we expect our international business to begin contributing to growth in fiscal 2017, in line with the company's overall growth rate. 
In terms of the profitability, we forecast continued improvement in non-GAAP operating margin in 2017 but how we get there will be different than last year. In 2017, we forecast a slight improvement in non-GAAP gross margin percentage, combined with greater leverage from operating expenses, leading to more improvement in operating margin than we saw last year. All of these leads us to forecast that earnings per share will be between $2.12 and $2.16 in 2017. This represents growth of 8.5% to 10.6% in constant currency and reported growth of between 8.2% and 10.2%. Again, we encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance range at this early stage of the year. This guidance assumes a full year tax rate of approximately 31% and diluted shares outstanding of between 289 million and 291 million for the year. Our guidance does not assume any capital deployment beyond calling what's left of our 2730 -- 2037 convertible notes in December. 
Now let's cover guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect revenues of $720 million to $730 million, flattish on a sequential basis as the benefit from extra seeling days between Christmas and New Year's is offset with the normal seasonal decline we experienced due to our global sales meetings and conference in Breast Health. Compared to the prior year period, this range reflects revenue growth of 3.8% to 5.2% on a constant-currency basis and reported revenue growth of 3.6% to 5.0%. 
We forecast non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.51 in the first quarter. This represents anticipated growth of 9.1% to 11.3% in constant-currency terms, or 8.7% to 10.9% on a reported basis. Compared to our fourth quarter actuals, please note that operating expenses will increase in the first quarter due to the timing of sales and marketing activities in the extra days. 
Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that our fourth quarter capped off another good year for the company. Our financial performance demonstrates that we were transforming from our turnaround story to a sustainable growth company. We feel confident about the foundation we've established heading into 2017, and have the levers necessary to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth with EPS growth roughly double that rate. 
With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are ready for our first question."

We obviously expect that to grow throughout the course of 2017. And I think you had mentioned the 100 basis points, that's probably at the low end, maybe it's a little higher than that maybe 150 basis points probably at the midpoint to think about that and that's really driven behind the Affirm and Zika, probably the 2 largest new products. Brevera will happen, but it's in the back half of the year, and certainly some of the virals and U.S. will play role, but again, the majority of that will happen in 2018. So that's the first question. I think sustainability of NovaSure, we feel very good about that. But remember the formal withdrawal, the competitive product happened in our second quarter, so we expect to have larger and better growth in first and second quarters than we would have in the back half of the year a. We expect growth throughout the course of the year, but the first and second quarters will be bigger than the back half for NovaSure. In terms of the major blood banks, those are -- you need to ask Grifols, those are their customers. And so we're not going to be able to be in a position to answer that. And then in terms of Panther utilization, we do expect -- that's one of the big areas that we're very focused on is the continuing to not only place Panther systems but increase the utilization of the installed base. So I do expect that utilization to grow in line with the forecast that we had talked about for molecular business."

And really proud -- it's taken some work and it's all been happening behind the scenes. But really trying to break that grand slam or the bombast ideas. So what we've got going on now is a lot of folks focused on both substantial innovation but also incremental innovation. And if you take our Surgical business as an example, we have launched NovaSure and launched MyoSure and never really did any product upgrades or anything through the years, just threw them out there and watch eventually price degrade or whatever else. So launching MyoSure REACH is a classic example of something that we're working on. We also just mentioned we're actually launching an upgraded NovaSure product outside the United States. You can imagine we'll be planning on bringing about to the United States once we get that to approval. Likewise, in Breast Health, instead of just focusing on the replacement for 3D tomo, saying, okay, what are we going to do in the meantime, and how can we leverage 3D? Well, the Affirm prone biopsy system, Brevera. There will be other things that are looking at in that vein as well. And again, we wanted to put some points on the board before we start talking about the future. Because as you know, words and the new same as it relates to effectively the Diagnostic business, there were things that were not truly in play when we got here, we turbocharged diffusion, the development of the Fushion platform, which is then opening up that ability to do the same kind of singles and doubles as it relates to future assays. And be able to broaden up the menu there. And again, those will be a lot of singles and doubles that will come behind the viral load programs. And we're really hunkered down early on to push viral loads through and across the finish line, those have been kind of up and down, on the end of and really put a sustained commitment and starting to feel very, very good about our ability in each of the divisions to be bringing in more steady stream of innovation."

That's probably the right amount, but I think, right now, what we've done is fundamentally, as Steve mentioned, changed the mindset of the organizations in how they're going about actually developing products, linking R&D with marketing, truly having insight-driven innovation and creating that competitive advantage. We spent the most money as a percent of sales in our Diagnostic business, less in breast and in our Surgical businesses. I think that, that probably is going to stay roughly the same, but it's really the make up of it and the leadership making a big difference in terms of how we evaluate the innovation pipeline."

We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We once again posted strong results that illustrate the progress we're making toward building a sustainable growth company. In addition, our results capped off a very good fiscal 2016 in which we delivered on our commitments. 
Today, I'll first provide a high-level overview of our fourth quarter results. But since it's the end of our fiscal year, we'd also like to provide a strategic update on the journey we've shared over the last 3 years. We'll focus on our revenue and financial drivers for the full year and provide some color on the behind-the-scenes progress we're making in research and development. Let's start with our fourth quarter results. 
Revenue of $726.8 million grew 3.4% on a reported basis or 3.8% in constant currency, a healthy performance despite a difficult comparison to the prior year period. We also absorbed a headwind of nearly $4 million from divested and discontinued products. Net of these, total revenues would have grown 4.4% in constant currency. 
Our Surgical business again set the pace with its seventh straight quarter of double-digit growth globally. We are also pleased with how our breast imaging and molecular diagnostics businesses performed and encouraged that new products began to contribute to growth. We'll come back to this point in a minute. 
In terms of geography, U.S. sales grew 7.4% in the quarter, continuing a string of strong results. Even if we exclude the $5 million royalty payment from our fourth quarter results, our growth rate accelerated on a sequential basis. 
As expected, international sales declined 9.6% as reported or 7.8% in constant currency versus a difficult comparison in the prior year period. Apart from this tough comp, international Breast Health was stable sequentially in the quarter. There were also some pockets of strength globally, namely molecular diagnostics and Surgical, both of which posted double-digit growth. Although these businesses are relatively small today outside the U.S., we believe they will be important growth drivers in 2017 and beyond. 
Profit margins remained robust in the quarter. Most importantly, non-GAAP net income grew 14.6%, more than 3x faster than sales. And our net margin of 20% increased by 190 basis points. With the benefit of additional capital deployment, we posted non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 or 20.9% better than in the prior year period. 
So all in all, we posted a very strong fourth quarter that exceeded expectations and capped off an excellent year. 
Thinking about the year as a whole, we made good progress in our journey from turnaround story to sustainable growth company. To date, our successes have been most visible in domestic sales execution, which in turn has driven the improved financial performance of the company. 
One of the first goals we established 3 years ago was to stabilize 2 highly profitable products that had been declining sharply: ThinPrep and NovaSure. In 2016, these products were more than stable. They returned to solid growth. Cytology and perinatal sales increased 2% on the year in constant currency. Even more impressive, NovaSure sales grew 10% in constant currency as our team capitalized on the market withdrawal of a competing product. 
As we stabilized ThinPrep and NovaSure, we also set out to maximize growth drivers such as Genius 3D Mammography systems and the Panther platform in molecular diagnostics. Both of these products performed well in 2016. 
Genius drove 5.2% constant-currency growth in total Breast Health sales in 2016, and we remained bullish on the opportunity ahead of us. While there has been lots of debate about a peak in system placements, we have a fundamentally different and more positive view of the future. The 3D curve is very different than the 2D curve for a number of reasons, and we believe Breast Health sales will be stronger for longer than many anticipate. 
Although we've placed about 3,600 systems in the United States as of the end of the fiscal year, the market is still under penetrated. For example, 3D installations represent a little more than 40% of total Hologic mammography systems. And if you look at MQSA statistics, 3D installations represented just 1/4 of total systems. We have been placing roughly 300 units per quarter in the U.S. recently, and at this pace should enjoy many more quarters of solid performance. We are also gaining significant market share from our competitors. While our innovative marketing strategies enable us to maintain stable pricing. 
As our domestic installed base of 3D units has grown, so has the related service opportunity. Breast Health service revenue again exceeded $100 million in the quarter and increased at a high single-digit rate, boosting overall growth. This increase in service revenue, combined with the potential of new products, gives us confidence that Breast Health can continue to grow even as 3D adoption matures. 
Now let's turn to a second major growth driver, the Panther system, our fully automated diagnostics instrument. Panther helped our molecular business grow 7.8% in constant currency in 2016, behind increased sales of women's health tests for chlamydia and gonorrhea, HPV And Trichomonas. By the end of fiscal 2016, we had shipped more than 1,000 Panther units just to diagnostic customers. And we're encouraged that a growing number of these placements are coming internationally. Panther shipments to customers outside the United States grew dramatically in 2016, and we believe we are just scratching the surface of this long-term opportunity. 
At the same time, our sales team is partnering with lab and physician customers to ensure that patients are tested according to the best clinical guidelines, providing better care while increasing organic volumes. In fact, on a global basis, the average Panther generated more than $190,000 in assay revenue in 2016, a high single-digit increase in utilization. And we are optimistic that this number will increase further as we roll out viral load assays in Europe and the United States. 
As we look back on fiscal 2016, the stabilization of ThinPrep and NovaSure, combined with strong growth from Genius and Panther, drove excellent full year results. You might recall that 12 months ago, our initial guidance called for revenue of $2.81 billion to $2.84 billion for the year. We finished at $2.83 billion, so we delivered on our commitment. 
At the same time, we achieved significant margin improvement in 2016. For the year, non-GAAP gross margin was 65.6%, an impressive 140 basis points better than last year. This enabled us to make incremental investments in marketing and R&D to drive future growth while still delivering operating income of 33.6%, 30 basis points better than in 2015. 
Combined with a lower tax rate and repurchases of both convertible debt and common shares, we posted non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.96 in 2016. This was 17.4% higher than in the prior year and comfortably ahead of our original guidance. 
Looking beyond earnings, we're also very pleased with our cash flow in 2016, which is often underappreciated. We generated $787.2 million in operating cash with only $94.5 million in CapEx. And roughly half of this CapEx went toward revenue-generating instruments such as our Panther systems. As a result, free cash flow for the year was $692.7 million, 23.3% higher than non-GAAP net income. 
Our operations and finance teams deserve tremendous credit for making this happen. As one measure of their success, inventories at year-end 2016 were $8.4 million less than a year ago, even though product revenues were about $109 million higher. Taken a step further, inventories are now below the levels of even 2 years ago, demonstrating tremendous progress by our team. 
Obviously, these strong cash flows gave us the flexibility to continue improving our capital structure in 2016. We repurchased $274.2 million of convertible notes for $392.8 million during the year as well as 7.3 million shares of common stock for $250 million. As a result, our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, has fallen to 2.8x, a little more than half what it was at the time of the Gen-Probe acquisition. In addition, diluted shares outstanding were slightly lower in 2016 than in the prior year, providing a boost to EPS. 
Before I turn the call over to Bob, I want to emphasize that strong cash flows also enabled us to invest appropriately and consistently in research and development, which increased about 8% this year. And we are just beginning to see the fruits of our labor. 
In the fourth quarter 2016, sales of key new products exceeded $10 million in revenue for the first time. These new products include viral assays in Diagnostics, the Affirm prone biopsy system in Breast Health and MyoSure REACH in Surgical. We recognize that $10 million is still small in the context of overall Hologic, but it's a good start. And we are optimistic about the potential of these products in 2017. 
In addition, our R&D pipeline is building behind the first wave of new products. In diagnostics, we recently filed for regulatory approval of our Aptima Hepatitis C viral load test in the United States and anticipate launching it commercially in 2017, following the introduction of our HIV viral load assay. Sales of these products will become more meaningful in 2018 when we also have a Hepatitis B assay available. We also filed recently for U.S. regulatory approval of a herpes test, which will complement our existing portfolio of women's health products on the Panther system. And finally, we are beginning clinical trials for our respiratory assays on the next-generation Panther Fusion system. 
In Breast Health, we have fundamentally reshaped our R&D strategy away from the boom-and-bust approach of the past toward a model that strives for continuous innovation built around our leadership position in 3D mammography. The Affirm prone biopsy system fits in this vein as does our upcoming Brevera product, which will provide real-time specimen radiography to improve breast biopsy workflow and the patient experience. We are hopeful that Brevera will begin to contribute to growth late in 2017 and more meaningfully in 2018. 
Finally, in Surgical, we are encouraged by the early success of our MyoSure REACH line extension, which is providing new capabilities to customers, and therefore, helping expand the market. In the same way, we are working to leverage our market-leading position in endometrial ablation by launching internationally a next-generation NovaSure device that will improve patient comfort as well as physician usability. 
Compared to the dramatic improvement you've seen in U.S. sales execution, our progress in research and development is just becoming visible. We have a lot of work to do in these areas but are excited about our early progress. 
In some ways, domestic sales execution represents the tip of the iceberg in terms of what's possible here. Below the surface, we are working diligently to boost new product innovation, build our international capabilities and further enhance profitability. As our new leadership team settles in and as talented, engaged employees at all levels of the organization continue to do their thing, we look forward to sharing more successes with you in 2017 and beyond. 
Now I will hand the call over to Bob."
108544,403594883,1071201,"Hologic Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Hologic, Inc.","Executives","Thank you. Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on our divisional revenue performance, review the rest of our fourth quarter financials and then discuss our revenue -- our financial guidance for 2017. Unless otherwise note",1742,"Thank you. Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on our divisional revenue performance, review the rest of our fourth quarter financials and then discuss our revenue -- our financial guidance for 2017. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary will focus on non-GAAP results, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency. 
We closed out our fiscal year with results that surpassed expectations. Revenue grew at a healthy rate, and favorable gross margins allowed us to reinvest opportunistically in the business while still delivering strong bottom line growth. 
I'll begin by discussing our Surgical division, which remained the growth leader in the quarter with sales of $101.5 million and growth of 17.6%. Fueling this growth was MyoSure, where sales of $42.6 million grew 33.4%, thanks to the outstanding efforts of our commercial team. In addition, NovaSure sales grew 8.7% as we continue to gain market share and capitalize on a competitive withdrawal. 
Now moving to Diagnostics. We posted sales of $311.9 million in the quarter, a solid growth rate of 3.1%. In molecular diagnostics, quarterly sales of $134.3 million increased 9.6%. As Steve noted, we booked a $5 million royalty payment this quarter. But at the same time, we also absorbed a headwind of almost $3 million from our discontinued cystic fibrosis product line. So the underlying trends in the business remain strong, and we continue to gain share and increase utilization of women's health assays on the fully automated Panther instrument.  In addition, international sales grew at a mid-teens rate, and we posted yet another record quarter of Panther placements outside the U.S., providing a strong platform for future growth. 
Elsewhere in Diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal products posted sales of $121 million and increased slightly compared to the prior year period. Share gains for our ThinPrep product line continue to offset headwinds from longer cervical cancer screening intervals. 
And finally, our blood business declined 6%, as expected, as we continue to see the impact of lower blood utilization and fluctuating order partners by our partner, Grifols. Partially offsetting these headwinds were initial sales of our Zika products. As we enter 2017, we believe macro trends toward lower blood utilization will continue to be a drag on sales growth. 
Now moving to Breast Health. We posted global sales of $292.3 million and solid growth of 2.3% over another challenging comp. In the U.S., continued adoption of Genius 3D systems was supplemented by growing service annuity and our sales of our new Affirm prone biopsy system, driving an increase of 7.2% in sales. Over the last 2 quarters, our U.S. Breast Health results have clearly illustrated a point we've made repeatedly in recent months that the business can continue to grow despite increasingly challenging comps. 
And to round out our revenue discussion, Skeletal Health revenues of $21.2 million decreased 17.3% in constant currency, due mainly to lower volumes of our Fluoroscan mini C-arm products. 
Now moving down the income statement. Fourth quarter gross margins of 65.7% increased 110 basis points compared to the prior year period. Gross margins benefited from both geographic and product mix as well as continued pricing discipline and operational improvements. 
Total operating expenses of $235.5 million increased 7.7% in the fourth quarter. We continue to take advantage of improving gross margins to reinvest strategically in the business. For example, quarterly R&D spending increased 16.3%, and we're beginning to see some of the benefits, as Steve discussed. In addition, as we mentioned last quarter, a change in the retirement provisions of our equity plan drove an additional $4 million of expense. Despite these investments, our non-GAAP operating margin remained a healthy 33.3% in the quarter. 
Below the line, we continue to make good progress in 2 areas that have been a priority for our finance organization. Based on lower debt levels, interest expense of $32.9 million in the fourth quarter declined 14.8%. At the same time, our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 31% in the quarter was more than 300 basis points lower than a year ago. While we are very pleased with the results we've produced in a short amount of time, we are still at the beginning stages of this process and see continued opportunity ahead. 
And finally, to wrap up the fourth quarter income statement, non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 grew 20.9% compared to a year ago, much faster than sales growth. The multiple levers used to drive EPS growth in the quarter give us comfort in our ability to continue growing EPS at a multiple of sales growth. 
Now let me turn to cash flows and the balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $263.9 million improved 5.2%. 
We continue to focus on reducing our convertible debt. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $47.6 million in principal of our 2037 notes for $81.3 million and intend to redeem the remaining $12 million in cash when the notes are callable this December. 
Despite retiring a portion of our convertible debt and repurchasing shares over the course of 2016, we ended the year with $548.4 million in cash, an increase of $57.1 million compared to the prior year. We finished the year with total debt of $3.3 billion a reduction of $0.3 billion compared to the prior year. And our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, currently sits at 2.8x, close to our target of 2.5x. 
The combination of strong profit growth and lower debt continues to drive improvements to return on invested capital. As of year-end, ROIC was 12.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 180 basis points over the prior year. 
Now I'd like to cover our non-GAAP financial guidance for fiscal 2017. We are forecasting mid-single-digit revenue growth in '17 on top of increasingly challenging comps. We expect an improving operating margin and lower tax rate to drive EPS growth at roughly double the rate of sales growth. 
Specifically, we anticipate constant-currency revenue growth of between 4% and 5.5% in fiscal 2017. At recent exchange rates, this equates to sales of $2.94 billion to $2.98 billion on a reported basis with reported growth rates between 3.8% and 5.2%. As you update your forecasts, we would encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance ranges at this early stage as we've tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate, both, those potential upsides and downsides. 
Our guidance includes the net benefit of 3 extra selling days based on our fiscal calendar. Compared to the prior years period, we will gain 4 selling days in the first quarter. Although this will be the historically slow week between Christmas and New Year's while we will lose one day in the fourth fiscal quarter. We estimate this benefit to be between 50 and 70 basis points of sales growth with a negligible effect on EPS. 
At the same time, our guidance also includes a roughly $5 million headwind from products that we have either divested or recently decided to discontinue. In other words, our guidance would have been about 20 basis points higher if these products remained in our portfolio. 
In terms of divisional growth for 2017, our guidance contemplates low- to mid-single-digit growth in Diagnostics and Skeletal, mid-single-digit growth in Breast Health and slightly higher growth in Surgical. 
In Diagnostics, molecular should lead the charge behind Panther and an expanded international menu, including virology assays. We forecast that cytology and perinatal sales will be flat to up slightly, and we also expect blood to be flat to up slightly as new Zika sales offset negative macro trends. 
In Breast Health, we expect continued growth in Genius 3D Mammography, a growing service annuity, contributions from new products, including the Affirm prone biopsy system and Brevera towards the end of the year, as well as a return to growth for our international business. 
In Surgical, we expect growth to be driven by MyoSure market expansion efforts and NovaSure share gains as well as international sales. 
Geographically, we expect our international business to begin contributing to growth in fiscal 2017, in line with the company's overall growth rate. 
In terms of profitability, we forecast continued improvement in non-GAAP operating margin in 2017, but how we get there will be different than last year. In 2017, we forecast a slight improvement in non-GAAP gross margin percentage, combined with greater leverage from operating expenses, leading to more improvement in operating margin than we saw last year. 
All of this leads us to forecast that earnings per share will be between $2.12 and $2.16 in 2017. This represents growth of 8.5% to 10.6% in constant currency and reported growth of between 8.2% and 10.2%. Again, we'd encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance range at this early stage of the year. 
This guidance assumes a full year tax rate of approximately 31% and diluted shares outstanding of between 289 million and 291 million for the year. Our guidance does not assume any capital deployment beyond calling what's left of our 2037 convertible notes in December. 
Now let's cover guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect revenues of $720 million to $730 million, flattish on a sequential basis as the benefit from extra selling days between Christmas and New Year's is offset by the normal seasonal decline we experienced due to our global sales meetings and the RSNA conference in Breast Health. Compared to the prior year period, this range reflects revenue growth of 3.8% to 5.2% on a constant-currency basis and reported revenue growth of 3.6% to 5.0%. 
We forecast non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.51 in the first quarter. This represents anticipated growth of 9.1% to 11.3% in constant-currency terms or 8.7% to 10.9% on a reported basis. Compared to our fourth quarter actuals, please note that operating expenses will increase in the first quarter due to the timing of sales and marketing activities and the extra days. 
Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that our fourth quarter capped off another good year for the company. Our financial performance demonstrates that we are transforming from a turnaround story to a sustainable growth company.

Maybe it's a little higher than that, maybe 150 basis points, probably at the midpoint to think about that, and that's really driven behind the Affirm and Zika. Those are probably the 2 largest new products. Brevera will happen, but it's in the back half of the year. And then certainly, some of the virals and so forth in the U.S. will play a role. But again, the majority of that will happen in 2018. So that's the first question. I think sustainability of NovaSure, we feel very good about that. But remember, the formal withdrawal of the competitive product happened in our second quarter, so we expect to have larger and better growth in first and second quarters than we would have in the back half of the year. We expect growth throughout the course of the year, but the first and second quarters will be bigger than the back half for NovaSure. In terms of the major blood banks, those are -- that's -- you need to ask Grifols that -- those are their customers, and so we're not going to be able to be in a position to answer that. And then in terms of Panther utilization, we do expect -- that's one of the big areas that we're focused on is continuing to not only place Panther systems but increase the utilization of the installed base.

If you take a macro view at it, Isaac, we've dramatically overhauled, really, the R&D organizations in all 3 businesses and really proud -- it's taken some work, and it's all been happening behind the scenes but really trying to break that grand slam or the boom-bust ideas. So what we've got going on now is a lot of folks focused on both substantial innovation but also incremental innovation. And if you take our Surgical business as an example, we had launched NovaSure and launched MyoSure and never really did any product upgrades or anything through the year, just threw them out there and then watch eventually price degrade or whatever else. So launching MyoSure REACH is a classic example of something that we're working on. We also just mentioned we're actually launching an upgraded NovaSure product outside the United States. You can imagine we'll be planning on bringing that to the United States once we get that through approval. Likewise, in Breast Health, instead of just focusing on the replacement for 3D tomo, saying, ""Okay, what are we going to do in the meantime, and how can we leverage 3D?"" Well, the Affirm prone biopsy system, Brevera. There will be other things that we're looking at in that vein as well. And again, we wanted to put some points on the board before we start talking about the future, just as you know us realistically. And then the same as it relates to -- effectively the Diagnostics business, there were things that were not truly in play when we got here. We turbocharged the Fusion, the development of the Fusion platform, which is then opening up that ability to do the same kind of singles and doubles as it relates to future assays and be able to broaden out the menu there. And again, those will be a lot of singles and doubles that will come behind the viral load programs. And we really hunkered down early on to push the viral loads through and across the finish line. Those have kind of been up and down, on and off. And we've really put a sustained commitment and started to feel very, very good about our ability in each of the divisions to be bringing in more steady stream of innovation."

And so when I think about the R&D spend, we spend roughly 8% any year -- any quarter, it can change. That's probably the right amount. But I think, right now, what we've done is fundamentally, as Steve mentioned, changed the mindset of the organizations on how they're going about actually developing products, linking R&D with marketing, truly having insight-driven innovation and creating that competitive advantage. We spend the most money as a percent of sales in our Diagnostics business, less in Breast and in our Surgical businesses. I think that, that probably is going to stay roughly the same.

In regards to Breast Health, yes, we are still enthusiastic about the opportunities, both in 3D as well as 2D. I think the team has been focused and really looked at country by country, screening guidelines, how we work with, not only our dealers, but also starting more importantly, with governments and so forth and meeting some of the governments where they are.

We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We once again posted strong results that illustrate the progress we're making toward building a sustainable growth company. In addition, our results capped off a very good fiscal 2016 in which we delivered on our commitments. 
Today, I'll first provide a high-level overview of our fourth quarter results. But since it's the end of our fiscal year, we'd also like to provide a strategic update on the journey we've shared over the last 3 years. We'll focus on our revenue and financial drivers for the full year and provide some color on the behind-the-scenes progress we're making in research and development. Let's start with our fourth quarter results. 
Revenue of $726.8 million grew 3.4% on a reported basis or 3.8% in constant currency, a healthy performance despite a difficult comparison to the prior year period. We also absorbed a headwind of nearly $4 million from divested and discontinued products. Net of these, total revenues would have grown 4.4% in constant currency. 
Our Surgical business again set the pace with its seventh straight quarter of double-digit growth globally. We are also pleased with how our breast imaging and molecular diagnostics businesses performed and encouraged that new products began to contribute to growth. We'll come back to this point in a minute. 
In terms of geography, U.S. sales grew 7.4% in the quarter, continuing a string of strong results. Even if we exclude the $5 million royalty payment from our fourth quarter results, our growth rate accelerated on a sequential basis. 
As expected, international sales declined 9.6% as reported or 7.8% in constant currency versus a difficult comparison in the prior year period. Apart from this tough comp, international Breast Health was stable sequentially in the quarter. There were also some pockets of strength globally, namely molecular diagnostics and Surgical, both of which posted double-digit growth. Although these businesses are relatively small today outside the U.S., we believe they will be important growth drivers in 2017 and beyond. 
Profit margins remained robust in the quarter. Most importantly, non-GAAP net income grew 14.6%, more than 3x faster than sales. And our net margin of 20% increased by 190 basis points. With the benefit of additional capital deployment, we posted non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 or 20.9% better than in the prior year period. 
So all in all, we posted a very strong fourth quarter that exceeded expectations and capped off an excellent year. 
Thinking about the year as a whole, we made good progress in our journey from turnaround story to sustainable growth company. To date, our successes have been most visible in domestic sales execution, which in turn has driven the improved financial performance of the company. 
One of the first goals we established 3 years ago was to stabilize 2 highly profitable products that had been declining sharply: ThinPrep and NovaSure. In 2016, these products were more than stable. They returned to solid growth. Cytology and perinatal sales increased 2% on the year in constant currency. Even more impressive, NovaSure sales grew 10% in constant currency as our team capitalized on the market withdrawal of a competing product. 
As we stabilized ThinPrep and NovaSure, we also set out to maximize growth drivers such as Genius 3-D Mammography systems and the Panther platform in molecular diagnostics. Both of these products performed well in 2016. 
Genius drove 5.2% constant-currency growth in total Breast Health sales in 2016, and we remain bullish on the opportunity ahead of us. While there has been lots of debate about a peak in system placements, we have a fundamentally different and more positive view of the future. The 3-D curve is very different than the 2-D curve for a number of reasons, and we believe Breast Health sales will be stronger for longer than many anticipate. 
Although we've placed about 3,600 systems in the United States as of the end of the fiscal year, the market is still underpenetrated. For example, 3-D installations represent a little more than 40% of total Hologic mammography systems. And if you look at MQSA statistics, 3-D installations represent just 1/4 of total systems. We have been placing roughly 300 units per quarter in the U.S. recently, and at this pace should enjoy many more quarters of solid performance. We are also gaining significant market share from our competitors. While our innovative marketing strategies enable us to maintain stable pricing. 
As our domestic installed base of 3-D units has grown, so has the related service opportunity. Breast Health service revenue again exceeded $100 million in the quarter and increased at a high single-digit rate, boosting overall growth. This increase in service revenue, combined with the potential of new products, gives us confidence that Breast Health can continue to grow even as 3-D adoption matures. 
Now let's turn to a second major growth driver, the Panther system, our fully automated diagnostics instrument. Panther helped our molecular business grow 7.8% in constant currency in 2016, behind increased sales of women's health tests for chlamydia and gonorrhea, HPV And Trichomonas. By the end of fiscal 2016, we had shipped more than 1,000 Panther units just to diagnostic customers. And we're encouraged that a growing number of these placements are coming internationally. Panther shipments to customers outside the United States grew dramatically in 2016, and we believe we are just scratching the surface of this long-term opportunity. 
At the same time, our sales team is partnering with lab and physician customers to ensure that patients are tested according to the best clinical guidelines, providing better care while increasing organic volumes. In fact, on a global basis, the average Panther generated more than $190,000 in assay revenue in 2016, a high single-digit increase in utilization. And we are optimistic that this number will increase further as we roll out viral load assays in Europe and the United States. 
As we look back on fiscal 2016, the stabilization of ThinPrep and NovaSure, combined with strong growth from Genius and Panther, drove excellent full year results. You might recall that 12 months ago, our initial guidance called for revenue of $2.81 billion to $2.84 billion for the year. We finished at $2.83 billion, so we delivered on our commitment. 
At the same time, we achieved significant margin improvement in 2016. For the year, non-GAAP gross margin was 65.6%, an impressive 140 basis points better than last year. This enabled us to make incremental investments in marketing and R&D to drive future growth while still delivering operating income of 33.6%, 30 basis points better than in 2015. 
Combined with a lower tax rate and repurchases of both convertible debt and common shares, we posted non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.96 in 2016. This was 17.4% higher than in the prior year and comfortably ahead of our original guidance. 
Looking beyond earnings, we're also very pleased with our cash flow in 2016, which is often underappreciated. We generated $787.2 million in operating cash with only $94.5 million in CapEx. And roughly half of this CapEx went toward revenue-generating instruments such as our Panther systems. As a result, free cash flow for the year was $692.7 million, 23.3% higher than non-GAAP net income. 
Our operations and finance teams deserve tremendous credit for making this happen. As one measure of their success, inventories at year-end 2016 were $8.4 million less than a year ago, even though product revenues were about $109 million higher. Taken a step further, inventories are now below the levels of even 2 years ago, demonstrating tremendous progress by our team. 
Obviously, these strong cash flows gave us the flexibility to continue improving our capital structure in 2016. We repurchased $274.2 million of convertible notes for $392.8 million during the year as well as 7.3 million shares of common stock for $250 million. As a result, our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, has fallen to 2.8x, a little more than half what it was at the time of the Gen-Probe acquisition. In addition, diluted shares outstanding were slightly lower in 2016 than in the prior year, providing a boost to EPS. 
Before I turn the call over to Bob, I want to emphasize that strong cash flows also enabled us to invest appropriately and consistently in research and development, which increased about 8% this year. And we are just beginning to see the fruits of our labor. 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, sales of key new products exceeded $10 million in revenue for the first time. These new products include viral assays in Diagnostics, the Affirm prone biopsy system in Breast Health and MyoSure REACH in Surgical. We recognize that $10 million is still small in the context of overall Hologic, but it's a good start. And we are optimistic about the potential of these products in 2017. 
In addition, our R&D pipeline is building behind the first wave of new products. In diagnostics, we recently filed for regulatory approval of our Aptima Hepatitis C viral load test in the United States and anticipate launching it commercially in 2017, following the introduction of our HIV viral load assay. Sales of these products will become more meaningful in 2018 when we also have a Hepatitis B assay available. We also filed recently for U.S. regulatory approval of a herpes test, which will complement our existing portfolio of women's health products on the Panther system. And finally, we are beginning clinical trials for our respiratory assays on the next-generation Panther Fusion system. 
In Breast Health, we have fundamentally reshaped our R&D strategy away from the boom-and-bust approach of the past toward a model that strives for continuous innovation built around our leadership position in 3-D mammography. The Affirm prone biopsy system fits in this vein as does our upcoming Brevera product, which will provide real-time specimen radiography to improve breast biopsy workflow and the patient experience. We are hopeful that Brevera will begin to contribute to growth late in 2017 and more meaningfully in 2018. 
Finally, in Surgical, we are encouraged by the early success of our MyoSure REACH line extension, which is providing new capabilities to customers, and therefore, helping expand the market. In the same way, we are working to leverage our market-leading position in endometrial ablation by launching, internationally, a next-generation NovaSure device that will improve patient comfort as well as physician usability. 
Compared to the dramatic improvement you've seen in U.S. sales execution, our progress in research and development is just becoming visible. We have a lot of work to do in these areas but are excited about our early progress. 
In some ways, domestic sales execution represents the tip of the iceberg in terms of what's possible here. Below the surface, we are working diligently to boost new product innovation, build our international capabilities and further enhance profitability. As our new leadership team settles in and as talented, engaged employees at all levels of the organization continue to do their thing, we look forward to sharing more successes with you in 2017 and beyond. 
Now I will hand the call over to Bob."
108544,403594883,1071326,"Hologic Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Hologic, Inc.","Executives","Thank you. Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on our divisional revenue performance, review the rest of our fourth quarter financials and then discuss our revenue -- our financial guidance for 2017. Unless otherwise note",1742,"Thank you. Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on our divisional revenue performance, review the rest of our fourth quarter financials and then discuss our revenue -- our financial guidance for 2017. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary will focus on non-GAAP results, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency. 
We closed out our fiscal year with results that surpassed expectations. Revenue grew at a healthy rate, and favorable gross margins allowed us to reinvest opportunistically in the business while still delivering strong bottom line growth. 
I'll begin by discussing our Surgical division, which remained the growth leader in the quarter with sales of $101.5 million and growth of 17.6%. Fueling this growth was MyoSure, where sales of $42.6 million grew 33.4%, thanks to the outstanding efforts of our commercial team. In addition, NovaSure sales grew 8.7% as we continued to gain market share and capitalize on a competitive withdrawal. 
Now moving to Diagnostics. We posted sales of $311.9 million in the quarter, a solid growth rate of 3.1%. In molecular diagnostics, quarterly sales of $134.3 million increased 9.6%. As Steve noted, we booked a $5 million royalty payment this quarter. But at the same time, we also absorbed a headwind of almost $3 million from our discontinued cystic fibrosis product line. So the underlying trends in the business remain strong, and we continue to gain share and increase utilization of women's health assays on the fully automated Panther instrument. In addition, international sales grew at a mid-teens rate, and we posted yet another record quarter of Panther placements outside the U.S., providing a strong platform for future growth. 
Elsewhere in Diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal products posted sales of $121 million and increased slightly compared to the prior year period. Share gains for our ThinPrep product line continue to offset headwinds from longer cervical cancer screening intervals. 
And finally, our blood business declined 6%, as expected, as we continue to see the impact of lower blood utilization and fluctuating order patterns by our partner, Grifols. Partially offsetting these headwinds were initial sales of our Zika products. As we enter 2017, we believe macro trends towards lower blood utilization will continue to be a drag on sales growth. 
Now moving to Breast Health. We posted global sales of $292.3 million and solid growth of 2.3% over another challenging comp. In the U.S., continued adoption of Genius 3-D systems was supplemented by a growing service annuity and our sales of our new Affirm prone biopsy system, driving an increase of 7.2% in sales. Over the last 2 quarters, our U.S. Breast Health results have clearly illustrated a point we've made repeatedly in recent months: that the business can continue to grow despite increasingly challenging comps. 
And to round out our revenue discussion, Skeletal Health revenues of $21.2 million decreased 17.3% in constant currency, due mainly to lower volumes of our Fluoroscan mini C-arm products. 
Now moving down the income statement. Fourth quarter gross margins of 65.7% increased 110 basis points compared to the prior year period. Gross margins benefited from both geographic and product mix as well as continued pricing discipline and operational improvements. 
Total operating expenses of $235.5 million increased 7.7% in the fourth quarter. We continue to take advantage of improving gross margins to reinvest strategically in the business. For example, quarterly R&D spending increased 16.3%, and we're beginning to see some of the benefits, as Steve discussed. In addition, as we mentioned last quarter, a change in the retirement provisions of our equity plan drove an additional $4 million of expense. Despite these investments, our non-GAAP operating margin remained a healthy 33.3% in the quarter. 
Below the line, we continue to make good progress in 2 areas that have been a priority for our finance organization. Based on lower debt levels, interest expense of $32.9 million in the fourth quarter declined 14.8%. At the same time, our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 31% in the quarter was more than 300 basis points lower than a year ago. While we are very pleased with the results we've produced in a short amount of time, we are still at the beginning stages of this process and see continued opportunity ahead. 
And finally, to wrap up the fourth quarter income statement, non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 grew 20.9% compared to a year ago, much faster than sales growth. The multiple levers used to drive EPS growth in the quarter give us comfort in our ability to continue growing EPS at a multiple of sales. 
Now let me turn to cash flows and the balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $263.9 million improved 5.2%. 
We continue to focus on reducing our convertible debt. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $47.6 million in principal of our 2037 notes for $81.3 million and intend to redeem the remaining $12 million in cash when the notes are callable this December. 
Despite retiring a portion of our convertible debt and repurchasing shares over the course of 2016, we ended the year with $548.4 million in cash, an increase of $57.1 million compared to the prior year. We finished the year with total debt of $3.3 billion, a reduction of $0.3 billion compared to the prior year. And our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, currently sits at 2.8x, close to our target of 2.5x. 
The combination of strong profit growth and lower debt continues to drive improvements to return on invested capital. As of year-end, ROIC was 12.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 180 basis points over the prior year. 
Now I'd like to cover our non-GAAP financial guidance for fiscal 2017. We are forecasting mid-single-digit revenue growth in '17 on top of increasingly challenging comps. We expect an improving operating margin and lower tax rate to drive EPS growth at roughly double the rate of sales growth. 
Specifically, we anticipate constant-currency revenue growth of between 4% and 5.5% in fiscal 2017. At recent exchange rates, this equates to sales of $2.94 billion to $2.98 billion on a reported basis with reported growth rates between 3.8% and 5.2%. As you update your forecasts, we would encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance ranges at this early stage as we've tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate both those potential upsides and downsides. 
Our guidance includes the net benefit of 3 extra selling days based on our fiscal calendar. Compared to the prior year periods, we will gain 4 selling days in the first quarter. Although this will be the historically slow week between Christmas and New Year's while we will lose one day in the fourth fiscal quarter. We estimate this benefit to be between 50 and 70 basis points of sales growth with a negligible effect on EPS. 
At the same time, our guidance also includes a roughly $5 million headwind from products that we have either divested or recently decided to discontinue. In other words, our guidance would have been about 20 basis points higher if these products remained in our portfolio. 
In terms of divisional growth for 2017, our guidance contemplates low- to mid-single-digit growth in Diagnostics and Skeletal, mid-single-digit growth in Breast Health and slightly higher growth in Surgical. 
In Diagnostics, molecular should lead the charge behind Panther and an expanded international menu, including virology assays. We forecast that cytology and perinatal sales will be flat to up slightly, and we also expect blood to be flat to up slightly as new Zika sales offset negative macro trends. 
In Breast Health, we expect continued growth in Genius 3-D Mammography, a growing service annuity, contributions from new products, including the Affirm prone biopsy system and Brevera towards the end of the year, as well as a return to growth for our international business. 
In Surgical, we expect growth to be driven by MyoSure market expansion efforts and NovaSure share gains as well as international sales. 
Geographically, we expect our international business to begin contributing to growth in fiscal 2017, in line with the company's overall growth rate. 
In terms of profitability, we forecast continued improvement in non-GAAP operating margin in 2017, but how we get there will be different than last year. In 2017, we forecast a slight improvement in non-GAAP gross margin percentage, combined with greater leverage from operating expenses, leading to more improvement in operating margin than we saw last year. 
All of this leads us to forecast that earnings per share will be between $2.12 and $2.16 in 2017. This represents growth of 8.5% to 10.6% in constant currency and reported growth of between 8.2% and 10.2%. Again, we'd encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance range at this early stage of the year. 
This guidance assumes a full year tax rate of approximately 31% and diluted shares outstanding of between 289 million and 291 million for the year. Our guidance does not assume any capital deployment beyond calling what's left of our 2037 convertible notes in December. 
Now let's cover guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect revenues of $720 million to $730 million, flattish on a sequential basis as the benefit from extra selling days between Christmas and New Year's is offset by the normal seasonal decline we experienced due to our global sales meetings and the RSNA conference in Breast Health. Compared to the prior year period, this range reflects revenue growth of 3.8% to 5.2% on a constant-currency basis and reported revenue growth of 3.6% to 5.0%. 
We forecast non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.51 in the first quarter. This represents anticipated growth of 9.1% to 11.3% in constant-currency terms or 8.7% to 10.9% on a reported basis. Compared to our fourth quarter actuals, please note that operating expenses will increase in the first quarter due to the timing of sales and marketing activities and the extra days. 
Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that our fourth quarter capped off another good year for the company. Our financial performance demonstrates that we are transforming from a turnaround story to a sustainable growth company. We feel confident about the foundation we have established heading into 2017 and have the levers necessary to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth with EPS growth roughly double that rate. 
With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]"

Maybe it's a little higher than that, maybe 150 basis points, probably at the midpoint to think about that. And that's really driven behind the Affirm and Zika. Those are probably the 2 largest new products. Brevera will happen, but it's in the back half of the year. And then certainly, some of the virals and so forth in the U.S. will play a role. But again, the majority of that will happen in 2018. So that's the first question. I think sustainability of NovaSure, we feel very good about that. But remember, the formal withdrawal of the competitive product happened in our second quarter, so we expect to have larger and better growth in first and second quarters than we would add in the back half of the year. We expect growth throughout the course of the year, but the first and second quarters will be bigger than the back half for NovaSure. In terms of the major blood banks, those are -- you need to ask Grifols that, those are their customers, and so we're not going to be able to be in a position to answer that. And then in terms of Panther utilization, we do expect -- that's one of the big areas that we're focused on is continuing to not only place Panther systems but increase the utilization of the installed base.

And really proud -- it's taken some work, and it's all been happening behind the scenes but really trying to break that grand slam or the boom-bust idea. So what we've got going on now is a lot of folks focused on both substantial innovation but also incremental innovation. And if you take our Surgical business as an example, we had launched NovaSure and launched MyoSure and never really did any product upgrades or anything through the years, just threw them out there and then watched eventually, price degrade or whatever else. So launching MyoSure REACH is a classic example of something that we're working on. We also just mentioned we're actually launching an upgraded NovaSure product outside the United States. You can imagine we'll be planning on bringing that to the United States once we get that through approval. Likewise, in Breast Health, instead of just focusing on the replacement for 3-D tomo, saying, ""Okay, what are we going to do in the meantime, and how can we leverage 3-D?"" Well, the Affirm prone biopsy system, Brevera. There will be other things that we're looking at in that vein as well. And again, we wanted to put some points on the board before we start talking about the future, just as you know us stylistically. And then the same as it relates to -- effectively the Diagnostics business, there were things that were not really in play when we got here. We turbocharged the Fusion, the development of the Fusion platform, which is then opening up that ability to do the same kind of singles and doubles as it relates to future assays and be able to broaden out the menu there. And again, those will be a lot of singles and doubles that will come behind the viral load programs. And we really hunkered down early on to push the viral loads through and across the finish line. Those have kind of been up and down, on and off. And we've really put a sustained commitment and started to feel very, very good about our ability in each of the divisions to be bringing in more steady stream of innovation."

Any year -- any quarter, it can change. That's probably the right amount. But I think, right now, what we've done is fundamentally, as Steve mentioned, changed the mind-set of the organizations and how they're going about actually developing products: linking R&D with marketing, truly having insight-driven innovation and creating that competitive advantage. We spend the most money as a percent of sales in our Diagnostics business, less in Breast and in our Surgical businesses. I think that, that probably is going to stay roughly the same.

And every year, what I keep seeing is our teams just keep putting more new products in place, better people in place. And I probably feel better about the sustainability of this company than in any point since I've been here. Because I think by the time we go into '18, we're going to have more products hitting. We're going to have the international business that much further along. Because so much of what Eric's focused here during this year, what we've been doing in international this year is really putting the foundation in place that I'd hoped and wanted to be putting in place sooner. But we really weren't doing it. So I think just fundamentally, we just keep getting stronger and stronger. The comps will be getting tougher, this and that. But overall, feeling very good. We're going have a lot of stuff hitting in late '17 and into '18, and that's when the pipeline stuff will really be coming through."

It's never going to get to 100%. But certainly, we have room to grow. And if we look at TIGRIS, as an example, it's up in the 65% to 75% range in utilization, so there's still plenty of opportunity there from a molecular standpoint. In regards to Breast Health, yes, we are still enthusiastic about the opportunities, both in 3-D as well as 2-D. I think the team has been focused and really looked at country by country, screening guidelines, how we work with not only our dealers, but also starting more importantly, with governments and so forth and meeting some of the governments where they are. And the beauty of our 2-D system is it's software upgradable to 3-D, and so we have both the best 2-D system as well as the best 3-D system. And so that is still a strategy that we feel good about in the markets that we're focused on and an opportunity, not only to place both 2-D and the 3-D systems, but have that opportunity for upgrade over time."

We're pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We once again posted strong results that illustrate the progress we're making toward building a sustainable growth company. In addition, our results capped off a very good fiscal 2016 in which we delivered on our commitments. 
Today, I'll first provide a high-level overview of our fourth quarter results. But since it's the end of our fiscal year, we'd also like to provide a strategic update on the journey we've shared over the last 3 years. We'll focus on our revenue and financial drivers for the full year and provide some color on the behind-the-scenes progress we're making in research and development. Let's start with our fourth quarter results. 
Revenue of $726.8 million grew 3.4% on a reported basis or 3.8% in constant currency, a healthy performance despite a difficult comparison to the prior year period. We also absorbed a headwind of nearly $4 million from divested and discontinued products. Net of these, total revenues would have grown 4.4% in constant currency. 
Our Surgical business again set the pace with its seventh straight quarter of double-digit growth globally. We are also pleased with how our breast imaging and molecular diagnostics businesses performed and encouraged that new products began to contribute to growth. We'll come back to this point in a minute. 
In terms of geography, U.S. sales grew 7.4% in the quarter, continuing a string of strong results. Even if we exclude the $5 million royalty payment from our fourth quarter results, our growth rate accelerated on a sequential basis. 
As expected, international sales declined 9.6% as reported or 7.8% in constant currency versus a difficult comparison in the prior year period. Apart from this tough comp, international Breast Health was stable sequentially in the quarter. There were also some pockets of strength globally, namely molecular diagnostics and Surgical, both of which posted double-digit growth. Although these businesses are relatively small today outside the U.S., we believe they will be important growth drivers in 2017 and beyond. 
Profit margins remained robust in the quarter. Most importantly, non-GAAP net income grew 14.6%, more than 3x faster than sales. And our net margin of 20% increased by 190 basis points. With the benefit of additional capital deployment, we posted non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 or 20.9% better than in the prior year period. 
So all in all, we posted a very strong fourth quarter that exceeded expectations and capped off an excellent year. 
Thinking about the year as a whole, we made good progress in our journey from turnaround story to sustainable growth company. To date, our successes have been most visible in domestic sales execution, which in turn has driven the improved financial performance of the company. 
One of the first goals we established 3 years ago was to stabilize 2 highly profitable products that had been declining sharply: ThinPrep and NovaSure. In 2016, these products were more than stable. They returned to solid growth. Cytology and perinatal sales increased 2% on the year in constant currency. Even more impressive, NovaSure sales grew 10% in constant currency as our team capitalized on the market withdrawal of a competing product. 
As we stabilized ThinPrep and NovaSure, we also set out to maximize growth drivers such as Genius 3-D Mammography systems and the Panther platform in molecular diagnostics. Both of these products performed well in 2016. 
Genius drove 5.2% constant-currency growth in total Breast Health sales in 2016, and we remain bullish on the opportunity ahead of us. While there has been lots of debate about a peak in system placements, we have a fundamentally different and more positive view of the future. The 3-D curve is very different than the 2-D curve for a number of reasons, and we believe Breast Health sales will be stronger for longer than many anticipate. 
Although we've placed about 3,600 systems in the United States as of the end of the fiscal year, the market is still underpenetrated. For example, 3-D installations represent a little more than 40% of total Hologic mammography systems. And if you look at MQSA statistics, 3-D installations represent just 1/4 of total systems. We have been placing roughly 300 units per quarter in the U.S. recently, and at this pace should enjoy many more quarters of solid performance. We are also gaining significant market share from our competitors. While our innovative marketing strategies enable us to maintain stable pricing. 
As our domestic installed base of 3-D units has grown, so has the related service opportunity. Breast Health service revenue again exceeded $100 million in the quarter and increased at a high single-digit rate, boosting overall growth. This increase in service revenue, combined with the potential of new products, gives us confidence that Breast Health can continue to grow even as 3-D adoption matures. 
Now let's turn to a second major growth driver, the Panther system, our fully automated diagnostics instrument. Panther helped our molecular business grow 7.8% in constant currency in 2016, behind increased sales of women's health tests for chlamydia and gonorrhea, HPV And Trichomonas. By the end of fiscal 2016, we had shipped more than 1,000 Panther units just to diagnostic customers. And we're encouraged that a growing number of these placements are coming internationally. Panther shipments to customers outside the United States grew dramatically in 2016, and we believe we are just scratching the surface of this long-term opportunity. 
At the same time, our sales team is partnering with lab and physician customers to ensure that patients are tested according to the best clinical guidelines, providing better care while increasing organic volumes. In fact, on a global basis, the average Panther generated more than $190,000 in assay revenue in 2016, a high single-digit increase in utilization. And we are optimistic that this number will increase further as we roll out viral load assays in Europe and the United States. 
As we look back on fiscal 2016, the stabilization of ThinPrep and NovaSure, combined with strong growth from Genius and Panther, drove excellent full year results. You might recall that 12 months ago, our initial guidance called for revenue of $2.81 billion to $2.84 billion for the year. We finished at $2.83 billion, so we delivered on our commitment. 
At the same time, we achieved significant margin improvement in 2016. For the year, non-GAAP gross margin was 65.6%, an impressive 140 basis points better than last year. This enabled us to make incremental investments in marketing and R&D to drive future growth while still delivering operating income of 33.6%, 30 basis points better than in 2015. 
Combined with a lower tax rate and repurchases of both convertible debt and common shares, we posted non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.96 in 2016. This was 17.4% higher than in the prior year and comfortably ahead of our original guidance. 
Looking beyond earnings, we're also very pleased with our cash flow in 2016, which is often underappreciated. We generated $787.2 million in operating cash with only $94.5 million in CapEx. And roughly half of this CapEx went toward revenue-generating instruments such as our Panther systems. As a result, free cash flow for the year was $692.7 million, 23.3% higher than non-GAAP net income. 
Our operations and finance teams deserve tremendous credit for making this happen. As one measure of their success, inventories at year-end 2016 were $8.4 million less than a year ago, even though product revenues were about $109 million higher. Taken a step further, inventories are now below the levels of even 2 years ago, demonstrating tremendous progress by our team. 
Obviously, these strong cash flows gave us the flexibility to continue improving our capital structure in 2016. We repurchased $274.2 million of convertible notes for $392.8 million during the year as well as 7.3 million shares of common stock for $250 million. As a result, our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, has fallen to 2.8x, a little more than half what it was at the time of the Gen-Probe acquisition. In addition, diluted shares outstanding were slightly lower in 2016 than in the prior year, providing a boost to EPS. 
Before I turn the call over to Bob, I want to emphasize that strong cash flows also enabled us to invest appropriately and consistently in research and development, which increased about 8% this year. And we are just beginning to see the fruits of our labor. 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, sales of key new products exceeded $10 million in revenue for the first time. These new products include viral assays in Diagnostics, the Affirm prone biopsy system in Breast Health and MyoSure REACH in Surgical. We recognize that $10 million is still small in the context of overall Hologic, but it's a good start. And we are optimistic about the potential of these products in 2017. 
In addition, our R&D pipeline is building behind the first wave of new products. In diagnostics, we recently filed for regulatory approval of our Aptima Hepatitis C viral load test in the United States and anticipate launching it commercially in 2017, following the introduction of our HIV viral load assay. Sales of these products will become more meaningful in 2018 when we also have a Hepatitis B assay available. We also filed recently for U.S. regulatory approval of a herpes test, which will complement our existing portfolio of women's health products on the Panther system. And finally, we are beginning clinical trials for our respiratory assays on the next-generation Panther Fusion system. 
In Breast Health, we have fundamentally reshaped our R&D strategy away from the boom-and-bust approach of the past toward a model that strives for continuous innovation built around our leadership position in 3-D mammography. The Affirm prone biopsy system fits in this vein as does our upcoming Brevera product, which will provide real-time specimen radiography to improve breast biopsy workflow and the patient experience. We are hopeful that Brevera will begin to contribute to growth late in 2017 and more meaningfully in 2018. 
Finally, in Surgical, we are encouraged by the early success of our MyoSure REACH line extension, which is providing new capabilities to customers, and therefore, helping expand the market. In the same way, we are working to leverage our market-leading position in endometrial ablation by launching, internationally, a next-generation NovaSure device that will improve patient comfort as well as physician usability. 
Compared to the dramatic improvement you've seen in U.S. sales execution, our progress in research and development is just becoming visible. We have a lot of work to do in these areas but are excited about our early progress. 
In some ways, domestic sales execution represents the tip of the iceberg in terms of what's possible here. Below the surface, we are working diligently to boost new product innovation, build our international capabilities and further enhance profitability. As our new leadership team settles in and as talented, engaged employees at all levels of the organization continue to do their thing, we look forward to sharing more successes with you in 2017 and beyond. 
Now I will hand the call over to Bob."
108544,403594883,1073306,"Hologic Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Hologic, Inc.","Executives","Thank you. Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on our divisional revenue performance, review the rest of our fourth quarter financials and then discuss our revenue -- our financial guidance for 2017. Unless otherwise note",1742,"Thank you. Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm going to provide more detail on our divisional revenue performance, review the rest of our fourth quarter financials and then discuss our revenue -- our financial guidance for 2017. Unless otherwise noted, my commentary will focus on non-GAAP results, and revenue growth rates will be expressed in constant currency. 
We closed out our fiscal year with results that surpassed expectations. Revenue grew at a healthy rate, and favorable gross margins allowed us to reinvest opportunistically in the business while still delivering strong bottom line growth. 
I'll begin by discussing our Surgical division, which remained the growth leader in the quarter with sales of $101.5 million and growth of 17.6%. Fueling this growth was MyoSure, where sales of $42.6 million grew 33.4%, thanks to the outstanding efforts of our commercial team. In addition, NovaSure sales grew 8.7% as we continued to gain market share and capitalize on a competitive withdrawal. 
Now moving to Diagnostics. We posted sales of $311.9 million in the quarter, a solid growth rate of 3.1%. In molecular diagnostics, quarterly sales of $134.3 million increased 9.6%. As Steve noted, we booked a $5 million royalty payment this quarter. But at the same time, we also absorbed a headwind of almost $3 million from our discontinued cystic fibrosis product line. So the underlying trends in the business remain strong, and we continue to gain share and increase utilization of women's health assays on the fully automated Panther instrument. In addition, international sales grew at a mid-teens rate, and we posted yet another record quarter of Panther placements outside the U.S., providing a strong platform for future growth. 
Elsewhere in Diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal products posted sales of $121 million and increased slightly compared to the prior year period. Share gains for our ThinPrep product line continue to offset headwinds from longer cervical cancer screening intervals. 
And finally, our blood business declined 6%, as expected, as we continue to see the impact of lower blood utilization and fluctuating order patterns by our partner, Grifols. Partially offsetting these headwinds were initial sales of our Zika products. As we enter 2017, we believe macro trends towards lower blood utilization will continue to be a drag on sales growth. 
Now moving to Breast Health. We posted global sales of $292.3 million and solid growth of 2.3% over another challenging comp. In the U.S., continued adoption of Genius 3-D systems was supplemented by a growing service annuity and our sales of our new Affirm prone biopsy system, driving an increase of 7.2% in sales. Over the last 2 quarters, our U.S. Breast Health results have clearly illustrated a point we've made repeatedly in recent months: that the business can continue to grow despite increasingly challenging comps. 
And to round out our revenue discussion, Skeletal Health revenues of $21.2 million decreased 17.3% in constant currency, due mainly to lower volumes of our Fluoroscan mini C-arm products. 
Now moving down the income statement. Fourth quarter gross margins of 65.7% increased 110 basis points compared to the prior year period. Gross margins benefited from both geographic and product mix as well as continued pricing discipline and operational improvements. 
Total operating expenses of $235.5 million increased 7.7% in the fourth quarter. We continue to take advantage of improving gross margins to reinvest strategically in the business. For example, quarterly R&D spending increased 16.3%, and we're beginning to see some of the benefits, as Steve discussed. In addition, as we mentioned last quarter, a change in the retirement provisions of our equity plan drove an additional $4 million of expense. Despite these investments, our non-GAAP operating margin remained a healthy 33.3% in the quarter. 
Below the line, we continue to make good progress in 2 areas that have been a priority for our finance organization. Based on lower debt levels, interest expense of $32.9 million in the fourth quarter declined 14.8%. At the same time, our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 31% in the quarter was more than 300 basis points lower than a year ago. While we are very pleased with the results we've produced in a short amount of time, we are still at the beginning stages of this process and see continued opportunity ahead. 
And finally, to wrap up the fourth quarter income statement, non-GAAP EPS of $0.52 grew 20.9% compared to a year ago, much faster than sales growth. The multiple levers used to drive EPS growth in the quarter give us comfort in our ability to continue growing EPS at a multiple of sales. 
Now let me turn to cash flows and the balance sheet. In the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $263.9 million improved 5.2%. 
We continue to focus on reducing our convertible debt. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $47.6 million in principal of our 2037 notes for $81.3 million and intend to redeem the remaining $12 million in cash when the notes are callable this December. 
Despite retiring a portion of our convertible debt and repurchasing shares over the course of 2016, we ended the year with $548.4 million in cash, an increase of $57.1 million compared to the prior year. We finished the year with total debt of $3.3 billion, a reduction of $0.3 billion compared to the prior year. And our leverage ratio, net debt over EBITDA, currently sits at 2.8x, close to our target of 2.5x. 
The combination of strong profit growth and lower debt continues to drive improvements to return on invested capital. As of year-end, ROIC was 12.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 180 basis points over the prior year. 
Now I'd like to cover our non-GAAP financial guidance for fiscal 2017. We are forecasting mid-single-digit revenue growth in '17 on top of increasingly challenging comps. We expect an improving operating margin and lower tax rate to drive EPS growth at roughly double the rate of sales growth. 
Specifically, we anticipate constant-currency revenue growth of between 4% and 5.5% in fiscal 2017. At recent exchange rates, this equates to sales of $2.94 billion to $2.98 billion on a reported basis with reported growth rates between 3.8% and 5.2%. As you update your forecasts, we would encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance ranges at this early stage as we've tried to set realistic ranges that incorporate both those potential upsides and downsides. 
Our guidance includes the net benefit of 3 extra selling days based on our fiscal calendar. Compared to the prior year periods, we will gain 4 selling days in the first quarter. Although this will be the historically slow week between Christmas and New Year's while we will lose one day in the fourth fiscal quarter. We estimate this benefit to be between 50 and 70 basis points of sales growth with a negligible effect on EPS. 
At the same time, our guidance also includes a roughly $5 million headwind from products that we have either divested or recently decided to discontinue. In other words, our guidance would have been about 20 basis points higher if these products remained in our portfolio. 
In terms of divisional growth for 2017, our guidance contemplates low- to mid-single-digit growth in Diagnostics and Skeletal, mid-single-digit growth in Breast Health and slightly higher growth in Surgical. 
In Diagnostics, molecular should lead the charge behind Panther and an expanded international menu, including virology assays. We forecast that cytology and perinatal sales will be flat to up slightly, and we also expect blood to be flat to up slightly as new Zika sales offset negative macro trends. 
In Breast Health, we expect continued growth in Genius 3-D Mammography, a growing service annuity, contributions from new products, including the Affirm prone biopsy system and Brevera towards the end of the year, as well as a return to growth for our international business. 
In Surgical, we expect growth to be driven by MyoSure market expansion efforts and NovaSure share gains as well as international sales. 
Geographically, we expect our international business to begin contributing to growth in fiscal 2017, in line with the company's overall growth rate. 
In terms of profitability, we forecast continued improvement in non-GAAP operating margin in 2017, but how we get there will be different than last year. In 2017, we forecast a slight improvement in non-GAAP gross margin percentage, combined with greater leverage from operating expenses, leading to more improvement in operating margin than we saw last year. 
All of this leads us to forecast that earnings per share will be between $2.12 and $2.16 in 2017. This represents growth of 8.5% to 10.6% in constant currency and reported growth of between 8.2% and 10.2%. Again, we'd encourage you to model at the middle of our guidance range at this early stage of the year. 
This guidance assumes a full year tax rate of approximately 31% and diluted shares outstanding of between 289 million and 291 million for the year. Our guidance does not assume any capital deployment beyond calling what's left of our 2037 convertible notes in December. 
Now let's cover guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect revenues of $720 million to $730 million, flattish on a sequential basis as the benefit from extra selling days between Christmas and New Year's is offset by the normal seasonal decline we experienced due to our global sales meetings and the RSNA conference in Breast Health. Compared to the prior year period, this range reflects revenue growth of 3.8% to 5.2% on a constant-currency basis and reported revenue growth of 3.6% to 5.0%. 
We forecast non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.50 to $0.51 in the first quarter. This represents anticipated growth of 9.1% to 11.3% in constant-currency terms or 8.7% to 10.9% on a reported basis. Compared to our fourth quarter actuals, please note that operating expenses will increase in the first quarter due to the timing of sales and marketing activities and the extra days. 
Before we open the call for questions, let me conclude by saying that our fourth quarter capped off another good year for the company. Our financial performance demonstrates that we are transforming from a turnaround story to a sustainable growth company. We feel confident about the foundation we have established heading into 2017 and have the levers necessary to deliver mid-single-digit revenue growth with EPS growth roughly double that rate. 
With that, I will ask the operator to open up the call for questions. [Operator Instructions]"

Maybe it's a little higher than that, maybe 150 basis points, probably at the midpoint to think about that. And that's really driven behind the Affirm and Zika. Those are probably the 2 largest new products. Brevera will happen, but it's in the back half of the year. And then certainly, some of the virals and so forth in the U.S. will play a role. But again, the majority of that will happen in 2018. So that's the first question. I think sustainability of NovaSure, we feel very good about that. But remember, the formal withdrawal of the competitive product happened in our second quarter, so we expect to have larger and better growth in first and second quarters than we would add in the back half of the year. We expect growth throughout the course of the year, but the first and second quarters will be bigger than the back half for NovaSure. In terms of the major blood banks, those are -- you need to ask Grifols that, those are their customers, and so we're not going to be able to be in a position to answer that. And then in terms of Panther utilization, we do expect -- that's one of the big areas that we're focused on is continuing to not only place Panther systems but increase the utilization of the installed base.

And really proud -- it's taken some work, and it's all been happening behind the scenes but really trying to break that grand slam or the boom-bust idea. So what we've got going on now is a lot of folks focused on both substantial innovation but also incremental innovation. And if you take our Surgical business as an example, we had launched NovaSure and launched MyoSure and never really did any product upgrades or anything through the years, just threw them out there and then watched eventually, price degrade or whatever else. So launching MyoSure REACH is a classic example of something that we're working on. We also just mentioned we're actually launching an upgraded NovaSure product outside the United States. You can imagine we'll be planning on bringing that to the United States once we get that through approval. Likewise, in Breast Health, instead of just focusing on the replacement for 3-D tomo, saying, ""Okay, what are we going to do in the meantime, and how can we leverage 3-D?"" Well, the Affirm prone biopsy system, Brevera. There will be other things that we're looking at in that vein as well. And again, we wanted to put some points on the board before we start talking about the future, just as you know us stylistically. And then the same as it relates to -- effectively the Diagnostics business, there were things that were not really in play when we got here. We turbocharged the Fusion, the development of the Fusion platform, which is then opening up that ability to do the same kind of singles and doubles as it relates to future assays and be able to broaden out the menu there. And again, those will be a lot of singles and doubles that will come behind the viral load programs. And we really hunkered down early on to push the viral loads through and across the finish line. Those have kind of been up and down, on and off. And we've really put a sustained commitment and started to feel very, very good about our ability in each of the divisions to be bringing in more steady stream of innovation."

Any year -- any quarter, it can change. That's probably the right amount. But I think, right now, what we've done is fundamentally, as Steve mentioned, changed the mind-set of the organizations and how they're going about actually developing products: linking R&D with marketing, truly having insight-driven innovation and creating that competitive advantage. We spend the most money as a percent of sales in our Diagnostics business, less in Breast and in our Surgical businesses. I think that, that probably is going to stay roughly the same.

Maybe I'll talk to the last question, first. That's one of the reasons that the utilization is growing the way it is, is the team, in particular, in the U.S., has done a fantastic job of being able to sell the entire menu and really done a customer segmentation that says, ""Okay, if they've got chlamydia, gonorrhea, are they testing for Trich? Are they testing for HPV?"" And that has really driven that utilization in the U.S, and it's starting to drive that utilization internationally as well now that we have the viral loads. I will tell you in terms of growth rates for our major assay -- still, obviously, the largest is our chlamydia, gonorrhea CT/GC assay that grew in the low single digits. And then HPV and Trich continue to grow in excess of market, so those are gaining share. We feel good about our ability to continue to drive growth in '17 in those markets as well -- or those assays."

I will tell you that our operations teams are incredibly focused on continuing to improve the operational aspects of the business, and we established good pricing discipline. So -- and I think there are still opportunities to improve margins, I think just perhaps not at the level of 2016 given some of that product mix that we had. And then in the OpEx margins, it's across -- it's going to be across the product lines or product areas.

Because I think we're finding more and more avenues and more and more opportunities to tap into other procedures and things. So we continue -- even through the year, that growth rate has not yet slowed. We brought some news to it. And I think we see that as still being a real growth driver for us. NovaSure will clearly come back to earth in terms of growth rates. But again, we're going to be bringing news to that franchise, and we're just -- we have adopted a mind-set that we don't accept anything but an expectation of growth, even on the older businesses.
