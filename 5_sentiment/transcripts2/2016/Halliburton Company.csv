I want to begin with a few of our key accomplishments in 2015. First, total company revenue of $23.6 billion declined 28% year-over-year, outperforming a 35% decline in both the average worldwide rig count and global drilling and completions And even though it it was a very tough market, I'm pleased to say that, once again, we outpaced our peer group in North America and internationally both sequentially and on a full year basis.
I am especially pleased with the resilience of our international business. Despite lower revenues as a result of pricing concessions and activity reductions, we were able to improve operating margins during the year due to a relentless focus on cost management. We also outperformed our largest pierced sequentially and on a full year basis in both revenue and in margins. In the North America, of course, it was beyond a challenging year where we saw unprecedented declines in activity. However, relative to the overall market, I am pleased with our performance. From the 2014 peak, our Completions-related activity declined approximately 33%, relative to a 64% reduction in the U.S. land rig count. This clearly again demonstrates the customer quality that has emerged during this downturn and positions us well with the market's eventual recovery.
Now I would like to provide you with an update on the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. During the quarter, we announced that our timing agreement with the Department of Justice expired without reaching a settlement or the DOJ initiating litigation. In December, the DOJ informed us that they do not believe that our previously announced proposed divestitures are sufficient to address the DOJ's concerns that acknowledged that they would assess further proposals. 
With respect to the European Commission, the review has entered Phase 2, which was anticipated, and we recently advised the commission that we plan to formally propose remedies, which we believe should satisfy any competition concerns.
Earlier this month, Halliburton presented to the DOJ an enhanced of proposed divestitures in order to seek their approval of the transaction. We also informally notified the EC and other jurisdictions about the enhanced divestiture package. The sales process for the planned divestitures continues, and we are in discussions with interested buyers. There's no agreement to date with the DOJ or EC as to the adequacy of the proposed divestitures. Our conversations with the DOJ and the EC and other enforcement authorities continue with the desire to resolve their competition-related concerns as soon as possible.
Now I want to be clear that we remain committed to seeing this deal proved despite the extended time required to obtain regulatory approvals. Now while it is taking longer than originally expected, we believe the compelling strategic benefits for our shareholders inherent in this combination continues to remain intact. We strongly believe that the proposed merger is good for the industry and for our customers. The combination is expected to create an even stronger company and achieve substantial efficiencies enabling us to compete aggressively to provide efficient, innovative and low-cost services. Completion of the transaction would allow us to better meet our customers' oil services needs and help them operate more cost effectively, which is increasingly important due to the current state of the energy industry and oil and gas prices.
Finally, we agreed with Baker Hughes to extend the period to obtain required regulatory approvals to no later than April 30, 2016, but remain focused on completing the deal as early as possible. In the event regulatory approvals have not been received by April 30th, the merger agreement does not terminate automatically. Both companies may continue to seek regulatory approval or either company may terminate the merger agreement.
Now let me discuss what we're seeing in the market today and our prospects and challenges for the coming year, and then Christian will discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail.
Now this has certainly been the most challenging downturn that I have seen in my many, many years in business. We expect the market will continue to remain challenged in 2016, then it will be the first time since the late '80s the global upstream spending will decline for 2 consecutive years. Commodity prices have been a moving target, forcing our customers to be cautious in providing visibility to us and our shareholders into their 2016 capital expenditure plans. Although we do not believe current oil prices are sustainable, they are without a doubt negatively influencing customer plans in the near term. 
On a geographic basis, North America is expected to be the most impacted in 2016. Third-party surveys have also been a moving target, indicating a year-on-year decline in service spending from 30% up to as much as 50%, and that's on top of the estimated 40% decline in industry spend in 2015. But the reality is due to the macro uncertainties, many of our customers are managing their businesses in realtime rig by rig. Accordingly, we are going to take this market week by week and in some cases, crew by crew. This is unlikely to change until our customers have confidence in a sustainable and economical oil price.
Now there are a number of moving parts in North America, and my experience has taught me not to bet on the exact timing of a recovery, but we do expect that the longer it takes, the sharper the recovery will be. Until then, we will continue to execute our playbook and adapt our cost structure to market conditions while also positioning our North America land business for future success and ultimately outperform the industry as the market recovers.
International markets held up much better than North America in 2015, but they are also not immune to the impacts of lower commodity prices. Recent third-party surveys for international spend indicated a decline that may be up to 20%, which will be slightly worse than last year. We are working diligently with our customers to improve economics of their projects through technology and operating efficiency but do expect margins to be negatively impacted by lower activity levels and pricing pressures throughout the year.
Now looking at our geographies. We expect activity in the Middle East/Asia region to again be the most resilient in 2016 as recent mature field project awards throughout the Middle East are anticipated to move forward. However, we expect Australia, India and other markets across Asia to be impacted by reduced customer spending and delayed projects.
Europe/Africa/CIS is also expected to experience activity declines across the entire region in 2016 with the most vulnerable areas being the North Sea and Angola where the offshore markets continue to face extremely challenging economics. Customers are focused on reducing their cost structures through more efficient well design and the adoption of new standards for production systems. But these are structural changes that will take time to fully implement. 
And in Latin America, we expect lower activities across the region with the largest declines projected in Brazil and Mexico as a result of significant and OC budget constraints. Latin America is currently expected to have the largest percentage decline within our international markets. So in summary, 2016 is simply going to be a tough slug through the mud, but I can tell you we will do what we have to do. We know what buttons to push and levers to pull, and we will. We believe our customers will remain focused on cost-per-barrel optimization and gaining higher levels of efficiency, both of which bode very well for Halliburton. Now it's very difficult to predict the exact timing, but once the market has visibility of the trough, the recovery will come into view. And when it does, we expect the recovery will play out very similar to others where North America will rebound first and the strongest, followed by the international markets where the rebound will be more methodical.
Now let me turn the call over to Christian to provide more details on our financial results. Christian?"
177698,315848644,920484,"Halliburton Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2016",2016-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Halliburton Company","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a comparison of our fourth quarter results through the third quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.1 billion represented a 9% decline, while operating income declined by 7% to $473 million",819,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a comparison of our fourth quarter results through the third quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.1 billion represented a 9% decline, while operating income declined by 7% to $473 million. All regions experienced revenue declines during the quarter led by North America as a result of continued activity and pricing headwinds. For our international business, fourth quarter revenue and operating income declined by 5% and 10%, respectively, as a result of price concessions and activity declines with our customers during the quarter. Additionally, due to customer budget constraints, we did not see the typical benefit from year-end equipment and software sales. 
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue declined by 5% with a similar decline in operating income of 6%. Lower activity levels in Saudi Arabia and Iraq led the decline, partially offset by modestly higher sales in China and increased activity in Kuwait and Oman.
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS. We saw fourth quarter revenue declined by 6% with a decrease in operating income of 18%. The decline for the quarter was primarily driven by a sharp reduction of activity in the North Sea, partially offset by higher activity and Angola and Algeria. 
Latin America revenue and operating income declined by 6% and 9% respectively, driven by reduced activity from most of the regions. Partially offsetting this decline was improved productivity levels in Mexico.
Moving to North America. Revenue declined 13% with operating margins improving by approximately 160 basis points. Reduced activity throughout the U.S. land was the primary driver of the revenue decline, especially in the pumping-related product lines. The margin improvement was primarily due to a spike in year-end completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico, which is not expected to repeat in the first quarter. 
Margins also benefited from our aggressive cost reduction efforts and minimal weather disruptions during the quarter. Our margins continue to include an elevated cost structure in North America in anticipation of the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. For 2015, our total company decrementals were about half of the previous cycle due to actions we've been taking to adjust our cost structure throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, we incurred a charge of $192 million after tax, consisting primarily of asset write-offs and severance-related costs. As industry fundamentals continue to weaken, we will continue to make further structural adjustments and may incur additional charges in the first quarter. 
Our corporate and other expense totaled $70 million for the quarter, excluding costs related to the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. We anticipate that our quarterly expenses for the first quarter will be approximately $70 million excluding acquisition-related costs, and this will be the new run rate for 2016. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of approximately 19% includes a retroactive benefit from Congress' recent approval of the federal research and experimentation tax credit. As we go forward in 2016, we are expecting the first quarter and full year effective tax rates to be approximately 24% to 25%.
Given the ongoing decline in activity levels, we further reduced our capital expenditures as we exited the year, ending 2015 with a total CapEx spend of $2.2 billion. Our current guidance for 2016 capital expenditures is $1.6 billion. This CapEx guidance includes the continued conversion of our fleet to Q10 pumps to support our service efficiency strategy, which is critical in this environment. And we also expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.9 billion for 2016. This is the first time in over a decade that our CapEx is lower than our expected DD&A expense, which demonstrates our commitment to cash flows during this challenging period for the industry.
Turning to our operational outlook, the severity of the activity decline in the coming year continues to be unclear, but let me give you some comments for the first quarter. Our first quarter international results will be subject to weather-related seasonality that occurs geographies such as the North Sea and Russia exacerbated by the uncertainty around customer spending levels for the coming year. Although difficult to predict, at this point, we anticipate first quarter eastern hemisphere revenues to decline sequentially by a low double-digit percentage with margins similar to the first quarter 2015 levels. In Latin America, we anticipate revenues to decline sequentially by a mid-teens percentage with margins retreating to the upper single digits.
In North America, we also have limited visibility with estimate that the first quarter revenues will decline with the U.S. rig count, which is already down double digits against the fourth quarter average. We currently anticipate margins to come in at around break-even levels. And finally, we entered 2016 on a solid financial position with strong liquidity, which will enable us to address the current market challenges and be well positioned for the industry's eventual recovery.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?"

To begin, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate all of our front-line people for delivering solid fourth quarter results in a tough market. As Dave mentioned earlier, we're expecting 2016 to be a very challenging year due to poor commodity prices and shrinking customer budgets. We believe that as the coming cycle unfolds, we will see a continuation of what began in 2015, customers seeking efficiency gains and discrete technology to help them bend the cost curve. With lower commodity price levels, we believe the market will continue to evolve into this direction and customers will adopt products and services that help them produce wells with a lower cost per barrel of oil equivalent. Now this plays directly into Halliburton's strengths, helping our customers become more efficient on location to maximize their production, all of which contribute to lowering their unit cost per barrel of oil. 
So regardless of the commodity price, we're continuing to execute on our proven two-pronged strategy in this downturn: the first part being the control what we can control in the short term, and second is to look beyond the cycle to prepare for a recovery. With respect to the short term, this means making the tactical changes necessary to right size the business to the market. We revisited our cost profile throughout 2015 and made significant changes to help mitigate the impact on our operating margins, and we will continue to do so. It started with where we work. We systematically reviewed profitability in the granular sub-product line levels, and this resulted in the consolidation of facilities in more than 20 countries around the world and closing down operations in 2 countries. And finally, current market conditions forced us to reduce global headcount by 25% in 2015, a necessary but very unfortunate reality. The second part of our strategy is to look beyond the cycle and ensure long-term health of the franchise. For example, aligning ourselves with the right customers, investing in technology and staying dead focused on superior execution. In terms of customer portfolio, we work to align ourselves with customers who have stronger balance sheet and fairway acreage in the basins. In North America, our top 17 customers make up 50% of our revenue. When the downturn began, these customers were among the last to lay down rigs. Today, we're collaborating with them on ways to lower their cost per BOE to a place where we can both be successful. And when the recovery comes, we believe that these operators and, therefore, Halliburton will be best positioned for the upside. In terms of technology, 2015 was a successful year. Despite the downturn in activity we saw an uptake in new technology such as decision space and helping customers maximize production and lower their cost per barrel of oil. A recent addition to our cost of chemistry portfolio is our service. is a hydraulic fraction treatment designed to deliver far afield micro fractures enhancing the perspective lines of new wells. Early trials have indicated more than a 20% uplift in production compared to wells. Technologies like Micro Scout represent years of research through a disciplined multistage program. And although I typically spend more time talking about execution and how we get things done in the field, it's important to point out that we're executing in the technology side of our business as well. The joint research projects with our customers and by elevating field developed solutions, Halliburton is among the more efficient innovators in the industry.
Last year, Halliburton secured new patents at an R&D cost of less than $1 million per patent. In terms of our R&D patent efficiency, which is central to the return of intellectual property, Halliburton is in the same range as other top global U.S. patent leaders. And finally, superior execution. Service quality is a frequently underappreciated piece of our business, but I can tell you that in a market like this, a timely efficient job can the difference between the economic well and an uneconomic well. So for many markets, contract extensions and project awards are influenced by service quality. Or simply put, distinguish ourselves to win and retain work.
Now looking at 2015, it was an extremely strong year for the quality of our operations. This was our third straight year of improvement in both safety and service quality metrics, both of which saw significant double-digit reductions from 2014. Even while the market is forcing us to streamline our footprint in the field or improving our performance rates, essentially doing more with less and doing better. We're refining our processes and systems, eliminating everything that's not required to deliver our value proposition. You'll be hearing more about this throughout 2016 as this is not a onetime event. It's the relentless focus on efficiency and process improvement that makes us the execution company. We believe that these elements, our strong customer portfolio, our efficient technology spend and our superior service quality providing strong foundation for our business. We're confident that the execution on our strategy and building on the successes, we can continue to outperform our competitors both during the downturn and when the recovery comes.

We estimate 4 to 6 million horsepower that will be out of the market by the second half of 2016. And my gut says we're at the top end of that range right now, and this is really why we're committed to Frac of the Future.

With the drilling and completion efficiencies that we've got in the U.S., the time to drill and complete a well has been dramatically reduced which means the time between when you can price what is a frat cost or what is drilling cost or what is the mud job cost is very dynamic very realtime and it's very transactional. The international markets still continues to be a long-term contract market, so the discussions that you have with customers around price concessions and changes is typically done within the context of an existing long-term contract, which gives you more of a seat at the table and more of an ability to convince the customer that what you're delivering is adding value or that you have ideas where their contracts can get more efficient and, therefore, reduced their cost per BOE. And customers always have the ability to go out on tender, but those things typically take a while to come to fruition. So I think really the velocity by which business is done in North America is quite fast in the us and international market and, therefore, I think the margins will stay up at a higher level and not be compressed onto U.S. levels."

I want to begin with a few of our key accomplishments in 2015. First, total company revenue of $23.6 billion declined 28% year-over-year, outperforming a 35% decline in both the average worldwide rig count and global drilling and completions spend. And even though it was a very tough market, I am pleased to say that once again, we outpaced our peer group in North America and internationally both sequentially and on a full year basis.
I am especially pleased with the resilience of our international business. Despite lower revenues as a result of pricing concessions and activity reductions, we were able to improve operating margins during the year due to a relentless focus on cost management. We also outperformed our largest peers sequentially and on a full year basis in both revenue and in margins. 
And in North America, of course, it was beyond a challenging year where we saw unprecedented declines in activity. However, relative to the overall market, I am pleased with our performance. From the 2014 peak, our completions-related activity declined approximately 33% relative to a 64% reduction in the U.S. land rig count. This clearly again demonstrates the customer flight to quality that has emerged during this downturn and positions us well for the market's eventual recovery.
Now I would like to provide you with an update on the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. During the quarter, we announced that our timing agreement with the Department of Justice expired without reaching a settlement or the DOJ initiating litigation. In December, the DOJ informed us that they do not believe that our previously announced proposed divestitures are sufficient to address the DOJ's concerns but acknowledged that they would assess further proposals. 
With respect to the European Commission, the review has entered Phase 2, which was anticipated, and we recently advised the commission that we plan to formally propose remedies, which we believe should satisfy any competition concerns.
Earlier this month, Halliburton presented to the DOJ an enhanced set of proposed divestitures in order to seek their approval of the transaction. We also informally notified the EC and other jurisdictions about the enhanced divestiture package. The sales process for the planned divestitures continues, and we are in discussions with interested buyers. There is no agreement to date with the DOJ or EC as to the adequacy of the proposed divestitures. Our conversations with the DOJ and the EC and other enforcement authorities continue with the desire to resolve their competition-related concerns as soon as possible.
Now I want to be clear that we remain committed to seeing this deal through despite the extended time required to obtain regulatory approvals. Now while it is taking longer than originally expected, we believe the compelling strategic and financial benefits for our shareholders inherent in this combination continues to remain intact. We strongly believe that the proposed merger is good for the industry and for our customers. The combination is expected to create an even stronger company and achieve substantial efficiencies, enabling us to compete aggressively to provide efficient, innovative and low-cost services. Completion of the transaction would allow us to better meet our customers' oil services needs and help them operate more cost-effectively, which is increasingly important due to the current state of the energy industry and oil and gas prices.
Finally, we agreed with Baker Hughes to extend the period to obtain required regulatory approvals to no later than April 30, 2016, but remain focused on completing the deal as early as possible. In the event regulatory approvals have not been received by April 30, the merger agreement does not terminate automatically. Both companies may continue to seek regulatory approval or either company may terminate the merger agreement.
Now let me discuss what we're seeing in the market today and our prospects and challenges for the coming year, and then Christian will discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail.
Now this has certainly been the most challenging downturn that I have seen in my many, many years in business. We expect the market will continue to remain challenged in 2016 and that it will be the first time since the late '80s that global upstream spending will decline for 2 consecutive years. Commodity prices have been a moving target, forcing our customers to be cautious in providing visibility to us and their shareholders into their 2016 capital expenditure plans. Although we do not believe current oil prices are sustainable, they are without a doubt negatively influencing customer plans in the near term. 
On a geographic basis, North America is expected to be the most impacted in 2016. Third-party surveys have also been a moving target, indicating a year-on-year decline in service spending from 30% up to as much as 50%, and that's on top of the estimated 40% decline in industry spend in 2015. But the reality is due to the macro uncertainties, many of our customers are managing their businesses in real time rig by rig. Accordingly, we are going to take this market week-by-week and, in some cases, crew by crew. This is unlikely to change until our customers have confidence in a sustainable and economical oil price.
Now there are a number of moving parts in North America, and my experience has taught me not to bet on the exact timing of a recovery. But we do expect that the longer it takes, the sharper the recovery will be. Until then, we will continue to execute our playbook and adapt our cost structure to market conditions while also positioning our North America land business for future success and ultimately to outperform the industry as the market recovers.
The international markets held up much better than North America in 2015, but they are also not immune to the impacts of lower commodity prices. Recent third-party surveys for international spend indicate a decline that may be up to 20%, which will be slightly worse than last year. We are working diligently with our customers to improve economics of their projects through technology and operating efficiency but do expect margins to be negatively impacted by lower activity levels and pricing pressures throughout the year.
Now looking at our geographies. We expect activity in the Middle East/Asia region to again be the most resilient in 2016 as recent mature field project awards throughout the Middle East are anticipated to move forward. However, we expect Australia, India and other markets across Asia to be impacted by reduced customer spending and delayed projects.
Europe/Africa/CIS is also expected to experience activity declines across the entire region in 2016, with the most vulnerable areas being the North Sea and Angola where the offshore markets continue to face extremely challenging economics. Customers are focused on reducing their cost structures through more efficient well design and the adoption of new standards for production systems. But these are structural changes that will take time to fully implement. 
And in Latin America, we expect lower activities across the region, with the largest declines projected in Brazil and Mexico as a result of significant NOC budget constraints. Latin America is currently expected to have the largest percentage decline within our international markets. 
So in summary, 2016 is simply going to be a tough slog through the mud, but I can tell you we will do what we have to do. We know what buttons to push and levers to pull, and we will. We believe our customers will remain focused on cost-per-barrel optimization and gaining higher levels of efficiency, both of which bode very well for Halliburton. 
Now it is very difficult to predict the exact timing, but once the market has visibility of the trough, the recovery will come into view. And when it does, we expect the recovery will play out very similar to others where North America will rebound first and the strongest, followed by the international markets where the rebound will be more methodical.
Now let me turn the call over to Christian to provide more details on our financial results. Christian?"
177698,315848644,920536,"Halliburton Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2016",2016-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Halliburton Company","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a comparison of our fourth quarter results to the third quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.1 billion represented a 9% decline while operating income declined by 7% to $473 million. Al",821,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a comparison of our fourth quarter results to the third quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.1 billion represented a 9% decline while operating income declined by 7% to $473 million. 
All regions experienced revenue declines during the quarter, led by North America as a result of continued activity and pricing headwinds. For our international business, fourth quarter revenue and operating income declined by 5% and 10%, respectively, as a result of price concessions and activity declines with our customers during the quarter. Additionally, due to customer budget constraints, we did not see the typical benefit from year-end equipment and software sales. 
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue declined by 5% with a similar decline in operating income of 6%. Lower activity levels in Saudi Arabia and Iraq led the decline, partially offset by modestly higher sales in China and increased activity in Kuwait and Oman.
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS. We saw fourth quarter revenue decline by 6% with a decrease in operating income of 18%. The decline for the quarter was primarily driven by a sharp reduction of activity in the North Sea, partially offset by higher activity in Angola and Algeria. 
Latin America revenue and operating income declined by 6% and 9%, respectively, driven by reduced activity throughout most of the region. Partially offsetting this decline was improved productivity levels in Mexico.
Moving to North America. Revenue declined 13%, with operating margins improving by approximately 160 basis points. Reduced activity throughout the U.S. land was the primary driver of the revenue decline, especially in the pumping-related product lines. The margin improvement was primarily due to a spike in year-end completion tool sales in the Gulf of Mexico, which is not expected to repeat in the first quarter. 
Margins also benefited from our aggressive cost reduction efforts and minimal weather disruptions during the quarter. Our margins continue to include an elevated cost structure in North America in anticipation of the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. 
For 2015, our total company decrementals were about half of the previous cycle due to actions we've been taking to adjust our cost structure throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, we incurred a charge of $192 million after tax, consisting primarily of asset write-offs and severance-related costs. As industry fundamentals continue to weaken, we will continue to make further structural adjustments and may incur additional charges in the first quarter. 
Our corporate and other expense totaled $70 million for the quarter, excluding costs related to the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the first quarter will be approximately $70 million excluding acquisition-related costs, and this will be the new run rate for 2016. 
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of approximately 19% includes a retroactive benefit from Congress' recent approval of the federal research and experimentation tax credit. As we go forward in 2016, we are expecting the first quarter and full year effective tax rates to be approximately 24% to 25%.
Given the ongoing decline in activity levels, we further reduced our capital expenditures as we exited the year, ending 2015 with a total CapEx spend of $2.2 billion. Our current guidance for 2016 capital expenditures is $1.6 billion. This CapEx guidance includes the continued conversion of our fleet to Q10 pumps to support our service efficiency strategy, which is critical in this environment. We also expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.9 billion for 2016. This is the first time in over a decade that our CapEx is lower than our expected DD&A expense, which demonstrates our commitment to live within our cash flows during this challenging period for the industry.
Turning to our operational outlook. The severity of the activity decline in the coming year continues to be unclear, but let me give you some comments for the first quarter. Our first quarter international results will be subject to weather-related seasonality that occurs in geographies such as the North Sea and Russia, exacerbated by the uncertainty around customer spending levels for the coming year. Although difficult to predict, at this point, we anticipate first quarter Eastern Hemisphere revenues to decline sequentially by a low double-digit percentage, with margins similar to the first quarter 2015 levels. In Latin America, we anticipate revenues to decline sequentially by a mid-teens percentage, with margins retreating to the upper single digits.
In North America, we also have limited visibility but estimate that first quarter revenues will decline with the U.S. rig count, which is already down double digits against the fourth quarter average. We currently anticipate margins to come in at around break-even levels. And finally, we enter 2016 on a solid financial position with strong liquidity, which will enable us to address the current market challenges and be well positioned for the industry's eventual recovery.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?"

To begin, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate all of our frontline people for delivering solid fourth quarter results in a tough market. As Dave mentioned earlier, we're expecting 2016 to be a very",889,"Thank you, Christian, and good morning, everyone. To begin, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate all of our frontline people for delivering solid fourth quarter results in a tough market. 
As Dave mentioned earlier, we're expecting 2016 to be a very challenging year due to poor commodity prices and shrinking customer budgets. We believe that as the coming cycle unfolds, we'll see a continuation of what began in 2015: customers seeking efficiency gains and discrete technology to help them bend the cost curve. At lower commodity price levels, we believe the market will continue to evolve in this direction and customers will adopt products and services that help them produce wells with a lower cost per barrel of oil equivalent. Now this plays directly into Halliburton's strengths, helping our customers become more efficient on location and maximize their production, all of which contribute to lowering their unit cost per barrel of oil. 
So regardless of the commodity price, we're continuing to execute on our proven two-pronged strategy in this downturn, the first part being to control what we can control in the short term, and second is to look beyond the cycle to prepare for recovery. 
And with respect to the short term, this means making the tactical changes necessary to rightsize the business to the market. We revisited our cost profile throughout 2015 and made significant changes to help mitigate the impact on our operating margins, and we will continue to do so. It started with where we work. We systematically reviewed profitability at a granular subproduct line level. And this resulted in the consolidation of facilities in more than 20 countries around the world and closing down operations in 2 countries. And finally, current market conditions forced us to reduce global headcount by 25% in 2015, a necessary but very unfortunate reality. 
The second part of our strategy is to look beyond the cycle and ensure long-term health of the franchise. For example, aligning ourselves with the right customers, investing in technology and staying dead focused on superior execution. In terms of customer portfolio, we work to align ourselves with customers who have stronger balance sheets and fairway acreage in the basins. 
In North America, our top 17 customers make up 50% of our revenue. When the downturn began, these customers were among the last to lay down rigs. Today, we're collaborating with them on ways to lower their cost per BOE to a place where we can both be successful. And when the recovery comes, we believe that these operators and therefore Halliburton will be best positioned for the upside. 
In terms of technology, 2015 was a successful year. Despite the downturn in activity, we saw an uptake of new technologies, such as DecisionSpace and Rock-Firm, helping customers maximize production and lower their cost per barrel of oil. 
A recent addition to our custom chemistry portfolio is our MicroScout Service. MicroScout is a hydraulic fracturing treatment designed to deliver propane into far-field microfractures, enhancing the productive life of new wells. Early trials have indicated more than a 20% uplift in production compared to offset wells. Our technologies like MicroScout represent years of research through a disciplined multistage gate program. And although I typically spend more time talking about execution and how we get things done in the field, it's important to point out that we're executing in the technology side of our business as well. Through joint research projects with our customers and by elevating field developed solutions, Halliburton is among the more efficient innovators in any industry.
Last year, Halliburton secured new patents at an R&D cost of less than $1 million per patent. In terms of R&D patent efficiency, which is central to the return on intellectual property, Halliburton is in the same range as other top global U.S. patent leaders. 
And finally, superior execution. Service quality is a frequently underappreciated piece of our business, but I can tell you that in a market like this, a timely, efficient job can the difference between an economic well and an uneconomic well. So for many markets, contract extensions and project awards are influenced by service quality or simply put, it's how we distinguish ourselves to win and retain work.
Now looking at 2015, it was an extremely strong year for the quality of our operations. This was our third straight year of improvement in both safety and service quality metrics, both of which saw significant double-digit reductions from 2014. Even while the market is forcing us to streamline our footprint in the field, we're improving our performance rates, essentially doing more with less and doing it better. We are refining our processes and systems, eliminating everything that's not required to deliver our value proposition. You'll be hearing more about this throughout 2016 as this is not a onetime event. 
It's the relentless focus on efficiency and process improvement that makes us the execution company. We believe that these elements: our strong customer portfolio, our efficient technology spend and our superior service quality, provide a strong foundation for our business. We are confident that by executing on our strategy and building on these successes, we can continue to outperform our competitors both during the downturn and when the recovery comes.

Of course, the way you do business between international markets and the U.S. markets is also quite different. With the drilling and completion efficiencies that we've got in the U.S., the time to drill and complete a well has been dramatically reduced, which means the time that -- between when you can price what is a frac cost or what is drilling cost or what is a mud job cost is very dynamic, very real-time and is very transactional. The international market still continues to be a long-term contract market, so the discussions that you have with customers around price concessions and scope changes is typically done within the context of an existing long-term contract, which gives you more of a seat at the table and more of an ability to convince the customer that what you're delivering is adding value or that you have ideas where their contracts can get more efficient and therefore reduce their cost per BOE. And customers always have the ability to go out on tender, but those things typically take a while to come to fruition. So I think really the velocity by which business is done in North America is quite faster than it does in the international market. And therefore, I think the margins will stay up at a higher level and not be compressed down to U.S. levels."

I want to begin with a few of our key accomplishments in 2015. First, total company revenue of $23.6 billion declined 28% year-over-year, outperforming a 35% decline in both the average worldwide rig count and global drilling and completions spend. And even though it was a very tough market, I am pleased to say that once again we outpaced our peer group in North America and internationally, both sequentially and on a full year basis.
I am especially pleased with the resilience of our international business. Despite lower revenues as a result of pricing concessions and activity reductions, we were able to improve operating margins during the year due to a relentless focus on cost management. We also outperformed our largest peers sequentially and on a full year basis in both revenue and in margins. 
And in North America, of course, it was beyond a challenging year, where we saw unprecedented declines in activity. However, relative to the overall market, I am pleased with our performance. From the 2014 peak, our completions-related activity declined approximately 33% relative to a 64% reduction in the U.S. land rig count. This clearly again demonstrates the customer flight to quality that has emerged during this downturn and positions us well for the market's eventual recovery.
Now I would like to provide you with an update on the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. During the quarter, we announced that our timing agreement with the Department of Justice expired without reaching a settlement or the DOJ initiating litigation. In December, the DOJ informed us that they do not believe that our previously announced proposed divestitures are sufficient to address the DOJ's concerns but acknowledged that they would assess further proposals. 
With respect to the European Commission, the review has entered Phase 2, which was anticipated, and we recently advised the commission that we plan to formally propose remedies, which we believe should satisfy any competition concerns.
Earlier this month, Halliburton presented to the DOJ an enhanced set of proposed divestitures in order to seek their approval of the transaction. We also informally notified the EC and other jurisdictions about the enhanced divestiture package. The sales process for the planned divestitures continues, and we are in discussions with interested buyers. There is no agreement to date with the DOJ or EC as to the adequacy of the proposed divestitures. Our conversations with the DOJ and the EC and other enforcement authorities continue, with the desire to resolve their competition-related concerns as soon as possible.
Now I want to be clear that we remain committed to seeing this deal through despite the extended time required to obtain regulatory approvals. Now while it is taking longer than originally expected, we believe the compelling strategic and financial benefits for our shareholders inherent in this combination continues to remain intact. We strongly believe that the proposed merger is good for the industry and for our customers. The combination is expected to create an even stronger company and achieve substantial efficiencies, enabling us to compete aggressively to provide efficient, innovative and low-cost services. Completion of the transaction would allow us to better meet our customers' oil services needs and help them operate more cost-effectively, which is increasingly important due to the current state of the energy industry and oil and gas prices.
Finally, we agreed with Baker Hughes to extend the period to obtain required regulatory approvals to no later than April 30, 2016, but remain focused on completing the deal as early as possible. In the event regulatory approvals have not been received by April 30, the merger agreement does not terminate automatically. Both companies may continue to seek regulatory approval or either company may terminate the merger agreement.
Now let me discuss what we're seeing in the market today and our prospects and challenges for the coming year, and then Christian will discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail.
Now this has certainly been the most challenging downturn that I have seen in my many, many years in business. We expect the market will continue to remain challenged in 2016 and that it will be the first time since the late '80s that global upstream spending will decline for 2 consecutive years. Commodity prices have been a moving target, forcing our customers to be cautious in providing visibility to us and their shareholders into their 2016 capital expenditure plans. Although we do not believe current oil prices are sustainable, they are without a doubt negatively influencing customer plans in the near term. 
On a geographic basis, North America is expected to be the most impacted in 2016. Third-party surveys have also been a moving target, indicating a year-on-year decline in service spending from 30% up to as much as 50%, and that's on top of the estimated 40% decline in industry spend in 2015. But the reality is, due to the macro uncertainties, many of our customers are managing their businesses in real time, rig-by-rig. Accordingly, we are going to take this market week-by-week and, in some cases, crew-by-crew. This is unlikely to change until our customers have confidence in a sustainable and economical oil price.
Now there are a number of moving parts in North America, and my experience has taught me not to bet on the exact timing of a recovery. But we do expect that the longer it takes, the sharper the recovery will be. Until then, we will continue to execute our playbook and adapt our cost structure to market conditions while also positioning our North America land business for future success and ultimately to outperform the industry as the market recovers.
The international markets held up much better than North America in 2015, but they are also not immune to the impacts of lower commodity prices. Recent third-party surveys for international spend indicate a decline that may be up to 20%, which will be slightly worse than last year. We are working diligently with our customers to improve economics of their projects through technology and operating efficiency, but do expect margins to be negatively impacted by lower activity levels and pricing pressures throughout the year.
Now looking at our geographies. We expect activity in the Middle East/Asia region to again be the most resilient in 2016, as recent mature field project awards throughout the Middle East are anticipated to move forward. However, we expect Australia, India and other markets across Asia to be impacted by reduced customer spending and delayed projects.
Europe/Africa/CIS is also expected to experience activity declines across the entire region in 2016, with the most vulnerable areas being the North Sea and Angola, where the offshore markets continue to face extremely challenging economics. Customers are focused on reducing their cost structures through more efficient well design and the adoption of new standards for production systems. But these are structural changes that will take time to fully implement. 
And in Latin America, we expect lower activities across the region, with the largest declines projected in Brazil and Mexico as a result of significant NOC budget constraints. Latin America is currently expected to have the largest percentage decline within our international markets. 
So in summary, 2016 is simply going to be a tough slog through the mud, but I can tell you we will do what we have to do. We know what buttons to push and levers to pull, and we will. We believe our customers will remain focused on cost-per-barrel optimization and gaining higher levels of efficiency, both of which bode very well for Halliburton. 
Now it is very difficult to predict the exact timing, but once the market has visibility of the trough, the recovery will come into view. And when it does, we expect the recovery will play out very similar to others, where North America will rebound first and the strongest, followed by the international markets where the rebound will be more methodical.
Now let me turn the call over to Christian to provide more details on our financial results. Christian?"
177698,315848644,920549,"Halliburton Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2016",2016-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Halliburton Company","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a comparison of our fourth quarter results to the third quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.1 billion represented a 9% decline, while operating income declined by 7% to $473 million. A",820,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a comparison of our fourth quarter results to the third quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.1 billion represented a 9% decline, while operating income declined by 7% to $473 million. 
All regions experienced revenue declines during the quarter, led by North America as a result of continued activity and pricing headwinds. For our international business, fourth quarter revenue and operating income declined by 5% and 10%, respectively, as a result of price concessions and activity declines with our customers during the quarter. Additionally, due to customer budget constraints, we did not see the typical benefit from year-end equipment and software sales. 
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue declined by 5%, with a similar decline in operating income of 6%. Lower activity levels in Saudi Arabia and Iraq led the decline, partially offset by modestly higher sales in China and increased activity in Kuwait and Oman.
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS. We saw fourth quarter revenue decline by 6%, with a decrease in operating income of 18%. The decline for the quarter was primarily driven by a sharp reduction of activity in the North Sea, partially offset by higher activity in Angola and Algeria. 
Latin America revenue and operating income declined by 6% and 9%, respectively, driven by reduced activity throughout most of the region. Partially offsetting this decline was improved activity levels in Mexico.
Moving to North America. Revenue declined 13%, with operating margins improving by approximately 160 basis points. Reduced activity throughout the U.S. land was the primary driver of the revenue decline, especially in the pumping-related product lines. The margin improvement was primarily due to a spike in year-end Completion Tools sales in the Gulf of Mexico, which is not expected to repeat in the first quarter. 
Margins also benefited from our aggressive cost-reduction efforts and minimal weather disruptions during the quarter. Our margins continue to include an elevated cost structure in North America in anticipation of the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. 
For 2015, our total company decrementals were about half of the previous cycle due to actions we've been taking to adjust our cost structure throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, we incurred a charge of $192 million after tax, consisting primarily of asset write-offs and severance-related costs. As industry fundamentals continue to weaken, we will continue to make further structural adjustments and may incur additional charges in the first quarter. 
Our corporate and other expense totaled $70 million for the quarter, excluding costs related to the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the first quarter will be approximately $70 million excluding acquisition-related costs, and this will be the new run rate for 2016. 
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of approximately 19% includes a retroactive benefit from Congress' recent approval of the federal research and experimentation tax credit. As we go forward in 2016, we are expecting the first quarter and full year effective tax rates to be approximately 24% to 25%.
Given the ongoing decline in activity levels, we further reduced our capital expenditures as we exited the year, ending 2015 with a total CapEx spend of $2.2 billion. Our current guidance for 2016 capital expenditures is $1.6 billion. This CapEx guidance includes the continued conversion of our fleet to Q10 pumps to support our service efficiency strategy, which is critical in this environment. We also expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.9 billion for 2016. This is the first time in over a decade that our CapEx is lower than our expected DD&A expense, which demonstrates our commitment to live within our cash flows during this challenging period for the industry.
Turning to our operational outlook. The severity of the activity decline in the coming year continues to be unclear, but let me give you some comments for the first quarter. Our first quarter international results will be subject to weather-related seasonality that occurs in geographies such as the North Sea and Russia, exacerbated by the uncertainty around customer spending levels for the coming year. Although difficult to predict, at this point, we anticipate first quarter Eastern Hemisphere revenues to decline sequentially by a low double-digit percentage, with margins similar to the first quarter 2015 levels. In Latin America, we anticipate revenues to decline sequentially by a mid-teens percentage, with margins retreating to the upper single digits.
In North America, we also have limited visibility but estimate that first quarter revenues will decline with the U.S. rig count, which is already down double digits against the fourth quarter average. We currently anticipate margins to come in at around break-even levels. And finally, we enter 2016 on a solid financial position with strong liquidity, which will enable us to address the current market challenges and be well positioned for the industry's eventual recovery.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?"

To begin, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate all of our frontline people for delivering solid fourth quarter results in a tough market. As Dave mentioned earlier, we're expecting 2016 to be a very",889,"Thank you, Christian, and good morning, everyone. To begin, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate all of our frontline people for delivering solid fourth quarter results in a tough market. 
As Dave mentioned earlier, we're expecting 2016 to be a very challenging year due to poor commodity prices and shrinking customer budgets. We believe that as the coming cycle unfolds, we'll see a continuation of what began in 2015: customers seeking efficiency gains and discrete technology to help them bend the cost curve. At lower commodity price levels, we believe the market will continue to evolve in this direction and customers will adopt products and services that help them produce wells with a lower cost per barrel of oil equivalent. Now this plays directly into Halliburton's strengths, helping our customers become more efficient on location and maximize their production, all of which contribute to lowering their unit cost per barrel of oil. 
So regardless of the commodity price, we're continuing to execute on our proven two-pronged strategy in this downturn, the first part being to control what we can control in the short term, and second is to look beyond the cycle to prepare for recovery. 
And with respect to the short term, this means making the tactical changes necessary to rightsize the business to the market. We revisited our cost profile throughout 2015 and made significant changes to help mitigate the impact on our operating margins, and we will continue to do so. It started with where we work. We systematically reviewed profitability at a granular subproduct line level. And this resulted in the consolidation of facilities in more than 20 countries around the world and closing down operations in 2 countries. And finally, current market conditions forced us to reduce global headcount by 25% in 2015, a necessary but very unfortunate reality. 
The second part of our strategy is to look beyond the cycle and ensure long-term health of the franchise. For example, aligning ourselves with the right customers, investing in technology and staying dead focused on superior execution. In terms of customer portfolio, we work to align ourselves with customers who have stronger balance sheets and fairway acreage in the basins. 
In North America, our top 17 customers make up 50% of our revenue. When the downturn began, these customers were among the last to lay down rigs. Today, we're collaborating with them on ways to lower their cost per BOE to a place where we can both be successful. And when the recovery comes, we believe that these operators, and therefore Halliburton, will be best positioned for the upside. 
In terms of technology, 2015 was a successful year. Despite the downturn in activity, we saw an uptake of new technologies, such as DecisionSpace and Rock-Firm, helping customers maximize production and lower their cost per barrel of oil. 
A recent addition to our custom chemistry portfolio is our MicroScout Service. MicroScout is a hydraulic fracturing treatment designed to deliver proppant into far-field microfractures, enhancing the productive life of new wells. Early trials have indicated more than a 20% uplift in production compared to offset wells. Our technologies like MicroScout represent years of research through a disciplined multistage gate program. And although I typically spend more time talking about execution and how we get things done in the field, it's important to point out that we're executing in the technology side of our business as well. Through joint research projects with our customers and by elevating field-developed solutions, Halliburton is among the more efficient innovators in any industry.
Last year, Halliburton secured new patents at an R&D cost of less than $1 million per patent. In terms of R&D patent efficiency, which is central to the return on intellectual property, Halliburton is in the same range as other top global U.S. patent leaders. 
And finally, superior execution. Service quality is a frequently underappreciated piece of our business, but I can tell you that in a market like this, a timely, efficient job can be the difference between an economic well and an uneconomic well. So for many markets, contract extensions and project awards are influenced by service quality or simply put, it's how we distinguish ourselves to win and retain work.
Now looking at 2015, it was an extremely strong year for the quality of our operations. This was our third straight year of improvement in both safety and service quality metrics, both of which saw significant double-digit reductions from 2014. Even while the market is forcing us to streamline our footprint in the field, we're improving our performance rates, essentially doing more with less and doing it better. We are refining our processes and systems, eliminating everything that's not required to deliver our value proposition. You'll be hearing more about this throughout 2016 as this is not a onetime event. 
It's the relentless focus on efficiency and process improvement that makes us the execution company. We believe that these elements: our strong customer portfolio, our efficient technology spend and our superior service quality, provide a strong foundation for our business. We are confident that by executing on our strategy and building on these successes, we can continue to outperform our competitors both during the downturn and when the recovery comes.

Of course, the way you do business between international markets and the U.S. markets is also quite different. With the drilling and completion efficiencies that we've got in the U.S., the time to drill and complete a well has been dramatically reduced, which means the time that -- between when you can price what is a frac cost or what is drilling cost or what is a mud job cost is very dynamic, very real-time and is very transactional. The international market still continues to be a long-term contract market, so the discussions that you have with customers around price concessions and scope changes is typically done within the context of an existing long-term contract, which gives you more of a seat at the table and more of an ability to convince the customer that what you're delivering is adding value or that you have ideas where their contracts can get more efficient and therefore reduce their cost per BOE. And customers always have the ability to go out on tender, but those things typically take a while to come to fruition. So I think really the velocity by which business is done in North America is quite faster than it does in the international market.

And again, these are also economies in many cases that are built around production of oil and gas. And so from an activity perspective, they tend to be, relative basis, more resilient. The second thing it does is it does provide the opportunity to better manage the work with some visibility, which helps us support margins; and the second (sic) [third], work with clients who are committed to a level of activity to then optimize that level of activity.

During our prepared remarks, Dave will provide an update on the pending Baker Hughes transaction. However, due to the ongoing regulatory review, we will not be taking any questions today related to regulatory matters.
Some of our comments today may include forward-looking statements reflecting Halliburton's views about future events. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to materially differ from our forward-looking statements. These risks are discussed in Halliburton's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014; Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015; recent current reports on Form 8-K and other Securities and Exchange Commission filings. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.
Our comments today include non-GAAP financial measures. And unless otherwise noted in our discussion today, we will be excluding the impact of these items. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our fourth quarter press release, which can be found on our website.
Now I'll turn the call over to Dave. Dave?"

I want to begin with a few of our key accomplishments in 2015. First, total company revenue of $23.6 billion declined 28% year-over-year, outperforming a 35% decline in both the average worldwide rig count and global drilling and completions spend. And even though it was a very tough market, I am pleased to say that once again we outpaced our peer group in North America and internationally, both sequentially and on a full year basis.
I am especially pleased with the resilience of our international business. Despite lower revenues as a result of pricing concessions and activity reductions, we were able to improve operating margins during the year due to a relentless focus on cost management. We also outperformed our largest peers sequentially and on a full year basis in both revenue and in margins. 
And in North America, of course, it was beyond a challenging year, where we saw unprecedented declines in activity. However, relative to the overall market, I am pleased with our performance. From the 2014 peak, our completions-related activity declined approximately 33% relative to a 64% reduction in the U.S. land rig count. This clearly again demonstrates the customer flight to quality that has emerged during this downturn and positions us well for the market's eventual recovery.
Now I would like to provide you with an update on the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. During the quarter, we announced that our timing agreement with the Department of Justice expired without reaching a settlement or the DOJ initiating litigation. In December, the DOJ informed us that they do not believe that our previously announced proposed divestitures are sufficient to address the DOJ's concerns but acknowledged that they would assess further proposals. 
With respect to the European Commission, the review has entered Phase 2, which was anticipated, and we recently advised the commission that we plan to formally propose remedies, which we believe should satisfy any competition concerns.
Earlier this month, Halliburton presented to the DOJ an enhanced set of proposed divestitures in order to seek their approval of the transaction. We also informally notified the EC and other jurisdictions about the enhanced divestiture package. The sales process for the planned divestitures continues, and we are in discussions with interested buyers. There is no agreement to date with the DOJ or EC as to the adequacy of the proposed divestitures. Our conversations with the DOJ and the EC and other enforcement authorities continue, with the desire to resolve their competition-related concerns as soon as possible.
Now I want to be clear that we remain committed to seeing this deal through despite the extended time required to obtain regulatory approvals. Now while it is taking longer than originally expected, we believe the compelling strategic and financial benefits for our shareholders inherent in this combination continues to remain intact. We strongly believe that the proposed merger is good for the industry and for our customers. The combination is expected to create an even stronger company and achieve substantial efficiencies, enabling us to compete aggressively to provide efficient, innovative and low-cost services. Completion of the transaction would allow us to better meet our customers' oil services needs and help them operate more cost-effectively, which is increasingly important due to the current state of the energy industry and oil and gas prices.
Finally, we agreed with Baker Hughes to extend the period to obtain required regulatory approvals to no later than April 30, 2016, but remain focused on completing the deal as early as possible. In the event regulatory approvals have not been received by April 30, the merger agreement does not terminate automatically. Both companies may continue to seek regulatory approval or either company may terminate the merger agreement.
Now let me discuss what we're seeing in the market today and our prospects and challenges for the coming year, and then Christian will discuss our fourth quarter results in more detail.
Now this has certainly been the most challenging downturn that I have seen in my many, many years in business. We expect the market will continue to remain challenged in 2016 and that it will be the first time since the late '80s that global upstream spending will decline for 2 consecutive years. Commodity prices have been a moving target, forcing our customers to be cautious in providing visibility to us and their shareholders into their 2016 capital expenditure plans. Although we do not believe current oil prices are sustainable, they are without a doubt negatively influencing customer plans in the near term. 
On a geographic basis, North America is expected to be the most impacted in 2016. Third-party surveys have also been a moving target, indicating a year-on-year decline in service spending from 30% up to as much as 50%, and that's on top of the estimated 40% decline in industry spend in 2015. But the reality is, due to the macro uncertainties, many of our customers are managing their businesses in real time, rig-by-rig. Accordingly, we are going to take this market week-by-week and, in some cases, crew-by-crew. This is unlikely to change until our customers have confidence in a sustainable and economical oil price.
Now there are a number of moving parts in North America, and my experience has taught me not to bet on the exact timing of a recovery. But we do expect that the longer it takes, the sharper the recovery will be. Until then, we will continue to execute our playbook and adapt our cost structure to market conditions while also positioning our North America land business for future success and ultimately to outperform the industry as the market recovers.
The international markets held up much better than North America in 2015, but they are also not immune to the impacts of lower commodity prices. Recent third-party surveys for international spend indicate a decline that may be up to 20%, which will be slightly worse than last year. We are working diligently with our customers to improve economics of their projects through technology and operating efficiency, but do expect margins to be negatively impacted by lower activity levels and pricing pressures throughout the year.
Now looking at our geographies. We expect activity in the Middle East/Asia region to again be the most resilient in 2016, as recent mature field project awards throughout the Middle East are anticipated to move forward. However, we expect Australia, India and other markets across Asia to be impacted by reduced customer spending and delayed projects.
Europe/Africa/CIS is also expected to experience activity declines across the entire region in 2016, with the most vulnerable areas being the North Sea and Angola, where the offshore markets continue to face extremely challenging economics. Customers are focused on reducing their cost structures through more efficient well design and the adoption of new standards for production systems. But these are structural changes that will take time to fully implement. 
And in Latin America, we expect lower activities across the region, with the largest declines projected in Brazil and Mexico as a result of significant NOC budget constraints. Latin America is currently expected to have the largest percentage decline within our international markets. 
So in summary, 2016 is simply going to be a tough slog through the mud, but I can tell you we will do what we have to do. We know what buttons to push and levers to pull, and we will. We believe our customers will remain focused on cost-per-barrel optimization and gaining higher levels of efficiency, both of which bode very well for Halliburton. 
Now it is very difficult to predict the exact timing, but once the market has visibility of the trough, the recovery will come into view. And when it does, we expect the recovery will play out very similar to others, where North America will rebound first and the strongest, followed by the international markets where the rebound will be more methodical.
Now let me turn the call over to Christian to provide more details on our financial results. Christian?"
177698,315848644,920609,"Halliburton Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2016",2016-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Halliburton Company","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a comparison of our fourth quarter results to the third quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.1 billion represented a 9% decline, while operating income declined by 7% to $473 million. A",820,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a comparison of our fourth quarter results to the third quarter of 2015. Total company revenue of $5.1 billion represented a 9% decline, while operating income declined by 7% to $473 million. 
All regions experienced revenue declines during the quarter, led by North America as a result of continued activity and pricing headwinds. For our international business, fourth quarter revenue and operating income declined by 5% and 10%, respectively, as a result of price concessions and activity declines with our customers during the quarter. Additionally, due to customer budget constraints, we did not see the typical benefit from year-end equipment and software sales. 
In the Middle East/Asia region, revenue declined by 5%, with a similar decline in operating income of 6%. Lower activity levels in Saudi Arabia and Iraq led the decline, partially offset by modestly higher sales in China and increased activity in Kuwait and Oman.
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS. We saw fourth quarter revenue decline by 6%, with a decrease in operating income of 18%. The decline for the quarter was primarily driven by a sharp reduction of activity in the North Sea, partially offset by higher activity in Angola and Algeria. 
Latin America revenue and operating income declined by 6% and 9%, respectively, driven by reduced activity throughout most of the region. Partially offsetting this decline was improved activity levels in Mexico.
Moving to North America. Revenue declined 13%, with operating margins improving by approximately 160 basis points. Reduced activity throughout the U.S. land was the primary driver of the revenue decline, especially in the pumping-related product lines. The margin improvement was primarily due to a spike in year-end Completion Tools sales in the Gulf of Mexico, which is not expected to repeat in the first quarter. 
Margins also benefited from our aggressive cost-reduction efforts and minimal weather disruptions during the quarter. Our margins continue to include an elevated cost structure in North America in anticipation of the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. 
For 2015, our total company decrementals were about half of the previous cycle due to actions we've been taking to adjust our cost structure throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, we incurred a charge of $192 million after tax, consisting primarily of asset write-offs and severance-related costs. As industry fundamentals continue to weaken, we will continue to make further structural adjustments and may incur additional charges in the first quarter. 
Our corporate and other expense totaled $70 million for the quarter, excluding costs related to the pending Baker Hughes acquisition. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the first quarter will be approximately $70 million excluding acquisition-related costs, and this will be the new run rate for 2016. 
Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of approximately 19% includes a retroactive benefit from Congress' recent approval of the federal research and experimentation tax credit. As we go forward in 2016, we are expecting the first quarter and full year effective tax rates to be approximately 24% to 25%.
Given the ongoing decline in activity levels, we further reduced our capital expenditures as we exited the year, ending 2015 with a total CapEx spend of $2.2 billion. Our current guidance for 2016 capital expenditures is $1.6 billion. This CapEx guidance includes the continued conversion of our fleet to Q10 pumps to support our service efficiency strategy, which is critical in this environment. We also expect depreciation and amortization to be approximately $1.9 billion for 2016. This is the first time in over a decade that our CapEx is lower than our expected DD&A expense, which demonstrates our commitment to live within our cash flows during this challenging period for the industry.
Turning to our operational outlook. The severity of the activity decline in the coming year continues to be unclear, but let me give you some comments for the first quarter. Our first quarter international results will be subject to weather-related seasonality that occurs in geographies such as the North Sea and Russia, exacerbated by the uncertainty around customer spending levels for the coming year. Although difficult to predict, at this point, we anticipate first quarter Eastern Hemisphere revenues to decline sequentially by a low double-digit percentage, with margins similar to the first quarter 2015 levels. In Latin America, we anticipate revenues to decline sequentially by a mid-teens percentage, with margins retreating to the upper single digits.
In North America, we also have limited visibility but estimate that first quarter revenues will decline with the U.S. rig count, which is already down double digits against the fourth quarter average. We currently anticipate margins to come in at around break-even levels. And finally, we enter 2016 on a solid financial position with strong liquidity, which will enable us to address the current market challenges and be well positioned for the industry's eventual recovery.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?"
177698,315848644,920609,"Halliburton Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2016",2016-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Halliburton Company","Executives","Thank you, Christian, and good morning, everyone. To begin, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate all of our frontline people for delivering solid fourth quarter results in a tough market.

To begin, I'd like to take a moment to congratulate all of our frontline people for delivering solid fourth quarter results in a tough market. 
As Dave mentioned earlier, we're expecting 2016 to be a very challenging year due to poor commodity prices and shrinking customer budgets. We believe that as the coming cycle unfolds, we'll see a continuation of what began in 2015: customers seeking efficiency gains and discrete technology to help them bend the cost curve. At lower commodity price levels, we believe the market will continue to evolve in this direction and customers will adopt products and services that help them produce wells with a lower cost per barrel of oil equivalent. Now this plays directly into Halliburton's strengths, helping our customers become more efficient on location and maximize their production, all of which contribute to lowering their unit cost per barrel of oil. 
So regardless of the commodity price, we're continuing to execute on our proven two-pronged strategy in this downturn, the first part being to control what we can control in the short term, and second is to look beyond the cycle to prepare for recovery. 
And with respect to the short term, this means making the tactical changes necessary to rightsize the business to the market. We revisited our cost profile throughout 2015 and made significant changes to help mitigate the impact on our operating margins, and we will continue to do so. It started with where we work. We systematically reviewed profitability at a granular subproduct line level. And this resulted in the consolidation of facilities in more than 20 countries around the world and closing down operations in 2 countries. And finally, current market conditions forced us to reduce global headcount by 25% in 2015, a necessary but very unfortunate reality. 
The second part of our strategy is to look beyond the cycle and ensure long-term health of the franchise. For example, aligning ourselves with the right customers, investing in technology and staying dead focused on superior execution. In terms of customer portfolio, we work to align ourselves with customers who have stronger balance sheets and fairway acreage in the basins. 
In North America, our top 17 customers make up 50% of our revenue. When the downturn began, these customers were among the last to lay down rigs. Today, we're collaborating with them on ways to lower their cost per BOE to a place where we can both be successful. And when the recovery comes, we believe that these operators, and therefore Halliburton, will be best positioned for the upside. 
In terms of technology, 2015 was a successful year. Despite the downturn in activity, we saw an uptake of new technologies, such as DecisionSpace and Rock-Firm, helping customers maximize production and lower their cost per barrel of oil. 
A recent addition to our custom chemistry portfolio is our MicroScout Service. MicroScout is a hydraulic fracturing treatment designed to deliver proppant into far-field microfractures, enhancing the productive life of new wells. Early trials have indicated more than a 20% uplift in production compared to offset wells. Our technologies like MicroScout represent years of research through a disciplined multistage gate program. And although I typically spend more time talking about execution and how we get things done in the field, it's important to point out that we're executing in the technology side of our business as well. Through joint research projects with our customers and by elevating field-developed solutions, Halliburton is among the more efficient innovators in any industry.
Last year, Halliburton secured new patents at an R&D cost of less than $1 million per patent. In terms of R&D patent efficiency, which is central to the return on intellectual property, Halliburton is in the same range as other top global U.S. patent leaders. 
And finally, superior execution. Service quality is a frequently underappreciated piece of our business, but I can tell you that in a market like this, a timely, efficient job can be the difference between an economic well and an uneconomic well. So for many markets, contract extensions and project awards are influenced by service quality or simply put, it's how we distinguish ourselves to win and retain work.
Now looking at 2015, it was an extremely strong year for the quality of our operations. This was our third straight year of improvement in both safety and service quality metrics, both of which saw significant double-digit reductions from 2014. Even while the market is forcing us to streamline our footprint in the field, we're improving our performance rates, essentially doing more with less and doing it better. We are refining our processes and systems, eliminating everything that's not required to deliver our value proposition. You'll be hearing more about this throughout 2016 as this is not a onetime event. 
It's the relentless focus on efficiency and process improvement that makes us the execution company. We believe that these elements: our strong customer portfolio, our efficient technology spend and our superior service quality, provide a strong foundation for our business. We are confident that by executing on our strategy and building on these successes, we can continue to outperform our competitors both during the downturn and when the recovery comes.

And are you starting to see a change of behavior by the small pressure pumpers, where they're starting to become more aggressive in either pulling out of the market or on the cost side or can they?"

And consistent with remarks before, we see today about half the equipment as idled. That equipment is not being maintained and is being cannibalized for parts more broadly. The service intensity, believe it or not, continues to creep up, so we saw a 9% sequential increase in profit pumped on a per-well basis, which means equipment is working harder than it ever has. We estimate 4 million to 6 million horsepower that'd be out of the market by the second half of 2016. And my gut says we're at the top end of that range right now, and this is really why we're committed to Frac of the Future. I mean, it's the cost of the pump, and it's the total operating cost of the equipment that matters, in my view, the most. And that's what'll have Halliburton best positioned for the recovery."

Of course, the way you do business between international markets and the U.S. markets is also quite different. With the drilling and completion efficiencies that we've got in the U.S., the time to drill and complete a well has been dramatically reduced, which means the time that -- between when you can price what is a frac cost or what is drilling cost or what is a mud job cost is very dynamic, very real-time and is very transactional. The international market still continues to be a long-term contract market, so the discussions that you have with customers around price concessions and scope changes is typically done within the context of an existing long-term contract, which gives you more of a seat at the table and more of an ability to convince the customer that what you're delivering is adding value or that you have ideas where their contracts can get more efficient and therefore reduce their cost per BOE. And customers always have the ability to go out on tender, but those things typically take a while to come to fruition. So I think really the velocity by which business is done in North America is quite faster than it does in the international market.

Our prepared remarks today will be brief, leaving more time for the question-and-answer period. We would like to start by providing some background on our mutual decision with Baker Hughes to terminate our merger agreement.
From the time we announced the deal in November 2014, we knew that putting together 2 companies with the global size and scale of Halliburton and Baker would be no small task, but we believed that we could close the deal and do so in a timely manner because it truly made sense. We expect that the deal would create compelling benefits for the stockholders, customers and other stakeholders of each company. The potential annual cost synergies were substantial, and the transaction was expected to be accretive to cash flow and earnings within only a couple of years. In addition, the transaction would've allowed us to further reduce our customers' cost per barrel of oil equivalent. This was truly a great deal, one that was unanimously approved by each company's Board of Directors and overwhelmingly approved by each company's shareholders.
Unfortunately, things have changed quite a bit since we signed the merger agreement. From a regulatory perspective, we completely understood that the transaction would draw regulatory scrutiny and that substantial divestitures would be required to obtain regulatory approval. However, obtaining U.S. antitrust approval of large complex business combinations, regardless of the industry, has become increasingly time intensive and difficult as evidenced by the termination and litigation of several other large proposed transactions over the last 16 months.
We continue to believe the proposed Baker Hughes transaction would have been competitive, but our proposed divestitures were more than sufficient to address any regulatory concerns and that the position taken in the U.S. Department of Justice's lawsuit and the European Commission's statement of the objections are incorrect. We also continue to believe that the transaction would be good for the industry and customers, particularly now at a time when customers are focused on lowering cost per barrel of oil equivalent. However, the DOJ's lawsuit and EC statement of objections combined with the elongated review process in all jurisdictions, created substantial hurdles with respect to timing and deal certainty. We would also like to correct a misimpression about the proposed divestiture package that may have resulted from the statements made during the DOJ's April press conference regarding the lawsuit. We proposed to the DOJ a divestitures package worth billions of dollars that we believe would facilitate the entry of new competition in markets in which products and services are being divested, and we had buyers expressing a strong desire to acquire those businesses. The proposed divestitures were, for the most part, divestitures of complete worldwide product lines, including employees, management teams, business development personnel, manufacturing, R&D facilities, intellectual property portfolios and customer contracts. They addressed most of the markets alleged in the DOJ complaint. We believe that the proposed divestiture package was sufficient to address the DOJ-specific competitive concerns.
In addition to regulatory matters, the unprecedented deterioration of the oil and gas industry decimated the economics of the deal. During the pendency of the deal, the WTI price of oil has gone from over $76 in November of 2014 to a low of just over $26 in February of this year, while the global rig count has gone to a 17-year low, and you all know what's happened in North America, where each week we seem to hit new historical lows. As a consequence, the aggregate quarterly revenues of Baker Hughes have decreased nearly 60% from $6.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014 to $2.7 billion for the first quarter of this year. 
Given the abrupt and deep downturn in the oil services market, we were unable to obtain adequate value for the businesses we proposed to divest. This, coupled with the decline in each company's business, eroded the expected synergies and accretive aspects of the transaction, including the time line to integrate the businesses to levels which we believe severely undermined the originally anticipated synergy benefits of the deal. As a result, it became clear that continuing to pursue the transaction was no longer in the best interest of our stockholders, despite having to pay the termination fee to Baker Hughes. Moving forward with the transaction did not make sense in light of the elongated regulatory scrutiny, the projected time lines for closing the transaction, the poor deal economics and the current market environment.
Now to be clearly, we recommended this transaction to our board and to our shareholders for approval. We believe trying to do this transaction was worth the risk because of our strong belief in our strategy, process, employees and management team, but it wasn't to be. There is no doubt we are disappointed, and I want to thank both our employees as well as the employees of Baker Hughes for their tireless efforts throughout the regulatory process. But you know what? We are Halliburton and we will continue to provide the same innovative services and products that we've delivered to our customers for more than 97 years. We have a world-class management team who has industry knowledge and experience to drive value for our shareholders. 
Prior to the potential transactions, we were in a strong #2 position in the market, with a proven successful strategy of gaining market share through outperforming against the rig count and having among the highest margins and returns in the industry. We were successful in executing that strategy and knew our process was scalable to a larger company. That fact has not changed. If we have been successful, adding the Baker Hughes assets would've given us that scale quickly. But our strategy is not changed. We still expect to outperform the rig count. We plan to scale up our product service line capability by addressing one product line building block at a time through internal growth, investment and selective acquisitions. Going forward, we will strive to deliver the same predictable, reliable execution and industry-leading growth, margins and returns from our world-class employees and management team. 
Over the past 18 months, despite our intensive efforts to close the Baker Hughes transaction, we have been executing on our key strategic areas and adapting to the new reality that we face in a very difficult market. Compared to where we were 1.5 years ago, we have outperformed our peers both in North America and internationally. 
In the first quarter, we addressed some of our excess infrastructure cost that we were carrying pending the Baker Hughes transaction. We will now move aggressively to remove the remainder of those costs from our operations over the next couple of quarters. I am very proud of the outstanding operational and customer focus our employees have kept during this entire process. Their dedication, resiliency and hard work are the foundation of our company strength and why together we can and will weather any challenges that we face.
Now let me turn the call over to Christian to provide some financial details."

Let me start with a summary of our first quarter results. Total company revenue came in at $4.2 billion, which represents a 17% sequential decline compared to worldwide rig count decline of 21%. We experienced wea",950,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a summary of our first quarter results. Total company revenue came in at $4.2 billion, which represents a 17% sequential decline compared to worldwide rig count decline of 21%. We experienced weakening activity levels and pricing concessions during the quarter, along with seasonal weather disruptions in the North Sea and Russia. At this point, our overall decremental margins have been less than that of the previous cycle despite this downturn being deeper and longer. We've provided financial comparisons of our first quarter results to the fourth quarter of 2015 in our April 22 press release, and we would like to refer you to our commentary in that release. 
Due to our ongoing restructuring efforts, we revised our financial reporting presentation to only furnish overall regional results and global division results, and we will no longer provide divisional results by region. For completion and production and building and evaluation segments, we will only provide total global results for each segment going forward.
In the first quarter, we recognized a restructuring charge of $2.1 billion after tax to further adjust our cost structure to market conditions. This charge consisted primarily of asset impairments, including most of our non-cutin pressure pumping equipment as well as severance costs. As Dave mentioned, in the coming quarters, we will continue to make further structural adjustments, including the remaining escalated cost structure we've kept in North America.
Further, in accordance with accounting rules, we no longer classified our assets included in the proposed divestitures as assets held for sale at the end of the first quarter. As a result, in the first quarter, we incurred an asset tax charge to recognize the depreciation related to these assets that had been suspended since April of 2015. Beginning in the second quarter, our operational results will include the depreciation expense from these assets.
Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $46 million for the first quarter, excluding cost related to the Baker Hughes transaction. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the second quarter will be approximately $50 million to $55 million, excluding acquisition-related costs we incurred in April, and this will be the new quarterly run rate for the rest of 2016. 
Our first quarter free cash flow was negative $355 million, driven by about $250 million of restructuring payments and acquisition-related costs. We continue to commit to living within our cash flows for the year and given the ongoing decline in activity levels, we have further reduced our capital expenditures plans for 2016 to approximately $850 million. We've been disciplined in the deployment of capital equipment during this downturn and expect to reduce our CapEx spend by approximately 75% compared to 2014.
Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $346 million. For the second quarter, we expect depreciation and amortization to be about $400 million as a result of recommencing the depreciation for the assets that were previously classified as held for sale, the impact of our multiyear reduction of capital expenditures and the impairments we have taken. 
In conjunction with the termination of our Baker Hughes transaction, $2.5 billion of debt that we issued in late 2015 will be mandatorily redeemed. At the end of the first quarter, we had $9.6 billion of cash and equivalents available. Taking into account the debt redemption plus the $3.5 billion termination fee, we would still have had approximately $3.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We also have $3 billion available under our revolving credit facility, which with our cash balance provides us with ample liquidity of $6.6 billion to address the challenges and opportunities of the current market. For modeling purposes, starting in the second quarter, we will begin reflecting the incremental interest expense on the debt, taking into account the redemption of the $2.5 billion. As such, our estimated net interest expense for the second quarter will be approximately $165 million, and the quarterly run rate interest expense for the second half of 2016 will be approximately $155 million. 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23%. Our income tax expense for the second quarter will be impacted by several factors, including recognition of the incremental interest and higher depreciation, the statutory rates for the various geographies where we expect to generate income or losses and any discrete tax items. These factors will lead to a high degree of variability on our effective tax rate. Based upon our current forecast and expected earnings mix, we anticipated that we will recognize approximately $10 million to $15 million of tax expense in the second quarter.
Turning to our operational outlook. The market dynamics continue to make forecasting a challenge, but let me provide you with our current thoughts on how we see the second quarter shaping up. The following regional guidance comments reflect the higher depreciation expense. 
In the Eastern Hemisphere, we anticipate second quarter revenues to come in at similar levels as the first quarter but with margins lower by 300 to 400 basis points due to the impact of ongoing and expected pricing concessions and additional depreciation. In Latin America, we expect an upper single-digit decline in revenues, with margins declining by approximately 200 to 300 basis points from the first quarter levels.
In North America, the U.S. land rig count is already down 23% compared to the first quarter average and has continued to deteriorate week after week. As is typical, we expect our sequential revenue decline to outperform the rig count by several hundred basis points and anticipate that our decremental margins will be approximately 25% in the second quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?"

Before anything else, I'd like to thank each of our employees for their focus on execution in spite of the distractions presented by both the marketplace and current events. We are the execution company.",572,"Thank you, Christian, and good morning, everyone. Before anything else, I'd like to thank each of our employees for their focus on execution in spite of the distractions presented by both the marketplace and current events. We are the execution company. 
As we've announced, we're sizing our cost structure to the market conditions we're experiencing. I main confident that when the market activity stabilizes, margins can start on the road to recovery. We've had a dedicated team focused on the Baker transaction, which freed the rest of us from distraction and gave us the ability to aggressively pursue our corporate strategy. We prepared the franchise to deliver industry-leading growth and returns when we exit this down cycle. Halliburton is the execution company and led our peer group in returns throughout this most recent cycle. Our strategy remains focused on what our customers value most highly: maximizing production at the lowest cost per BOE. 
Now clearly, this is a dynamic formula depending on where we are in the cycle. Today, there's no doubt that the numerator, meaning cost, has most of our customers attention. Cost is something we can control, and we do it well at Halliburton, and I'm pleased with our progress. We've consistently delivered this strategy through 2 components First, converting customer insight into cost-effective solutions; and second, by providing reliable service quality. Our capabilities and our execution culture are built around systematically collecting insight from our customers on their operational challenges and collaborating with them and within Halliburton to design the programs and technology to solve their economic and technical challenges. 
For example, during the first quarter, we delivered production-maximizing chemistry for a major deepwater customer. However, instead of executing from a costly stimulation vessel, we were able to deliver the job from a substantially lower cost supply vessel by employing modular pumping equipment. The second component, executing reliably on our solutions, is something Halliburton does well and our customers appreciate. Our concentration on executing key processes has realized a multiyear double-digit service quality improvement, a demonstration of our clear focus on the lowest cost per BOE in action. And finally, closing the loop on our performance is where I focus my attention every day. This is execution, meaning getting things done. Are we delivering what we promised to our customers? And how do we tighten our unique fit around collaboration, technology and service quality while systematically reducing our cost and capital requirements to deliver the growth and returns we expect? This is an ongoing effort. And recent example of this is our North American restructuring where we removed a layer of management. And this has changed our cost profile certainly but also simplified and improved our internal collaboration and execution. Commodity prices and markets will move up and down, but the one thing about which I am certain, one thing that won't change over time is that the lowest cost per BOE wins. We believe our collaborative approach of converting client insight into cost-effective solutions and our focus on reliable execution will consistently deliver the lowest cost per BOE and allow our customers to make better wells and be more successful over time.
We continue to believe that the longer it takes for the recovery to occur, the sharper the recovery will be and that North America represents the greatest upside and Halliburton is positioned to outperform. Now I'll turn the call over to Dave for closing comments. Dave?"

Let me sum things up. We are disappointed in the outcome of the Baker Hughes transaction, but we are not going to do a deal that is not economic for our shareholders, and we are confident that our focused strategy will allow us to continue to outperform. Given our market outlook, we made significant changes to the fundamental cost structure of the business, which we believe will help protect margins in the near term and drive outsized incrementals going forward. 
This market has generated a sense of urgency in many of our customers, and we are having better conversations with them around improving their cost per barrel economics. And ultimately, we believe that when this market recovers, it will be North America that responds the fastest, offering the greatest upside and that Halliburton will be positioned to outperform.
Now let's open it up for questions."

In North America, we've been carrying around 300 basis points of added cost, which we started to dismantle in Q1. Now that process is going to continue through the end of the year, and we expect to eliminate around 100 basis points per quarter. Now that's just in North America. We're also looking at doing the same in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America as well as in all of our product service lines and corporate structure. So we're scrutinizing every cost from manufacturing to supply logistics to field operations, and we're doing this on a global basis. So overall, we'll be reducing our structural cost by about 25%. Or maybe said another way, we'll lower our annual run rate on cost by around $1 billion by the end of the year but with little of that happening in Q1. So these structural reductions are on top of volume-related cuts as we continue to adjust our operations for the market. Now the structural changes, by definition, are stickier. And now -- all this doesn't income without the cost. But looking ahead, we are thoughtfully looking at how we work, what makes us more effective in the way that we go to market as we make these reductions. And in many ways, we're more effective now than we were before, at least certainly in terms of safety and service quality. So for those reasons, the changes we're making, in my view, do not impact our ability to scale in the recovery and at the same time positioning Halliburton to outperform through the cycle."

I guess, before we talked about what we're going to look like going forward, I think it's really important that we really review where we are today. First and foremost, we are an integrated global oil services company. And I think in order to make that claim you have to have a broad portfolio for every service, for every customer in every market. And if you are an integrated company, you essentially can't pick and choose where you provide, who you provide it to, where you operate and what customers you work for. If you look at our individual product lines, our current portfolio is actually pretty good. We're in the #1 market position in fracturing in and completions. Our drillbit is #1 in North America. wireline and Landmark are all in strong #2 positions, and you referenced the ones that we need some help in. And certainly, the Baker Hughes transaction would have helped in Artificial Lift in production chemicals. And those areas, clearly, we're not in any sort of market-leading position, and I said that in my prepared remarks. But we have an ability to grow product lines. I think, a great example of that is our Testing business where just over the last several years, we've gone from essentially a start-up to almost the #2 in the market position. And with the contracts that we've won, we believe we'll very soon get into a #2 position there. So I like where we are. We certainly have the ability. As I said in my remarks, we're going to invest in those product lines where we're a little bit weak, and we'll look at selective acquisitions to round them out. I think as far as what comes next, I mean from a shareholder's standpoint, I want to reiterate we are continuing to be dead focused on our gross margin returns and lead the industry of those areas, get the $1 billion out of the business that Jeff just referenced and then take advantage of the North America rebound when it comes. So yes, we are disappointed, but we've got a good portfolio. We're going to continue to execute our strategy, and we're going to be fine."

And I think, given the nature of these companies and they are independents, they're very confident in their own skill set, they're confident in the acreage they have, and I think that when they believe that the time is right to start drilling, they'll do it. And generally, I think what we've seen is they'll be able to get the money to do that, either through commodity prices or going back into the equity markets or the debt markets.

And as we look forward here, the one thing I like to get an update on is your utilization sounds very high on your frac equipment, especially the Q10 pumps, just given what you're experiencing in your completion revenue in U.S. sources versus what peers are reporting. So in order for you to continue to outperform as the rig count increases, is that going to need to come from price increases? Or did you expect to get further market share gains? And on the further market share gains, is that going to require potentially unstacking some of the equipment that you recently impaired?"

It's one we talk about a lot internally. I think you have to go back to the basic strategy that we follow in North America and that is to be in every basin, to be with the right customers in those basins and have the right relationships with those customers. So there's a number of ways to outperform the rig count when it comes back. And obviously, I won't give a detailed road map as to how you do that. But certainly, by being and having the right customers as your bread and butter from a revenue stream, they generally are the ones that are more financially secure. They have the better acreage, and they're in the best position. They're likely the ones to put the earliest rigs out and, therefore, it's a natural extension of your market share by you take a customer that we have a great relationship, it might be running 5 rigs today, when they go to 8 rigs, you automatically get that work. So that's one way. Second is the efficiency of our equipment. I mean, when things bounce back in a well, lowest cost per BOE and efficiency is still going to be very, very important. And having the Q10, having our Frac of the Future, having our footprint, having our logistical system and all of those things in place because we are -- have not and will not have dismantle any of that is part of the exercise Jeff talked about will still allow us to be the low-cost provider in market that's expanding. I think another reason that we have worked hard to keep our utilization up is I don't care what people say, it is going to be larger to crew frac spreads. It's going to be harder to crew equipment and those sorts of things when this turns back. And so by keeping and preserving as much of our workforce and as much of our equipment being active, we can basically leverage that workforce more quickly across an expanding rig count. So I mean, I like where we are. It hasn't come without obviously a cost. We work hard with our customers to make sure that they're there in a position to keep rigs in the air. That's not, as I said, come without a cost in our margins, but I think it's a good trade-off because when this thing snaps back, it's going to snap back hard, and I really like the position we're going to be in at that point in time."

If you look at our release it to put out a week ago, clearly, the whole industry is overcapitalized at this point in time, and it's overcapitalized with some really good equipment. And so I think that as it flexes back and the rig count comes up, customers start to spend more money, the need to spend on capital, if in fact you are maintaining your equipment, maintaining your tools, which is what we're doing, we are not cold stacking stuff and letting it deteriorate, it's really just going to be an issue of getting the people to man that equipment as it comes back.

That is actually too much, given where we are in the cycle and the fact that it cost us about $1 billion to sort of run the company. So we actually have that problem sitting in front of us right now, great problem to have, and we'll spend start of the balance of the second quarter here sort of watching the market.

Our prepared remarks today will be brief, leaving more time for the question-and-answer period. We would like to start by providing some background on our mutual decision with Baker Hughes to terminate our merger agreement.
From the time we announced the deal in November 2014, we knew that putting together 2 companies with the global size and scale of Halliburton and Baker would be no small task, but we believed that we could close the deal and do so in a timely manner because it truly made sense. We expect that the deal would create compelling benefits for the stockholders, customers and other stakeholders of each company. The potential annual cost synergies were substantial, and the transaction was expected to be accretive to cash flow and earnings within only a couple of years. In addition, the transaction would have allowed us to further reduce our customers' cost per barrel of oil equivalent. This was truly a great deal, one that was unanimously approved by each company's Board of Directors and overwhelmingly approved by each company's shareholders.
Unfortunately, things have changed quite a bit since we signed the merger agreement. From a regulatory perspective, we completely understood that the transaction would draw regulatory scrutiny and that substantial divestitures would be required to obtain regulatory approval. However, obtaining U.S. antitrust approval of large complex business combinations, regardless of the industry, has become increasingly time intensive and difficult as evidenced by the termination and litigation of several other large proposed transactions over the last 16 months.
We continue to believe the proposed Baker Hughes transaction would have been co-competitive, that our proposed divestitures were more than sufficient to address any regulatory concerns and that the position taken in the U.S. Department of Justice's lawsuit and the European Commission's statement of the objections are incorrect. We also continue to believe that the transaction would be good for the industry and customers, particularly now at a time when customers are focused on lowering cost per barrel of oil equivalent. However, the DOJ's lawsuit and EC's statement of objections, combined with the elongated review process in all jurisdictions, created substantial hurdles with respect to timing and deal certainty. We would also like to correct a misimpression about the proposed divestiture package that may have resulted from the statements made during the DOJ's April press conference regarding the lawsuit. We proposed to the DOJ a divestiture package worth billions of dollars that we believe would facilitate the entry of new competition in markets in which products and services are being divested, and we had buyers expressing a strong desire to acquire those businesses. The proposed divestitures were, for the most part, divestitures of complete worldwide product lines, including employees, management teams, business development personnel, manufacturing, R&D facilities, intellectual property portfolios and customer contracts. They addressed most of the markets alleged in the DOJ complaint. We believe that the proposed divestiture package was sufficient to address the DOJ-specific competitive concerns.
In addition to regulatory matters, the unprecedented deterioration of the oil and gas industry decimated the economics of the deal. During the pendency of the deal, the WTI price of oil has gone from over $76 in November of 2014 to a low of just over $26 in February of this year, while the global rig count has gone to a 17-year low, and you all know what's happened in North America, where each week we seemed to hit new historical lows. As a consequence, the aggregate quarterly revenues of Baker Hughes have decreased nearly 60% from $6.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014 to $2.7 billion for the first quarter of this year. 
Given the abrupt and deep downturn in the oil services market, we were unable to obtain adequate value for the businesses we proposed to divest. This, coupled with the decline in each company's business, eroded the expected synergies and accretive aspects of the transaction, including the time line to integrate the businesses to levels which we believe severely undermined the originally anticipated synergy benefits of the deal. As a result, it became clear that continuing to pursue the transaction was no longer in the best interest of our stockholders, despite having to pay the termination fee to Baker Hughes. Moving forward with the transaction did not make sense in light of the elongated regulatory scrutiny, the projected time lines for closing the transaction, the poor deal economics and the current market environment.
Now to be clear, we recommended this transaction to our board and to our shareholders for approval. We believe trying to do this transaction was worth the risk because of our strong belief in our strategy, process, employees and management team, but it wasn't to be. There is no doubt we are disappointed, and I want to thank both our employees as well as the employees of Baker Hughes for their tireless efforts throughout the regulatory process. But you know what? We are Halliburton and we will continue to provide the same innovative services and products that we've delivered to our customers for more than 97 years. We have a world-class management team who has industry knowledge and experience to drive value for our shareholders. 
Prior to the potential transactions, we were in a strong #2 position in the market, with a proven successful strategy of gaining market share through outperforming against the rig count and having among the highest margins and returns in the industry. We were successful in executing that strategy and knew our process was scalable to a larger company. That fact has not changed. If we had been successful, adding the Baker Hughes assets would have given us that scale quickly. But our strategy has not changed. We still expect to outperform the rig count. We plan to scale up our product service line capability by addressing one product line building block at a time through internal growth, investment and selective acquisitions. Going forward, we will strive to deliver the same predictable, reliable execution and industry-leading growth, margins and returns from our world-class employees and management team. 
Over the past 18 months, despite our intensive efforts to close the Baker Hughes transaction, we have been executing on our key strategic areas and adapting to the new reality that we face in a very difficult market. Compared to where we were 1.5 years ago, we have outperformed our peers both in North America and internationally. 
In the first quarter, we addressed some of our excess infrastructure cost that we were carrying pending the Baker Hughes transaction. We will now move aggressively to remove the remainder of those costs from our operations over the next couple of quarters. I am very proud of the outstanding operational and customer focus our employees have kept during this entire process. Their dedication, resiliency and hard work are the foundation of our company strength and why together we can and will weather any challenges that we face.
Now let me turn the call over to Christian to provide some financial details."

Let me start with a summary of our first quarter results. Total company revenue came in at $4.2 billion, which represents a 17% sequential decline compared to worldwide rig count decline of 21%. We experienced wea",951,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a summary of our first quarter results. Total company revenue came in at $4.2 billion, which represents a 17% sequential decline compared to worldwide rig count decline of 21%. We experienced weakening activity levels and pricing concessions during the quarter, along with seasonal weather disruptions in the North Sea and Russia. At this point, our overall decremental margins have been less than that of the previous cycle despite this downturn being deeper and longer. We have provided financial comparisons of our first quarter results to the fourth quarter of 2015 in our April 22 press release, and we would like to refer you to our commentary in that release. 
Due to our ongoing restructuring efforts, we revised our financial reporting presentation to only furnish overall regional results and global division results, and we will no longer provide divisional results by region. For Completion and Production and Drilling and Evaluation segments, we will only provide total global results for each segment going forward.
In the first quarter, we recognized a restructuring charge of $2.1 billion after tax to further adjust our cost structure to market conditions. This charge consisted primarily of asset impairments, including most of our non-Q10 pressure pumping equipment as well as severance costs. As Dave mentioned, in the coming quarters, we will continue to make further structural adjustments, including the remaining escalated cost structure we've kept in North America.
Further, in accordance with accounting rules, we no longer classified our assets included in the proposed divestitures as assets held for sale at the end of the first quarter. As a result, in the first quarter, we incurred an asset tax charge to recognize the depreciation related to these assets that had been suspended since April of 2015. Beginning in the second quarter, our operational results will include the depreciation expense from these assets.
Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $46 million for the first quarter, excluding cost related to the Baker Hughes transaction. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the second quarter will be approximately $50 million to $55 million, excluding acquisition-related costs we incurred in April, and this will be the new quarterly run rate for the rest of 2016. 
Our first quarter free cash flow was negative $355 million, driven by about $250 million of restructuring payments and acquisition-related costs. We continue to commit to living within our cash flows for the year and given the ongoing decline in activity levels, we have further reduced our capital expenditures plans for 2016 to approximately $850 million. We've been disciplined in the deployment of capital equipment during this downturn and expect to reduce our CapEx spend by approximately 75% compared to 2014.
Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $346 million. For the second quarter, we expect depreciation and amortization to be about $400 million as a result of recommencing the depreciation for the assets that were previously classified as held for sale, the impact of our multi-year reduction of capital expenditures and the impairments we have taken. 
In conjunction with the termination of the Baker Hughes transaction, $2.5 billion of debt that we issued in late 2015 will be mandatorily redeemed. At the end of the first quarter, we had $9.6 billion of cash and equivalents available. Taking into account the debt redemption plus the $3.5 billion termination fee, we would still have had approximately $3.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We also have $3 billion available under our revolving credit facility, which with our cash balance provides us with ample liquidity of $6.6 billion to address the challenges and opportunities of the current market. For modeling purposes, starting in the second quarter, we will begin reflecting the incremental interest expense on the debt, taking into account the redemption of the $2.5 billion. As such, our estimated net interest expense for the second quarter will be approximately $165 million, and the quarterly run rate interest expense for the second half of 2016 will be approximately $155 million. 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23%. Our income tax expense for the second quarter will be impacted by several factors, including recognition of the incremental interest and higher depreciation, the statutory rates for the various geographies where we expect to generate income or losses and any discrete tax items. These factors will lead to a high degree of variability on our effective tax rate. Based upon our current forecast and expected earnings mix, we anticipate that we will recognize approximately $10 million to $15 million of tax expense in the second quarter.
Turning to our operational outlook. The market dynamics continue to make forecasting a challenge, but let me provide you with our current thoughts on how we see the second quarter shaping up. The following regional guidance comments reflect the higher depreciation expense. 
In the Eastern Hemisphere, we anticipate second quarter revenues to come in at similar levels as the first quarter, but with margins lower by 300 to 400 basis points due to the impact of ongoing and expected pricing concessions and additional depreciation. In Latin America, we expect an upper single-digit decline in revenues, with margins declining by approximately 200 to 300 basis points from the first quarter levels.
In North America, the U.S. land rig count is already down 23% compared to the first quarter average and has continued to deteriorate week after week. As is typical, we expect our sequential revenue decline to outperform the rig count by several hundred basis points and anticipate that our decremental margins will be approximately 25% in the second quarter.

Before anything else, I'd like to thank each of our employees for their focus on execution in spite of the distractions presented by both the marketplace and current events. We are the execution company. 
As we have announced, we're sizing our cost structure to the market conditions we're experiencing. I remain confident that when the market activity stabilizes, margins can start on the road to recovery. We've had a dedicated team focused on the Baker transaction, which freed the rest of us from distraction and gave us the ability to aggressively pursue our corporate strategy. We've prepared the franchise to deliver industry-leading growth and returns when we exit this down cycle. Halliburton is the execution company and led our peer group in returns throughout this most recent cycle. Our strategy remains focused on what our customers value most highly: maximizing production at the lowest cost per BOE. 
Now clearly, this is a dynamic formula depending on where we are in the cycle. Today, there's no doubt that the numerator, meaning cost, has most of our customers' attention. Cost is something we can control, and we do it well at Halliburton, and I'm pleased with our progress. We've consistently delivered this strategy through 2 components: first, converting customer insight into cost-effective solutions; and second, by providing reliable service quality. Our capabilities and our execution culture are built around systematically collecting insight from our customers on their operational challenges, and collaborating with them and within Halliburton to design the programs and technology to solve their economic and technical challenges. 
For example, during the first quarter, we delivered production-maximizing gravel pack chemistry for a major deepwater customer. However, instead of executing from a costly stimulation vessel, we were able to deliver the job from a substantially lower cost supply vessel by employing modular pumping equipment. The second component, executing reliably on our solutions, is something Halliburton does well, and our customers appreciate. Our concentration on executing key processes has realized a multi-year double-digit service quality improvement, a demonstration of our clear focus on the lowest cost per BOE in action. And finally, closing the loop on our performance is where I focus my attention every day. This is execution, meaning getting things done. Are we delivering what we promised to our customers? And how do we tighten our unique fit around collaboration, technology and service quality while systematically reducing our cost and capital requirements to deliver the growth and returns we expect? This is an ongoing effort. And recent example of this is our North American restructuring where we removed a layer of management. And this has changed our cost profile certainly but also simplified and improved our internal collaboration and execution. Commodity prices and markets will move up and down, but the one thing about which I am certain, one thing that won't change over time is that the lowest cost per BOE wins. We believe our collaborative approach to converting client insight into cost-effective solutions and our focus on reliable execution will consistently deliver the lowest cost per BOE and allow our customers to make better wells and be more successful over time.
We continue to believe that the longer it takes for the recovery to occur, the sharper the recovery will be, and that North America represents the greatest upside and that Halliburton is positioned to outperform. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Dave for closing comments. Dave?"

Let me sum things up. We are disappointed in the outcome of the Baker Hughes transaction, but we are not going to do a deal that is not economic for our shareholders, and we are confident that our focused strategy will allow us to continue to outperform. Given our market outlook, we made significant changes to the fundamental cost structure of the business, which we believe will help protect margins in the near term and drive outsized incrementals going forward. 
This market has generated a sense of urgency in many of our customers, and we are having better conversations with them around improving their cost per barrel economics. And ultimately, we believe that when this market recovers, it will be North America that responds the fastest, offering the greatest upside, and that Halliburton will be positioned to outperform.

In North America, we've been carrying around 300 basis points of added cost, which we started to dismantle in Q1. Now that process is going to continue through the end of the year, and we expect to eliminate about 100 basis points per quarter. Now that's just in North America. So we're also looking at doing the same in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America as well as in all of our product service lines and corporate structure. So we're scrutinizing every cost from manufacturing to supply logistics to field operations, and we're doing this on a global basis. So overall, we'll be reducing our structural cost by about 25%. Or maybe said another way, we'll lower our annual run rate on cost by around $1 billion by the end of the year, but with little of that happening in Q1. So these structural reductions are on top of volume-related cuts as we continue to adjust our operations for the market. Now the structural changes, by definition, are stickier. And now -- all this doesn't come without a cost. But looking ahead, we are thoughtfully looking at how we work, what makes us more effective in the way that we go to market as we make these reductions. And in many ways, we're more effective now than we were before, or at least certainly in terms of safety and service quality. So for those reasons, the changes we're making, in my view, do not impact our ability to scale in a recovery, and at the same time positioning Halliburton to outperform through the cycle."

If you look at our individual product lines, our current portfolio is actually pretty good. We're in the #1 market position in fracturing, in cementing and completions. Our Drill Bits is #1 in North America. Sperry, wireline, Baroid and Landmark are all in strong #2 positions. And you referenced the ones that we need some help in. And certainly, the Baker Hughes transaction would have helped in Artificial Lift and production chemicals. And those areas, clearly, we're not in any sort of a market-leading position, and I said that in my prepared remarks. But we have an ability to grow product lines. I think, a great example of that is our Testing business, where just over the last several years, we've gone from essentially a start-up to almost the #2 in the market position. And with the contracts that we've won, we believe we'll very soon get into a #2 position there. So I like where we are. We certainly have the ability. As I said in my remarks, we are going to invest in those product lines where we're a little bit weak, and we'll look at selective acquisitions to round them out. I think as far as what comes next, I mean from a shareholder's standpoint, I want to reiterate we are continuing to be dead focused on our growth, margin and returns and leading the industry in those areas, get the $1 billion out of the business that Jeff just referenced, and then take advantage of the North America rebound when it comes.

And generally, I think what we've seen is they'll be able to get the money to do that, either through commodity prices or through going back into the equity markets or the debt markets. So yes, they're feeling better, and I think they're trying to survive to 2017 and then get on with things."

The question I would have for you, Dave, is we'll go to the bread-and-butter of the U.S. on the frac side. There's a lot of discussion on the attrition side. And so, therefore, wanted to hear your thoughts, or Jeff, on how much attrition do you think is merely replacing capital goods versus true attrition of equipment that could not come back and how much -- how old you think equipment needs to be before you see it as no longer committed or the customers see it as no longer actually competitive, and how much of equipment out there is that."

We hear companies talking publicly even about cannibalizing equipment that is stacked, and that's equipment that really doesn't go back to work. It gets rained on, it sits there, it's more and more difficult to bring back. So I think that is continuing all of the time. From our -- actually interestingly enough though, the volumes pump, which probably has more impact on equipment, continued to increase. So we saw a 17% increase in sand volume on a per well basis, which says that the equipment has to work harder than it ever has. And so for that reason, we are really happy with our Frac of the Future configuration and the Q10 pumps just because they handle it so well. So again, I think the equipment is out of the market. Much of that equipment is probably out to stay."

It's one we talk about a lot internally. I think you have to go back to the basic strategy that we follow in North America, and that is to be in every basin, to be with the right customers in those basins",439,"Yes, I think, Dan, it's actually a good question. It's one we talk about a lot internally. I think you have to go back to the basic strategy that we follow in North America, and that is to be in every basin, to be with the right customers in those basins and have the right relationships with those customers. So there's a number of ways to outperform the rig count when it comes back. And obviously, I won't give a detailed road map as to how you do that. But certainly, by being and having the right customers as your bread and butter from a revenue stream, they generally are the ones that are more financially secure. They have the better acreage, and they're in the best position. They're likely the ones to put the earliest rigs up. And therefore, it's a natural extension of your market share by you take a customer that we have a great relationship, it might be running 5 rigs today. When they go to 8 rigs, you automatically get that work. So that's one way. Second is the efficiency of our equipment. I mean, when things bounce back, and it will, lowest cost per BOE and efficiency is still going to be very, very important. And having the Q10, having our Frac of the Future, having our footprint, having our logistical system and all of those things in place because we are -- we have not and will not dismantle any of that, as part of the exercise Jeff talked about, will still allow us to be the low-cost provider in a market that's expanding. I think another reason that we have worked hard to keep our utilization up is it is -- I don't care what people say, it is going to be harder to crew frac spreads. It's going to be harder to crew cementing equipment and those sorts of things when this thing turns back. And so by keeping and preserving as much of our workforce and as much of our equipment being active, we can basically leverage that workforce more quickly across an expanding rig count. So I mean, I like where we are. It hasn't come without obviously a cost. We work hard with our customers to make sure that they're there in a position to keep rigs in the air. That's not, as I said, come without a cost on our margins, but I think it's a good trade-off because when this thing snaps back, it's going to snap back hard, and I really like the position we're going to be in at that point in time."

If you look at our release that we put out a week ago, I mean, clearly, the whole industry is overcapitalized at this point in time, and it's overcapitalized with some really good equipment. And so I think that as it flexes back and the rig count comes up, customers start to spend more money. The need to spend on capital, if in fact you are maintaining your equipment, maintaining your tools, which is what we are doing, we're not sort of cold-stacking stuff and letting it deteriorate, it's really just going to be an issue of getting the people to man that equipment as it comes back.

So I can just sort of respond to what we see in the marketplace. I think that pressure pumping, in my view, to be successful at it in the U.S., you have to have a U.S.-wide business because so much of the advantage you get in that business is through scope and scale. It's being the biggest procurer of sand. It's having the infrastructure. It's having the railcars. It's having the transload centers. It's having the ability to spend on technology, on chemistry, on footprint, on downhaul capabilities. And I think pulling back into a limited number of basins just doesn't allow you to have that scope and scale. So that -- our strategy has always been one that you have to be -- if you're committed to being an integrated services company, you have to take the benefit and the downside of that. And in a market like this, there is some downside because you are operating in some markets. You are operating in some product lines that maybe are not giving you the kinds of returns that you want. But at the end of the day, when it does bounce back, and you're making, hey, from a margin standpoint, it's way better to be essentially in every basin with every product lines.

Our prepared remarks today will be brief, leaving more time for the question-and-answer period. We would like to start by providing some background on our mutual decision with Baker Hughes to terminate our merger agreement.
From the time we announced the deal in November 2014, we knew that putting together 2 companies with the global size and scale of Halliburton and Baker would be no small task, but we believed that we could close the deal and do so in a timely manner because it truly made sense. We expected the deal would create compelling benefits for the stockholders, customers and other stakeholders of each company. The potential annual cost synergies were substantial, and the transaction was expected to be accretive to cash flow and earnings within only a couple of years. In addition, the transaction would have allowed us to further reduce our customers' cost per barrel of oil equivalent. This was truly a great deal, one that was unanimously approved by each company's Board of Directors and overwhelmingly approved by each company's shareholders.
Unfortunately, things have changed quite a bit since we signed the merger agreement. From a regulatory perspective, we completely understood that the transaction would draw regulatory scrutiny and that substantial divestitures would be required to obtain regulatory approval. However, obtaining U.S. antitrust approval of large complex business combinations, regardless of the industry, has become increasingly time intensive and difficult as evidenced by the termination and litigation of several other large proposed transactions over the last 16 months.
We continue to believe the proposed Baker Hughes transaction would have been pro competitive, that our proposed divestitures were more than sufficient to address any regulatory concerns and that the position taken in the U.S. Department of Justice's lawsuit and the European Commission's statement of objections are incorrect. We also continue to believe that the transaction would be good for the industry and customers, particularly now, at a time when customers are focused on lowering cost per barrel of oil equivalent. However, DOJ's lawsuit and EC's statement of objections, combined with the elongated review process in all jurisdictions, created substantial hurdles with respect to timing and deal certainty. We would also like to correct a misimpression about the proposed divestiture package that may have resulted from the statements made during the DOJ's April press conference regarding the lawsuit. We proposed to the DOJ a divestiture package worth billions of dollars that we believe would facilitate the entry of new competition in markets in which products and services are being divested, and we had buyers expressing a strong desire to acquire those businesses. The proposed divestitures were, for the most part, divestitures of complete worldwide product lines including employees, management teams, business development personnel, manufacturing, R&D facilities, intellectual property portfolios and customer contracts. They addressed most of the markets alleged in the DOJ complaint. We believe that the proposed divestiture package was sufficient to address the DOJ's specific competitive concerns.
In addition to regulatory matters, the unprecedented deterioration of the oil and gas industry decimated the economics of the deal. During the pendency of the deal, the WTI price of oil has gone from over $76 in November of 2014 to a low of just over $26 in February of this year, while the global rig count has gone to a 17-year low. And you all know what's happened in North America, where each week we seem to hit new historical lows. As a consequence, the aggregate quarterly revenues of Baker Hughes have decreased nearly 60% from $6.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2014 to $2.7 billion for the first quarter of this year. 
Given the abrupt and deep downturn in the oil services market, we were unable to obtain adequate value for the businesses we proposed to divest. This, coupled with the decline in each company's business eroded the expected synergies and accretive aspects of the transaction, including the time line to integrate the businesses, to levels which we believe severely undermined the originally anticipated synergy benefits of the deal. As a result, it became clear that continuing to pursue the transaction was no longer in the best interest of our stockholders, despite having to pay the termination fee to Baker Hughes. Moving forward with the transaction did not make sense in light of the elongated regulatory scrutiny, the projected time lines for closing the transaction, the poor deal economics and the current market environment.
Now to be clear, we recommended this transaction to our board and to our shareholders for approval. We believe trying to do this transaction was worth the risk because of our strong belief in our strategy, process, employees and management team, but it wasn't to be. There is no doubt we are disappointed, and I want to thank both our employees as well as the employees of Baker Hughes for their tireless efforts throughout the regulatory process. But you know what? We are Halliburton and we will continue to provide the same innovative services and products that we've delivered to our customers for more than 97 years. We have a world-class management team who has industry knowledge and experience to drive value for our shareholders. 
Prior to the potential transactions, we were in a strong #2 position in the market, with a proven successful strategy of gaining market share through outperforming against the rig count and having among the highest margins and returns in the industry. We were successful in executing that strategy and knew our process was scalable to a larger company. That fact has not changed. If we had been successful, adding the Baker Hughes assets would have given us that scale quickly. But our strategy has not changed. We still expect to outperform the rig count. We plan to scale up our product service line capability by addressing one product-line building block at a time through internal growth, investment and selective acquisitions. Going forward, we will strive to deliver the same predictable, reliable execution and industry-leading growth, margins and returns from our world-class employees and management team. 
Over the past 18 months, despite our intensive efforts to close the Baker Hughes transaction, we have been executing on our key strategic areas and adapting to the new reality that we face in a very difficult market. Compared to where we were 1.5 years ago, we have outperformed our peers both in North America and internationally. 
In the first quarter, we addressed some of our excess infrastructure costs that we were carrying pending the Baker Hughes transaction. We will now move aggressively to remove the remainder of those costs from our operations over the next couple of quarters. I am very proud of the outstanding operational and customer focus our employees have kept during this entire process. Their dedication, resiliency and hard work are the foundation of our company's strength and why, together, we can and will weather any challenges that we face.
Now let me turn the call over to Christian to provide some financial details."

Let me start with a summary of our first quarter results. Total company revenue came in at $4.2 billion, which represents a 17% sequential decline compared to worldwide rig count decline of 21%. We experienced wea",951,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a summary of our first quarter results. Total company revenue came in at $4.2 billion, which represents a 17% sequential decline compared to worldwide rig count decline of 21%. We experienced weakening activity levels and pricing concessions during the quarter, along with seasonal weather disruptions in the North Sea and Russia. At this point, our overall decremental margins have been less than that of the previous cycle despite this downturn being deeper and longer. We have provided financial comparisons of our first quarter results to the fourth quarter of 2015 in our April 22 press release, and we would like to refer you to our commentary in that release. 
Due to our ongoing restructuring efforts, we've revised our financial reporting presentation to only furnish overall regional results and global division results, and we will no longer provide divisional results by region. For our Completion and Production and Drilling and Evaluation segments, we will only provide total global results for each segment going forward.
In the first quarter, we recognized a restructuring charge of $2.1 billion after tax to further adjust our cost structure to market conditions. This charge consisted primarily of asset impairments, including most of our non-Q10 pressure pumping equipment as well as severance costs. As Dave mentioned, in the coming quarters, we will continue to make further structural adjustments, including the remaining escalated cost structure we've kept in North America.
Further, in accordance with accounting rules, we no longer classified our assets included in the proposed divestitures as assets held for sale at the end of the first quarter. As a result, in the first quarter, we incurred an asset tax charge to recognize the depreciation related to these assets that had been suspended since April of 2015. Beginning in the second quarter, our operational results will include the depreciation expense from these assets.
Our Corporate and Other expense totaled $46 million for the first quarter, excluding costs related to the Baker Hughes transaction. We anticipate that our corporate expenses for the second quarter will be approximately $50 million to $55 million, excluding acquisition-related costs we incurred in April, and this will be the new quarterly run rate for the rest of 2016. 
Our first quarter free cash flow was negative $355 million, driven by about $250 million of restructuring payments and acquisition-related costs. We continue to commit to living within our cash flows for the year, and given the ongoing decline in activity levels we have further reduced our capital expenditures plans for 2016 to approximately $850 million. We've been disciplined in the deployment of capital equipment during this downturn and expect to reduce our CapEx spend by approximately 75% compared to 2014.
Depreciation and amortization for the first quarter was $346 million. For the second quarter, we expect depreciation and amortization to be about $400 million as a result of recommencing the depreciation for the assets that were previously classified as held for sale, the impact of our multi-year reduction of capital expenditures and the impairments we have taken. 
In conjunction with the termination of the Baker Hughes transaction, $2.5 billion of debt that we issued in late 2015 will be mandatorily redeemed. At the end of the first quarter, we had $9.6 billion cash and equivalents available. Taking into account the debt redemption plus the $3.5 billion termination fee, we would still have had approximately $3.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. We also have $3 billion available under our revolving credit facility, which with our cash balance provides us with ample liquidity of $6.6 billion to address the challenges and opportunities of the current market. For modeling purposes, starting in the second quarter, we will begin reflecting the incremental interest expense on the debt, taking into account the redemption of the $2.5 billion. As such, our estimated net interest expense for the second quarter will be approximately $165 million, and the quarterly run rate interest expense for the second half of 2016 will be approximately $155 million. 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 23%. Our income tax expense for the second quarter will be impacted by several factors, including recognition of the incremental interest and higher depreciation, the statutory rates for the various geographies where we expect to generate income or losses and any discrete tax items. These factors will lead to a high degree of variability on our effective tax rate. Based upon our current forecast and expected earnings mix, we anticipate that we will recognize approximately $10 million to $15 million of tax expense in the second quarter.
Turning to our operational outlook. The market dynamics continue to make forecasting a challenge, but let me provide you with our current thoughts on how we see the second quarter shaping up. The following regional guidance comments reflect the higher depreciation expense. 
In the Eastern Hemisphere, we anticipate second quarter revenues to come in at similar levels as the first quarter, but with margins lower by 300 to 400 basis points due to the impact of ongoing and expected pricing concessions and additional depreciation. In Latin America, we expect an upper single-digit decline in revenues, with margins declining by approximately 200 to 300 basis points from the first quarter levels.
In North America, the U.S. land rig count is already down 23% compared to the first quarter average and has continued to deteriorate week after week. As is typical, we expect our sequential revenue decline to outperform the rig count by several hundred basis points and anticipate that our decremental margins will be approximately 25% in the second quarter.

We've had a dedicated team focused on the Baker transaction, which freed the rest of us from distraction and gave us the ability to aggressively pursue our corporate strategy. We've prepared the franchise to deliver industry-leading growth and returns when we exit this down cycle. Halliburton is the execution company and led our peer group in returns throughout this most recent cycle. Our strategy remains focused on what our customers value most highly: maximizing production at the lowest cost per BOE. 
Now clearly, this is a dynamic formula depending on where we are in the cycle. Today, there's no doubt that the numerator, meaning cost, has most of our customers' attention. Cost is something we can control, and we do it well at Halliburton, and I'm pleased with our progress. We've consistently delivered this strategy through 2 components: first, converting customer insight into cost-effective solutions; and second, by providing reliable service quality. Our capabilities and our execution culture are built around systematically collecting insight from our customers on their operational challenges, and collaborating with them and within Halliburton to design the programs and technology to solve their economic and technical challenges. 
For example, during the first quarter, we delivered production-maximizing gravel pack chemistry for a major deepwater customer. However, instead of executing from a costly stimulation vessel, we were able to deliver the job from a substantially lower cost supply vessel by employing modular pumping equipment. The second component, executing reliably on our solutions, is something Halliburton does well, and our customers appreciate. Our concentration on executing key processes has realized a multi-year double-digit service quality improvement, a demonstration of our clear focus on the lowest cost per BOE in action. And finally, closing the loop on our performance is where I focus my attention every day. This is execution, meaning getting things done. Are we delivering what we promised to our customers? And how do we tighten our unique fit around collaboration, technology and service quality while systematically reducing our cost and capital requirements to deliver the growth and returns we expect? This is an ongoing effort. A recent example of this is our North American restructuring where we removed a layer of management. Now this has changed our cost profile, certainly, but also simplified and improved our internal collaboration and execution. Commodity prices and markets will move up and down, but the one thing about which I am certain: one thing that won't change over time is that the lowest cost per BOE wins. We believe our collaborative approach to converting client insight into cost-effective solutions and our focus on reliable execution will consistently deliver the lowest cost per BOE and allow our customers to make better wells and be more successful over time.
We continue to believe that the longer it takes for the recovery to occur, the sharper the recovery will be, and that North America represents the greatest upside and that Halliburton is positioned to outperform. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Dave for closing comments. Dave?"

Let me sum things up. We are disappointed in the outcome of the Baker Hughes transaction, but we are not going to do a deal that is not economic for our shareholders, and we are confident that our focused strategy will allow us to continue to outperform. Given our market outlook, we made significant changes to the fundamental cost structure of the business, which we believe will help protect margins in the near term and drive outsized incrementals going forward. 
This market has generated a sense of urgency in many of our customers, and we are having better conversations with them around improving their cost-per-barrel economics. And ultimately, we believe that when this market recovers, it will be North America that responds the fastest, offering the greatest upside, and that Halliburton will be positioned to outperform.
Now let's open it up for questions."

In North America, we've been carrying around 300 basis points of added cost, which we started to dismantle in Q1. Now that process is going to continue through the end of the year, and we expect to eliminate about 100 basis points per quarter. Now that's just in North America. So we're also looking at doing the same in the Eastern Hemisphere and Latin America as well as in all of our product service lines and corporate structure. So we're scrutinizing every cost from manufacturing to supply logistics to field operations, and we're doing this on a global basis. So overall, we'll be reducing our structural cost by about 25%. Or maybe said another way, we'll lower our annual run rate on cost by around $1 billion by the end of the year, but with little of that happening in Q1. So these structural reductions are on top of volume-related cuts as we continue to adjust our operations for the market. Now the structural changes, by definition, are stickier. And now -- all this doesn't come without a cost. But looking ahead, we are thoughtfully looking at how we work, what makes us more effective in the way that we go to market as we make these reductions. And in many ways, we're more effective now than we were before, or at least certainly in terms of safety and service quality. So for those reasons, the changes we're making, in my view, do not impact our ability to scale in a recovery and at the same time positioning Halliburton to outperform through the cycle."

I guess, before we talk about what we're going to look like going forward, I think it's really important that we really review where we are today. And first and foremost, we're an integrated global oil services company. And I think in order to make that claim you have to have a broad portfolio, offer every service to every customer in every market. And if you are an integrated company you, essentially, can't pick and choose where you provide, who you provide it to, where you operate and what customers you work for. If you look at our individual product lines, our current portfolio is actually pretty good. We're in the #1 market position in fracturing, in cementing and completions. Our Drill Bits is #1 in North America. Sperry, wireline, Baroid and Landmark are all in strong #2 positions. And you referenced the ones that we need some help in. And certainly, the Baker Hughes transaction would have helped in Artificial Lift and production chemicals. And in those areas, clearly, we're not in any sort of a market-leading position, and I said that in my prepared remarks. But we have an ability to grow product lines. I think a great example of that is our Testing business, where just over the last several years we've gone from, essentially, a start-up to almost the #2 in the market position. And with the contracts that we've won, we believe we'll very soon get into a #2 position there. So I like where we are. We certainly have the ability. As I said in my remarks, we are going to invest in those product lines where we're a little bit weak, and we'll look at selective acquisitions to round them out. I think as far as then what comes next, I mean from a shareholder standpoint, I want to reiterate we are continuing to be dead focused on our growth, margin and returns and leading the industry in those areas, get the $1 billion out of the business that Jeff just referenced, and then take advantage of the North America rebound when it comes. So yes, we are disappointed, but we've got a good portfolio. We're going to continue to execute our strategy, and we're going to be fine."

They're confident in the acreage they have, and I think that when they believe that the time is right to start drilling, they'll do it.

From our -- actually interestingly enough though, the volumes pumped, which probably has more impact on equipment, continued to increase. So we saw a 17% increase in sand volume on a per well basis, which says that the equipment has to work harder than it ever has.

They have the better acreage, and they're in the best position. They're likely the ones to put the earliest rigs up. And therefore, it's a natural extension of your market share by -- you take a customer that we have a great relationship, it might be running 5 rigs today. When they go to 8 rigs, you automatically get that work. So that's one way. Second is the efficiency of our equipment. I mean, when things bounce back, and it will, lowest cost per BOE and efficiency is still going to be very, very important. And having the Q10, having our Frac of the Future, having our footprint, having our logistical system and all of those things in place because we are -- we have not and will not dismantle any of that, as part of the exercise Jeff talked about, will still allow us to be the low-cost provider in a market that's expanding. I think another reason that we have worked hard to keep our utilization up is it is -- I don't care what people say, it is going to be harder to crew frac spreads. It's going to be harder to crew cementing equipment and those sorts of things when this thing turns back. And so by keeping and preserving as much of our workforce and as much of our equipment being active we can, basically, leverage that workforce more quickly across an expanding rig count. So I mean, I like where we are. It hasn't come without, obviously, a cost. We've worked hard with our customers to make sure that they're in a position to keep rigs in the air. That's not, as I said, come without a cost on our margins, but I think it's a good trade-off because when this thing snaps back, it's going to snap back hard, and I really like the position we're going to be in at that point in time."

If you look at our release that we put out a week ago, I mean, clearly, the whole industry is overcapitalized at this point in time, and it's overcapitalized with some really good equipment. And so I think that as it flexes back and the rig count comes up, customers start to spend more money. The need to spend on capital, if in fact you are maintaining your equipment, maintaining your tools, which is what we are doing, we're not sort of cold-stacking stuff and letting it deteriorate, it's really just going to be an issue of getting the people to man that equipment as it comes back.

I think that pressure pumping, in my view, to be successful at it in the U.S., you have to have a U.S.-wide business because so much of the advantage you get in that business is through scope and scale. It's being the biggest procurer of sand. It's having the infrastructure. It's having the railcars. It's having the transload centers. It's having the ability to spend on technology, on chemistry, on footprint, on downhole capabilities. And I think pulling back into a limited number of basins just doesn't allow you to have that scope and scale. So that -- our strategy has always been one that you have to be -- if you're committed to being an integrated services company, you have to take the benefit and the downside of that. And in a market like this, there is some downside because you are operating in some markets. You are operating in some product lines that maybe are not giving you the kinds of returns that you want. But at the end of the day, when it does bounce back and you're making hay from a margin standpoint, it's way better to be, essentially, in every basin with every product line. So that's our strategy.

Our second quarter results showed great resilience in the face of a very challenging environment, which included declining rig activity and even more pricing headwinds. Our total company revenue declined only 9% sequentially compared to the 19% decline in the global rig count, and our North America revenue was down 15% from the prior quarter, significantly outperforming the 23% decline in the average U.S. rig count. However, despite these continuing headwinds, based on the recent improvements to North American activity, I believe that the second quarter will mark the trough for our earnings.
Now we are at a dynamic point in the cycle, and I'm not going to waste the limited time we have with you on the call this morning discussing things like the macroeconomics, the worldwide demand, the general economy or commodity prices. There are many public sources out there where you can get this data, including our customers, because that is the world that they live in every day.
What I want to talk about today is the world that we know best. Now conventional wisdom coming out of the first quarter was that the rig count would continue to drop. We said we saw in North America differently, and we're the first to call a bottom for the rig count. This is precisely what happened.
So let's talk about the reality of today's North America market. I can summarize this market in one sentence. Today, our customers are thinking about growing their business again rather than being focused on survival. There are 2 distinct factors that work in North America: psychological and economic, and I think it's critical to understand them both. Now you haven't heard me talk about the psychology of North American producers before, but given what has happened to many of our customers in the last 18 months, I think it's an important point to understand. I spend a large amount of time with customers late in the quarter taking their pulse, and I can tell you there is a growing survivor mentality out there, and you can't underestimate the positive change in attitude that we are seeing in our North American customers. There is a spring in their step that I didn't see earlier in the year and in almost every case, they are talking about adding rigs, buying assets or doing something value accretive. In short, they are getting back to business. And the psychological factors are getting better. Oil reaching $50 per barrel even for a brief time was a critical emotional milestone for our customers as was being able to buy a strip above [ph] $50 per barrel. But maybe it can be summed up best by one customer who told me, ""Dave, it's actually a light at the end of the tunnel and not an oncoming train."" So tomorrow an economic term, the animal spirits are back in North America. But also understanding the economic reality in North America is equally important. Pricing has helped cash flow but not enough. just rolling off have created cash flow uncertainty. Balance sheet repair is still critical, and many customers are looking at severe declines in production as many of them have drilled few wells in the last 18 months. And while there are many customers that have adequate liquidity, there is also a large segment evaluating how to access capital. This evaluation is around whether to do dilutive equity deals, accessing the high-yield markets, looking at reserved-based lending or partnering with private equity. But the important point is they are back in business. Now our North America customer management teams are great to work with. They are creative, adaptive and increasingly confident, and I believe they will find our solutions best tailored for their companies.
This is also smart group, and they see today's looming supply shortfall and know that U.S. unconventionals will likely be the first and deepest beneficiary of growing supply shortages, and you can be sure they want to reap some of that benefit.
So let's talk about how the cycle is starting to stack up and how this coming up cycle will play out. Now obviously the last 2 years has been a period of significant underinvestment where global CapEx has been reduced by nearly $400 billion. As a result, the industry will have to find a lot of new barrels in the next 5 years. Now you can choose your own energy supply expert, and there are many of them out there, but most agree we will need between 18 and 22 million barrels per day of new production by 2021, meaning we have to find nearly 2 Saudi Arabia's worth of production in the next 5 years.
To achieve this production goal, we believe there will need to be structural changes that have to happen. It clearly starts with a supportive commodity price, and we're not there yet today. But prices will have to get in there soon or the supply challenges will be even greater. Industry balance sheets will need to be repaired. The industry will need to replenish experience lost to retirement and cutbacks. We will have to find sustainable ways to deepen their relationships between operators and service companies, collaborating to integrate better, eliminate duplication and drive down delivery cost. And finally, producers will have to accept the reality of service company economics. Some of the efficiency gains we have made with our customers are in fact sustainable and will continue but others, including deep, uneconomic pricing cuts are unsustainable and will have to be reversed. In this environment, we are confident that North America will recover the fastest. The North America market has turned, and we expect to see a continued modest uptick in the U.S. rig count during the second half of the year and becoming more meaningful as we go into 2017. And now that we have seen the floor and activity levels, we expect revenue to increase based on higher utilization rates, and as we have said consistently, rig count stabilization is the first step on the road to margin repair, and Jeff will discuss that in a few minutes. Current service pricing in North America is unsustainable. We are in an environment where service providers are unable to meet their cost of capital and many are struggling to recover even their cash cost. Historically, as we reach the bottom, the downward momentum on pricing creates a headwind, and margin repair tends to lag activity recovery by a quarter or so. To break this typical cycle, we have made structural changes to our delivery platform, eliminating management layers and consolidating roles and locations. As a result of these savings, we are confident that North America margins can begin to recover in the third quarter. 
When this downturn started, we said that we were entering it from a position of strength in all of our markets. Since that time, we have executed our downturn playbook and have continuously outperformed the market both in North America as well as the Eastern Hemisphere, gaining market share in both.
So to summarize, the market has played out as we predicted them to, and our strategy is working. North America has turned and with our market share increase during the downturn, we believe we are the best positioned company. During the coming recovery, we plan to scale up our delivery platform by addressing our product line building blocks one at a time through a combination of organic growth and selective acquisitions. With that, let me turn the call over to Mark and Jeff to cover our financial and operational results. Mark?"

Let me start with a summary of our second quarter results compared to our first quarter results.

Let me start with a summary of our second quarter results compared to our first quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion, which declined 9% compared to a 19% decline in the worldwide rig count. Total company operating income declined 72%, primarily due to the continued decline in global activity and pricing as well as the reintroduction of depreciation expense for our previously held-for-sale assets.
Moving to our regional results. North America revenue declined 15%, but margins moving down to an operating loss of 8%. The primary drivers were the impact of reduced pricing and activity and our stimulation wireline and drilling product lines. In Latin America, revenue declined 12%, and operating income declined 54% as a result of reduced activity levels in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia and by our decision to curtail activity in Venezuela. Rig activity in both Brazil and Mexico is at a 20-year low, while Venezuela continues to experience significant political and economic turmoil. 
Turning to Middle East Asia. Revenue declined 3%, while operating income declined 22%. We saw increased activity in Kuwait and fairly consistent activity in Saudi Arabia. However, we also began to pricing pressure across the region, and activity levels declined in Iraq, Australia and Indonesia. In Europe/Africa/CIS, second quarter revenue increased 2% [ph], and operating income increased 12% as a result of the seasonal recovery of activity in the North Sea in Russia. Our Corporate and Other expense for the second quarter totaled $60 million, and we expect third quarter expense to come in at similar levels. We recorded a tax benefit for the second quarter of approximately $6 million. Based upon our current outlook for the third quarter, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately 50%. This unusual rate results from having tax losses in the U.S. that are then offset by taxable income in the foreign jurisdictions with lower statutory rates.
During the second quarter, we had several special charges that we need to highlight. First, as you previously disclosed, we recognized the $3.5 billion termination fee associated with the Baker Hughes transaction. We also recognized pretax restructuring and other charges of $423 million. These charges consist primarily of severance cost and asset impairments as we continue to adjust our cost structure and footprint to the current operating environment. The largest single item in the charge was a fair market value adjustment required by accounting rules for exchanging $200 million of our Venezuelan receivable for an interest-bearing promissory note.
This instrument provides a more defined schedule around the timing of payments while generating a return while we await payment. There is an immediate expense because accounting rules require that these notes be revalued to their current trading value even if you intend to hold them to maturity. Our current intent is to hold of them to maturity, and we expect to collect 100% of the principal. As such, the notes will accrete back to their par values as they mature over the next few years. All of these adjustments are tax-deductible, but the tax benefit we recorded also includes the impact of removing our accounting assertion on permanently reinvesting our foreign earnings and some adjustments related to the carryback of our now sizable U.S. NOL. The NOL carryback will provide us with a significant cash flow benefit later this year. 
Speaking of cash flow, this quarter was particularly noisy because of the termination of the Baker Hughes deal and continued restructuring work we are doing. When the smoke clears from the unusual items, however, cash flow from operations was slightly positive, and we closed to the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and equivalents.
Over our history, it's not unusual for our annual cash flow to be back-end-loaded in the year, and 2016 is no exception. We continue to commit to living within our cash flows during this challenging environment and improving earnings, and a number of working capital initiatives that we're implementation should get us ultimately to breakeven for the year. Capital expenditures for the year is still expected to be approximately $850 million.
Turning to our short-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with our thoughts on the third quarter. In North America, the U.S. land rig count is already up 5% sequentially on average and is expected to improve modestly over the remainder of the third quarter. We anticipate revenue will outperform the rig count by several hundred basis points and that margins will improve by 100 to 200 basis points as a result of our cost control initiatives and better utilization. In Latin America, we are anticipating a mid-teens percentage decline in revenue with margins moving down low single digits. Although we may see some end-of-year sales, Latin America is expected to remain our most challenged regions throughout the international down cycle, and we do not expect to see a fundamental improvement this year. And finally, third quarter Eastern Hemisphere revenue is expected to be down modestly low single digits due to declining activity and continued pricing headwinds. Looking ahead, we anticipate Eastern Hemisphere activity to decline over the balance of the year. However, we expect margins to remain flat in the third quarter as they also benefit from our cost control initiatives.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?"
177698,340701492,1008412,"Halliburton Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Halliburton Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let me start today with the headline: 900 is the new 2,000 for U.S. rig activity. And what do I mean by that? I believe it will only take 900 rigs to consume all of the horsepower available in the market. Why?",1236,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let me start today with the headline: 900 is the new 2,000 for U.S. rig activity. And what do I mean by that? I believe it will only take 900 rigs to consume all of the horsepower available in the market. Why? We know the North America market best, and we are in every single part of that market. It is clear to us that is the increases in rig efficiency, lateral length and sand per well create the compounding effect that consumes increasingly more horsepower per rig. In addition, we watch the effect of the downturn on North America service capacity every day and every basin. We've seen the attrition of equipment, people and companies. So let me take these in order. First, horsepower attrition continues due to scrapping and cannibalization. We believe up to 4 million horsepower, and maybe even more, has been permanently removed from the market, representing about 20% of the horsepower capacity reported at the peak, and more is permanently impaired each day. Industry headcount reductions continue, and many of these people are leaving the industry. Finally, company bankruptcies and consolidations also work to accelerate equipment attrition. 
Now I want to address what we do as we scrape along the bottom and look ahead to the recovery. The steps are: must be present to win, and we are. We are present in every market. Second is reduce structural cost. We are doing it. Third, increase utilization. We're positioned for it. And finally, get pricing help. This happens when utilization increases. 
To be ready for the recovery, we played offense. First, we actively protected our market position with key customers, kept the majority of our fleet deployed and delivered fantastic service quality. Despite absorbing the pain of pricing reaching unsustainable levels, we made a strategic decision to stay in every market and keep crews running. In spite of the nearly 80% decline in rig count, our stage count only declined 33%. So here's what we're doing now. We preserved idle equipment outside of our field locations so it doesn't get cannibalized. It's clear to me that it will be cheaper to reactivate our cold stack equipment than to put capital into cannibalized horsepower. This means we are best positioned to more quickly get back to work in the market recovery and are prepared to activate equipment when we see economic opportunities to do so. In terms of structural cost control, we're making significant progress towards reducing our annual cost structure by $1 billion. We reduced headcount and consolidated facilities in every region. At the end of the second quarter, we're about halfway there, both internationally and in North America. We anticipate the remaining savings will come in the second half of the year and will reach the $1 billion run rate cost savings as we go into 2017. 
The next step is increased utilization. We know our platform is most effective when it's fully utilized, so job 1 is to fill the whitespace in the calendar. This is why we work with customers to best utilize our platform in turn helping our customers produced at the lowest cost per BOE. Throughout the downturn, our superior delivery platform, which is our value proposition, our people, processes and equipment results in a margin gap to nearly every competitor, and we expect to maintain that advantage in the recovery. 
The last step will be the return of pricing. Price negotiations have been a barroom brawl in certain situations. As we've seen the signs of recovery, we've elected to walk away from money-losing jobs in recent months. We've been reviewing every contract and program down to individual wells on a pad-by-pad basis, including opportunities for pass-through and cost-related pricing and surcharge. It's a tough market, but we believe pricing will recover as activity increases. And when we have these 4 things, we are confident our North America margins will return to double digits. But beyond North America land, our key focus areas are unconventionals, mature fields and deepwater, and I'm pleased with our executing around the world. Though they may be limited, we're working closely with our customers to unlock unconventionals in every region around the world, including recent projects in Abu Dhabi and Argentina. In the Middle East, we made significant inroads in our IPM business, taking a market-leading position during the downturn. This reflects the dedication our employees have for understanding their customer needs, identify solutions and helping to reduce risks, all while improving efficiency in this uncertain market. This creates a great environment for our collaborative and integrated business model, helping our customers to deliver the lowest cost per barrel of oil. Though we know deepwater is the most challenged, we are collaborating closely with their customers who were working hard to drive now structural costs and make economic wells ECD is an engineered drilling fluid system that allows us to manage narrow frac while drilling. In addition to reducing overall drilling times, ECD is helping break records on greater penetration and one of multiple systems that have allowed us to take a #1 position in the Gulf of Mexico fluids market. 
In Southeast Asia, we have a great example of a collaborative effort with a client that optimized the drilling solution, including drillbits and fluids for exploration while reducing the drilling time by 14 days. This cost savings help to deliver the lowest cost per BOE and is proof that when we work together with our customers and internally, we can provide the efficient solutions in any market. The ability to input customer requirements into our drillbit development in short order is what enables us to deliver this collaborative solution. Collaboration is central to everything we do. Not only do we say it, we do it. A great example is a new resource for customers and partners called iEnergy available through Landmark. It's an open-architecture approach to problem-solving. Now iEnergy was conceived as a community of stakeholders sharing data and building applications. Think of it as our open architecture approach in contrast to proprietary and closed models in the market today. This is highly indicative of how we collaborate at Halliburton, not only collaborating internally but collaborating more closely with our customers. I could go on all day about specific products and services. Let me wrap up with what we do. Our competitive advantage is this. We collaborate engineered solutions and execute to maximize our clients' asset value, which means lower costs and making more barrels. This is why we maintain our global service footprint. We will own the last mile, be present across the globe and maintain dead focus on service quality.
So to sum it up, we like our position. As we expected, the North America unconventional market has responded the fastest, demonstrated by the recent activity pickup. International markets will take more time to rebound, but we are certainly well positioned for when they do. I want to close by thanking our employees for maintaining their focus on service quality and executing at every level in this challenging market. Simply put, service quality essential to how we win and retain work. We've seen record low incident rates so far this year, and it's important we keep this focus on safety and service quality as the market begins to pick up.

So going into the downturn equilibrium was about 2,000 rigs and 600 frac crews in the U.S. so a little more than 3 rigs kept every frac crew busy. Really 3 factors at play here. So first drilling efficiency, then completion intensity and attrition. So from a drilling efficiency standpoint, rigs have gotten almost 30% faster, meaning more wells per rig per year, so that new ratio is closer to 2 to 2.5 rigs for every crew. Second is around completions intensity and a job gotten twice as big meaning more horsepower per crew, almost 20% more meaning that the same horsepower that made up 600 crews, now only make up 500, and so then you get to the attrition part of that, and there are estimates that range from 3 to 7 million horsepower that level of the market.

And Jeff hit on some of them, rig efficiency sustainable. The speed of that they can drill out lateral is sustainable. The bigger jobs in higher production is sustainable, but that doesn't come without cost. And so as I said, these are great set of customers. They know in their heart of hearts that service prices have to go up. And they are going to fight that impact of prices coming up as fast and as long as they can, but the reality is they know they need a viable service industry to be successful in the long run. So it will be give and take. And my guess is as we listen to the calls over the next few quarters is the operators will say they got them locked in and the service companies will say we've got to have price increases, and we'll end up in the middle somewhere like we always do."

Our second quarter results showed great resilience in the face of a very challenging environment, which included declining rig activity and even more pricing headwinds. Our total company revenue declined only 9% sequentially compared to the 19% decline in the global rig count, and our North America revenue was down 15% from the prior quarter, significantly outperforming the 23% decline in the average U.S. rig count. However, despite these continuing headwinds, based on the recent improvements to North American activity, I believe that the second quarter will mark the trough for our earnings.
Now we are at a dynamic point in the cycle, and I'm not going to waste the limited time we have with you on the call this morning discussing things like the macroeconomics, the worldwide demand, the general economy or commodity prices. There are many public sources out there where you can get this data, including our customers, because that is the world that they live in every day.
What I want to talk about today is the world that we know best. Now conventional wisdom coming out of the first quarter was that the rig count would continue to drop. We said we saw North America differently, and we're the first to call a bottom for the rig count. This is precisely what happened.
So let's talk about the reality of today's North America market. I can summarize this market in one sentence. Today, our customers are thinking about growing their business again rather than being focused on survival. There are 2 distinct factors that work in North America: psychological and economic, and I think it's critical to understand them both. Now you haven't heard me talk about the psychology of North American producers before, but given what has happened to many of our customers in the last 18 months, I think it's an important point to understand. I spend a large amount of time with customers late in the quarter taking their pulse, and I can tell you there is a growing survivor mentality out there, and you can't underestimate the positive change in attitude that we are seeing in our North American customers. There is a spring in their step that I didn't see earlier in the year and in almost every case, they are talking about adding rigs, buying assets or doing something value accretive. In short, they are getting back to business. And the psychological factors are getting better. Oil reaching $50 per barrel even for a brief time was a critical emotional milestone for our customers as was being able to buy a strip above $50 per barrel. But maybe it can be summed up best by one customer who told me, ""Dave, it's actually a light at the end of the tunnel and not an oncoming train."" So to borrow a Keynesian economic term, the animal spirits are back in North America. But also understanding the economic reality in North America is equally important. Pricing has helped cash flow but not enough. Hedges rolling off have created cash flow uncertainty. Balance sheet repair is still critical, and many customers are looking at severe declines in production as many of them have drilled few wells in the last 18 months. And while there are many customers that have adequate liquidity, there is also a large segment evaluating how to access capital. This evaluation is around whether to do dilutive equity deals, accessing the high-yield markets, looking at reserved-based lending or partnering with private equity. But the important point is they are back in business. Now our North America customer management teams are great to work with. They are creative, adaptive and increasingly confident, and I believe they will find the solutions best tailored for their companies.
This is also a smart group, and they see today's looming supply shortfall and know that U.S. unconventionals will likely be the first and deepest beneficiary of growing supply shortages, and you can be sure they want to reap some of that benefit.
So let's talk about how the cycle is starting to stack up and how this coming up cycle will play out. Now obviously the last 2 years has been a period of significant underinvestment where global CapEx has been reduced by nearly $400 billion. As a result, the industry will have to find a lot of new barrels in the next 5 years. Now you can choose your own energy supply expert, and there are many of them out there, but most agree we will need between 18 and 22 million barrels per day of new production by 2021, meaning we have to find nearly 2 Saudi Arabia's worth of production in the next 5 years.
To achieve this production goal, we believe there will need to be structural changes that have to happen. It clearly starts with a supportive commodity price, and we're not there yet today. But prices will have to get there soon or the supply challenges will be even greater. Industry balance sheets will need to be repaired. The industry will need to replenish experience lost to retirement and cutbacks. We will have to find sustainable ways to deepen the relationships between operators and service companies, collaborating to integrate better, eliminate duplication and drive down delivery cost. And finally, producers will have to accept the reality of service company economics. Some of the efficiency gains we have made with our customers are in fact sustainable and will continue but others, including deep, uneconomic pricing cuts are unsustainable and will have to be reversed. In this environment, we are confident that North America will recover the fastest. The North America market has turned, and we expect to see a continued modest uptick in the U.S. rig count during the second half of the year and becoming more meaningful as we go into 2017. And now that we have seen the floor and activity levels, we expect revenue to increase based on higher utilization rates, and as we have said consistently, rig count stabilization is the first step on the road to margin repair, and Jeff will discuss that in a few minutes. Current service pricing in North America is unsustainable. We are in an environment where service providers are unable to meet their cost of capital and many are struggling to recover even their cash cost. Historically, as we reach the bottom, the downward momentum on pricing creates a headwind, and margin repair tends to lag activity recovery by a quarter or so. To break this typical cycle, we have made structural changes to our delivery platform, eliminating management layers and consolidating roles and locations. As a result of these savings, we are confident that North America margins can begin to recover in the third quarter. 
When this downturn started, we said that we were entering it from a position of strength in all of our markets. Since that time, we have executed our downturn playbook and have continuously outperformed the market both in North America as well as the Eastern Hemisphere, gaining market share in both.
So to summarize, the market has played out as we predicted, and our strategy is working. North America has turned and with our market share increase during the downturn, we believe we are the best positioned company. During the coming recovery, we plan to scale up our delivery platform by addressing our product line building blocks one at a time through a combination of organic growth and selective acquisitions. With that, let me turn the call over to Mark and Jeff to cover our financial and operational results. Mark?"
177698,340701492,1008574,"Halliburton Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Halliburton Company","Executives","Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a summary of our second quarter results compared to our first quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion, which declined 9% compared to a 19% decline in the worldwide",894,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a summary of our second quarter results compared to our first quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion, which declined 9% compared to a 19% decline in the worldwide rig count. Total company operating income declined 72%, primarily due to the continued decline in global activity and pricing as well as the reintroduction of depreciation expense for our previously held-for-sale assets.
Moving to our regional results. North America revenue declined 15% with margins moving down to an operating loss of 8%. The primary drivers were the impact of reduced pricing and activity and our stimulation wireline and drilling product lines. In Latin America, revenue declined 12%, and operating income declined 54% as a result of reduced activity levels in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia and by our decision to curtail our activity in Venezuela. Rig activity in both Brazil and Mexico is at a 20-year low, while Venezuela continues to experience significant political and economic turmoil. 
Turning to Middle East Asia. Revenue declined 3%, while operating income declined 22%. We saw increased activity in Kuwait and fairly consistent activity in Saudi Arabia. However, we also began to experience pricing pressure across the region, and activity levels declined in Iraq, Australia and Indonesia. In Europe/Africa/CIS, second quarter revenue increased 2%, and operating income increased 12% as a result of the seasonal recovery of activity in the North Sea in Russia. Our Corporate and Other expense for the second quarter totaled $60 million, and we expect third quarter expense to come in at similar levels. We recorded a tax benefit for the second quarter of approximately $6 million. Based upon our current outlook for the third quarter, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately 50%. This unusual rate results from having tax losses in the U.S. that are then offset by taxable income in the foreign jurisdictions with lower statutory rates.
During the second quarter, we had several special charges that we need to highlight. First, as we previously disclosed, we recognized the $3.5 billion termination fee associated with the Baker Hughes transaction. We also recognized pretax restructuring and other charges of $423 million. These charges consist primarily of severance cost and asset impairments as we continue to adjust our cost structure and footprint to the current operating environment. The largest single item in that charge was a fair market value adjustment required by accounting rules for exchanging $200 million of our Venezuela receivable for an interest-bearing promissory note.
This instrument provides a more defined schedule around the timing of payments while generating a return while we await payment. There is an immediate expense because accounting rules require that these notes be revalued to their current trading value even if you intend to hold them to maturity. Our current intent is to hold them to maturity, and we expect to collect 100% of the principal. As such, the notes will accrete back to their par value as they mature over the next few years. All of these adjustments are tax-deductible, but the tax benefit we recorded also includes the impact of removing our accounting assertion on permanently reinvesting our foreign earnings and some adjustments related to the carryback of our now sizable U.S. NOL. The NOL carryback will provide us with a significant cash flow benefit later this year. 
Speaking of cash flow, this quarter was particularly noisy because of the termination of the Baker Hughes deal and continued restructuring work we are doing. When the smoke clears from the unusual items, however, cash flow from operations was slightly positive, and we closed the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and equivalents.
Over our history, it's not unusual for our annual cash flow to be back-end-loaded in the year, and 2016 is no exception. We continue to commit to living within our cash flows during this challenging environment and improving earnings, and a number of working capital initiatives that we're implementation should get us ultimately to breakeven for the year. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be approximately $850 million.
Turning to our short-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with our thoughts on the third quarter. In North America, the U.S. land rig count is already up 5% sequentially on average and is expected to improve modestly over the remainder of the third quarter. We anticipate revenue will outperform the rig count by several hundred basis points and that margins will improve by 100 to 200 basis points as a result of our cost control initiatives and better utilization. In Latin America, we are anticipating a mid-teens percentage decline in revenue with margins moving down to the low single digits. Although we may see some end-of-year sales, Latin America is expected to remain our most challenged region throughout the international down cycle, and we do not expect to see a fundamental improvement this year. And finally, third quarter Eastern Hemisphere revenue is expected to be down modestly, low single digits due to declining activity and continued pricing headwinds. Looking ahead, we anticipate Eastern Hemisphere activity to decline over the balance of the year. However, we expect margins to remain flat in the third quarter as they also benefit from our cost control initiatives.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?"
177698,340701492,1008574,"Halliburton Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2016",2016-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Halliburton Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let me start today with the headline: 900 is the new 2,000 for U.S. rig activity. And what do I mean by that? I believe it will only take 900 rigs to consume all of the horsepower available in the market. Why?",1241,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let me start today with the headline: 900 is the new 2,000 for U.S. rig activity. And what do I mean by that? I believe it will only take 900 rigs to consume all of the horsepower available in the market. Why? We know the North America market best, and we are in every single part of that market. It was clear to us is that the increases in rig efficiency, lateral length and sand per well create a compounding effect that consumes increasingly more horsepower per rig. In addition, we watch the effect of the downturn on North America service capacity every day and every basin. We've seen the attrition of equipment, people and companies. So let me take these in order. First, horsepower attrition continues due to scrapping and cannibalization. We believe up to 4 million horsepower, and maybe even more, has been permanently removed from the market, representing about 20% of the horsepower capacity reported at the peak, and more is permanently impaired each day. Industry headcount reductions continue, and many of these people are leaving the industry. Finally, company bankruptcies and consolidations also work to accelerate equipment attrition. 
Now I want to address what we do as we scrape along the bottom and look ahead to the recovery. The steps are: must be present to win, and we are. We are present in every market. Second is reduce structural cost. We are doing it. Third, increase utilization. We're positioned for it. And finally, get pricing help. This happens when utilization increases. 
To be ready for the recovery, we played offense. First, we actively protected our market position with key customers, kept the majority of our fleet deployed and delivered fantastic service quality. Despite absorbing the pain of pricing reaching unsustainable levels, we made a strategic decision to stay in every market and keep crews running. In spite of the nearly 80% decline in rig count, our stage count only declined 33%. So here's what we're doing now. We preserved idle equipment outside of our field locations so it doesn't get cannibalized. It's clear to me that it will be cheaper to reactivate our cold-stacked equipment than to put capital into cannibalized horsepower. This means we are best positioned to more quickly get back to work in the market recovery and are prepared to activate equipment when we see economic opportunities to do so. In terms of structural cost control, we're making significant progress towards reducing our annual cost structure by $1 billion. We reduced headcount and consolidated facilities in every region. At the end of the second quarter, we're about halfway there, both internationally and in North America. We anticipate the remaining savings will come in the second half of the year and will reach the $1 billion run rate cost savings as we go into 2017. 
The next step is increased utilization. We know our platform is most effective when it's fully utilized, so job 1 is to fill the whitespace in the calendar. This is why we work with customers to best utilize our platform in turn helping our customers produce at the lowest cost per BOE. Throughout the downturn, our superior delivery platform, which is our value proposition, our people, processes and equipment results in a margin gap to nearly every competitor, and we expect to maintain that advantage in the recovery. 
The last step will be the return of pricing. Price negotiations have been a barroom brawl in certain situations. As we've seen signs of recovery, we've elected to walk away from money-losing jobs in recent months. We've been reviewing every contract and program down to individual wells on a pad-by-pad basis, including opportunities for pass-through and cost-related pricing and surcharge. It's a tough market, but we believe pricing will recover as activity increases. And when we have these 4 things, we are confident our North America margins will return to double digits. But beyond North America land, our key focus areas are unconventionals, mature fields and deepwater, and I'm pleased with how we're executing around the world. Though they may be limited, we're working closely with our customers to unlock unconventionals in every region around the world, including recent projects in Abu Dhabi and Argentina. In the Middle East, we made significant inroads in our IPM business, taking a market-leading position during the downturn. This reflects the dedication our employees have for understanding their customer needs, identify solutions and helping to reduce risks, all while improving efficiency in this uncertain market. This creates a great environment for our collaborative and integrated business model, helping our customers to deliver the lowest cost per barrel of oil. Though we know deepwater is the most challenged, we are collaborating closely with our customers who are working hard to drive down structural costs and make economic wells. Berry ECD is an engineered drilling fluid system that allows us to manage narrow frac gradients while drilling. In addition to reducing overall drilling times, Berry ECD is helping break records on greater penetration and is one of multiple systems that have allowed us to take a #1 position in the Gulf of Mexico fluids market. 
In Southeast Asia, we have a great example of a collaborative effort with a client that optimized the drilling solution, including Drill bits and fluids for exploration well reducing the drilling time by 14 days. This cost savings help to deliver the lowest cost per BOE and is proof that when we work together with our customers and internally, we can provide efficient solutions in any market. The ability to input customer requirements into our Drill bit development in short order is what enables us to deliver this collaborative solution. Collaboration is central to everything we do. Not only do we say it, we do it. A great example is a new resource for customers and partners called iEnergy available through Landmark. It's an open-architecture approach to problem-solving. Now iEnergy was conceived as a community of stakeholders sharing data and building applications. Think of it as our open architecture approach in contrast to proprietary and closed models in the market today. This is highly indicative of how we collaborate at Halliburton, not only collaborating internally but collaborating more closely with our customers. I could go on all day about specific products and services. Let me wrap up with what we do. Our competitive advantage is this. We collaborate engineered solutions and execute to maximize our clients' asset value, which means lower cost and making more barrels. This is why we maintain our global service footprint. We will own the last mile, be present across the globe and maintain dead focus on service quality.
So to sum it up, we like our position. As we expected, the North America unconventional market has responded the fastest, demonstrated by the recent activity pickup. International markets will take more time to rebound, but we are certainly well positioned for when they do. I want to close by thanking our employees for maintaining their focus on service quality and executing at every level in this challenging market. Simply put, service quality is central to how we win and retain work. We've seen record low incident rates so far this year, and it's important we keep this focus on safety and service quality as the market begins to pick up.
Now I'll turn the call over to Dave for closing comments. Dave?"

In the next North America rig cycle, 900 is the new 2,000. The international markets will follow, and we are maintaining our integrated global services footprint, managing cost and continuing to gain share. We are working hard at reducing structural cost. We expect to achieve $1 billion lower run rate going into 2017. We remain laser focused on consistent execution, generating superior financial performance and providing industry-leading shareholder returns. And finally, we expect that the second quarter will be the trough of our earnings, and we are confident that Halliburton will be best positioned to outperform in the recovery phase of the cycle.

So going into the downturn equilibrium was about 2,000 rigs and 600 frac crews in the U.S. so a little more than 3 rigs kept every frac crew busy. Really 3 factors at play here. So first drilling efficiency, then completions intensity and attrition. So from a drilling efficiency standpoint, rigs have gotten almost 30% faster, meaning more wells per rig per year, so that new ratio is closer to 2 to 2.5 rigs for every crew. Second is around completions intensity and the jobs have gotten twice as big meaning more horsepower per crew, almost 20% more meaning that the same horsepower that made up 600 crews, now only make up 500, and so then we get to the attrition part of that, and there are estimates that range from 3 to 7 million horsepower that have left the market. We think it's about 4. We see that because we're out in the market every day looking at horsepower but the fact is there's more horsepower that attrits every day just given the type of intensity. So I think the important point is that the market can tighten may be faster than you think."

There was another point that I didn't get a chance to make on the earlier comment. One of the things that we're already beginning to see in the marketplace is a little bit of cost inflation. Diesel, we're seeing it, in some commodities, and things so we are already believe it or not at this point beginning to fight inflation. And so during this period of time,  this sort of off the bottom here with the slope -- the shallow slope that we are on it makes it challenging. We got to get capacity utilization before you can really go get pricing, and we're going to push but some of the commodities are starting to poke their head up and that's catching us a little bit. That's part of what's being reflected in there."

Our second quarter results showed great resilience in the face of a very challenging environment, which included declining rig activity and even more pricing headwinds. Our total company revenue declined only 9% sequentially compared to the 19% decline in the global rig count, and our North America revenue was down 15% from the prior quarter, significantly outperforming the 23% decline in the average U.S. rig count. However, despite these continuing headwinds, based on the recent improvements to North American activity, I believe that the second quarter will mark the trough for our earnings.
Now we are at a dynamic point in the cycle, and I'm not going to waste the limited time we have with you on the call this morning discussing things like the macroeconomics of worldwide demand, the general economy or commodity prices. There are many public sources out there where you can get this data, including our customers, because that is the world that they live in every day.
What I want to talk about today is the world that we know best. Now conventional wisdom coming out of the first quarter was that the rig count would continue to drop. We said we saw North America differently and were the first to call a bottom for the rig count. This is precisely what happened.
So let's talk about the reality of today's North America market. I can summarize this market in one sentence. Today, our customers are thinking about growing their business again rather than being focused on survival. There are 2 distinct factors that work in North America: psychological and economic, and I think it's critical to understand them both. Now you haven't heard me talk about the psychology of North American producers before, but given what has happened to many of our customers in the last 18 months, I think it's an important point to understand. I spend a large amount of time with customers late in the quarter taking their pulse, and I can tell you there is a growing survivor mentality out there, and you can't underestimate the positive change in attitude that we are seeing in our North American customers. There is a spring in their step that I didn't see earlier in the year, and in almost every case, they are talking about adding rigs, buying assets or doing something value accretive. In short, they are getting back to business. And the psychological factors are getting better. Oil reaching $50 per barrel even for a brief time was a critical emotional milestone for our customers as was being able to buy a strip above $50 per barrel. But maybe it can be summed up best by one customer who told me, ""Dave, it's actually a light at the end of the tunnel and not an oncoming train."" So to borrow a Keynesian economic term, the animal spirits are back in North America. But also understanding the economic reality in North America is equally important. Pricing has helped cash flow, but not enough. Hedges rolling off have created cash flow uncertainty. Balance sheet repair is still critical, and many customers are looking at severe declines in production, as many of them have drilled few wells in the last 18 months. And while there are many customers that have adequate liquidity, there is also a large segment evaluating how to access capital. This evaluation is around whether to do dilutive equity deals, accessing the high-yield markets, looking at reserved-based lending or partnering with private equity. But the important point is they are back in business. Now our North America customer management teams are great to work with. They are creative, adaptive and increasingly confident, and I believe they will find the solutions best tailored for their companies.
This is also a smart group, and they see today's looming supply shortfall and know that U.S. unconventionals will likely be the first and deepest beneficiary of growing supply shortages, and you can be sure they want to reap some of that benefit.
So let's talk about how the cycle is starting to stack up and how this coming up cycle will play out. Now obviously the last 2 years has been a period of significant underinvestment where global CapEx has been reduced by nearly $400 billion. As a result, the industry will have to find a lot of new barrels in the next 5 years. Now you can choose your own energy supply expert, and there are many of them out there, but most agree we will need between 18 and 22 million barrels per day of new production by 2021, meaning we have to find nearly 2 Saudi Arabia's worth of production in the next 5 years.
To achieve this production goal, we believe there will need to be structural changes that have to happen. It clearly starts with a supportive commodity price, and we're not there yet today. But prices will have to get there soon or the supply challenges will be even greater. Industry balance sheets will need to be repaired. The industry will need to replenish experience lost to retirement and cutbacks. We will have to find sustainable ways to deepen the relationships between operators and service companies, collaborating to integrate better, eliminate duplication and drive down delivery cost. And finally, producers will have to accept the reality of service company economics. Some of the efficiency gains we have made with our customers are in fact sustainable and will continue, but others, including deep, uneconomic pricing cuts, are unsustainable and will have to be reversed. In this environment, we are confident that North America will recover the fastest. The North America market has turned, and we expect to see a continued modest uptick in the U.S. rig count during the second half of the year and becoming more meaningful as we go into 2017. And now that we have seen the floor in activity levels, we expect revenue to increase based on higher utilization rates. And as we have said consistently, rig count stabilization is the first step on the road to margin repair, and Jeff will discuss that in a few minutes. Current service pricing in North America is unsustainable. We are in an environment where service providers are unable to meet their cost of capital and many are struggling to recover even their cash cost. Historically, as we reach the bottom, the downward momentum on pricing creates a headwind, and margin repair tends to lag activity recovery by a quarter or so. To break this typical cycle, we have made structural changes to our delivery platform, eliminating management layers and consolidating roles and locations. As a result of these savings, we are confident that North America margins can begin to recover in the third quarter. 
When this downturn started, we said that we were entering it from a position of strength in all of our markets. Since that time, we have executed our downturn playbook and have continuously outperformed the market both in North America as well as the Eastern Hemisphere, gaining market share in both.
So to summarize, the market has played out as we predicted, and our strategy is working. North America has turned and with our market share increase during the downturn, we believe we are the best positioned company. During the coming recovery, we plan to scale up our delivery platform by addressing our product line building blocks one at a time through a combination of organic growth and selective acquisitions. With that, let me turn the call over to Mark and Jeff to cover our financial and operational results. Mark?"

Let me start with a summary of our second quarter results compared to our first quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion, which declined 9% compared to a 19% decline in the worldwide",894,"Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a summary of our second quarter results compared to our first quarter results. Total company revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion, which declined 9% compared to a 19% decline in the worldwide rig count. Total company operating income declined 72%, primarily due to the continued decline in global activity and pricing as well as the reintroduction of depreciation expense for our previously held-for-sale assets.
Moving to our regional results. North America revenue declined 15% with margins moving down to an operating loss of 8%. The primary drivers were the impact of reduced pricing and activity and our stimulation wireline and drilling product lines. In Latin America, revenue declined 12%, and operating income declined 54% as a result of reduced activity levels in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia and by our decision to curtail our activity in Venezuela. Rig activity in both Brazil and Mexico is at a 20-year low, while Venezuela continues to experience significant political and economic turmoil. 
Turning to Middle East Asia. Revenue declined 3%, while operating income declined 22%. We saw increased activity in Kuwait and fairly consistent activity in Saudi Arabia. However, we also began to experience pricing pressure across the region, and activity levels declined in Iraq, Australia and Indonesia. In Europe/Africa/CIS, second quarter revenue increased 2%, and operating income increased 12% as a result of the seasonal recovery of activity in the North Sea and Russia. Our Corporate and Other expense for the second quarter totaled $60 million, and we expect third quarter expense to come in at similar levels. We recorded a tax benefit for the second quarter of approximately $6 million. Based upon our current outlook for the third quarter, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately 50%. This unusual rate results from having tax losses in the U.S. that are then offset by taxable income in the foreign jurisdictions with lower statutory rates.
During the second quarter, we had several special charges that we need to highlight. First, as we previously disclosed, we recognized the $3.5 billion termination fee associated with the Baker Hughes transaction. We also recognized pretax restructuring and other charges of $423 million. These charges consist primarily of severance cost and asset impairments as we continue to adjust our cost structure and footprint to the current operating environment. The largest single item in that charge was a fair market value adjustment required by accounting rules for exchanging $200 million of our Venezuela receivable for an interest-bearing promissory note.
This instrument provides a more defined schedule around the timing of payments while generating a return while we await payment. There is an immediate expense because accounting rules require that these notes be revalued to their current trading value even if you intend to hold them to maturity. Our current intent is to hold them to maturity, and we expect to collect 100% of the principal. As such, the notes will accrete back to their par value as they mature over the next few years. All of these adjustments are tax-deductible, but the tax benefit we recorded also includes the impact of removing our accounting assertion on permanently reinvesting our foreign earnings and some adjustments related to the carryback of our now sizable U.S. NOL. The NOL carryback will provide us with a significant cash flow benefit later this year. 
Speaking of cash flow, this quarter was particularly noisy because of the termination of the Baker Hughes deal and continued restructuring work we are doing. When the smoke clears from the unusual items, however, cash flow from operations was slightly positive, and we closed the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and equivalents.
Over our history, it's not unusual for our annual cash flow to be back-end-loaded in the year, and 2016 is no exception. We continue to commit to living within our cash flows during this challenging environment and improving earnings, and a number of working capital initiatives that we're implementing should get us ultimately to breakeven for the year. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be approximately $850 million.
Turning to our short-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with our thoughts on the third quarter. In North America, the U.S. land rig count is already up 5% sequentially on average and is expected to improve modestly over the remainder of the third quarter. We anticipate revenue will outperform the rig count by several hundred basis points and that margins will improve by 100 to 200 basis points as a result of our cost control initiatives and better utilization. In Latin America, we are anticipating a mid-teens percentage decline in revenue with margins moving down to the low single digits. Although we may see some end-of-year sales, Latin America is expected to remain our most challenged region throughout the international down cycle, and we do not expect to see a fundamental improvement this year. And finally, third quarter Eastern Hemisphere revenue is expected to be down modestly, low single digits, due to declining activity and continued pricing headwinds. Looking ahead, we anticipate Eastern Hemisphere activity to decline over the balance of the year. However, we expect margins to remain flat in the third quarter as they also benefit from our cost control initiatives.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?"

Let me start today with the headline: 900 is the new 2,000 for U.S. rig activity. And what do I mean by that? I believe it will only take 900 rigs to consume all of the horsepower available in the market. Why?",1246,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let me start today with the headline: 900 is the new 2,000 for U.S. rig activity. And what do I mean by that? I believe it will only take 900 rigs to consume all of the horsepower available in the market. Why? Well we know the North America market best, and we are in every single part of that market. And what’s clear to us is that the increases in rig efficiency, lateral length and sand per well create a compounding effect that consumes increasingly more horsepower per rig. In addition, we watch the effect of the downturn on North America service capacity every day and every basin. We've seen the attrition of equipment, people and companies. So let me take these in order. First, horsepower attrition continues due to scrapping and cannibalization. We believe up to 4 million horsepower, and maybe even more, has been permanently removed from the market, representing about 20% of the horsepower capacity reported at the peak, and more is permanently impaired each day. Industry headcount reductions continue, and many of these people are leaving the industry. Finally, company bankruptcies and consolidations also work to accelerate equipment attrition. 
Now I want to address what we do as we scrape along the bottom and look ahead to the recovery. The steps are: Must be present to win, and we are. We are present in every market. Second is reduced structural cost. We are doing it. Third, increase utilization. We're positioned for it. And finally, get pricing help. This happens when utilization increases. 
To be ready for the recovery, we played offense. First, we actively protected our market position with key customers, kept the majority of our fleet deployed and delivered fantastic service quality. Despite absorbing the pain of pricing reaching unsustainable levels, we made a strategic decision to stay in every market and keep crews running. In spite of the nearly 80% decline in rig count, our stage count only declined 33%. So here's what we're doing now. We preserved idle equipment outside of our field locations so it doesn't get cannibalized. It's clear to me that it will be cheaper to reactivate our cold-stacked equipment than to put capital into cannibalized horsepower. This means we are best positioned to more quickly get back to work in the market recovery and are prepared to activate equipment when we see economic opportunities to do so. In terms of structural cost control, we're making significant progress towards reducing our annual cost structure by $1 billion. We reduced headcount and consolidated facilities in every region. At the end of the second quarter, we're about halfway there, both internationally and in North America. We anticipate the remaining savings will come in the second half of the year and will reach the $1 billion run rate cost savings as we go into 2017. 
The next step is increased utilization. We know our platform is most effective when it's fully utilized, so job 1 is to fill the white space in the calendar. This is why we work with customers that best utilize our platform in turn helping our customers produce at the lowest cost per BOE. Throughout the downturn, our superior delivery platform, which is our value proposition, our people, processes and equipment, results in a margin gap to nearly every competitor, and we expect to maintain that advantage in the recovery. 
The last step will be the return of pricing. Price negotiations have been a barroom brawl. And in certain situations, as we've seen signs of recovery, we've elected to walk away from money-losing jobs in recent months. We've been reviewing every contract and program down to individual wells on a pad-by-pad basis, including opportunities for pass-through and cost-related pricing and surcharge. It's a tough market, but we believe pricing will recover as activity increases. And when we have these 4 things, we are confident our North America margins will return to double digits. But beyond North America land, our key focus areas are unconventionals, mature fields and deepwater, and I'm pleased with how we're executing around the world. Though they may be limited, we're working closely with our customers to unlock unconventionals in every region around the world, including recent projects in Abu Dhabi and Argentina. In the Middle East, we’ve made significant inroads in our IPM business, taking a market-leading position during the downturn. This reflects the dedication our employees have for understanding their customer needs, identifying solutions and helping to reduce risks, all while improving efficiency in this uncertain market. This creates a great environment for our collaborative and integrated business model, helping our customers to deliver the lowest cost per barrel of oil. Though we know deepwater is the most challenged, we are collaborating closely with our customers who are working hard to drive down structural costs and make economic wells. Berry ECD is an engineered drilling fluid system that allows us to manage narrow frac gradients while drilling. In addition to reducing overall drilling times, Berry ECD has helped break records on rate of penetration and is one of multiple systems that have allowed us to take a #1 position in the Gulf of Mexico fluids market. 
In Southeast Asia, we have a great example of a collaborative effort with a client that optimized the drilling solution, including Drill bits and fluids, for an exploration well, reducing the drilling time by 14 days. This cost savings helps to deliver the lowest cost per BOE and is proof that when we work together with our customers and internally, we can provide efficient solutions in any market. The ability to input customer requirements into our Drill bit development in short order is what enables us to deliver this collaborative solution. Collaboration is central to everything we do. Not only do we say it, we do it. A great example is a new resource for customers and partners called iEnergy available through Landmark. It's an open-architecture approach to problem-solving. Now iEnergy was conceived as a community of stakeholders sharing data and building applications. Think of it as our open architecture approach in contrast to proprietary and closed models in the market today. This is highly indicative of how we collaborate at Halliburton, not only collaborating internally but collaborating more closely with our customers. I could go on all day about specific products and services. Let me wrap up with what we do. Our competitive advantage is this: we collaborate, engineer solutions and execute to maximize our clients' asset value, which means lower cost and making more barrels. This is why we maintain our global service footprint. We will own the last mile, be present across the globe and maintain dead focus on service quality.
So to sum it up, we like our position. As we expected, the North America unconventional market has responded the fastest, demonstrated by the recent activity pickup. International markets will take more time to rebound, but we are certainly well positioned for when they do. I want to close by thanking our employees for maintaining their focus on service quality and executing at every level in this challenging market. Simply put, service quality is central to how we win and retain work. We've seen record low incident rates so far this year, and it's important we keep this focus on safety and service quality as the market begins to pick up.
Now I'll turn the call over to Dave for closing comments. Dave?"

So going into the downturn equilibrium was about 2,000 rigs and 600 frac crews in the U.S. so a little more than 3 rigs kept every frac crew busy. Really 3 factors at play here. So first drilling efficiency, then completions intensity and attrition. So from a drilling efficiency standpoint, rigs have gotten almost 30% faster, meaning more wells per rig per year, so that new ratio is closer to 2 to 2.5 rigs for every crew. Second is around completions intensity and the jobs have gotten twice as big meaning more horsepower per crew, almost 20% more meaning that the same horsepower that made up 600 crews, now only make up 500, and so then we get to the attrition part of that, and there are estimates that range from 3 million to 7 million horsepower that have left the market.

You've got the NOCs generally with mature fields, and they are just trying to squeeze more out of their mature fields through their existing infrastructure, and that part of the business actually has held up pretty well. There is certainly some pricing pressure there. There's certainly some issues with customers trying to lower their cost per BOE. I think it's the deepwater complex that is the most challenged in this commodity price environment, and we clearly are working with our customers as are all the other contractors to try to push that cost, that breakeven cost down in the deepwater complex. But where pricing is today, it just doesn't work generally in the deepwater, especially the new deepwater. So we've been focused on making sure that we get market share gains even as the market has shrunk because in the long term contracting nature of that market, when it does turn back up, you've got those contracts in hand, and that market share becomes very sticky at that point in time."

Our second quarter results showed great resilience in the face of a very challenging environment, which included declining rig activity and even more pricing headwinds. Our total company revenue declined only 9% sequentially compared to the 19% decline in the global rig count, and our North America revenue was down 15% from the prior quarter, significantly outperforming the 23% decline in the average U.S. rig count. However, despite these continuing headwinds, based on the recent improvements to North American activity, I believe that the second quarter will mark the trough for our earnings.
Now we are at a dynamic point in the cycle, and I'm not going to waste the limited time we have with you on the call this morning discussing things like the macroeconomics of worldwide demand, the general economy or commodity prices. There are many public sources out there where you can get this data, including our customers, because that is the world that they live in every day.
What I want to talk about today is the world that we know best. Now conventional wisdom coming out of the first quarter was that the rig count would continue to drop. We said we saw North America differently and were the first to call a bottom for the rig count. This is precisely what happened.
So let's talk about the reality of today's North America market. I can summarize this market in one sentence. Today, our customers are thinking about growing their business again rather than being focused on survival. There are 2 distinct factors that work in North America: psychological and economic, and I think it's critical to understand them both. Now you haven't heard me talk about the psychology of North American producers before, but given what has happened to many of our customers in the last 18 months, I think it's an important point to understand. I spend a large amount of time with customers late in the quarter taking their pulse, and I can tell you there is a growing survivor mentality out there, and you can't underestimate the positive change in attitude that we are seeing in our North American customers. There is a spring in their step that I didn't see earlier in the year, and in almost every case, they are talking about adding rigs, buying assets or doing something value accretive. In short, they are getting back to business. And the psychological factors are getting better. Oil reaching $50 per barrel even for a brief time was a critical emotional milestone for our customers as was being able to buy a strip above $50 per barrel. But maybe it can be summed up best by one customer who told me, ""Dave, it's actually a light at the end of the tunnel and not an oncoming train."" So to borrow a Keynesian economic term, the animal spirits are back in North America. But also understanding the economic reality in North America is equally important. Pricing has helped cash flow, but not enough. Hedges rolling off have created cash flow uncertainty. Balance sheet repair is still critical, and many customers are looking at severe declines in production, as many of them have drilled few wells in the last 18 months. And while there are many customers that have adequate liquidity, there is also a large segment evaluating how to access capital. This evaluation is around whether to do dilutive equity deals, accessing the high-yield markets, looking at reserved-based lending or partnering with private equity. But the important point is they are back in business. Now our North America customer management teams are great to work with. They are creative, adaptive and increasingly confident, and I believe they will find the solutions best tailored for their companies.
This is also a smart group, and they see today's looming supply shortfall and know that U.S. unconventionals will likely be the first and deepest beneficiary of growing supply shortages, and you can be sure they want to reap some of that benefit.
So let's talk about how the cycle is starting to stack up and how this coming up cycle will play out. Now obviously the last 2 years has been a period of significant underinvestment where global CapEx has been reduced by nearly $400 billion. As a result, the industry will have to find a lot of new barrels in the next 5 years. Now you can choose your own energy supply expert, and there are many of them out there, but most agree we will need between 18 and 22 million barrels per day of new production by 2021, meaning we have to find nearly 2 Saudi Arabia's worth of production in the next 5 years.
To achieve this production goal, we believe there will need to be structural changes that have to happen. It clearly starts with a supportive commodity price, and we're not there yet today. But prices will have to get there soon or the supply challenges will be even greater. Industry balance sheets will need to be repaired. The industry will need to replenish experience lost to retirement and cutbacks. We will have to find sustainable ways to deepen the relationships between operators and service companies, collaborating to integrate better, eliminate duplication and drive down delivery cost. And finally, producers will have to accept the reality of service company economics. Some of the efficiency gains we have made with our customers are in fact sustainable and will continue, but others, including deep, uneconomic pricing cuts, are unsustainable and will have to be reversed. In this environment, we are confident that North America will recover the fastest. The North America market has turned, and we expect to see a continued modest uptick in the U.S. rig count during the second half of the year and becoming more meaningful as we go into 2017. And now that we have seen the floor in activity levels, we expect revenue to increase based on higher utilization rates. And as we have said consistently, rig count stabilization is the first step on the road to margin repair, and Jeff will discuss that in a few minutes. Current service pricing in North America is unsustainable. We are in an environment where service providers are unable to meet their cost of capital and many are struggling to recover even their cash cost. Historically, as we reach the bottom, the downward momentum on pricing creates a headwind, and margin repair tends to lag activity recovery by a quarter or so. To break this typical cycle, we have made structural changes to our delivery platform, eliminating management layers and consolidating roles and locations. As a result of these savings, we are confident that North America margins can begin to recover in the third quarter. 
When this downturn started, we said that we were entering it from a position of strength in all of our markets. Since that time, we have executed our downturn playbook and have continuously outperformed the market both in North America as well as the Eastern Hemisphere, gaining market share in both.
So to summarize, the market has played out as we predicted, and our strategy is working. North America has turned and with our market share increase during the downturn, we believe we are the best positioned company. During the coming recovery, we plan to scale up our delivery platform by addressing our product line building blocks one at a time through a combination of organic growth and selective acquisitions. With that, let me turn the call over to Mark and Jeff to cover our financial and operational results. Mark?"

Total company operating income declined 72%, primarily due to the continued decline in global activity and pricing as well as the reintroduction of depreciation expense for our previously held-for-sale assets.
Moving to our regional results. North America revenue declined 15% with margins moving down to an operating loss of 8%. The primary drivers were the impact of reduced pricing and activity and our stimulation wireline and drilling product lines. In Latin America, revenue declined 12%, and operating income declined 54% as a result of reduced activity levels in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia and by our decision to curtail our activity in Venezuela. Rig activity in both Brazil and Mexico is at a 20-year low, while Venezuela continues to experience significant political and economic turmoil. 
Turning to Middle East Asia. Revenue declined 3%, while operating income declined 22%. We saw increased activity in Kuwait and fairly consistent activity in Saudi Arabia. However, we also began to experience pricing pressure across the region, and activity levels declined in Iraq, Australia and Indonesia. In Europe/Africa/CIS, second quarter revenue increased 2%, and operating income increased 12% as a result of the seasonal recovery of activity in the North Sea and Russia. Our Corporate and Other expense for the second quarter totaled $60 million, and we expect third quarter expense to come in at similar levels. We recorded a tax benefit for the second quarter of approximately $6 million. Based upon our current outlook for the third quarter, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately 50%. This unusual rate results from having tax losses in the U.S. that are then offset by taxable income in the foreign jurisdictions with lower statutory rates.
During the second quarter, we had several special charges that we need to highlight. First, as we previously disclosed, we recognized the $3.5 billion termination fee associated with the Baker Hughes transaction. We also recognized pretax restructuring and other charges of $423 million. These charges consist primarily of severance cost and asset impairments as we continue to adjust our cost structure and footprint to the current operating environment. The largest single item in that charge was a fair market value adjustment required by accounting rules for exchanging $200 million of our Venezuela receivable for an interest-bearing promissory note.
This instrument provides a more defined schedule around the timing of payments while generating a return while we await payment. There is an immediate expense because accounting rules require that these notes be revalued to their current trading value even if you intend to hold them to maturity. Our current intent is to hold them to maturity, and we expect to collect 100% of the principal. As such, the notes will accrete back to their par value as they mature over the next few years. All of these adjustments are tax-deductible, but the tax benefit we recorded also includes the impact of removing our accounting assertion on permanently reinvesting our foreign earnings and some adjustments related to the carryback of our now sizable U.S. NOL. The NOL carryback will provide us with a significant cash flow benefit later this year. 
Speaking of cash flow, this quarter was particularly noisy because of the termination of the Baker Hughes deal and continued restructuring work we are doing. When the smoke clears from the unusual items, however, cash flow from operations was slightly positive, and we closed the quarter with $3.1 billion in cash and equivalents.
Over our history, it's not unusual for our annual cash flow to be back-end-loaded in the year, and 2016 is no exception. We continue to commit to living within our cash flows during this challenging environment and improving earnings, and a number of working capital initiatives that we're implementing should get us ultimately to breakeven for the year. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be approximately $850 million.
Turning to our short-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with our thoughts on the third quarter. In North America, the U.S. land rig count is already up 5% sequentially on average and is expected to improve modestly over the remainder of the third quarter. We anticipate revenue will outperform the rig count by several hundred basis points and that margins will improve by 100 to 200 basis points as a result of our cost control initiatives and better utilization. In Latin America, we are anticipating a mid-teens percentage decline in revenue with margins moving down to the low single digits. Although we may see some end-of-year sales, Latin America is expected to remain our most challenged region throughout the international down cycle, and we do not expect to see a fundamental improvement this year. And finally, third quarter Eastern Hemisphere revenue is expected to be down modestly, low single digits, due to declining activity and continued pricing headwinds. Looking ahead, we anticipate Eastern Hemisphere activity to decline over the balance of the year. However, we expect margins to remain flat in the third quarter as they also benefit from our cost control initiatives.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?"

Let me start today with the headline: 900 is the new 2,000 for U.S. rig activity. And what do I mean by that? I believe it will only take 900 rigs to consume all of the horsepower available in the market. Why?",1246,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let me start today with the headline: 900 is the new 2,000 for U.S. rig activity. And what do I mean by that? I believe it will only take 900 rigs to consume all of the horsepower available in the market. Why? Well we know the North America market best, and we are in every single part of that market. And what’s clear to us is that the increases in rig efficiency, lateral length and sand per well create a compounding effect that consumes increasingly more horsepower per rig. In addition, we watch the effect of the downturn on North America service capacity every day and every basin. We've seen the attrition of equipment, people and companies. So let me take these in order. First, horsepower attrition continues due to scrapping and cannibalization. We believe up to 4 million horsepower, and maybe even more, has been permanently removed from the market, representing about 20% of the horsepower capacity reported at the peak, and more is permanently impaired each day. Industry headcount reductions continue, and many of these people are leaving the industry. Finally, company bankruptcies and consolidations also work to accelerate equipment attrition. 
Now I want to address what we do as we scrape along the bottom and look ahead to the recovery. The steps are: Must be present to win, and we are. We are present in every market. Second is reduced structural cost. We are doing it. Third, increase utilization. We're positioned for it. And finally, get pricing help. This happens when utilization increases. 
To be ready for the recovery, we played offense. First, we actively protected our market position with key customers, kept the majority of our fleet deployed and delivered fantastic service quality. Despite absorbing the pain of pricing reaching unsustainable levels, we made a strategic decision to stay in every market and keep crews running. In spite of the nearly 80% decline in rig count, our stage count only declined 33%. So here's what we're doing now. We preserved idle equipment outside of our field locations so it doesn't get cannibalized. It's clear to me that it will be cheaper to reactivate our cold-stacked equipment than to put capital into cannibalized horsepower. This means we are best positioned to more quickly get back to work in the market recovery and are prepared to activate equipment when we see economic opportunities to do so. In terms of structural cost control, we're making significant progress towards reducing our annual cost structure by $1 billion. We reduced headcount and consolidated facilities in every region. At the end of the second quarter, we're about halfway there, both internationally and in North America. We anticipate the remaining savings will come in the second half of the year and will reach the $1 billion run rate cost savings as we go into 2017. 
The next step is increased utilization. We know our platform is most effective when it's fully utilized, so job 1 is to fill the white space in the calendar. This is why we work with customers that best utilize our platform in turn helping our customers produce at the lowest cost per BOE. Throughout the downturn, our superior delivery platform, which is our value proposition, our people, processes and equipment, results in a margin gap to nearly every competitor, and we expect to maintain that advantage in the recovery. 
The last step will be the return of pricing. Price negotiations have been a barroom brawl. And in certain situations, as we've seen signs of recovery, we've elected to walk away from money-losing jobs in recent months. We've been reviewing every contract and program down to individual wells on a pad-by-pad basis, including opportunities for pass-through and cost-related pricing and surcharge. It's a tough market, but we believe pricing will recover as activity increases. And when we have these 4 things, we are confident our North America margins will return to double digits. But beyond North America land, our key focus areas are unconventionals, mature fields and deepwater, and I'm pleased with how we're executing around the world. Though they may be limited, we're working closely with our customers to unlock unconventionals in every region around the world, including recent projects in Abu Dhabi and Argentina. In the Middle East, we’ve made significant inroads in our IPM business, taking a market-leading position during the downturn. This reflects the dedication our employees have for understanding their customer needs, identifying solutions and helping to reduce risks, all while improving efficiency in this uncertain market. This creates a great environment for our collaborative and integrated business model, helping our customers to deliver the lowest cost per barrel of oil. Though we know deepwater is the most challenged, we are collaborating closely with our customers who are working hard to drive down structural costs and make economic wells. Berry ECD is an engineered drilling fluid system that allows us to manage narrow frac gradients while drilling. In addition to reducing overall drilling times, Berry ECD has helped break records on rate of penetration and is one of multiple systems that have allowed us to take a #1 position in the Gulf of Mexico fluids market. 
In Southeast Asia, we have a great example of a collaborative effort with a client that optimized the drilling solution, including Drill bits and fluids, for an exploration well, reducing the drilling time by 14 days. This cost savings helps to deliver the lowest cost per BOE and is proof that when we work together with our customers and internally, we can provide efficient solutions in any market. The ability to input customer requirements into our Drill bit development in short order is what enables us to deliver this collaborative solution. Collaboration is central to everything we do. Not only do we say it, we do it. A great example is a new resource for customers and partners called iEnergy available through Landmark. It's an open-architecture approach to problem-solving. Now iEnergy was conceived as a community of stakeholders sharing data and building applications. Think of it as our open architecture approach in contrast to proprietary and closed models in the market today. This is highly indicative of how we collaborate at Halliburton, not only collaborating internally but collaborating more closely with our customers. I could go on all day about specific products and services. Let me wrap up with what we do. Our competitive advantage is this: we collaborate, engineer solutions and execute to maximize our clients' asset value, which means lower cost and making more barrels. This is why we maintain our global service footprint. We will own the last mile, be present across the globe and maintain dead focus on service quality.
So to sum it up, we like our position. As we expected, the North America unconventional market has responded the fastest, demonstrated by the recent activity pickup. International markets will take more time to rebound, but we are certainly well positioned for when they do. I want to close by thanking our employees for maintaining their focus on service quality and executing at every level in this challenging market. Simply put, service quality is central to how we win and retain work. We've seen record low incident rates so far this year, and it's important we keep this focus on safety and service quality as the market begins to pick up.
Now I'll turn the call over to Dave for closing comments. Dave?"

So going into the downturn equilibrium was about 2,000 rigs and 600 frac crews in the U.S. so a little more than 3 rigs kept every frac crew busy. Really 3 factors at play here. So first drilling efficiency, then completions intensity and attrition. So from a drilling efficiency standpoint, rigs have gotten almost 30% faster, meaning more wells per rig per year, so that new ratio is closer to 2 to 2.5 rigs for every crew. Second is around completions intensity and the jobs have gotten twice as big meaning more horsepower per crew, almost 20% more meaning that the same horsepower that made up 600 crews, now only make up 500, and so then we get to the attrition part of that, and there are estimates that range from 3 million to 7 million horsepower that have left the market. We think it's about 4 million. We see that because we're out in the market every day looking at horsepower. But the fact is there's more horsepower that attrits every day just given the type of intensity. So I think the important point is that the market can tighten maybe faster than you think."

You've got the NOCs generally with mature fields, and they are just trying to squeeze more out of their mature fields through their existing infrastructure, and that part of the business actually has held up pretty well. There is certainly some pricing pressure there. There's certainly some issues with customers trying to lower their cost per BOE. I think it's the deepwater complex that is the most challenged in this commodity price environment, and we clearly are working with our customers as are all the other contractors to try to push that cost, that breakeven cost down in the deepwater complex. But where pricing is today, it just doesn't work generally in the deepwater, especially the new deepwater. So we've been focused on making sure that we get market share gains even as the market has shrunk because in the long term contracting nature of that market, when it does turn back up, you've got those contracts in hand, and that market share becomes very sticky at that point in time."

I never thought I would be so satisfied by barely making a profit. But given where this market is, I certainly am. Through hard work and determination, we have returned to positive territory for our earnings. Now this has been a historic down cycle for the industry, and it's had its fair share of challenges. Our organization is meeting those challenges head on and fighting through them. I am very proud of our leadership in all of our employees. We are the execution company, and I believe this quarter, we outexecuted even the very high expectations we place [ph] on our organization.
Let's take a minute and talk about what transpired over the quarter. Our North America revenue grew 9% for the period, representing the first revenue increase in 7 quarters. Our results improved as we took advantage of the rig count growth by focusing on increasing utilization and working our surface efficiency model. Our customers' animal spirits remain alive and well in North America even though for some, they may feel caged in a bit by cash flow constraints in the short term. The average U.S. rig count increased 14% over the quarter, driven primarily by rig additions to smaller operators where we saw a trend of less service-intensive wells, which is not activity typically worth chasing at today's pricing. This quarter was also impacted by the natural lag time between drilling and completion activity. However, we are now seeing completion activity starting to pick up as we start the fourth quarter. 
We continue to aggressively implement our structural cost reductions announced in our first quarter call, and we have met our goal. On a monthly basis, we have already achieved the run rate of $1 billion of cost savings annually. We also generated over $1 billion in cash flow from operating activities this quarter. As you all know, as we executed our playbook, we gain significant market share globally through the downturn. As the market stabilized, our primary focus will now switch to improving our margins while maintaining that market share. In the U.S., we believe we now have the highest market share we've ever had. And at this point, if we have to give some of it back to move margins up, we might take that approach.
In North America, we achieved a 41% incremental margin. This is a strong step in the right direction as we work to regain profitability there. We remain steadfast in our belief that significant activity increases from our customers starts with sustainable commodity prices over $50 per barrel, which we haven't seen in any meaningful way yet since the rig count activity bottomed out. Operators have had time to reflect on their future drilling plans, and I believe they will approach the recovery with a rational, methodical response in activity based on commodity price fluctuations.
Now looking ahead to the fourth quarter on North America land. Activity levels are difficult to call at this point. Based on current customer feedback, we remain cautious around customer activity due to holiday and seasonal weather-related downtimes. Our customers may take extended breaks starting as early as Thanksgiving and push additional work to the first quarter of 2017. As one customer told me, ""Dave, it doesn't make any sense for me to rent an efficient, high-spec rig if I have to start and stop all the time for the holidays or the last 5 weeks of the year. I just can't get the efficiencies I'm paying for in the rig. I'd rather just wait until next year to start drilling."" And I believe we'll see a lot of that mentality in the fourth quarter. But that being said, it does not change our view that things are getting better for us and our customers.
Now let's turn internationally. I like where our market share is today in the international markets, and I believe we continue to outperform our peers. I expect the international markets to slowly grind downward due to the lower commodity price environment. We experienced activity and pricing headwinds during the quarter. But in anticipation of those forces, we aggressively managed our costs. Although we have had to concede some on pricing, we have worked closely with our customers during the past year to improve their project economics through technology and operating efficiency. We expect to see a bottoming of the international rig count in the first half of 2017. Land-based mature field activity should lead the international recovery, while we expect the Deepwater complex to remain severely challenged for the foreseeable future. 
Even though the light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter, there is no question that we remain in a very challenging market. However, we are confident in our ability to navigate through this cycle and in our continued focus on unconventional mature fields and deepwater markets. As we have said before, unconventionals, particularly those in North America, are leading the recovery and activity, providing the optimal combination of short-cycle returns and fastest incremental barrel to market. Mature fields continue to be resilient, given their relatively low lifting costs. And finally, deepwater remains structurally challenged with higher costs and long-duration project characteristics. While each faces a different set of circumstances today, you can be sure we are looking at our business closely to ensure that we accelerate our growth in each sector as the industry begins to heal. As we have said for some time, North America has assumed the role of swing producer in global oil production. Because of the shift away from production discipline, which was historically created by OPEC, our industry will likely experience shorter commodity price cycles going forward. So we see the future market as a combination of shorter cycles and range-bound commodity prices. In that environment, it is imperative that returns-focused companies like Halliburton be more asset-light. Having an organization structured in a way that is flexible, nimble and efficient and that can adapt to these new quick-moving cycles will be critical to drive the returns results our shareholders have come to expect. 
Our philosophy has been in prioritizing returns over margins and revenue, and that philosophy will continue. Now don't get me wrong. We are always focused on improving margins. But keep in mind, the last cycle of $100 oil covered up terrible inefficiencies across the industry. In today's environment, asset utilization will be just as critical to improving margins, and I have full confidence we are taking the necessary steps to achieve that. Positioning us for success while navigating through this deep cyclical downturn was one of the most intellectually stimulating management challenges we have ever had, and I am confident the Halliburton management team has and will continue to successfully meet each and every challenge.
With that, let me turn the call over to Mark and Jeff to cover our financial and operational results. Mark?"
177698,378742760,1056760,"Halliburton Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Halliburton Company","Executives","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone. Let's start with a summary of our third quarter results compared to our second quarter results on an adjusted basis.

Let's start with a summary of our third quarter results compared to our second quarter results on an adjusted basis. Total company revenue for the quarter was flat at $3.8 billion, while our operating income doubled to $128 million. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in North America and the continued impact of our global cost savings initiatives. 
Moving to our regional results. North America revenue increased 9% with a $58 million increase in operating results or 47% sequentially. The higher U.S. land rig count, coupled with better equipment utilization and our ongoing cost management efforts, drove this improvement. 
In Latin America, revenue and operating income declined by 13% and 50%, respectively. These results primary reflect reduced activity levels in Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela as we've now experienced a 15-year low in the regional rig count. 
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS. Revenue declined 6% as a result of lower drilling activity in West Africa and Continental Europe. Operating income increased 19%, primarily related to our cost savings initiatives and improved pressure pumping and pipeline service profitability throughout the region. 
In Middle East/Asia, revenue declined 3% with a decline in operating income of 4%. The decrease for the quarter was primarily driven by reduced activity across Asia Pacific, including Australia and Indonesia, as well as pricing pressure across the entire region. 
Our Corporate and Other expense for the third quarter totaled approximately $47 million, which was positively impacted by a true-up of some of our insurance reserves. For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate expense to return to our previous run rate of approximately $60 million. Interest expense for the quarter was $141 million and was positively impacted by the interest income we're now earning on the Venezuelan promissory notes we accepted in exchange for some of our trade receivables last quarter. We expect that this level of net interest expense will be our new run rate for the next several quarters. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was a 114% benefit, well above the already unusual 50% rate we anticipated on our last call. As we've discussed before, these unusual effective tax rates are primarily the result of having tax losses in the U.S. that are offset by taxable income in foreign jurisdictions with lower statutory rates. However, the difference this quarter from the rate we anticipated was largely due to an adjustment reflecting the beneficial use of an Argentinian tax treaty that limits the taxation of royalty payments for intellectual property and will allow for more efficient movement of our foreign cash in the future. Based on our current outlook, we anticipate that our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter will be approximately 65%. 
Turning to cash flow. We improved our cash position during the third quarter, ending the period with $3.3 billion in cash and equivalents even after paying off $600 million of senior notes. This increase in cash flow was primarily due to working capital improvements, which included a 7-plus day reduction of our days sales outstanding and the receipt of a series of tax refunds. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be approximately $850 million.
Now turning to our short-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with our thoughts on the fourth quarter. In North America, the uncertainty surrounding customer activity around the holiday season makes the quarter difficult to predict. Based on what our customers are collectively telling us, we anticipate our revenue to perform in line with the rig count, and we expect our sequential incremental margins to be 35% to 40%. In our international business we believe the typical seasonal uptick in year-end software and product sales will be minimal this year as customer budgets are exhausted and may not fully offset continued pricing and activity pressures. As such, we expect fourth quarter revenue and margins to come in flat compared to the third quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?"
177698,378742760,1056760,"Halliburton Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Halliburton Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank and congratulate all of our employees for their fantastic execution throughout the cycle.

I'd like to thank and congratulate all of our employees for their fantastic execution throughout the cycle. It's been a tough 2 years, and our organization has delivered on service quality, has delivered on cost savings and has absolutely executed on our value proposition, collaborating and [ph] engineering solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. The result of this execution was improved margins and repeat business. 
So let's start with North America. While the supply and demand balance for U.S. onshore services is heading in the right direction, we were still in an oversupplied equipment market. Our customers remain focused on cost and producing more barrels. I believe this puts us in an excellent position. No one is better at collaborating with customers to engineer solutions that deliver the lowest cost per BOE than Halliburton. In fact, the more I talk to customers, the more I'm convinced this is the winning formula. 
In pressure pumping, we estimate that the U.S. active fleet -- I emphasize active -- grew to over 7 million horsepower, and the utilization of that active marketed fleet is about 70%. This is a long way from full capacity, but it represents substantial tightening during the third quarter. And as I said last quarter, this is the first step towards a balanced market for the industry's available fleet. And while we know the industry has additional horsepower on the sidelines that could come into the market, we also know that this additional equipment requires substantial maintenance to be put back to work and will require adequate price increases to justify its return. So as we look ahead, we expect pricing to work its way through a couple of predictable steps. The first step, which we're starting to see now, is a tightening of active capacity. This will have a modest price impact. But more importantly, it allows increased utilization to have a positive contribution to earnings. 
Step 2 is when we see equipment requiring significant investment returning to the market. I expect that this will require significantly higher pricing to justify the investment. This is by no means traditional pricing power. Instead, it's the industry recognizing the relationship between investments and returns. Let's hope. 
Market share is valuable, and that's why we build it in the downturn. I think Dave was crystal clear that our target is leading returns, and we have not forgotten that. High market share gives us choice in a recovery to work with the most efficient customers, who value what we do and who ultimately reward us for helping them make better wells. There is no doubt that in this environment, our clients are planning work based on commodity price. The stakes have never been higher for us to help maximize the value of their assets, and this is exactly what we're doing. 
So let me take you through some examples of how we're doing this today. Last quarter, we worked with a Permian operator who wanted to step outside of their core assets and find a way to optimize the value of their acreage. With a robust drilling and completion plan in place, the customer sought to minimize completion damage during flowback to maximize overall recovery. Through the use of our caliber engineer flowback service, we were able to prevent damage and achieve a 15% higher cumulative production on this well than on wells nearby with similar completions. The well is now the best producer in the customer's portfolio despite it being in a geology that had been originally considered marginal. Now there's been a lot of talk about drilling in [ph] core reservoir rock recently. I believe it's now our job to help our customers extend the definition of core. This is a great example of how we listen to our customers' drivers and work with them to develop a unique solution to meet their goals. Caliber has not been used before in the Permian. But thanks to this success, this gained traction in that basin. 
In the Middle East, we recently engaged in a highly collaborative project where the customer's drivers were to improve delivery time and production. We developed a solution that stimulated a well in less time and in a more cost-effective manner. Using our squeeze [ph] technique, where coil tubing is used to deliver a more focused stimulation to selective areas, we were able to use fewer chemicals and reduce pumping time by 40%. This highlights how Halliburton systematically collaborates with the customer to engineer a solution that maximizes their asset value. 
In Brazil, we worked to maximize our customers' asset value through intelligent completions. These are essential in the pre-salt area to improve reservoir management and production while reducing the overall well cost. In the quarter, we completed a multiyear campaign of 40 successful intelligent completions, which lowered the lifting cost dramatically. This is what clients like about Halliburton. We collaborate, meaning listen and respond to our customers. We focus on creating and maintaining strong client relationships. It's why we win and keep work. It's how we get things done and why we are the execution company. 
To sum up, I've walked through our value proposition in action, and it's equally effective in all of our strategic markets: unconventionals, mature fields and deepwater. The takeaway is that Halliburton is well positioned to win the recovery in each of these markets.
Now I'll turn the call over to Dave for closing comments. Dave?"

As we predicted, the North America unconventional market has responded the quickest, demonstrated by the increase in recent rig count activity. However, we continue to believe meaningful activity increases from our customers will not start until we see sustainable commodity prices above $50 per barrel. And while the international markets will take a little more time to rebound, we are maintaining our integrated global services footprint, managing costs and continuing to fight for market share. We expect to see the bottom for activity in this market to occur in the first half of 2017. In this global recovery, we expect cycle times to accelerate. I believe successful companies will be characterized by lighter asset base, faster asset velocity and job site execution all geared to respond quickly to deliver returns. So to me, no matter what market is handed to us, Halliburton is well positioned, and our dedication to execution gives me confidence that we will continue to outperform our peers.

I fully believe though that this comes right over the next period of time because again, where we tend to engage is when we start to make the bigger decisions around how to design fracs, where we're going to be positioned and getting up to sort of full speed and full velocity, that's when our assets work the hardest, and that's where we're the most efficient.

We move it by rail through transloading move to the last mile to the well site. So we don't articulate all that cost out of the margin designed to recover that cost and put it in line with the other margins that we have across the pumping and other service side of our business. Obviously, what's happening right now is we're not earning a margin on a lot of that business. I mean in some cases, we may. But the practical reality when you're negative in North America, particularly on the pressure pumping side, you're not making money on the sand. You can look at it as right now buy sand for our customers accounts, and that's not a sustainable practice. So that's a large part of what we're trying to repair. But we do believe that our -- the scale of it, of the operation that we have the amount of sand that we move, the quality and the efficiency of the transloading operation we provide is a significant value add to our customers.

I never thought I would be so satisfied by barely making a profit. But given where this market is, I certainly am. Through hard work and determination, we have returned to positive territory for our earnings. Now this has been a historic down cycle for the industry, and it's had its fair share of challenges. Our organization is meeting those challenges head on and fighting through them. I am very proud of our leadership in all of our employees. We are the execution company, and I believe this quarter, we outexecuted even the very high expectations we place on our organization.
Let's take a minute and talk about what transpired over the quarter. Our North America revenue grew 9% for the period, representing the first revenue increase in 7 quarters. Our results improved as we took advantage of the rig count growth by focusing on increasing utilization and working our surface efficiency model. Our customers' animal spirits remain alive and well in North America even though for some, they may feel caged in a bit by cash flow constraints in the short term. The average U.S. rig count increased 14% over the quarter, driven primarily by rig additions to smaller operators where we saw a trend of less service-intensive wells, which is not activity typically worth chasing at today's pricing. This quarter was also impacted by the natural lag time between drilling and completion activity. However, we are now seeing completion activity starting to pick up as we start the fourth quarter. 
We continue to aggressively implement our structural cost reductions announced in our first quarter call, and we have met our goal. On a monthly basis, we have already achieved the run rate of $1 billion of cost savings annually. We also generated over $1 billion in cash flow from operating activities this quarter. As you all know, as we executed our playbook, we gain significant market share globally through the downturn. As the market stabilized, our primary focus will now switch to improving our margins while maintaining that market share. In the U.S., we believe we now have the highest market share we've ever had. And at this point, if we have to give some of it back to move margins up, we might take that approach.
In North America, we achieved a 41% incremental margin. This is a strong step in the right direction as we work to regain profitability there. We remain steadfast in our belief that significant activity increases from our customers starts with sustainable commodity prices over $50 per barrel, which we haven't seen in any meaningful way yet since the rig count activity bottomed out. Operators have had time to reflect on their future drilling plans, and I believe they will approach the recovery with a rational, methodical response in activity based on commodity price fluctuations.
Now looking ahead to the fourth quarter on North America land. Activity levels are difficult to call at this point. Based on current customer feedback, we remain cautious around customer activity due to holiday and seasonal weather-related downtimes. Our customers may take extended breaks starting as early as Thanksgiving and push additional work to the first quarter of 2017. As one customer told me, ""Dave, it doesn't make any sense for me to rent an efficient, high-spec rig if I have to start and stop all the time for the holidays or the last 5 weeks of the year. I just can't get the efficiencies I'm paying for in the rig. I'd rather just wait until next year to start drilling."" And I believe we'll see a lot of that mentality in the fourth quarter. But that being said, it does not change our view that things are getting better for us and our customers.
Now let's turn internationally. I like where our market share is today in the international markets, and I believe we continue to outperform our peers. I expect the international markets to slowly grind downward due to the lower commodity price environment. We experienced activity and pricing headwinds during the quarter. But in anticipation of those forces, we aggressively managed our costs. Although we have had to concede some on pricing, we have worked closely with our customers during the past year to improve their project economics through technology and operating efficiency. We expect to see a bottoming of the international rig count in the first half of 2017. Land-based mature field activity should lead the international recovery, while we expect the Deepwater complex to remain severely challenged for the foreseeable future. 
Even though the light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter, there is no question that we remain in a very challenging market. However, we are confident in our ability to navigate through this cycle and in our continued focus on unconventional mature fields and deepwater markets. As we have said before, unconventionals, particularly those in North America, are leading the recovery and activity, providing the optimal combination of short-cycle returns and fastest incremental barrel to market. Mature fields continue to be resilient, given their relatively low lifting costs. And finally, deepwater remains structurally challenged with higher costs and long-duration project characteristics. While each faces a different set of circumstances today, you can be sure we are looking at our business closely to ensure that we accelerate our growth in each sector as the industry begins to heal. As we have said for some time, North America has assumed the role of swing producer in global oil production. Because of the shift away from production discipline, which was historically created by OPEC, our industry will likely experience shorter commodity price cycles going forward. So we see the future market as a combination of shorter cycles and range-bound commodity prices. In that environment, it is imperative that returns-focused companies like Halliburton be more asset-light. Having an organization structured in a way that is flexible, nimble and efficient and that can adapt to these new quick-moving cycles will be critical to drive the returns results our shareholders have come to expect. 
Our philosophy has been in prioritizing returns over margins and revenue, and that philosophy will continue. Now don't get me wrong. We are always focused on improving margins. But keep in mind, the last cycle of $100 oil covered up terrible inefficiencies across the industry. In today's environment, asset utilization will be just as critical to improving margins, and I have full confidence we are taking the necessary steps to achieve that. Positioning us for success while navigating through this deep cyclical downturn was one of the most intellectually stimulating management challenges we have ever had, and I am confident the Halliburton management team has and will continue to successfully meet each and every challenge.
With that, let me turn the call over to Mark and Jeff to cover our financial and operational results. Mark?"
177698,378742760,1056847,"Halliburton Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Halliburton Company","Executives","Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everyone.

Let's start with a summary of our third quarter results compared to our second quarter results on an adjusted basis. Total company revenue for the quarter was flat at $3.8 billion, while our operating income doubled to $128 million. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in North America and the continued impact of our global cost savings initiatives. 
Moving to our regional results. North America revenue increased 9% with a $58 million increase in operating results or 47% sequentially. The higher U.S. land rig count, coupled with better equipment utilization and our ongoing cost management efforts, drove this improvement. 
In Latin America, revenue and operating income declined by 13% and 50%, respectively. These results primary reflect reduced activity levels in Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela as we've now experienced a 15-year low in the regional rig count. 
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS. Revenue declined 6% as a result of lower drilling activity in West Africa and Continental Europe. Operating income increased 19%, primarily related to our cost savings initiatives and improved pressure pumping and pipeline service profitability throughout the region. 
In Middle East/Asia, revenue declined 3% with a decline in operating income of 4%. The decrease for the quarter was primarily driven by reduced activity across Asia Pacific, including Australia and Indonesia, as well as pricing pressure across the entire region. 
Our Corporate and Other expense for the third quarter totaled approximately $47 million, which was positively impacted by a true-up of some of our insurance reserves. For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate expense to return to our previous run rate of approximately $60 million. Interest expense for the quarter was $141 million and was positively impacted by the interest income we're now earning on the Venezuelan promissory notes we accepted in exchange for some of our trade receivables last quarter. We expect that this level of net interest expense will be our new run rate for the next several quarters. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was a 114% benefit, well above the already unusual 50% rate we anticipated on our last call. As we've discussed before, these unusual effective tax rates are primarily the result of having tax losses in the U.S. that are offset by taxable income in foreign jurisdictions with lower statutory rates. However, the difference this quarter from the rate we anticipated was largely due to an adjustment reflecting the beneficial use of an Argentinian tax treaty that limits the taxation of royalty payments for intellectual property and will allow for more efficient movement of our foreign cash in the future. Based on our current outlook, we anticipate that our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter will be approximately 65%. 
Turning to cash flow. We improved our cash position during the third quarter, ending the period with $3.3 billion in cash and equivalents even after paying off $600 million of senior notes. This increase in cash flow was primarily due to working capital improvements, which included a 7-plus day reduction of our days sales outstanding and the receipt of a series of tax refunds. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be approximately $850 million.
Now turning to our short-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with our thoughts on the fourth quarter. In North America, the uncertainty surrounding customer activity around the holiday season makes the quarter difficult to predict. Based on what our customers are collectively telling us, we anticipate our revenue to perform in line with the rig count, and we expect our sequential incremental margins to be 35% to 40%. In our international business we believe the typical seasonal uptick in year-end software and product sales will be minimal this year as customer budgets are exhausted and may not fully offset continued pricing and activity pressures. As such, we expect fourth quarter revenue and margins to come in flat compared to the third quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?"
177698,378742760,1056847,"Halliburton Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Halliburton Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank and congratulate all of our employees for their fantastic execution throughout the cycle.

I'd like to thank and congratulate all of our employees for their fantastic execution throughout the cycle. It's been a tough 2 years, and our organization has delivered on service quality, has delivered on cost savings and has absolutely executed on our value proposition, collaborating an engineering solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. The result of this execution was improved margins and repeat business. 
So let's start with North America. While the supply and demand balance for U.S. onshore services is heading in the right direction, we were still in an oversupplied equipment market. Our customers remain focused on cost and producing more barrels. I believe this puts us in an excellent position. No one is better at collaborating with customers to engineer solutions that deliver the lowest cost per BOE than Halliburton. In fact, the more I talk to customers, the more I'm convinced this is the winning formula. 
In pressure pumping, we estimate that the U.S. active fleet -- I emphasize active -- grew to over 7 million horsepower, and the utilization of that active marketed fleet is about 70%. This is a long way from full capacity, but it represents substantial tightening during the third quarter. And as I said last quarter, this is the first step towards a balanced market for the industry's available fleet. And while we know the industry has additional horsepower on the sidelines that could come into the market, we also know that this additional equipment requires substantial maintenance to be put back to work and will require adequate price increases to justify its return. So as we look ahead, we expect pricing to work its way through a couple of predictable steps. The first step, which we're starting to see now, is a tightening of active capacity. This will have a modest price impact. But more importantly, it allows increased utilization to have a positive contribution to earnings. 
Step 2 is when we see equipment requiring significant investment returning to the market. I expect that this will require significantly higher pricing to justify the investment. This is by no means traditional pricing power. Instead, it's the industry recognizing the relationship between investments and returns. Let's hope. 
Market share is valuable, and that's why we build it in the downturn. I think Dave was crystal clear that our target is leading returns, and we have not forgotten that. High market share gives us choice in a recovery to work with the most efficient customers, who value what we do and who ultimately reward us for helping them make better wells. There is no doubt that in this environment, our clients are planning work based on commodity price. The stakes have never been higher for us to help maximize the value of their assets, and this is exactly what we're doing. 
So let me take you through some examples of how we're doing this today. Last quarter, we worked with a Permian operator who wanted to step outside of their core assets and find a way to optimize the value of their acreage. With a robust drilling and completion plan in place, the customer sought to minimize completion damage during flowback to maximize overall recovery. Through the use of our caliber engineer flowback service, we were able to prevent damage and achieve a 15% higher cumulative production on this well than on wells nearby with similar completions. The well is now the best producer in the customer's portfolio despite it being in a geology that had been originally considered marginal. Now there's been a lot of talk about drilling in core reservoir rock recently. I believe it's now our job to help our customers extend the definition of core. This is a great example of how we listen to our customers' drivers and work with them to develop a unique solution to meet their goals. Caliber has not been used before in the Permian. But thanks to this success, this gained traction in that basin. 
In the Middle East, we recently engaged in a highly collaborative project where the customer's drivers were to improve delivery time and production. We developed a solution that stimulated a well in less time and in a more cost-effective manner. Using our surgi squeeze technique, where coil tubing is used to deliver a more focused stimulation to selective areas, we were able to use fewer chemicals and reduce pumping time by 40%. This highlights how Halliburton systematically collaborates with the customer to engineer a solution that maximizes their asset value. 
In Brazil, we worked to maximize our customers' asset value through intelligent completions. These are essential in the pre-salt area to improve reservoir management and production while reducing the overall well cost. In the quarter, we completed a multiyear campaign of 40 successful intelligent completions, which lowered the lifting cost dramatically. This is what clients like about Halliburton. We collaborate, meaning listen and respond to our customers. We focus on creating and maintaining strong client relationships. It's why we win and keep work. It's how we get things done and why we are the execution company. 
To sum up, I've walked through our value proposition in action, and it's equally effective in all of our strategic markets: unconventionals, mature fields and deepwater. The takeaway is that Halliburton is well positioned to win the recovery in each of these markets.
Now I'll turn the call over to Dave for closing comments. Dave?"

As we predicted, the North America unconventional market has responded the quickest, demonstrated by the increase in recent rig count activity. However, we continue to believe meaningful activity increases from our customers will not start until we see sustainable commodity prices above $50 per barrel. And while the international markets will take a little more time to rebound, we are maintaining our integrated global services footprint, managing costs and continuing to fight for market share. We expect to see the bottom for activity in this market to occur in the first half of 2017. In this global recovery, we expect cycle times to accelerate. I believe successful companies will be characterized by lighter asset base, faster asset velocity and job site execution all geared to respond quickly to deliver returns. So to me, no matter what market is handed to us, Halliburton is well positioned, and our dedication to execution gives me confidence that we will continue to outperform our peers.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

Jeff made the comment earlier about variablizing costs, and I think that there are some things that we haven't necessarily always thought of as structural that they are -- they would be variable in the definition of how we would typically look at them. But when we talk about variable those, we're talking about constantly looking at do we lease versus buy, do we turn the depreciation charge into a lease charge, do we rent versus own? What can we do to continue to try to increasingly create optionality in our business so that we can flex with the market overall but more importantly, flex with our customers to making sure as they continue to evaluate how they want to do their wells or where they want to do their wells that we can move with them and be as nimble as possible? So I think that we're going to go into next year. Jeff alluded to this, even though we believe the year will be better, we're going to plan very aggressively flat in terms of our structural cost. And even planning flat requires the organization to continue to really focus in on what can we do from a continuous improvement standpoint to continue to drive out cost. I believe you're never done, and we're going to continue to go for it."

And my experience has been some years it happens, but most years, they start to pull things off the calendar as the holidays get there. And you've got the added I think dimension this year of where the commodity price is, what they can buy. Are they going to spend their money buying strips for next year, are they going to basically want to continue to use these high-spec rigs in a sporadic way or just wait until next year where they can run them out on a pad and run them for 60, 80, 90, 100 days and get the efficiencies from them?

Let me start by saying that I am very pleased with our results. I never thought I would be so satisfied by barely making a profit. But given where this market is, I certainly am.

I never thought I would be so satisfied by barely making a profit. But given where this market is, I certainly am. Through hard work and determination, we have returned to positive territory for our earnings. Now this has been a historic down cycle for the industry, and it's had its fair share of challenges. Our organization is meeting those challenges head on and fighting through them. I am very proud of our leadership in all of our employees. We are the execution company, and I believe this quarter, we outexecuted even the very high expectations we place on our organization.
Let's take a minute and talk about what transpired over the quarter. Our North America revenue grew 9% for the period, representing the first revenue increase in 7 quarters. Our results improved as we took advantage of the rig count growth by focusing on increasing utilization and working our surface efficiency model. Our customers' animal spirits remain alive and well in North America even though for some, they may feel caged in a bit by cash flow constraints in the short term. The average U.S. rig count increased 14% over the quarter, driven primarily by rig additions to smaller operators where we saw a trend of less service-intensive wells, which is not activity typically worth chasing at today's pricing. This quarter was also impacted by the natural lag time between drilling and completion activity. However, we are now seeing completion activity starting to pick up as we start the fourth quarter. 
We continue to aggressively implement our structural cost reductions announced in our first quarter call, and we have met our goal. On a monthly basis, we have already achieved the run rate of $1 billion of cost savings annually. We also generated over $1 billion in cash flow from operating activities this quarter. As you all know, as we executed our playbook, we gained significant market share globally through the downturn. As the market stabilized, our primary focus will now switch to improving our margins while maintaining that market share. In the U.S., we believe we now have the highest market share we've ever had. And at this point, if we have to give some of it back to move margins up, we might take that approach.
In North America, we achieved a 41% incremental margin. This is a strong step in the right direction as we work to regain profitability there. We remain steadfast in our belief that significant activity increases from our customers starts with sustainable commodity prices over $50 per barrel, which we haven't seen in any meaningful way yet since the rig count activity bottomed out. Operators have had time to reflect on their future drilling plans, and I believe they will approach the recovery with a rational, methodical response in activity based on commodity price fluctuations.
Now looking ahead to the fourth quarter on North America land. Activity levels are difficult to call at this point. Based on current customer feedback, we remain cautious around customer activity due to holiday and seasonal weather-related downtimes. Our customers may take extended breaks starting as early as Thanksgiving and push additional work to the first quarter of 2017. As one customer told me, ""Dave, it doesn't make any sense for me to rent an efficient, high-spec rig if I have to start and stop all the time for the holidays or the last 5 weeks of the year. I just can't get the efficiencies I'm paying for in the rig. I'd rather just wait until next year to start drilling."" And I believe we'll see a lot of that mentality in the fourth quarter. But that being said, it does not change our view that things are getting better for us and our customers.
Now let's turn internationally. I like where our market share is today in the international markets, and I believe we continue to outperform our peers. I expect the international markets to slowly grind downward due to the lower commodity price environment. We experienced activity and pricing headwinds during the quarter. But in anticipation of those forces, we aggressively managed our costs. Although we have had to concede some on pricing, we have worked closely with our customers during the past year to improve their project economics through technology and operating efficiency. We expect to see a bottoming of the international rig count in the first half of 2017. Land-based mature field activity should lead the international recovery, while we expect the Deepwater complex to remain severely challenged for the foreseeable future. 
Even though the light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter, there is no question that we remain in a very challenging market. However, we are confident in our ability to navigate through this cycle and in our continued focus on unconventional mature fields and deepwater markets. As we have said before, unconventionals, particularly those in North America, are leading the recovery in activity, providing the optimal combination of short-cycle returns and fastest incremental barrel to market. Mature fields continue to be resilient, given their relatively low lifting costs. And finally, deepwater remains structurally challenged with higher costs and long-duration project characteristics. While each faces a different set of circumstances today, you can be sure we are looking at our business closely to ensure that we accelerate our growth in each sector as the industry begins to heal. As we have said for some time, North America has assumed the role of swing producer in global oil production. Because of the shift away from production discipline, which was historically created by OPEC, our industry will likely experience shorter commodity price cycles going forward. So we see the future market as a combination of shorter cycles and range-bound commodity prices. In that environment, it is imperative that returns-focused companies like Halliburton be more asset-light. Having an organization structured in a way that is flexible, nimble and efficient and that can adapt to these new quick-moving cycles will be critical to drive the returns results our shareholders have come to expect. 
Our philosophy has been in prioritizing returns over margins and revenue, and that philosophy will continue. Now don't get me wrong. We are always focused on improving margins. But keep in mind, the last cycle of $100 oil covered up terrible inefficiencies across the industry. In today's environment, asset utilization will be just as critical to improving margins, and I have full confidence we are taking the necessary steps to achieve that. Positioning us for success while navigating through this deep cyclical downturn was one of the most intellectually stimulating management challenges we have ever had, and I am confident the Halliburton management team has and will continue to successfully meet each and every challenge.
With that, let me turn the call over to Mark and Jeff to cover our financial and operational results. Mark?"

Let's start with a summary of our third quarter results compared to our second quarter results on an adjusted basis.

Let's start with a summary of our third quarter results compared to our second quarter results on an adjusted basis. Total company revenue for the quarter was flat at $3.8 billion, while our operating income doubled to $128 million. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in North America and the continued impact of our global cost savings initiatives. 
Moving to our regional results. North America revenue increased 9% with a $58 million increase in operating results or 47% sequentially. The higher U.S. land rig count, coupled with better equipment utilization and our ongoing cost management efforts, drove this improvement. 
In Latin America, revenue and operating income declined by 13% and 50%, respectively. These results primary reflect reduced activity levels in Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela as we've now experienced a 15-year low in the regional rig count. 
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS. Revenue declined 6% as a result of lower drilling activity in West Africa and Continental Europe. Operating income increased 19%, primarily related to our cost savings initiatives and improved pressure pumping and pipeline service profitability throughout the region. 
In Middle East/Asia, revenue declined 3% with a decline in operating income of 4%. The decrease for the quarter was primarily driven by reduced activity across Asia Pacific, including Australia and Indonesia, as well as pricing pressure across the entire region. 
Our Corporate and Other expense for the third quarter totaled approximately $47 million, which was positively impacted by a true-up of some of our insurance reserves. For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate expense to return to our previous run rate of approximately $60 million. Interest expense for the quarter was $141 million and was positively impacted by the interest income we're now earning on the Venezuelan promissory notes we accepted in exchange for some of our trade receivables last quarter. We expect that this level of net interest expense will be our new run rate for the next several quarters. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was a 114% benefit, well above the already unusual 50% rate we anticipated on our last call. As we've discussed before, these unusual effective tax rates are primarily the result of having tax losses in the U.S. that are offset by taxable income in foreign jurisdictions with lower statutory rates. However, the difference this quarter from the rate we anticipated was largely due to an adjustment reflecting the beneficial use of an Argentinian tax treaty that limits the taxation of royalty payments for intellectual property and will allow for more efficient movement of our foreign cash in the future. Based on our current outlook, we anticipate that our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter will be approximately 65%. 
Turning to cash flow. We improved our cash position during the third quarter, ending the period with $3.3 billion in cash and equivalents even after paying off $600 million of senior notes. This increase in cash flow was primarily due to working capital improvements, which included a 7-plus day reduction of our days sales outstanding and the receipt of a series of tax refunds. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be approximately $850 million.
Now turning to our short-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with our thoughts on the fourth quarter. In North America, the uncertainty surrounding customer activity around the holiday season makes the quarter difficult to predict. Based on what our customers are collectively telling us, we anticipate our revenue to perform in line with the rig count, and we expect our sequential incremental margins to be 35% to 40%. In our international business we believe the typical seasonal uptick in year-end software and product sales will be minimal this year as customer budgets are exhausted and may not fully offset continued pricing and activity pressures. As such, we expect fourth quarter revenue and margins to come in flat compared to the third quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?"
177698,378742760,1057002,"Halliburton Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2016",2016-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Halliburton Company","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank and congratulate all of our employees for their fantastic execution throughout the cycle. It's been a tough 2 years, and our organization has delivered on service quality, has delivered on cos",911,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to thank and congratulate all of our employees for their fantastic execution throughout the cycle. It's been a tough 2 years, and our organization has delivered on service quality, has delivered on cost savings and has absolutely executed on our value proposition, collaborating and engineering solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. The result of this execution was improved margins and repeat business. 
So let's start with North America. While the supply and demand balance for U.S. onshore services is heading in the right direction, we were still in an oversupplied equipment market. Our customers remained focused on cost and producing more barrels. I believe this puts us in an excellent position. No one is better at collaborating with customers to engineer solutions that deliver the lowest cost per BOE than Halliburton. In fact, the more I talk to customers, the more I'm convinced this is the winning formula. 
In pressure pumping, we estimate that the U.S. active fleet, I emphasize active, grew to over 7 million horsepower and the utilization of that active marketed fleet is about 70%. This is a long way from full capacity, but it represents substantial tightening during the third quarter. And as I said last quarter, this is the first step towards a balanced market for the industry's available fleet. And while we know the industry has additional horsepower on the sidelines that could come into the market, we also know that this additional equipment requires substantial maintenance to be put back to work and will require adequate price increases to justify its return. So as we look ahead, we expect pricing to work its way through a couple of predictable steps. The first step, which we're starting to see now, is a tightening of active capacity. This will have a modest price impact. But more importantly, it allows increased utilization to have a positive contribution to earnings. 
Step 2 is when we see equipment requiring significant investment returning to the market. I expect that this will require significantly higher pricing to justify the investment. This is by no means traditional pricing power. Instead, it's the industry recognizing the relationship between investments and returns. Let's hope. 
Market share is valuable, and that's why we build it in the downturn. I think Dave was crystal clear that our target is leading returns, and we have not forgotten that. High market share gives us choice in a recovery to work with the most efficient customers, who value what we do and who ultimately reward us for helping them make better wells. There is no doubt that in this environment, our clients are planning work based on commodity price. The stakes have never been higher for us to help maximize the value of their assets, and this is exactly what we're doing. 
So let me take you through some examples of how we're doing this today. Last quarter, we worked with a Permian operator who wanted to step outside of their core assets and find a way to optimize the value of their acreage. With a robust drilling and completion plan in place, the customer sought to minimize completion damage during flowback to maximize overall recovery. Through the use of our CALIBR Engineered Flowback Service, we were able to prevent damage and achieve a 15% higher cumulative production on this well than on wells nearby with similar completions. The well is now the best producer in the customer's portfolio despite it being in a geology that had been originally considered marginal. Now there's been a lot of talk about drilling in core reservoir rock recently. I believe it's now our job to help our customers extend the definition of core. This is a great example of how we listen to our customers' drivers and work with them to develop a unique solution to meet their goals. CALIBR had not been used before in the Permian, but thanks to this success it's gained traction in that basin. 
In the Middle East, we recently engaged in a highly collaborative project where the customer's drivers were to improve delivery time and production. We developed a solution that stimulated a well in less time and in a more cost-effective manner. Using our surgi [ph] squeeze technique, where coil tubing is used to deliver a more focused stimulation to selective areas, we were able to use fewer chemicals and reduce pumping time by 40%. This highlights how Halliburton systematically collaborates with the customer to engineer a solution that maximizes their asset value. 
In Brazil, we worked to maximize our customers' asset value through intelligent completions. These are essential in the pre-salt area to improve reservoir management and production while reducing the overall well cost. In the quarter, we completed a multiyear campaign of 40 successful intelligent completions, which lowered the lifting cost dramatically. This is what clients like about Halliburton. We collaborate, meaning listen and respond to our customers. We focus on creating and maintaining strong client relationships. It's why we win and keep work. It's how we get things done and why we are the execution company. 
To sum up, I've walked through our value proposition in action, and it's equally effective in all of our strategic markets: unconventionals, mature fields and deepwater. The takeaway is that Halliburton is well positioned to win the recovery in each of these markets.
Now I'll turn the call over to Dave for closing comments. Dave?"

As we predicted, the North America unconventional market has responded the quickest, demonstrated by the increase in recent rig count activity. However, we continue to believe meaningful activity increases from our customers will not start until we see sustainable commodity prices above $50 per barrel. And while the international markets will take a little more time to rebound, we are maintaining our integrated global services footprint, managing costs and continuing to fight for market share. We expect to see the bottom for activity in this market to occur in the first half of 2017. In this global recovery, we expect cycle times to accelerate. I believe successful companies will be characterized by a lighter asset base, faster asset velocity and job site execution all geared to respond quickly to deliver returns. So to me, no matter what market is handed to us, Halliburton is well positioned, and our dedication to execution gives me confidence that we will continue to outperform our peers.
With that, let's open it up for questions."

So we're just trying to draw a little bit of caution out there that there's probably more variables in this Q4 than typically there might be because we're bouncing off the bottom at this point in time."

I never thought I would be so satisfied by barely making a profit. But given where this market is, I certainly am. Through hard work and determination, we have returned to positive territory for our earnings. Now this has been a historic down cycle for the industry, and it's had its fair share of challenges. Our organization is meeting those challenges head on and fighting through them. I am very proud of our leadership in all of our employees. We are the execution company, and I believe this quarter, we outexecuted even the very high expectations we place on our organization.
Let's take a minute and talk about what transpired over the quarter. Our North America revenue grew 9% for the period, representing the first revenue increase in 7 quarters. Our results improved as we took advantage of the rig count growth by focusing on increasing utilization and working our surface efficiency model. Our customers' animal spirits remain alive and well in North America even though for some, they may feel caged in a bit by cash flow constraints in the short term. The average U.S. rig count increased 14% over the quarter, driven primarily by rig additions to smaller operators where we saw a trend of less service-intensive wells, which is not activity typically worth chasing at today's pricing. This quarter was also impacted by the natural lag time between drilling and completion activity. However, we are now seeing completion activity starting to pick up as we start the fourth quarter. 
We continue to aggressively implement our structural cost reductions announced in our first quarter call, and we have met our goal. On a monthly basis, we have already achieved the run rate of $1 billion of cost savings annually. We also generated over $1 billion in cash flow from operating activities this quarter. As you all know, as we executed our playbook, we gained significant market share globally through the downturn. As the market stabilized, our primary focus will now switch to improving our margins while maintaining that market share. In the U.S., we believe we now have the highest market share we've ever had. And at this point, if we have to give some of it back to move margins up, we might take that approach.
In North America, we achieved a 41% incremental margin. This is a strong step in the right direction as we work to regain profitability there. We remain steadfast in our belief that significant activity increases from our customers starts with sustainable commodity prices over $50 per barrel, which we haven't seen in any meaningful way yet since the rig count activity bottomed out. Operators have had time to reflect on their future drilling plans, and I believe they will approach the recovery with a rational, methodical response in activity based on commodity price fluctuations.
Now looking ahead to the fourth quarter on North America land. Activity levels are difficult to call at this point. Based on current customer feedback, we remain cautious around customer activity due to holiday and seasonal weather-related downtimes. Our customers may take extended breaks starting as early as Thanksgiving and push additional work to the first quarter of 2017. As one customer told me, ""Dave, it doesn't make any sense for me to rent an efficient, high-spec rig if I have to start and stop all the time for the holidays or the last 5 weeks of the year. I just can't get the efficiencies I'm paying for in the rig. I'd rather just wait until next year to start drilling."" And I believe we'll see a lot of that mentality in the fourth quarter. But that being said, it does not change our view that things are getting better for us and our customers.
Now let's turn internationally. I like where our market share is today in the international markets, and I believe we continue to outperform our peers. I expect the international markets to slowly grind downward due to the lower commodity price environment. We experienced activity and pricing headwinds during the quarter. But in anticipation of those forces, we aggressively managed our costs. Although we have had to concede some on pricing, we have worked closely with our customers during the past year to improve their project economics through technology and operating efficiency. We expect to see a bottoming of the international rig count in the first half of 2017. Land-based mature field activity should lead the international recovery, while we expect the Deepwater complex to remain severely challenged for the foreseeable future. 
Even though the light at the end of the tunnel is getting brighter, there is no question that we remain in a very challenging market. However, we are confident in our ability to navigate through this cycle and in our continued focus on unconventional mature fields and deepwater markets. As we have said before, unconventionals, particularly those in North America, are leading the recovery in activity, providing the optimal combination of short-cycle returns and fastest incremental barrel to market. Mature fields continue to be resilient, given their relatively low lifting costs. And finally, deepwater remains structurally challenged with higher costs and long-duration project characteristics. While each faces a different set of circumstances today, you can be sure we are looking at our business closely to ensure that we accelerate our growth in each sector as the industry begins to heal. As we have said for some time, North America has assumed the role of swing producer in global oil production. Because of the shift away from production discipline, which was historically created by OPEC, our industry will likely experience shorter commodity price cycles going forward. So we see the future market as a combination of shorter cycles and range-bound commodity prices. In that environment, it is imperative that returns-focused companies like Halliburton be more asset-light. Having an organization structured in a way that is flexible, nimble and efficient and that can adapt to these new quick-moving cycles will be critical to drive the returns results our shareholders have come to expect. 
Our philosophy has been in prioritizing returns over margins and revenue, and that philosophy will continue. Now don't get me wrong. We are always focused on improving margins. But keep in mind, the last cycle of $100 oil covered up terrible inefficiencies across the industry. In today's environment, asset utilization will be just as critical to improving margins, and I have full confidence we are taking the necessary steps to achieve that. Positioning us for success while navigating through this deep cyclical downturn was one of the most intellectually stimulating management challenges we have ever had, and I am confident the Halliburton management team has and will continue to successfully meet each and every challenge.
With that, let me turn the call over to Mark and Jeff to cover our financial and operational results. Mark?"

Let's start with a summary of our third quarter results compared to our second quarter results on an adjusted basis. Total company revenue for the quarter was flat at $3.8 billion, while our operating income doubled to $128 million. These results were primarily driven by increased activity in North America and the continued impact of our global cost savings initiatives. 
Moving to our regional results. North America revenue increased 9% with a $58 million increase in operating results or 47% sequentially. The higher U.S. land rig count, coupled with better equipment utilization and our ongoing cost management efforts, drove this improvement. 
In Latin America, revenue and operating income declined by 13% and 50%, respectively. These results primary reflect reduced activity levels in Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela as we've now experienced a 15-year low in the regional rig count. 
Turning to Europe/Africa/CIS. Revenue declined 6% as a result of lower drilling activity in West Africa and Continental Europe. Operating income increased 19%, primarily related to our cost savings initiatives and improved pressure pumping and pipeline service profitability throughout the region. 
In Middle East/Asia, revenue declined 3% with a decline in operating income of 4%. The decrease for the quarter was primarily driven by reduced activity across Asia Pacific, including Australia and Indonesia, as well as pricing pressure across the entire region. 
Our Corporate and Other expense for the third quarter totaled approximately $47 million, which was positively impacted by a true-up of some of our insurance reserves. For the fourth quarter, we expect our corporate expense to return to our previous run rate of approximately $60 million. Interest expense for the quarter was $141 million and was positively impacted by the interest income we're now earning on the Venezuelan promissory notes we accepted in exchange for some of our trade receivables last quarter. We expect that this level of net interest expense will be our new run rate for the next several quarters. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was a 114% benefit, well above the already unusual 50% rate we anticipated on our last call. As we've discussed before, these unusual effective tax rates are primarily the result of having tax losses in the U.S. that are offset by taxable income in foreign jurisdictions with lower statutory rates. However, the difference this quarter from the rate we anticipated was largely due to an adjustment reflecting the beneficial use of an Argentinian tax treaty that limits the taxation of royalty payments for intellectual property and will allow for more efficient movement of our foreign cash in the future. Based on our current outlook, we anticipate that our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter will be approximately 65%. 
Turning to cash flow. We improved our cash position during the third quarter, ending the period with $3.3 billion in cash and equivalents even after paying off $600 million of senior notes. This increase in cash flow was primarily due to working capital improvements, which included a 7-plus day reduction of our days sales outstanding and the receipt of a series of tax refunds. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be approximately $850 million.
Now turning to our short-term operational outlook. Let me provide you with our thoughts on the fourth quarter. In North America, the uncertainty surrounding customer activity around the holiday season makes the quarter difficult to predict. Based on what our customers are collectively telling us, we anticipate our revenue to perform in line with the rig count, and we expect our sequential incremental margins to be 35% to 40%. In our international business we believe the typical seasonal uptick in year-end software and product sales will be minimal this year as customer budgets are exhausted and may not fully offset continued pricing and activity pressures. As such, we expect fourth quarter revenue and margins to come in flat compared to the third quarter.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the operational update. Jeff?"

I'd like to thank and congratulate all of our employees for their fantastic execution throughout the cycle.

I'd like to thank and congratulate all of our employees for their fantastic execution throughout the cycle. It's been a tough 2 years, and our organization has delivered on service quality, has delivered on cost savings and has absolutely executed on our value proposition, collaborating and engineering solutions to maximize asset value for our customers. The result of this execution was improved margins and repeat business. 
So let's start with North America. While the supply and demand balance for U.S. onshore services is heading in the right direction, we were still in an oversupplied equipment market. Our customers remained focused on cost and producing more barrels. I believe this puts us in an excellent position. No one is better at collaborating with customers to engineer solutions that deliver the lowest cost per BOE than Halliburton. In fact, the more I talk to customers, the more I'm convinced this is the winning formula. 
In pressure pumping, we estimate that the U.S. active fleet, I emphasize active, grew to over 7 million horsepower and the utilization of that active marketed fleet is about 70%. This is a long way from full capacity, but it represents substantial tightening during the third quarter. And as I said last quarter, this is the first step towards a balanced market for the industry's available fleet. And while we know the industry has additional horsepower on the sidelines that could come into the market, we also know that this additional equipment requires substantial maintenance to be put back to work and will require adequate price increases to justify its return. So as we look ahead, we expect pricing to work its way through a couple of predictable steps. The first step, which we're starting to see now, is a tightening of active capacity. This will have a modest price impact. But more importantly, it allows increased utilization to have a positive contribution to earnings. 
Step 2 is when we see equipment requiring significant investment returning to the market. I expect that this will require significantly higher pricing to justify the investment. This is by no means traditional pricing power. Instead, it's the industry recognizing the relationship between investments and returns. Let's hope. 
Market share is valuable, and that's why we build it in the downturn. I think Dave was crystal clear that our target is leading returns, and we have not forgotten that. High market share gives us choice in a recovery to work with the most efficient customers, who value what we do and who ultimately reward us for helping them make better wells. There is no doubt that in this environment, our clients are planning work based on commodity price. The stakes have never been higher for us to help maximize the value of their assets, and this is exactly what we're doing. 
So let me take you through some examples of how we're doing this today. Last quarter, we worked with a Permian operator who wanted to step outside of their core assets and find a way to optimize the value of their acreage. With a robust drilling and completion plan in place, the customer sought to minimize completion damage during flowback to maximize overall recovery. Through the use of our CALIBR Engineered Flowback Service, we were able to prevent damage and achieve a 15% higher cumulative production on this well than on wells nearby with similar completions. The well is now the best producer in the customer's portfolio despite it being in a geology that had been originally considered marginal. Now there's been a lot of talk about drilling in core reservoir rock recently. I believe it's now our job to help our customers extend the definition of core. This is a great example of how we listen to our customers' drivers and work with them to develop a unique solution to meet their goals. CALIBR had not been used before in the Permian, but thanks to this success it's gained traction in that basin. 
In the Middle East, we recently engaged in a highly collaborative project where the customer's drivers were to improve delivery time and production. We developed a solution that stimulated a well in less time and in a more cost-effective manner. Using our surgi [ph] squeeze technique, where coil tubing is used to deliver a more focused stimulation to selective areas, we were able to use fewer chemicals and reduce pumping time by 40%. This highlights how Halliburton systematically collaborates with the customer to engineer a solution that maximizes their asset value. 
In Brazil, we worked to maximize our customers' asset value through intelligent completions. These are essential in the pre-salt area to improve reservoir management and production while reducing the overall well cost. In the quarter, we completed a multiyear campaign of 40 successful intelligent completions, which lowered the lifting cost dramatically. This is what clients like about Halliburton. We collaborate, meaning listen and respond to our customers. We focus on creating and maintaining strong client relationships. It's why we win and keep work. It's how we get things done and why we are the execution company. 
To sum up, I've walked through our value proposition in action, and it's equally effective in all of our strategic markets: unconventionals, mature fields and deepwater. The takeaway is that Halliburton is well positioned to win the recovery in each of these markets.
Now I'll turn the call over to Dave for closing comments. Dave?"

But when I think about the longer-term future, where does it go, the key point is controlling the frac, in our view. And that's why we study chemistry. And we think that it's not one-size-fits-all. It's actually what is the right size for that rock, and that's why we are dead focused on making better wells."
