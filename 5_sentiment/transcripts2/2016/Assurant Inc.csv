We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and year-end 2015 results with you today.
Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release announcing our fourth quarter and year-end 2015 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
Beginning in the second quarter 2015, we revised the presentation of Assurant's results to reflect our focus on housing and lifestyle specialty offerings. As a reminder, results for Assurant Health runoff operations are included only in net income and are no longer reflected in net operating income. We will continue to report Assurant Employee Benefits under operating results until the sale of that business is closed.
Today's call will contain other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted at assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with brief remarks from Alan and Chris before moving to Q&A.
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports including our 2014 and upcoming 2015 Form 10k. Now I will turn the call over to Alan."

Our performance in the fourth quarter fell short of our expectations and is disappointing. Results were marked by profit declines in both mobile and lender-placed insurance as well as some unusual items, which Chris will detail later. We are taking actions to address this weaker short-term performance as we execute our multiyear transformation and continue to deploy capital to create long-term value for shareholders.
While 2016 will be a transitional year, we are confident the underlying potential of our core housing and lifestyle businesses is strong. 
During 2015, we made significant progress to realign our strategic focus and position Assurant for long-term profitable growth. For example, the sale of Assurant Employee Benefits to Sun Life Financial will provide Assurant with about $1 billion of net proceeds including capital releases and is expected to close by the end of the first quarter.
The exit of our health insurance operations remains on track. All of our Affordable Care Act, or ACA individual medical policies, lapsed as of January 1, 2016. This allows us to celebrate the wind down and begin to release the capital that supports that business.
During the fourth quarter, we also focused on the go forward organizational framework that will support profitable growth. We're realigning talent and moving to an integrated enterprise operating model to be more agile and cost-efficient worldwide.
The external searches for Chris' successor as CFO and for a Chief Technology Officer are moving ahead. We expect to fill these roles in the coming months. Once leaders are in place, we will further integrate their respective teams resulting in better ordination and greater efficiencies over time.
All of these steps are critical in our multiyear transformation to build a stronger Assurant for the future. 
Now I'll offer some business highlights both for the quarter and the year, which reinforce our confidence in the future.
At Assurant Solutions, we continued to strengthen our competitive position in the mobile industry where we now protect more than 29 million devices worldwide. During the fourth quarter, we introduced new upgrade and device buyback programs for telephonic in Spain and expanded our relationship with their brand in Chile. While the contribution from these new relationships are initially small, they are important drivers in the global expansion of our Connected Living business and will help us to deliver 10% average annual growth in earnings long term. 
We recognize the growth also would require additional investments, both in the U.S. and internationally. As an example, last year, we increased our staff significantly within our repair and logistics operations. This allowed us to process more than 8 million mobile devices in the U.S. Investments in our capabilities and infrastructure will be critically important to increase capacity and capture share in this dynamic market.
At Assurant Specialty Property, we made significant progress transforming our lender-placed platform as that business normalizes. These efforts will help us maintain our strong customer service and leadership position while we also generate savings in 2016 and beyond.
We're especially pleased with the contributions of our targeted housing businesses, where we continue to leverage our deep industry expertise and capabilities to increase revenue and profitability.
For example, multi-family housing revenue increased 22% in 2015 and accounted for $280 million of premiums and fees. We increased our share of wallet with Affinity Partners and added several new national property manager relationships.
Similarly, our mortgage solutions business captured share and generated nearly $290 million of fee income for the year. Currently, we provide valuation or property preservation services to 7 of the top 10 servicers and 5 of the top 10 mortgage originators. We believe there are significant opportunities to cross sell additional offerings and grow with existing and new clients.
In the year ahead, we will continue to invest in multifamily housing and mortgage Solutions as targeted areas for growth. In both of these businesses, we are well positioned for the future.
Now I'll highlight overall results for full year 2015, which exclude the health runoff operations. 
Operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 11.3% reflecting lower earnings, especially Property and Solutions.
Total revenue for 2015 was $7.3 billion, a 4% decrease from 2014. Despite this decline, we're pleased that our targeted growth areas, including mobile, multi-family housing, and mortgage solutions now account for $1.6 billion of revenue, a 16% increase from 2014. These constitute primarily fee-based or capital light businesses that comment our specialty risk offerings.
In 2015, we also continue to generate strong cash flows driven by Specialty Property and Solutions, which provided approximately $600 million of dividends, almost 120% of their combined earnings. This allowed us to invest in our Housing and Lifestyle offerings, capitalize the wind down of Health, and still return $380 million to shareholders. 
Looking ahead, we are focused on executing our transformation to build a stronger Assurant for the future. This year, we expect to complete our portfolio realignment and establish our new organizational framework. The ongoing normalization of lender-placed, declines in nongrowth areas, and variability in foreign exchange, will however present headwinds. We are taking additional steps to position the company for profitable growth in 2017 and beyond.
The proceeds from the sale of Employee Benefits, dividends from Health, and cash flow from our ongoing businesses will provide significant financial disability. With this capital, we'll be able to fund meaningful investments to build our global lifestyle and housing offerings and continue to return capital to our shareholders.
We are also identifying opportunities to increase operating efficiencies. Last month, for example, we announced within Assurant that we are freezing our pension plan effective March 1. This action will generate annual pretax savings of about $35 million.
In addition, we will take other actions to integrate our support functions and further streamline our operations to reduce expenses over time. I want to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment to our strategic transformation.
In the short period of time, we have made significant progress. And while there is more work ahead, I'm proud of what we've accomplished and I'm confident in our future. 
And now, I'll turn to Chris who will review results for the quarter in more detail. Chris?"
4026111,321840772,930019,"Assurant Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2016",2016-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. I'll start with Solutions.

Nearly 2/3 of the decline was driven by weaker than expected mobile results. This included the loss of the tablet program referenced in prior quarters and $6 million of higher expenses to support existing programs and new launches expected this year. These factors along with lower production from North American retailers and continued runoff in the credit business, also contributed to poor performance in the quarter. 
In addition, Solutions fourth quarter included a few unusual items. We recorded $8 million of prior period accounting adjustments related to the overstatement of mobile inventory and account receivables in our legacy warranty business. This represented a cumulative adjustments with no material impact to any previous periods. Foreign exchange also created a significant headwind in the quarter, including foreign exchange losses on intercompany balances with both Latin America and Europe. The accounting adjustments and foreign-exchange losses were nearly offset by a year-over-year decrease in legal reserves following a preliminary decision of an outstanding U.K. regulatory matter.
Turning to revenue. Solutions revenue was flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Premiums were down modestly due to foreign exchange pressures, the loss of the tablet program, and declines in runoff business. Fee income, now nearly 25% of Solutions quarterly revenue, increased significantly as we expanded our mobile administration and repair offerings.
Looking ahead, despite recent weakness, we remain optimistic about the future prospects of Solutions. Based on current estimates, we expect earnings growth in 2016. This will, however, be more heavily weighted toward the second half of the year due to the launch of new mobile programs, improved international profitability and additional expense initiatives.
Next, let's look at Specialty Property. Excluding the divestiture of American Reliable, or ARIC, net operating income decreased $7 million to $58 million. Results reflect the ongoing normalization of lender-placed, the previously disclosed loss of client business and an increase in legal expenses. This was partially offset by lower reinsurance cost due to our declining exposure as well as favorable non cat loss experience.
Also excluding ARIC, fourth quarter net earned premiums were down 8% from 2014 primarily due to a 30 basis point decline in the placement rate, which includes the previously disclosed loss of client business.
While overall revenue at Specialty Property decreased, targeted growth areas contributed $157 million of premiums and fee income in the quarter, up 22% from last year driven by mortgage solutions and multi-family housing.
For the quarter, Specialty Property's total expense ratio increased 670 basis points year-over-year. Around 570 basis points of the change was driven primarily by lower premiums and higher legal costs related to outstanding matters. The remaining 100 basis points is due to growth of the fee-based business.
Total expenses in absolute dollars declined modestly year-over-year reflecting the impact of expense management initiatives already underway. We expect additional savings in 2016 as we further transform our lender-placed platform including the implementation of new technology to further enhance efficiency and customer service.
With the continued normalization of lender-placed, we expect additional reductions in Specialty Property's revenue and earnings this year. Actions are underway to transform our operating platform and diversify our mix of business, which will help us maintain attractive returns.
Turning to Employee Benefits. Fourth quarter earnings increased to $15 million driven by favorable disability and life experience. Net earned premiums and fee income increased slightly compared to the fourth quarter 2014 as growth in Voluntary more than offset expected declines in true group disability. 
As Alan mentioned, we expect to close the sale of this business by the end of the first quarter. We have received the majority of required state regulatory approvals and are moving toward closing.
At Health runoff operations, the segment reported a fourth quarter net loss of $16 million in line with our estimates. This included $11 million in severance-related costs and other indirect expenses not included in the previously established premium deficiency reserves.
During the quarter, we had a $250 million net infusion into Health to ensure adequate levels of statutory surplus and fund estimated exit related charges and claims through the wind down process. 
We now expect the dividend $475 million from Health during 2016 with additional modest dividends expected in 2017. This is subject to regulatory approval, any significant changes in claims experienced and the final payments from the 2015 risk mitigation programs. 
So far, preliminary claims development in January for 2015 policies continues to track our estimates. As of December 31, we received all expected cash payments for the 2014 ACA risk mitigation programs. For 2015 policies, we booked an additional $150 [ph] million in the quarter related to the reinsurance and risk adjustment programs.  This brings the total amount accrued to $522 million. Reimbursements for 2015 recoverables will be paid in various installments starting at the end of March.
Moving to corporate, we ended 2015 with $210 million in deployable capital. During the fourth quarter, we paid $33 million in shareholder dividends reflecting our increased payout and we repurchased $74 million worth of stock. Overall, for the full year 2015, the company repurchased 4.2 million shares or nearly 6% of our common stock outstanding. This year through February 5, we repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares for $90 million. We believe the stock remains attractively priced.
Based on our current estimates, 2016 dividends from Assurant Solutions and Specialty Property should approximate total segment operating earnings. In addition, proceeds from the sale of Employee Benefits and dividends from Health will provide us with nearly $1.5 billion of deployable capital for the benefit of shareholders. As always, all dividends are subject to rating agency approval.
The corporate loss for the quarter increased $11 million to $31 million reflecting an expected reversal of a tax benefit recorded in the first half of the year as well as $3.5 million of severance and other strategic repositioning costs. This year, we expect the corporate loss to approximate $70 million. We will work to eliminate residual expenses from Health and Employee Benefits and implement other initiatives so that we can exit the year at a lower run rate.
For sure and overall, we are committed to executing our transformation strategy and positioning Housing and Lifestyle for profitable growth long term. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

We did take the decision to freeze the pension plan, was designed to help offset some of those stranded costs. And then of course, all of the transformation work that's underway is also designed to not just absorb stranded overhead that we're going to see coming out of Health and Benefits but also to better position the company going forward to be more agile but then also, and more efficient in terms of support functions."

We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and year-end 2015 results with you today.
Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release announcing our fourth quarter and year-end 2015 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
Beginning in the second quarter 2015, we revised the presentation of Assurant's results to reflect our focus on housing and lifestyle specialty offerings. As a reminder, results for Assurant Health runoff operations are included only in net income and are no longer reflected in net operating income. We will continue to report Assurant Employee Benefits under operating results until the sale of that business is closed.
Today's call will contain other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted at assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with brief remarks from Alan and Chris before moving to Q&A.
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports including our 2014 and upcoming 2015 Form 10k.

Our performance in the fourth quarter fell short of our expectations and is disappointing. Results were marked by profit declines in both mobile and lender-placed insurance as well as some unusual items, which Chris will detail later. We are taking actions to address this weaker short-term performance as we execute our multiyear transformation and continue to deploy capital to create long-term value for shareholders.
While 2016 will be a transitional year, we are confident the underlying potential of our core housing and lifestyle businesses is strong. 
During 2015, we made significant progress to realign our strategic focus and position Assurant for long-term profitable growth. For example, the sale of Assurant Employee Benefits to Sun Life Financial will provide Assurant with about $1 billion of net proceeds including capital releases and is expected to close by the end of the first quarter.
The exit of our health insurance operations remains on track. All of our Affordable Care Act, or ACA individual major medical policies, lapsed as of January 1, 2016. This allows us to accelerate the wind down and begin to release the capital that supports that business.
During the fourth quarter, we also focused on the go-forward organizational framework that will support profitable growth. We're realigning talent and moving to an integrated enterprise operating model to be more agile and cost-efficient worldwide.
The external searches for Chris' successor as CFO and for a Chief Technology Officer are moving ahead. We expect to fill these roles in the coming months. Once leaders are in place, we will further integrate their respective teams resulting in better coordination and greater efficiencies over time.
All of these steps are critical in our multiyear transformation to build a stronger Assurant for the future. 
Now I'll offer some business highlights both for the quarter and the year, which reinforce our confidence in the future.
At Assurant Solutions, we continue to strengthen our competitive position in the mobile industry where we now protect more than 29 million devices worldwide. During the fourth quarter, we introduced new upgrade and device buyback programs for Telefonica in Spain and expanded our relationship with their Mobistar brand in Chile. While the contribution from these new relationships are initially small, they are important drivers in the global expansion of our Connected Living business and will help us to deliver 10% average annual growth in earnings long term. 
We recognize the growth also will require additional investments, both in the U.S. and internationally. As an example, last year, we increased our staff significantly within our repair and logistics operations. This allowed us to process more than 8 million mobile devices in the U.S. Investments in our capabilities and infrastructure will be critically important to increase capacity and capture share in this dynamic market.
At Assurant Specialty Property, we made significant progress transforming our lender-placed platform as that business normalizes. These efforts will help us maintain our strong customer service and leadership position while we also generate savings in 2016 and beyond.
We're especially pleased with the contributions of our targeted housing businesses, where we continue to leverage our deep industry expertise and capabilities to increase revenue and profitability.
For example, multi-family housing revenue increased 22% in 2015 and accounted for $280 million of premiums and fees. We increased our share of wallet with Affinity Partners and added several new national property manager relationships.
Similarly, our mortgage solutions business captured share and generated nearly $290 million of fee income for the year. Currently, we provide valuation or property preservation services to 7 of the top 10 servicers and 5 of the top 10 mortgage originators. We believe there are significant opportunities to cross sell additional offerings and grow with existing and new clients.
In the year ahead, we will continue to invest in multifamily housing and mortgage solutions as targeted areas for growth. In both of these businesses, we are well positioned for the future.
Now I'll highlight overall results for full year 2015, which exclude the health runoff operations. 
Operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 11.3% reflecting lower earnings, especially Property and Solutions.
Total revenue for 2015 was $7.3 billion, a 4% decrease from 2014. Despite this decline, we're pleased that our targeted growth areas, including mobile, multi-family housing, and mortgage solutions now account for $1.6 billion of revenue, a 16% increase from 2014. These constitute primarily fee-based or capital light businesses that complement our specialty risk offerings.
In 2015, we also continue to generate strong cash flows driven by Specialty Property and Solutions, which provided approximately $600 million of dividends, almost 120% of their combined earnings. This allowed us to invest in our Housing and Lifestyle offerings, capitalize the wind down of Health, and still return $380 million to shareholders. 
Looking ahead, we are focused on executing our transformation to build a stronger Assurant for the future. This year, we expect to complete our portfolio realignment and establish our new organizational framework. The ongoing normalization of lender-placed, declines in nongrowth areas, and variability in foreign exchange, will however present headwinds. We are taking additional steps to position the company for profitable growth in 2017 and beyond.
The proceeds from the sale of Employee Benefits, dividends from Health, and cash flow from our ongoing businesses will provide significant financial flexibility. With this capital, we'll be able to fund meaningful investments to build our global lifestyle and housing offerings and continue to return capital to our shareholders.
We are also identifying opportunities to increase operating efficiencies. Last month, for example, we announced within Assurant that we are freezing our pension plan effective March 1. This action will generate annual pretax savings of about $35 million.
In addition, we will take other actions to integrate our support functions and further streamline our operations to reduce expenses over time. I want to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment to our strategic transformation.
In a short period of time, we have made significant progress. And while there is more work ahead, I'm proud of what we've accomplished and I'm confident in our future. 
And now, I'll turn to Chris who will review results for the quarter in more detail. Chris?"

This represented a cumulative adjustment with no material impact to any previous periods. Foreign exchange also created a significant headwind in the quarter, including foreign exchange losses on intercompany balances with both Latin America and Europe. The accounting adjustments and foreign-exchange losses were nearly offset by a year-over-year decrease in legal reserves following a preliminary decision of an outstanding U.K. regulatory matter.
Turning to revenue. Solutions revenue was flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Premiums were down modestly due to foreign exchange pressures, the loss of the tablet program, and declines in runoff business. Fee income, now nearly 25% of Solutions quarterly revenue, increased significantly as we expanded our mobile administration and repair offerings.
Looking ahead, despite recent weakness, we remain optimistic about the future prospects of Solutions. Based on current estimates, we expect earnings growth in 2016. This will, however, be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year due to the launch of new mobile programs, improved international profitability and additional expense initiatives.
Next, let's look at Specialty Property. Excluding the divestiture of American Reliable, or ARIC, net operating income decreased $7 million to $58 million. Results reflect the ongoing normalization of lender-placed, the previously disclosed loss of client business and an increase in legal expenses. This was partially offset by lower reinsurance cost due to our declining exposure as well as favorable non-cat loss experience.
Also excluding ARIC, fourth quarter net earned premiums were down 8% from 2014 primarily due to a 30 basis point decline in the placement rate, which includes the previously disclosed loss of client business.
While overall revenue at Specialty Property decreased, targeted growth areas contributed $157 million of premiums and fee income in the quarter, up 22% from last year driven by mortgage solutions and multi-family housing.
For the quarter, Specialty Property's total expense ratio increased 670 basis points year-over-year. Around 570 basis points of the change was driven primarily by lower premiums and higher legal costs related to outstanding matters. The remaining 100 basis points is due to growth of the fee-based business.
Total expenses in absolute dollars declined modestly year-over-year reflecting the impact of expense management initiatives already underway. We expect additional savings in 2016 as we further transform our lender-placed platform including the implementation of new technology to further enhance efficiency and customer service.
With the continued normalization of lender-placed, we expect additional reductions in Specialty Property's revenue and earnings this year. Actions are underway to transform our operating platform and diversify our mix of business, which will help us maintain attractive returns.
Turning to Employee Benefits. Fourth quarter earnings increased to $15 million driven by favorable disability and life experience. Net earned premiums and fee income increased slightly compared to the fourth quarter 2014 as growth in Voluntary more than offset expected declines in true group disability. 
As Alan mentioned, we expect to close the sale of this business by the end of the first quarter. We have received a majority of required state regulatory approvals and are moving toward closing.
At Health runoff operations, the segment reported a fourth quarter net loss of $16 million in line with our estimates. This included $11 million in severance-related costs and other indirect expenses not included in the previously established premium deficiency reserves.
During the quarter, we had a $250 million net infusion into Health to ensure adequate levels of statutory surplus and fund estimated exit related charges and claims through the wind down process. 
We now expect a dividend of $475 million from Health during 2016 with additional modest dividends expected in 2017. This is subject to regulatory approval, any significant changes in claims experienced and the final payments from the 2015 risk mitigation programs. 
So far, preliminary claims development in January for 2015 policies continues to track our estimates. As of December 31, we received all expected cash payments for the 2014 ACA risk mitigation programs. For 2015 policies, we booked an additional $150 million in the quarter related to the reinsurance and risk adjustment programs.  This brings the total amount accrued to $522 million. Reimbursements for 2015 recoverables will be paid in various installments starting at the end of March.
Moving to corporate, we ended 2015 with $210 million in deployable capital. During the fourth quarter, we paid $33 million in shareholder dividends reflecting our increased payout and we repurchased $74 million worth of stock. Overall, for the full year 2015, the company repurchased 4.2 million shares or nearly 6% of our common stock outstanding. This year through February 5, we repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares for $90 million. We believe the stock remains attractively priced.
Based on our current estimates, 2016 dividends from Assurant Solutions and Specialty Property should approximate total segment operating earnings. In addition, proceeds from the sale of Employee Benefits and dividends from Health will provide us with nearly $1.5 billion of deployable capital for the benefit of shareholders. As always, all dividends are subject to rating agency approval.
The corporate loss for the quarter increased $11 million to $31 million reflecting an expected reversal of a tax benefit recorded in the first half of the year as well as $3.5 million of severance and other strategic repositioning costs. This year, we expect the corporate loss to approximate $70 million. We will work to eliminate residual expenses from Health and Employee Benefits and implement other initiatives so that we can exit the year at a lower run rate.
For Assurant overall, we are committed to executing our transformation strategy and positioning Housing and Lifestyle for profitable growth long term. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and year-end 2015 results with you today.
Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release announcing our fourth quarter and year-end 2015 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
Beginning in the second quarter 2015, we revised the presentation of Assurant's results to reflect our focus on housing and lifestyle specialty offerings. As a reminder, results for Assurant Health runoff operations are included only in net income and are no longer reflected in net operating income. We will continue to report Assurant Employee Benefits under operating results until the sale of that business is closed.
Today's call will contain other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted at assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with brief remarks from Alan and Chris before moving to Q&A.
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports including our 2014 and upcoming 2015 Form 10k. Now I will turn the call over to Alan."

Our performance in the fourth quarter fell short of our expectations and is disappointing. Results were marked by profit declines in both mobile and lender-placed insurance as well as some unusual items, which Chris will detail later. We are taking actions to address this weaker short-term performance as we execute our multiyear transformation and continue to deploy capital to create long-term value for shareholders.
While 2016 will be a transitional year, we are confident the underlying potential of our core housing and lifestyle businesses is strong. 
During 2015, we made significant progress to realign our strategic focus and position Assurant for long-term profitable growth. For example, the sale of Assurant Employee Benefits to Sun Life Financial will provide Assurant with about $1 billion of net proceeds including capital releases and is expected to close by the end of the first quarter.
The exit of our health insurance operations remains on track. All of our Affordable Care Act, or ACA individual major medical policies, lapsed as of January 1, 2016. This allows us to accelerate the wind down and begin to release the capital that supports that business.
During the fourth quarter, we also focused on the go-forward organizational framework that will support profitable growth. We're realigning talent and moving to an integrated enterprise operating model to be more agile and cost-efficient worldwide.
The external searches for Chris' successor as CFO and for a Chief Technology Officer are moving ahead. We expect to fill these roles in the coming months. Once leaders are in place, we will further integrate their respective teams resulting in better coordination and greater efficiencies over time.
All of these steps are critical in our multiyear transformation to build a stronger Assurant for the future. 
Now I'll offer some business highlights both for the quarter and the year, which reinforce our confidence in the future.
At Assurant Solutions, we continue to strengthen our competitive position in the mobile industry where we now protect more than 29 million devices worldwide. During the fourth quarter, we introduced new upgrade and device buyback programs for Telefonica in Spain and expanded our relationship with their Mobistar brand in Chile. While the contribution from these new relationships are initially small, they are important drivers in the global expansion of our Connected Living business and will help us to deliver 10% average annual growth in earnings long term. 
We recognize the growth also will require additional investments, both in the U.S. and internationally. As an example, last year, we increased our staff significantly within our repair and logistics operations. This allowed us to process more than 8 million mobile devices in the U.S. Investments in our capabilities and infrastructure will be critically important to increase capacity and capture share in this dynamic market.
At Assurant Specialty Property, we made significant progress transforming our lender-placed platform as that business normalizes. These efforts will help us maintain our strong customer service and leadership position while we also generate savings in 2016 and beyond.
We're especially pleased with the contributions of our targeted housing businesses, where we continue to leverage our deep industry expertise and capabilities to increase revenue and profitability.
For example, multi-family housing revenue increased 22% in 2015 and accounted for $280 million of premiums and fees. We increased our share of wallet with Affinity Partners and added several new national property manager relationships.
Similarly, our mortgage solutions business captured share and generated nearly $290 million of fee income for the year. Currently, we provide valuation or property preservation services to 7 of the top 10 servicers and 5 of the top 10 mortgage originators. We believe there are significant opportunities to cross sell additional offerings and grow with existing and new clients.
In the year ahead, we will continue to invest in multifamily housing and mortgage solutions as targeted areas for growth. In both of these businesses, we are well positioned for the future.
Now I'll highlight overall results for full year 2015, which exclude the health runoff operations. 
Operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 11.3% reflecting lower earnings, especially Property and Solutions.
Total revenue for 2015 was $7.3 billion, a 4% decrease from 2014. Despite this decline, we're pleased that our targeted growth areas, including mobile, multi-family housing, and mortgage solutions now account for $1.6 billion of revenue, a 16% increase from 2014. These constitute primarily fee-based or capital light businesses that complement our specialty risk offerings.
In 2015, we also continue to generate strong cash flows driven by Specialty Property and Solutions, which provided approximately $600 million of dividends, almost 120% of their combined earnings. This allowed us to invest in our Housing and Lifestyle offerings, capitalize the wind down of Health, and still return $380 million to shareholders. 
Looking ahead, we are focused on executing our transformation to build a stronger Assurant for the future. This year, we expect to complete our portfolio realignment and establish our new organizational framework. The ongoing normalization of lender-placed, declines in nongrowth areas, and variability in foreign exchange, will however present headwinds. We are taking additional steps to position the company for profitable growth in 2017 and beyond.
The proceeds from the sale of Employee Benefits, dividends from Health, and cash flow from our ongoing businesses will provide significant financial flexibility. With this capital, we'll be able to fund meaningful investments to build our global lifestyle and housing offerings and continue to return capital to our shareholders.
We are also identifying opportunities to increase operating efficiencies. Last month, for example, we announced within Assurant that we are freezing our pension plan effective March 1. This action will generate annual pretax savings of about $35 million.
In addition, we will take other actions to integrate our support functions and further streamline our operations to reduce expenses over time. I want to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment to our strategic transformation.
In a short period of time, we have made significant progress. And while there is more work ahead, I'm proud of what we've accomplished and I'm confident in our future. 
And now, I'll turn to Chris who will review results for the quarter in more detail. Chris?"
4026111,321840772,930382,"Assurant Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2016",2016-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. I'll start with Solutions. Net operating income totaled $30 million, a $29 million decrease from the prior year. Nearly 2/3 of the decline was driven by weaker than expected mobile results.

Nearly 2/3 of the decline was driven by weaker than expected mobile results. This included the loss of the tablet program referenced in prior quarters and $6 million of higher expenses to support existing programs and new launches expected this year. These factors along with lower production from North American retailers and continued runoff in the credit business, also contributed to poor performance in the quarter. 
In addition, Solutions fourth quarter included a few unusual items. We recorded $8 million of prior period accounting adjustments related to the overstatement of mobile inventory and account receivables in our legacy warranty business. This represented a cumulative adjustment with no material impact to any previous periods. Foreign exchange also created a significant headwind in the quarter, including foreign exchange losses on intercompany balances with both Latin America and Europe. The accounting adjustments and foreign-exchange losses were nearly offset by a year-over-year decrease in legal reserves following a preliminary decision of an outstanding U.K. regulatory matter.
Turning to revenue. Solutions revenue was flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Premiums were down modestly due to foreign exchange pressures, the loss of the tablet program, and declines in runoff business. Fee income, now nearly 25% of Solutions quarterly revenue, increased significantly as we expanded our mobile administration and repair offerings.
Looking ahead, despite recent weakness, we remain optimistic about the future prospects of Solutions. Based on current estimates, we expect earnings growth in 2016. This will, however, be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year due to the launch of new mobile programs, improved international profitability and additional expense initiatives.
Next, let's look at Specialty Property. Excluding the divestiture of American Reliable, or ARIC, net operating income decreased $7 million to $58 million. Results reflect the ongoing normalization of lender-placed, the previously disclosed loss of client business and an increase in legal expenses. This was partially offset by lower reinsurance cost due to our declining exposure as well as favorable non-cat loss experience.
Also excluding ARIC, fourth quarter net earned premiums were down 8% from 2014 primarily due to a 30 basis point decline in the placement rate, which includes the previously disclosed loss of client business.
While overall revenue at Specialty Property decreased, targeted growth areas contributed $157 million of premiums and fee income in the quarter, up 22% from last year driven by mortgage solutions and multi-family housing.
For the quarter, Specialty Property's total expense ratio increased 670 basis points year-over-year. Around 570 basis points of the change was driven primarily by lower premiums and higher legal costs related to outstanding matters. The remaining 100 basis points is due to growth of the fee-based business.
Total expenses in absolute dollars declined modestly year-over-year reflecting the impact of expense management initiatives already underway. We expect additional savings in 2016 as we further transform our lender-placed platform including the implementation of new technology to further enhance efficiency and customer service.
With the continued normalization of lender-placed, we expect additional reductions in Specialty Property's revenue and earnings this year. Actions are underway to transform our operating platform and diversify our mix of business, which will help us maintain attractive returns.
Turning to Employee Benefits. Fourth quarter earnings increased to $15 million driven by favorable disability and life experience. Net earned premiums and fee income increased slightly compared to the fourth quarter 2014 as growth in Voluntary more than offset expected declines in true group disability. 
As Alan mentioned, we expect to close the sale of this business by the end of the first quarter. We have received a majority of required state regulatory approvals and are moving toward closing.
At Health runoff operations, the segment reported a fourth quarter net loss of $16 million in line with our estimates. This included $11 million in severance-related costs and other indirect expenses not included in the previously established premium deficiency reserves.
During the quarter, we had a $250 million net infusion into Health to ensure adequate levels of statutory surplus and fund estimated exit related charges and claims through the wind down process. 
We now expect a dividend of $475 million from Health during 2016 with additional modest dividends expected in 2017. This is subject to regulatory approval, any significant changes in claims experienced and the final payments from the 2015 risk mitigation programs. 
So far, preliminary claims development in January for 2015 policies continues to track our estimates. As of December 31, we received all expected cash payments for the 2014 ACA risk mitigation programs. For 2015 policies, we booked an additional $150 million in the quarter related to the reinsurance and risk adjustment programs.  This brings the total amount accrued to $522 million. Reimbursements for 2015 recoverables will be paid in various installments starting at the end of March.
Moving to corporate, we ended 2015 with $210 million in deployable capital. During the fourth quarter, we paid $33 million in shareholder dividends reflecting our increased payout and we repurchased $74 million worth of stock. Overall, for the full year 2015, the company repurchased 4.2 million shares or nearly 6% of our common stock outstanding. This year through February 5, we repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares for $90 million. We believe the stock remains attractively priced.
Based on our current estimates, 2016 dividends from Assurant Solutions and Specialty Property should approximate total segment operating earnings. In addition, proceeds from the sale of Employee Benefits and dividends from Health will provide us with nearly $1.5 billion of deployable capital for the benefit of shareholders. As always, all dividends are subject to rating agency approval.
The corporate loss for the quarter increased $11 million to $31 million reflecting an expected reversal of a tax benefit recorded in the first half of the year as well as $3.5 million of severance and other strategic repositioning costs. This year, we expect the corporate loss to approximate $70 million. We will work to eliminate residual expenses from Health and Employee Benefits and implement other initiatives so that we can exit the year at a lower run rate.
For Assurant overall, we are committed to executing our transformation strategy and positioning Housing and Lifestyle for profitable growth long term. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

Some onetime items may be impacting the domestic and potentially, even the international combined ratios, if I look at those ex pre-need. Similar question to the Specialty Property question, if we look at the combined ratio, domestic and international in Solutions for the full year '15, how should we think about what you think about as the underlying core level off of which we got to be trending as we look out to '16 and beyond?

Obviously, a disappointing quarter. With that said, it's important to remember the transformation that Solutions has undergone over the last couple of years. In the last couple of years, we built a global leader in the mobile and Connected Living business. We've expanded our distribution. We've added clients. We've added services and we're building a much more diversified set of earnings. With that said, it does have some quarter-to-quarter volatility on that journey, but we feel very good about the evolution of Solutions. But Chris, you want to comment more specifically?"

We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and year-end 2015 results with you today.
Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release announcing our fourth quarter and year-end 2015 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
Beginning in the second quarter 2015, we revised the presentation of Assurant's results to reflect our focus on housing and lifestyle specialty offerings. As a reminder, results for Assurant Health runoff operations are included only in net income and are no longer reflected in net operating income. We will continue to report Assurant Employee Benefits under operating results until the sale of that business is closed.
Today's call will contain other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted at assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with brief remarks from Alan and Chris before moving to Q&A.
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports including our 2014 and upcoming 2015 Form 10K. Now I will turn the call over to Alan."

Our performance in the fourth quarter fell short of our expectations and is disappointing. Results were marked by profit declines in both mobile and lender-placed insurance as well as some unusual items, which Chris will detail later. We are taking actions to address this weaker short-term performance as we execute our multiyear transformation and continue to deploy capital to create long-term value for shareholders.
While 2016 will be a transitional year, we are confident the underlying potential of our core housing and lifestyle businesses is strong. 
During 2015, we made significant progress to realign our strategic focus and position Assurant for long-term profitable growth. For example, the sale of Assurant Employee Benefits to Sun Life Financial will provide Assurant with about $1 billion of net proceeds including capital releases and is expected to close by the end of the first quarter.
The exit of our health insurance operations remains on track. All of our Affordable Care Act, or ACA individual major medical policies, lapsed as of January 1, 2016. This allows us to accelerate the wind down and begin to release the capital that supports that business.
During the fourth quarter, we also focused on the go-forward organizational framework that will support profitable growth. We're realigning talent and moving to an integrated enterprise operating model to be more agile and cost-efficient worldwide.
The external searches for Chris' successor as CFO and for a Chief Technology Officer are moving ahead. We expect to fill these roles in the coming months. Once leaders are in place, we will further integrate their respective teams resulting in better coordination and greater efficiencies over time.
All of these steps are critical in our multiyear transformation to build a stronger Assurant for the future. 
Now I'll offer some business highlights both for the quarter and the year, which reinforce our confidence in the future.
At Assurant Solutions, we continued to strengthen our competitive position in the mobile industry where we now protect more than 29 million devices worldwide. During the fourth quarter, we introduced new upgrade and device buyback programs for Telefonica in Spain and expanded our relationship with their Mobistar brand in Chile. While the contribution from these new relationships are initially small, they are important drivers in the global expansion of our Connected Living business and will help us to deliver 10% average annual growth in earnings long term. 
We recognize the growth also will require additional investments, both in the U.S. and internationally. As an example, last year, we increased our staff significantly within our repair and logistics operations. This allowed us to process more than 8 million mobile devices in the U.S. Investments in our capabilities and infrastructure will be critically important to increase capacity and capture share in this dynamic market.
At Assurant Specialty Property, we made significant progress transforming our lender-placed platform as that business normalizes. These efforts will help us maintain our strong customer service and leadership position while we also generate savings in 2016 and beyond.
We're especially pleased with the contributions of our targeted housing businesses, where we continue to leverage our deep industry expertise and capabilities to increase revenue and profitability.
For example, multi-family housing revenue increased 22% in 2015 and accounted for $280 million of premiums and fees. We increased our share of wallet with Affinity Partners and added several new national property manager relationships.
Similarly, our mortgage solutions business captured share and generated nearly $290 million of fee income for the year. Currently, we provide valuation or property preservation services to 7 of the top 10 servicers and 5 of the top 10 mortgage originators. We believe there are significant opportunities to cross sell additional offerings and grow with existing and new clients.
In the year ahead, we will continue to invest in multifamily housing and mortgage solutions as targeted areas for growth. In both of these businesses, we are well positioned for the future.
Now I'll highlight overall results for full year 2015, which exclude the health runoff operations. 
Operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 11.3% reflecting lower earnings, especially Property and Solutions.
Total revenue for 2015 was $7.3 billion, a 4% decrease from 2014. Despite this decline, we're pleased that our targeted growth areas, including mobile, multi-family housing, and mortgage solutions now account for $1.6 billion of revenue, a 16% increase from 2014. These constitute primarily fee-based or capital light businesses that complement our specialty risk offerings.
In 2015, we also continued to generate strong cash flows driven by Specialty Property and Solutions, which provided approximately $600 million of dividends, or almost 120% of their combined earnings. This allowed us to invest in our Housing and Lifestyle offerings, capitalize the wind down of Health, and still return $380 million to shareholders. 
Looking ahead, we are focused on executing our transformation to build a stronger Assurant for the future. This year, we expect to complete our portfolio realignment and establish our new organizational framework. The ongoing normalization of lender-placed, declines in nongrowth areas, and variability in foreign exchange, will however present headwinds. We are taking additional steps to position the company for profitable growth in 2017 and beyond.
The proceeds from the sale of Employee Benefits, dividends from Health, and cash flow from our ongoing businesses will provide significant financial flexibility. With this capital, we'll be able to fund meaningful investments to build our global lifestyle and housing offerings and continue to return capital to our shareholders.
We are also identifying opportunities to increase operating efficiencies. Last month, for example, we announced within Assurant that we are freezing our pension plan effective March 1. This action will generate annual pretax savings of about $35 million.
In addition, we will take other actions to integrate our support functions and further streamline our operations to reduce expenses over time. I want to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment to our strategic transformation.
In a short period of time, we have made significant progress. And while there is more work ahead, I'm proud of what we've accomplished and I'm confident in our future. 
And now, I'll turn to Chris who will review results for the quarter in more detail. Chris?"

Nearly 2/3 of the decline was driven by weaker than expected mobile results. This included the loss of the tablet program referenced in prior quarters and $6 million of higher expenses to support existing programs and new launches expected this year. These factors along with lower production from North American retailers and continued runoff in the credit business, also contributed to poorer performance in the quarter. 
In addition, Solutions fourth quarter included a few unusual items. We recorded $8 million of prior period accounting adjustments related to the overstatement of mobile inventory and account receivables in our legacy warranty business. This represented a cumulative adjustment with no material impact to any previous periods. Foreign exchange also created a significant headwind in the quarter, including foreign exchange losses on intercompany balances with both Latin America and Europe. The accounting adjustments and foreign-exchange losses were nearly offset by a year-over-year decrease in legal reserves following a preliminary decision of an outstanding U.K. regulatory matter.
Turning to revenue. Solutions revenue was flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Premiums were down modestly due to foreign exchange pressures, the loss of the tablet program, and declines in runoff business. Fee income, now nearly 25% of Solutions quarterly revenue, increased significantly as we expanded our mobile administration and repair offerings.
Looking ahead, despite recent weakness, we remain optimistic about the future prospects of Solutions. Based on current estimates, we expect earnings growth in 2016. This will, however, be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year due to the launch of new mobile programs, improved international profitability and additional expense initiatives.
Next, let's look at Specialty Property. Excluding the divestiture of American Reliable, or ARIC, net operating income decreased $7 million to $58 million. Results reflect the ongoing normalization of lender-placed, the previously disclosed loss of client business and an increase in legal expenses. This was partially offset by lower reinsurance costs due to our declining exposure as well as favorable non-cat loss experience.
Also excluding ARIC, fourth quarter net earned premiums were down 8% from 2014 primarily due to a 30 basis point decline in the placement rate, which includes the previously disclosed loss of client business.
While overall revenue at Specialty Property decreased, targeted growth areas contributed $157 million of premiums and fee income in the quarter, up 22% from last year driven by mortgage solutions and multi-family housing.
For the quarter, Specialty Property's total expense ratio increased 670 basis points year-over-year. Around 570 basis points of the change was driven primarily by lower premiums and higher legal costs related to outstanding matters. The remaining 100 basis points is due to growth of the fee-based business.
Total expenses in absolute dollars declined modestly year-over-year reflecting the impact of expense management initiatives already underway. We expect additional savings in 2016 as we further transform our lender-placed platform including the implementation of new technology to further enhance efficiency and customer service.
With the continued normalization of lender-placed, we expect additional reductions in Specialty Property's revenue and earnings this year. Actions are underway to transform our operating platform and diversify our mix of business, which will help us maintain attractive returns.
Turning to Employee Benefits. Fourth quarter earnings increased to $15 million driven by favorable disability and life experience. Net earned premiums and fee income increased slightly compared to the fourth quarter 2014 as growth in Voluntary more than offset expected declines in true group disability. 
As Alan mentioned, we expect to close the sale of this business by the end of the first quarter. We have received a majority of required state regulatory approvals and are moving toward closing.
At Health runoff operations, the segment reported a fourth quarter net loss of $16 million in line with our estimates. This included $11 million in severance-related costs and other indirect expenses not included in the previously established premium deficiency reserves.
During the quarter, we had a $250 million net infusion into Health to ensure adequate levels of statutory surplus and fund estimated exit related charges and claims through the wind down process. 
We now expect to dividend $475 million from Health during 2016 with additional modest dividends expected in 2017. This is subject to regulatory approval, any significant changes in claims experienced and the final payments from the 2015 risk mitigation programs. 
So far, preliminary claims development in January for 2015 policies continues to track our estimates. As of December 31, we received all expected cash payments for the 2014 ACA risk mitigation programs. For 2015 policies, we booked an additional $150 million in the quarter related to the reinsurance and risk adjustment programs.  This brings the total amount accrued to $522 million. Reimbursements for 2015 recoverables will be paid in various installments starting at the end of March.
Moving to corporate, we ended 2015 with $210 million in deployable capital. During the fourth quarter, we paid $33 million in shareholder dividends reflecting our increased payout and we repurchased $74 million worth of stock. Overall, for the full year 2015, the company repurchased 4.2 million shares or nearly 6% of our common stock outstanding. This year through February 5, we've repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares for $90 million. We believe the stock remains attractively priced.
Based on our current estimates, 2016 dividends from Assurant Solutions and Specialty Property should approximate total segment operating earnings. In addition, proceeds from the sale of Employee Benefits and dividends from Health will provide us with nearly $1.5 billion of deployable capital for the benefit of shareholders. As always, all dividends are subject to rating agency approval.
The corporate loss for the quarter increased $11 million to $31 million reflecting an expected reversal of a tax benefit recorded in the first half of the year as well as $3.5 million of severance and other strategic repositioning costs. This year, we expect the corporate loss to approximate $70 million. We will work to eliminate residual expenses from Health and Employee Benefits and implement other initiatives so that we can exit the year at a lower run rate.
For Assurant overall, we are committed to executing our transformation strategy and positioning Housing and Lifestyle for profitable growth long term. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

What we want to do at the Investor Day is help all of our investors better understand the lines of business that we have. And so just a couple things we'll cover or plan to cover at the March 8 Investor Day. We'll talk about kind of long-term targets and update those for both the company and then some of the key lines of businesses. We'll provide more disclosure around the key growth areas of the company and what's really growing for the company are the fee income and capital life businesses like mobile, mortgage solutions, multi-family housing. And then we'll talk about capital management and how that plays into achieving our long-term targets for the company. So hard to give a meaningful overall number for Solutions. We'll provide more granularity at Investor Day."

We look forward to discussing our fourth quarter and year-end 2015 results with you today.
Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday afternoon, we issued a news release announcing our fourth quarter and year-end 2015 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
Beginning in the second quarter 2015, we revised the presentation of Assurant's results to reflect our focus on housing and lifestyle specialty offerings. As a reminder, results for Assurant Health runoff operations are included only in net income and are no longer reflected in net operating income. We will continue to report Assurant Employee Benefits under operating results until the sale of that business is closed.
Today's call will contain other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement posted at assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with brief remarks from Alan and Chris before moving to Q&A.
Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports including our 2014 and upcoming 2015 Form 10K. Now I will turn the call over to Alan."

Our performance in the fourth quarter fell short of our expectations and is disappointing. Results were marked by profit declines in both mobile and lender-placed insurance as well as some unusual items, which Chris will detail later. We are taking actions to address this weaker short-term performance as we execute our multiyear transformation and continue to deploy capital to create long-term value for shareholders.
While 2016 will be a transitional year, we are confident the underlying potential of our core housing and lifestyle businesses is strong.
During 2015, we made significant progress to realign our strategic focus and position Assurant for long-term profitable growth. For example, the sale of Assurant Employee Benefits to Sun Life Financial will provide Assurant with about $1 billion of net proceeds including capital releases and is expected to close by the end of the first quarter.
The exit of our health insurance operations remains on track. All of our Affordable Care Act, or ACA individual major medical policies, lapsed as of January 1, 2016. This allows us to accelerate the wind down and begin to release the capital that supports that business.
During the fourth quarter, we also focused on the go-forward organizational framework that will support profitable growth. We're realigning talent and moving to an integrated enterprise operating model to be more agile and cost-efficient worldwide.
The external searches for Chris' successor as CFO and for a Chief Technology Officer are moving ahead. We expect to fill these roles in the coming months. Once leaders are in place, we will further integrate their respective teams resulting in better coordination and greater efficiencies over time.
All of these steps are critical in our multiyear transformation to build a stronger Assurant for the future.
Now I'll offer some business highlights both for the quarter and the year, which reinforce our confidence in the future.
At Assurant Solutions, we continued to strengthen our competitive position in the mobile industry where we now protect more than 29 million devices worldwide. During the fourth quarter, we introduced new upgrade and device buyback programs for Telefonica in Spain and expanded our relationship with their Mobistar brand in Chile. While the contribution from these new relationships are initially small, they are important drivers in the global expansion of our Connected Living business and will help us to deliver 10% average annual growth in earnings long term.
We recognize the growth also will require additional investments, both in the U.S. and internationally. As an example, last year, we increased our staff significantly within our repair and logistics operations. This allowed us to process more than 8 million mobile devices in the U.S. Investments in our capabilities and infrastructure will be critically important to increase capacity and capture share in this dynamic market.
At Assurant Specialty Property, we made significant progress transforming our lender-placed platform as that business normalizes. These efforts will help us maintain our strong customer service and leadership position while we also generate savings in 2016 and beyond.
We're especially pleased with the contributions of our targeted housing businesses, where we continue to leverage our deep industry expertise and capabilities to increase revenue and profitability.
For example, multi-family housing revenue increased 22% in 2015 and accounted for $280 million of premiums and fees. We increased our share of wallet with Affinity Partners and added several new national property manager relationships.
Similarly, our mortgage solutions business captured share and generated nearly $290 million of fee income for the year. Currently, we provide valuation or property preservation services to 7 of the top 10 servicers and 5 of the top 10 mortgage originators. We believe there are significant opportunities to cross sell additional offerings and grow with existing and new clients.
In the year ahead, we will continue to invest in multifamily housing and mortgage solutions as targeted areas for growth. In both of these businesses, we are well positioned for the future.
Now I'll highlight overall results for full year 2015, which exclude the health runoff operations.
Operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 11.3% reflecting lower earnings, especially Property and Solutions.
Total revenue for 2015 was $7.3 billion, a 4% decrease from 2014. Despite this decline, we're pleased that our targeted growth areas, including mobile, multi-family housing, and mortgage solutions now account for $1.6 billion of revenue, a 16% increase from 2014. These constitute primarily fee-based or capital light businesses that complement our specialty risk offerings.
In 2015, we also continued to generate strong cash flows driven by Specialty Property and Solutions, which provided approximately $600 million of dividends, or almost 120% of their combined earnings. This allowed us to invest in our Housing and Lifestyle offerings, capitalize the wind down of Health, and still return $380 million to shareholders.
Looking ahead, we are focused on executing our transformation to build a stronger Assurant for the future. This year, we expect to complete our portfolio realignment and establish our new organizational framework. The ongoing normalization of lender-placed, declines in nongrowth areas, and variability in foreign exchange, will however present headwinds. We are taking additional steps to position the company for profitable growth in 2017 and beyond.
The proceeds from the sale of Employee Benefits, dividends from Health, and cash flow from our ongoing businesses will provide significant financial flexibility. With this capital, we'll be able to fund meaningful investments to build our global lifestyle and housing offerings and continue to return capital to our shareholders.
We are also identifying opportunities to increase operating efficiencies. Last month, for example, we announced within Assurant that we are freezing our pension plan effective March 1. This action will generate annual pretax savings of about $35 million.
In addition, we will take other actions to integrate our support functions and further streamline our operations to reduce expenses over time. I want to thank our employees for their hard work and commitment to our strategic transformation.
In a short period of time, we have made significant progress. And while there is more work ahead, I'm proud of what we've accomplished and I'm confident in our future.
And now, I'll turn to Chris who will review results for the quarter in more detail. Chris?"
4026111,321840772,930834,"Assurant Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 10, 2016",2016-02-10,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Alan. I'll start with Solutions. Net operating income totaled $30 million, a $29 million decrease from the prior year. Nearly 2/3 of the decline was driven by weaker than expected mobile results. This included the loss of the tablet program refere",1060,"Thanks, Alan. I'll start with Solutions. Net operating income totaled $30 million, a $29 million decrease from the prior year. Nearly 2/3 of the decline was driven by weaker than expected mobile results. This included the loss of the tablet program referenced in prior quarters and $6 million of higher expenses to support existing programs and new launches expected this year. These factors along with lower production from North American retailers and continued runoff in the credit business, also contributed to poorer performance in the quarter.
In addition, Solutions fourth quarter included a few unusual items. We recorded $8 million of prior period accounting adjustments related to the overstatement of mobile inventory and account receivables in our legacy warranty business. This represented a cumulative adjustment with no material impact to any previous periods. Foreign exchange also created a significant headwind in the quarter, including foreign exchange losses on intercompany balances with both Latin America and Europe. The accounting adjustments and foreign-exchange losses were nearly offset by a year-over-year decrease in legal reserves following a preliminary decision of an outstanding U.K. regulatory matter.
Turning to revenue. Solutions revenue was flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Premiums were down modestly due to foreign exchange pressures, the loss of the tablet program, and declines in runoff business. Fee income, now nearly 25% of Solutions quarterly revenue, increased significantly as we expanded our mobile administration and repair offerings.
Looking ahead, despite recent weakness, we remain optimistic about the future prospects of Solutions. Based on current estimates, we expect earnings growth in 2016. This will, however, be more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year due to the launch of new mobile programs, improved international profitability and additional expense initiatives.
Next, let's look at Specialty Property. Excluding the divestiture of American Reliable, or ARIC, net operating income decreased $7 million to $58 million. Results reflect the ongoing normalization of lender-placed, the previously disclosed loss of client business and an increase in legal expenses. This was partially offset by lower reinsurance costs due to our declining exposure as well as favorable non-cat loss experience.
Also excluding ARIC, fourth quarter net earned premiums were down 8% from 2014 primarily due to a 30 basis point decline in the placement rate, which includes the previously disclosed loss of client business.
While overall revenue at Specialty Property decreased, targeted growth areas contributed $157 million of premiums and fee income in the quarter, up 22% from last year driven by mortgage solutions and multi-family housing.
For the quarter, Specialty Property's total expense ratio increased 670 basis points year-over-year. Around 570 basis points of the change was driven primarily by lower premiums and higher legal costs related to outstanding matters. The remaining 100 basis points is due to growth of the fee-based business.
Total expenses in absolute dollars declined modestly year-over-year reflecting the impact of expense management initiatives already underway. We expect additional savings in 2016 as we further transform our lender-placed platform including the implementation of new technology to further enhance efficiency and customer service.
With the continued normalization of lender-placed, we expect additional reductions in Specialty Property's revenue and earnings this year. Actions are underway to transform our operating platform and diversify our mix of business, which will help us maintain attractive returns.
Turning to Employee Benefits. Fourth quarter earnings increased to $15 million driven by favorable disability and life experience. Net earned premiums and fee income increased slightly compared to the fourth quarter 2014 as growth in Voluntary more than offset expected declines in true group disability.
As Alan mentioned, we expect to close the sale of this business by the end of the first quarter. We have received a majority of required state regulatory approvals and are moving toward closing.
At Health runoff operations, the segment reported a fourth quarter net loss of $16 million in line with our estimates. This included $11 million in severance-related costs and other indirect expenses not included in the previously established premium deficiency reserves.
During the quarter, we had a $250 million net infusion into Health to ensure adequate levels of statutory surplus and fund estimated exit related charges and claims through the wind down process.
We now expect to dividend $475 million from Health during 2016 with additional modest dividends expected in 2017. This is subject to regulatory approval, any significant changes in claims experienced and the final payments from the 2015 risk mitigation programs.
So far, preliminary claims development in January for 2015 policies continues to track our estimates. As of December 31, we received all expected cash payments for the 2014 ACA risk mitigation programs. For 2015 policies, we booked an additional $150 million in the quarter related to the reinsurance and risk adjustment programs.  This brings the total amount accrued to $522 million. Reimbursements for 2015 recoverables will be paid in various installments starting at the end of March.
Moving to corporate, we ended 2015 with $210 million in deployable capital. During the fourth quarter, we paid $33 million in shareholder dividends reflecting our increased payout and we repurchased $74 million worth of stock. Overall, for the full year 2015, the company repurchased 4.2 million shares or nearly 6% of our common stock outstanding. This year through February 5, we've repurchased an additional 1.1 million shares for $90 million. We believe the stock remains attractively priced.
Based on our current estimates, 2016 dividends from Assurant Solutions and Specialty Property should approximate total segment operating earnings. In addition, proceeds from the sale of Employee Benefits and dividends from Health will provide us with nearly $1.5 billion of deployable capital for the benefit of shareholders. As always, all dividends are subject to rating agency approval.
The corporate loss for the quarter increased $11 million to $31 million reflecting an expected reversal of a tax benefit recorded in the first half of the year as well as $3.5 million of severance and other strategic repositioning costs. This year, we expect the corporate loss to approximate $70 million. We will work to eliminate residual expenses from Health and Employee Benefits and implement other initiatives so that we can exit the year at a lower run rate.
For Assurant overall, we are committed to executing our transformation strategy and positioning Housing and Lifestyle for profitable growth long term. And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

We've added services and we're building a much more diversified set of earnings.

We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2016 results with you today.
Joining me from Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday, after the market close, we issued a news release announcing our first quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.  As noted in the release, beginning in the first quarter 2016, we revised the presentation of Assurant's results to focus on housing and lifestyle. Net operating income will now reflect contributions from our ongoing business segments, Assurant Solutions, Assurant Specialty Property and Corporate as well as interest expense. Operating results will exclude Assurant Health runoff operations, the divested Employee Benefits business and the amortization of deferred gains from dispositions.
Related prior period results in the financial supplement and in the news release have been revised to conform to the new presentation. We believe these changes provide a more meaningful presentation of our financials and better reflect our go forward strategy.
As we continue to work through our transformation, we expect to make additional enhancements to our reporting format. Today's call will contain other non-GAAP financial measures which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available at assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with brief remarks from Alan and Chris before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2015 Form 10-K and upcoming first quarter Form 10-Q. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Alan."

Overall, we are pleased with the strong first quarter performance of our housing and lifestyle businesses. Our results reaffirm our confidence in the future and progress against the financial targets we shared at our investor day as we strengthen our company for long-term profitable growth.
During the first quarter, we continue to execute our multi-year transformation strategy. For example, the sale of Employee Benefits to some my financial closed on March 1. We expect the dividend cash proceeds to the holding company starting this quarter subject to regulatory approval.
The wind down of our health operations also remains on track. Membership continue to decline only 26,000 covered lives as of March 31, down 93% since year end. In addition, claims development from 2015 policies continued to be in line with our assumptions. During the first quarter, we began work on the go forward operating structure under Gene Mergelmeyer as she prepares to move into the Chief Operating Officer role in July. Our goal is to leverage our enterprise scale and strengthen our competitive advantage across the global housing and lifestyle markets we serve.
In support of our transformation and growth strategy, last week, we announced Ajay Waghray -- will join Assurant on May 9 as our new Chief Technology Officer. Ajay joins our leadership team from Verizon with decades of global management and IT experience. At Assurant, Ajay will drive business alignment and strategy for technology across the global enterprise, and support our broad commitment outlined at investor day.  We also expect to have the new CFO on board in the coming months. Until his successor is appointed, we appreciate that Chris will continue to perform these duties while preparing for his new role as Chief Risk Officer. 
Within our segment, there are also many initiatives underway to strengthen our competitive position and expand our integrated risk offerings. At Assurant Solutions, we remain focused on executing our strategy of growing the Connected Living platform globally through innovative products and services as well as new partnerships. Longer term, we expect to double margins in Connected Living to 8% by scaling our offerings, driving operating efficiencies and managing declines in our legacy runoff business. These efforts, along with steady contributions from [indiscernible] Protection and Pre-need, will position solutions to deliver 10% average annual growth and net operating income over the long term.
At Assurant Specialty Property, we are expanding our fee-based capital-light businesses. These offerings now account for 27% of the segment's revenue, and are expected to continue to grow double digits in the long term. At the same time, we are actively managing the ongoing normalization of lender-placed with our expense management initiatives. These efforts will help Specialty Property to maintain at least a 20% operating ROE longer-term.
As getting our strategy will require us to invest prudently in our targeted growth areas to further diversify and strengthen our housing and lifestyle businesses. For example, we acquired a company that provides insurance coverage for parcel deliveries be a major shipping carriers. We plan to integrate their e-commerce capabilities into our other Assurant offerings to provide a seamless customer buying experience.
Last week, we also announced the purchase of renewal rights on 250,000 flood policies from Nationwide. This solidifies our position as the second-largest administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program in the United States. 
Overall, we're making good progress in diversifying our offerings and establishing a more integrated operational structure. We believe this will help us build a stronger Assurant for the future.
At our March investor day, we introduced 3 key long-term financial targets to track our progress. During the next 5 years, we expect to do the following: Deliver growth in net operating income; increase operating earnings per share on average by at least 15% annually; and expand operating ROE to 15% by 2020. These targets all exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent variability of weather.
Now I'll highlight our performance in the first quarter 2016 in relation to these long-term financial targets. Net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, declined 8% to $110 million. While we expect earnings to be down for full year 2016 driven by the normalization of lender-placed, we are preparing the company for profitable growth in 2017 and beyond.
Operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, decreased 2% from first quarter 2015 to $1.66, a decline in earnings was partially offset by and share buyback activity. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI and catastrophe losses, was 12.3%, up from 12% at year end, reflecting a shift to more fee-based and capital-light businesses.
Looking at our capital position. Our balance sheet remains strong. At the end of March, holding company capital totaled $450 million. Consistent with our intent to return $1.5 billion to shareholders by the end of 2017, through April 22, we returned a total of $355 million via dividends and share repurchases, or nearly 25% of that goal.  Overall, we're pleased with our progress during the first quarter. We believe our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more predictable diversified earnings, stronger cash flow generation and continued capital management flexibility. 
And now, I will turn to Chris who will review the results for the first quarter in additional detail. Chris?"

At Solutions, we were pleased with the improvement in underlying results from the fourth quarter of 2015. Compared to first quarter of 2015, however, net operating income declined $7 million to $47 million, primarily due to the previously disclosed loss of a domestic tablet program and declines within our legacy runoff business.
We also incurred some additional on-boarding costs related to new mobile programs expected to ramp up later in the year. Pre-need recorded a onetime $4 million net reserve and dock adjustment associated with a block of older policies that also contributed to lower results. 
Revenue at Solutions increased 5% from the prior period in 2015, driven by a higher volume of covered mobile devices globally and strong growth in vehicle protection. This was partially offset by declines at sir North American retailers and the impact from foreign exchange.
For the full year, we continue to expected growth in net operating income weighted toward the second half of 2016. New mobile programs, improved international profitability, and expense initiatives within solutions will drive the increase.
Now let's look at Specialty Property, which delivered a strong quarter despite ongoing normalization in lender-placed. Net operating income increased to $76 million, reflecting lower general expenses, more favorable loss experience and lower reinsurance costs as our risk exposure continued to decline. Results also included greater contributions from multi-family housing and mortgage solutions.
The combined ratio for lender-placed and manufactured housing risk products with 80.7%, 140 basis points better than last year. And this improvement was the result of a decline in the frequency and severity of non-catastrophe claims and lower general expenses. Despite lower premiums, we expect our expense ratio for these risk-based products to move toward the long-term targeted range of 42% to 44% by 2018, though the trajectory won't be linear.
Specialty Property revenue decreased 6%. The previously disclosed loss of client business, along with placement rate and premium reductions, lowered lender-placed premiums. Multi-family housing and mortgage solutions revenue partially offset the decline. Net earned premiums and fees for multi-family housing were up more than 20%. We achieve this increase through our affinity channel and expanded relationships where the property management companies.
Mortgage solutions revenue increased 28%, primarily from strong organic growth in field services. In the first quarter, these fee-based capital-light offerings generate a pretax margin of 11%, an increase of 620 basis points year-over-year. Strong organic growth is helping build the additional scale needed to reach our long-term target margin of 15% to 20%.
For the year, we expect the revenue and earnings to be down at Specialty Property as lender-placed continues to normalize. Expense savings and growth in our fee-based capital-light offerings are expected to partially offset the decline in net operating income.
Turning to health runoff operations. The segment reported a first quarter loss of $27 million, which was in line with our estimates. This included $10 million in severance-related costs as well as other indirect expenses not included in the previously established premium deficiency reserves.
During the quarter, we were able to dividend $65 million from health to the holding company. We expect to dividend and additional $410 million later this year. This is subject to regulatory approval. Any changes in claims experienced and the final payments from the 2015 ACA risk-mitigation programs.
As of March 31, we had a $487 million of recoverables related to the risk mitigation programs at health. In the first quarter, we received an initial payment of $29 million related to the 2015 reinsurance program, and we received another $38 million payment last week. HHS is expected to provide insurers with their final payment notifications by the end of June, and pay the remaining reimbursements starting in the third quarter.
Moving to Corporate. The loss for the quarter increased $10 million to $14 million, reflecting higher taxes and employee benefit costs. As a reminder, first quarter 2015 benefited from a tax consolidated adjustment that reversed itself during the course of last year. 
For full year 2016, we continue to expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million. The actions we are taking to build the new business operating framework and to eliminate residual expenses from health and employee benefits will support a more efficient operating model for the future.
Moving to capital. We ended the first quarter with $200 million in deployable capital. In addition to the $65 million from health that I referenced earlier, we brought up $55 million in dividends from Solutions and Specialty Property during the quarter. We also secured $250 million in short-term financing to fund share repurchases. This provided additional capital flexibility until cash proceeds from the sale of employee benefits are received at the holding company.
These actions allowed us to pay $32 million in shareholder dividends and repurchased $258 million worth of stock. Through April 22, we bought an additional 807,000 shares, bringing the total repurchased year-to-date to $4.2 million. So far this year, the buyback activity already surpassed the full year 2015 total.  At the same time, we believe ongoing cash flow generation from Solutions and Specialty Property will provide continued financial flexibility to support our current and future opportunities in the housing and lifestyle markets.
Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter results, and are committed to executing our transformation strategy to ensure long-term profitable growth in the housing and lifestyle.

We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2016 results with you today.
Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our first quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com. As noted in the release, beginning in the first quarter 2016, we revised the presentation of Assurant's results to focus on housing and lifestyle. Net operating income will now reflect contributions from our ongoing business segments: Assurant Solutions, Assurant Specialty Property and Corporate as well as interest expense. Operating results will exclude Assurant Health runoff operations, the divested Employee Benefits business and the amortization of deferred gains from dispositions.
Related prior period results in the financial supplement and in the news release have been revised to conform to the new presentation. We believe these changes provide a more meaningful presentation of our financials and better reflect our go-forward strategy.
As we continue to work through our transformation, we expect to make additional enhancements to our reporting format. Today's call will contain other non-GAAP financial measures which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available at assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with brief remarks from Alan and Chris before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2015 Form 10-K and upcoming first quarter Form 10-Q. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Alan."

Overall, we are pleased with the strong first quarter performance of our housing and lifestyle businesses. Our results reaffirm our confidence in the future and progress against the financial targets we share",877,"Thanks, Francesca, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we are pleased with the strong first quarter performance of our housing and lifestyle businesses. Our results reaffirm our confidence in the future and progress against the financial targets we shared at our Investor Day as we strengthen our company for long-term profitable growth.
During the first quarter, we continue to execute our multi-year transformation strategy. For example, the sale of Employee Benefits to Sun Life Financial closed on March 1. We expect the dividend cash proceeds to the holding company starting this quarter, subject to regulatory approval.
The wind-down of our Health operations also remains on track. Membership continued to decline to only 26,000 covered lives as of March 31, down 93% since year end. In addition, claims development from 2015 policies continued to be in line with our assumptions. During the first quarter, we began work on the go-forward operating structure under Gene Mergelmeyer as he prepares to move into the Chief Operating Officer role in July. Our goal is to leverage our enterprise scale and strengthen our competitive advantage across the global housing and lifestyle markets we serve.
In support of our transformation and growth strategy, last week, we announced Ajay Waghray will join Assurant on May 9 as our new Chief Technology Officer. Ajay joins our leadership team from Verizon with decades of global management and IT experience. At Assurant, Ajay will drive business alignment and strategy for technology across the global enterprise, and support our broader commitment outlined at Investor Day.  We also expect to have the new CFO on board in the coming months. Until a successor is appointed, we appreciate that Chris will continue to perform these duties while preparing for his new role as Chief Risk Officer. 
Within our segment, there are also many initiatives under way to strengthen our competitive position and expand our integrated risk offerings. At Assurant Solutions, we remain focused on executing our strategy of growing the Connected Living platform globally through innovative products and services as well as new partnerships. Longer term, we expect to double margins in Connected Living to 8% by scaling our offerings, driving operating efficiencies and managing declines in our legacy runoff business. These efforts, along with steady contributions from vehicle protection and pre-need, will position Solutions to deliver 10% average annual growth in net operating income over the long term.
At Assurant Specialty Property, we are expanding our fee-based, capital-light businesses. These offerings now account for 27% of the segment's revenue, and are expected to continue to grow at double digits in the long term. At the same time, we are actively managing the ongoing normalization of lender-placed with our expense management initiatives. These efforts will help Specialty Property to maintain at least a 20% operating ROE longer term.
Executing our strategy will require us to invest prudently in our targeted growth areas to further diversify and strengthen our housing and lifestyle businesses. For example, we acquired a company that provides insurance coverage for parcel deliveries via major shipping carriers. We plan to integrate their e-commerce capabilities into our other Assurant offerings to provide a seamless customer buying experience.
Last week, we also announced the purchase of renewal rights on 250,000 flood policies from Nationwide. This solidifies our position as the second-largest administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program in the United States. 
Overall, we're making good progress in diversifying our offerings and establishing a more integrated operational structure. We believe this will help us build a stronger Assurant for the future.
At our March Investor Day, we introduced 3 key long-term financial targets to track our progress. During the next 5 years, we expect to do the following: deliver growth in net operating income; increase operating earnings per share on average by at least 15% annually; and expand operating ROE to 15% by 2020. These targets all exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent variability of weather.
Now I'll highlight our performance in the first quarter 2016 in relation to these long-term financial targets. Net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, declined 8% to $110 million. While we expect earnings to be down for full year 2016 driven by the normalization of lender-placed, we are preparing the company for profitable growth in 2017 and beyond.
Operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, decreased 2% from first quarter 2015 to $1.66. A decline in earnings was partially offset by share buyback activity. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI and catastrophe losses, was 12.3%, up from 12% at year end, reflecting a shift to more fee-based and capital-light businesses.
Looking at our capital position. Our balance sheet remains strong. At the end of March, holding company capital totaled $450 million. Consistent with our intent to return $1.5 billion to shareholders by the end of 2017, through April 22, we returned a total of $355 million via dividends and share repurchases, or nearly 25% of that goal.  Overall, we're pleased with our progress during the first quarter. We believe our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more predictable diversified earnings, stronger cash flow generation and continued capital management flexibility. 
And now I will turn to Chris who will review the results for the first quarter in additional detail. Chris?"

At Solutions, we were pleased with the improvement in underlying results from the fourth quarter of 2015. Compared to first quarter of 2015, however, net operating income declined $7 million to $47 million, primarily due to the previously disclosed loss of a domestic tablet program and declines within our legacy runoff business.
We also incurred some additional on-boarding costs related to new mobile programs expected to ramp up later in the year. Pre-need recorded a onetime $4 million net reserve and DAC adjustment associated with a block of older policies that also contributed to lower results. 
Revenue at Solutions increased 5% from the prior period in 2015, driven by a higher volume of covered mobile devices globally and strong growth in vehicle protection. This was partially offset by declines at certain North American retailers and the impact from foreign exchange.
For the full year, we continue to expect growth in net operating income weighted towards the second half of 2016. New mobile programs, improved international profitability and expense initiatives within Solutions will drive the increase.
Now let's look at Specialty Property, which delivered a strong quarter despite ongoing normalization in lender-placed. Net operating income increased to $76 million, reflecting lower general expenses, more favorable loss experience and lower reinsurance costs as our risk exposure continued to decline. Results also included greater contributions from multi-family housing and mortgage solutions.
The combined ratio for lender-placed and manufactured housing risk products was 80.7%, 140 basis points better than last year. This improvement was the result of a decline in the frequency and severity of non-catastrophe claims and lower general expenses. Despite lower premiums, we expect our expense ratio for these risk-based products to move toward the long-term targeted range of 42% to 44% by 2018, though the trajectory won't be linear.
Specialty Property revenue decreased 6%. The previously disclosed loss of client business, along with placement rate and premium reductions, lowered lender-placed premiums. Multi-family housing and mortgage solutions revenue partially offset the decline. Net earned premium and fees for multi-family housing were up more than 20%. We achieved this increase through our affinity channel and expanded relationships with property management companies.
Mortgage solutions revenue increased 28%, primarily from strong organic growth in field services. In the first quarter, these fee-based, capital-light offerings generate a pretax margin of 11%, an increase of 620 basis points year-over-year. Strong organic growth is helping build the additional scale needed to reach our long-term target margin of 15% to 20%.
For the year, we expect revenue and earnings to be down at Specialty Property, as lender-placed continues to normalize. Expense savings and growth in our fee-based, capital-light offerings are expected to partially offset the decline in net operating income.
Turning to Health runoff operations. The segment reported a first quarter loss of $27 million, which was in line with our estimates. This included $10 million in severance-related costs as well as other indirect expenses not included in the previously established premium deficiency reserves.
During the quarter, we were able to dividend $65 million from Health to the holding company. We expect to dividend an additional $410 million later this year. This is subject to regulatory approval, any changes in claims experience and the final payments from the 2015 ACA risk-mitigation programs.
As of March 31, we had $487 million of recoverables related to the risk mitigation programs at Health. In the first quarter, we received an initial payment of $29 million related to the 2015 reinsurance program, and we received another $38 million payment last week. HHS is expected to provide insurers with their final payment notifications by the end of June, and pay the remaining reimbursements starting in the third quarter.
Moving to Corporate. The loss for the quarter increased $10 million to $14 million, reflecting higher taxes and employee benefit costs. As a reminder, first quarter 2015 benefited from a tax consolidating adjustment that reversed itself during the course of last year. 
For full year 2016, we continue to expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million. The actions we are taking to build the new business operating framework and to eliminate residual expenses from Health and Employee Benefits will support a more efficient operating model for the future.
Moving to capital. We ended the first quarter with $200 million in deployable capital. In addition to the $65 million from Health that I referenced earlier, we brought up $55 million in dividends from Solutions and Specialty Property during the quarter. We also secured $250 million in short-term financing to fund share repurchases. This provided additional capital flexibility until cash proceeds from the sale of Employee Benefits are received at the holding company.
These actions allowed us to pay $32 million in shareholder dividends and repurchased $258 million worth of stock. Through April 22, we bought an additional 807,000 shares, bringing the total repurchased year-to-date to 4.2 million. So far this year, buyback activity already surpassed the full year 2015 total. At the same time, we believe ongoing cash flow generation from Solutions and Specialty Property will provide continued financial flexibility to support our current and future opportunities in the housing and lifestyle markets.
Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter results, and are committed to executing our transformation strategy to ensure long-term profitable growth in housing and lifestyle.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2016 results with you today.
Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our first quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com. As noted in the release, beginning in the first quarter 2016, we revised the presentation of Assurant's results to focus on housing and lifestyle. Net operating income will now reflect contributions from our ongoing business segments: Assurant Solutions, Assurant Specialty Property and Corporate as well as interest expense. Operating results will exclude Assurant Health runoff operations, the divested Employee Benefits business and the amortization of deferred gains from dispositions.
Related prior period results in the financial supplement and in the news release have been revised to conform to the new presentation. We believe these changes provide a more meaningful presentation of our financials and better reflect our go-forward strategy.
As we continue to work through our transformation, we expect to make additional enhancements to our reporting format. Today's call will contain other non-GAAP financial measures which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available at assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with brief remarks from Alan and Chris before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2015 Form 10-K and upcoming first quarter Form 10-Q. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Alan."

Overall, we are pleased with the strong first quarter performance of our housing and lifestyle businesses.

Overall, we are pleased with the strong first quarter performance of our housing and lifestyle businesses. Our results reaffirm our confidence in the future and progress against the financial targets we shared at our Investor Day as we strengthen our company for long-term profitable growth.
During the first quarter, we continue to execute our multi-year transformation strategy. For example, the sale of Employee Benefits to Sun Life Financial closed on March 1. We expect the dividend cash proceeds to the holding company starting this quarter, subject to regulatory approval.
The wind-down of our Health operations also remains on track. Membership continued to decline to only 26,000 covered lives as of March 31, down 93% since year end. In addition, claims development from 2015 policies continued to be in line with our assumptions. During the first quarter, we began work on the go-forward operating structure under Gene Mergelmeyer as he prepares to move into the Chief Operating Officer role in July. Our goal is to leverage our enterprise scale and strengthen our competitive advantage across the global housing and lifestyle markets we serve.
In support of our transformation and growth strategy, last week, we announced Ajay Waghray will join Assurant on May 9 as our new Chief Technology Officer. Ajay joins our leadership team from Verizon with decades of global management and IT experience. At Assurant, Ajay will drive business alignment and strategy for technology across the global enterprise, and support our broader commitment outlined at Investor Day.  We also expect to have the new CFO on board in the coming months. Until a successor is appointed, we appreciate that Chris will continue to perform these duties while preparing for his new role as Chief Risk Officer. 
Within our segment, there are also many initiatives under way to strengthen our competitive position and expand our integrated risk offerings. At Assurant Solutions, we remain focused on executing our strategy of growing the Connected Living platform globally through innovative products and services as well as new partnerships. Longer term, we expect to double margins in Connected Living to 8% by scaling our offerings, driving operating efficiencies and managing declines in our legacy runoff business. These efforts, along with steady contributions from vehicle protection and pre-need, will position Solutions to deliver 10% average annual growth in net operating income over the long term.
At Assurant Specialty Property, we are expanding our fee-based, capital-light businesses. These offerings now account for 27% of the segment's revenue, and are expected to continue to grow at double digits in the long term. At the same time, we are actively managing the ongoing normalization of lender-placed with our expense management initiatives. These efforts will help Specialty Property to maintain at least a 20% operating ROE longer term.
Executing our strategy will require us to invest prudently in our targeted growth areas to further diversify and strengthen our housing and lifestyle businesses. For example, we acquired a company that provides insurance coverage for parcel deliveries via major shipping carriers. We plan to integrate their e-commerce capabilities into our other Assurant offerings to provide a seamless customer buying experience.
Last week, we also announced the purchase of renewal rights on 250,000 flood policies from Nationwide. This solidifies our position as the second-largest administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program in the United States. 
Overall, we're making good progress in diversifying our offerings and establishing a more integrated operational structure. We believe this will help us build a stronger Assurant for the future.
At our March Investor Day, we introduced 3 key long-term financial targets to track our progress. During the next 5 years, we expect to do the following: deliver growth in net operating income; increase operating earnings per share on average by at least 15% annually; and expand operating ROE to 15% by 2020. These targets all exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent variability of weather.
Now I'll highlight our performance in the first quarter 2016 in relation to these long-term financial targets. Net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, declined 8% to $110 million. While we expect earnings to be down for full year 2016 driven by the normalization of lender-placed, we are preparing the company for profitable growth in 2017 and beyond.
Operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, decreased 2% from first quarter 2015 to $1.66. A decline in earnings was partially offset by share buyback activity. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI and catastrophe losses, was 12.3%, up from 12% at year end, reflecting a shift to more fee-based and capital-light businesses.
Looking at our capital position. Our balance sheet remains strong. At the end of March, holding company capital totaled $450 million. Consistent with our intent to return $1.5 billion to shareholders by the end of 2017, through April 22, we returned a total of $355 million via dividends and share repurchases, or nearly 25% of that goal.  Overall, we're pleased with our progress during the first quarter. We believe our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more predictable diversified earnings, stronger cash flow generation and continued capital management flexibility. 
And now I will turn to Chris who will review the results for the first quarter in additional detail. Chris?"

At Solutions, we were pleased with the improvement in underlying results from the fourth quarter of 2015. Compared to first quarter of 2015, however, net operating income declined $7 million to $47 million, primarily due to the previously disclosed loss of a domestic tablet program and declines within our legacy runoff business.
We also incurred some additional on-boarding costs related to new mobile programs expected to ramp up later in the year. Pre-need recorded a onetime $4 million net reserve and DAC adjustment associated with a block of older policies that also contributed to lower results. 
Revenue at Solutions increased 5% from the prior period in 2015, driven by a higher volume of covered mobile devices globally and strong growth in vehicle protection. This was partially offset by declines at certain North American retailers and the impact from foreign exchange.
For the full year, we continue to expect growth in net operating income weighted towards the second half of 2016. New mobile programs, improved international profitability and expense initiatives within Solutions will drive the increase.
Now let's look at Specialty Property, which delivered a strong quarter despite ongoing normalization in lender-placed. Net operating income increased to $76 million, reflecting lower general expenses, more favorable loss experience and lower reinsurance costs as our risk exposure continued to decline. Results also include greater contributions from multi-family housing and mortgage solutions.
The combined ratio for lender-placed and manufactured housing risk products was 80.7%, 140 basis points better than last year. This improvement was the result of a decline in the frequency and severity of non-catastrophe claims and lower general expenses. Despite lower premiums, we expect our expense ratio for these risk-based products to move toward the long-term targeted range of 42% to 44% by 2018, though the trajectory won't be linear.
Specialty Property revenue decreased 6%. The previously disclosed loss of client business, along with placement rate and premium reductions, lowered lender-placed premiums. Multi-family housing and mortgage solutions revenue partially offset the decline. Net earned premium and fees for multi-family housing were up more than 20%. We achieved this increase through our affinity channel and expanded relationships with property management companies.
Mortgage solutions revenue increased 28%, primarily from strong organic growth in field services. In the first quarter, these fee-based, capital-light offerings generate a pretax margin of 11%, an increase of 620 basis points year-over-year. Strong organic growth is helping build the additional scale needed to reach our long-term target margin of 15% to 20%.
For the year, we expect revenue and earnings to be down at Specialty Property, as lender-placed continues to normalize. Expense savings and growth in our fee-based, capital-light offerings are expected to partially offset the decline in net operating income.
Turning to Health runoff operations. The segment reported a first quarter loss of $27 million, which was in line with our estimates. This included $10 million in severance-related costs as well as other indirect expenses not included in the previously established premium deficiency reserves.
During the quarter, we were able to dividend $65 million from Health to the holding company. We expect to dividend an additional $410 million later this year. This is subject to regulatory approval, any changes in claims experience and the final payments from the 2015 ACA risk-mitigation programs.
As of March 31, we had $487 million of recoverables related to the risk mitigation programs at Health. In the first quarter, we received an initial payment of $29 million related to the 2015 reinsurance program, and we received another $38 million payment last week. HHS is expected to provide insurers with their final payment notifications by the end of June, and pay the remaining reimbursements starting in the third quarter.
Moving to Corporate. The loss for the quarter increased $10 million to $14 million, reflecting higher taxes and employee benefit costs. As a reminder, first quarter 2015 benefited from a tax consolidating adjustment that reversed itself during the course of last year. 
For full year 2016, we continue to expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million. The actions we are taking to build the new business operating framework and to eliminate residual expenses from Health and Employee Benefits will support a more efficient operating model for the future.
Moving to capital. We ended the first quarter with $200 million in deployable capital. In addition to the $65 million from Health that I referenced earlier, we brought up $55 million in dividends from Solutions and Specialty Property during the quarter. We also secured $250 million in short-term financing to fund share repurchases. This provided additional capital flexibility until cash proceeds from the sale of Employee Benefits are received at the holding company.
These actions allowed us to pay $32 million in shareholder dividends and repurchased $258 million worth of stock. Through April 22, we bought an additional 807,000 shares, bringing the total repurchased year-to-date to 4.2 million. So far this year, buyback activity already surpassed the full year 2015 total. At the same time, we believe ongoing cash flow generation from Solutions and Specialty Property will provide continued financial flexibility to support our current and future opportunities in the housing and lifestyle markets.
Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter results, and are committed to executing our transformation strategy to ensure long-term profitable growth in housing and lifestyle.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

We look forward to discussing our first quarter 2016 results with you today.
Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our first quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com. As noted in the release, beginning in the first quarter 2016, we revised the presentation of Assurant's results to focus on housing and lifestyle. Net operating income will now reflect contributions from our ongoing business segments: Assurant Solutions, Assurant Specialty Property and Corporate as well as interest expense. Operating results will exclude Assurant Health runoff operations, the divested Employee Benefits business and the amortization of deferred gains from dispositions.
Related prior period results in the financial supplement and in the news release have been revised to conform to the new presentation. We believe these changes provide a more meaningful presentation of our financials and better reflect our go-forward strategy.
As we continue to work through our transformation, we expect to make additional enhancements to our reporting format. Today's call will contain other non-GAAP financial measures which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the 2, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available at assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with brief remarks from Alan and Chris before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2015 Form 10-K and upcoming first quarter Form 10-Q.
Now I'll turn the call over to Alan."

Overall, we are pleased with the strong first quarter performance of our housing and lifestyle businesses.

Overall, we are pleased with the strong first quarter performance of our housing and lifestyle businesses. Our results reaffirm our confidence in the future and progress against the financial targets we shared at our Investor Day as we strengthen our company for long-term profitable growth.
During the first quarter, we continue to execute our multi-year transformation strategy. For example, the sale of Employee Benefits to Sun Life Financial closed on March 1. We expect the dividend cash proceeds to the holding company starting this quarter, subject to regulatory approval.
The wind-down of our Health operations also remains on track. Membership continued to decline to only 26,000 covered lives as of March 31, down 93% since year end. In addition, claims development from 2015 policies continued to be in line with our assumptions. During the first quarter, we began work on the go-forward operating structure under Gene Mergelmeyer as he prepares to move into the Chief Operating Officer role in July. Our goal is to leverage our enterprise scale and strengthen our competitive advantage across the global housing and lifestyle markets we serve.
In support of our transformation and growth strategy, last week, we announced Ajay Waghray will join Assurant on May 9 as our new Chief Technology Officer. Ajay joins our leadership team from Verizon with decades of global management and IT experience. At Assurant, Ajay will drive business alignment and strategy for technology across the global enterprise, and support our broader commitment outlined at Investor Day. We also expect to have the new CFO on board in the coming months. Until a successor is appointed, we appreciate that Chris will continue to perform these duties while preparing for his new role as Chief Risk Officer.
Within our segment, there are also many initiatives under way to strengthen our competitive position and expand our integrated risk offerings. At Assurant Solutions, we remain focused on executing our strategy of growing the Connected Living platform globally through innovative products and services as well as new partnerships. Longer term, we expect to double margins in Connected Living to 8% by scaling our offerings, driving operating efficiencies and managing declines in our legacy runoff businesses. These efforts, along with steady contributions from vehicle protection and pre-need, will position Solutions to deliver 10% average annual growth in net operating income over the long term.
At Assurant Specialty Property, we are expanding our fee-based, capital-light businesses. These offerings now account for 27% of the segment's revenue, and are expected to continue to grow at double digits in the long term. At the same time, we are actively managing the ongoing normalization of lender-placed with our expense management initiatives. These efforts will help Specialty Property to maintain at least a 20% operating ROE longer term.
Executing our strategy will require us to invest prudently in our targeted growth areas to further diversify and strengthen our housing and lifestyle businesses. For example, we acquired a company that provides insurance coverage for parcel deliveries via major shipping carriers. We plan to integrate their e-commerce capabilities into our other Assurant offerings to provide a seamless customer buying experience.
Last week, we also announced the purchase of renewal rights on 250,000 flood policies from Nationwide. This solidifies our position as the second-largest administrator of the National Flood Insurance Program in the United States.
Overall, we're making good progress in diversifying our offerings and establishing a more integrated operational structure. We believe this will help us build a stronger Assurant for the future.
At our March Investor Day, we introduced 3 key long-term financial targets to track our progress. During the next 5 years, we expect to do the following: deliver growth in net operating income; increase operating earnings per share on average by at least 15% annually; and expand operating ROE to 15% by 2020. These targets all exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent variability of weather.
Now I'll highlight our performance in the first quarter 2016 in relation to these long-term financial targets. Net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, declined 8% to $110 million. While we expect earnings to be down for full year 2016 driven by the normalization of lender-placed, we are preparing the company for profitable growth in 2017 and beyond.
Operating earnings per share, excluding catastrophe losses, decreased 2% from first quarter 2015 to $1.66. A decline in earnings was partially offset by share buyback activity. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI and catastrophe losses, was 12.3%, up from 12% at year end, reflecting a shift to more fee-based and capital-light businesses.
Looking at our capital position. Our balance sheet remains strong. At the end of March, holding company capital totaled $450 million. Consistent with our intent to return $1.5 billion to shareholders by the end of 2017, through April 22, we returned a total of $355 million via dividends and share repurchases, or nearly 25% of that goal. Overall, we're pleased with our progress during the first quarter. We believe our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more predictable diversified earnings, stronger cash flow generation and continued capital management flexibility.
And now I will turn to Chris who will review the results for the first quarter in additional detail. Chris?"

At Solutions, we were pleased with the improvement in underlying results from the fourth quarter of 2015. Compared to first quarter of 2015, however, net operating income declined $7 million to $47 million, primarily due to the previously disclosed loss of a domestic tablet program and declines within our legacy runoff business.
We also incurred some additional on-boarding costs related to new mobile programs expected to ramp up later in the year. Pre-need recorded a onetime $4 million net reserve and DAC adjustment associated with a block of older policies that also contributed to lower results.
Revenue at Solutions increased 5% from the prior period in 2015, driven by a higher volume of covered mobile devices globally and strong growth in vehicle protection. This was partially offset by declines at certain North American retailers and the impact from foreign exchange.
For the full year, we continue to expect growth in net operating income weighted towards the second half of 2016. New mobile programs, improved international profitability and expense initiatives within Solutions will drive the increase.
Now let's look at Specialty Property, which delivered a strong quarter despite ongoing normalization in lender-placed. Net operating income increased to $76 million, reflecting lower general expenses, more favorable loss experience and lower reinsurance costs as our risk exposure continued to decline. Results also include greater contributions from multi-family housing and mortgage solutions.
The combined ratio for lender-placed and manufactured housing risk products was 80.7%, 140 basis points better than last year. This improvement was the result of a decline in the frequency and severity of non-catastrophe claims and lower general expenses. Despite lower premiums, we expect our expense ratio for these risk-based products to move toward the long-term targeted range of 42% to 44% by 2018, though the trajectory won't be linear.
Specialty Property revenue decreased 6%. The previously disclosed loss of client business, along with placement rate and premium reductions, lowered lender-placed premiums. Multi-family housing and mortgage solutions revenue partially offset the decline. Net earned premium and fees for multi-family housing were up more than 20%. We achieved this increase through our affinity channel and expanded relationships with property management companies.
Mortgage solutions revenue increased 28%, primarily from strong organic growth in field services. In the first quarter, these fee-based, capital-light offerings generated a pretax margin of 11%, an increase of 620 basis points year-over-year. Strong organic growth is helping build the additional scale needed to reach our long-term target margin of 15% to 20%.
For the year, we expect revenue and earnings to be down at Specialty Property, as lender-placed continues to normalize. Expense savings and growth in our fee-based, capital-light offerings are expected to partially offset the decline in net operating income.
Turning to Health runoff operations. The segment reported a first quarter loss of $27 million, which was in line with our estimates. This included $10 million in severance-related costs as well as other indirect expenses not included in the previously established premium deficiency reserves.
During the quarter, we were able to dividend $65 million from Health to the holding company. We expect to dividend an additional $410 million later this year. This is subject to regulatory approval, any changes in claims experience and the final payments from the 2015 ACA risk-mitigation programs.
As of March 31, we had $487 million of recoverables related to the risk mitigation programs at Health. In the first quarter, we received an initial payment of $29 million related to the 2015 reinsurance program, and we received another $38 million payment last week. HHS is expected to provide insurers with their final payment notifications by the end of June, and pay the remaining reimbursements starting in the third quarter.
Moving to Corporate. The loss for the quarter increased $10 million to $14 million, reflecting higher taxes and employee benefit costs. As a reminder, first quarter 2015 benefited from a tax consolidating adjustment that reversed itself during the course of last year.
For full year 2016, we continue to expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million. The actions we are taking to build the new business operating framework and to eliminate residual expenses from Health and Employee Benefits will support a more efficient operating model for the future.
Moving to capital. We ended the first quarter with $200 million in deployable capital. In addition to the $65 million from Health that I referenced earlier, we brought up $55 million in dividends from Solutions and Specialty Property during the quarter. We also secured $250 million in short-term financing to fund share repurchases. This provided additional capital flexibility until cash proceeds from the sale of Employee Benefits are received at the holding company.
These actions allowed us to pay $32 million in shareholder dividends and repurchased $258 million worth of stock. Through April 22, we bought an additional 807,000 shares, bringing the total repurchased year-to-date to 4.2 million. So far this year, buyback activity already surpassed the full year 2015 total. At the same time, we believe ongoing cash flow generation from Solutions and Specialty Property will provide continued financial flexibility to support our current and future opportunities in the housing and lifestyle markets.
Overall, we are pleased with our first quarter results, and are committed to executing our transformation strategy to ensure long-term profitable growth in housing and lifestyle.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

We're still trending in line with that, and continue to expect, over time, we'll grow to that 8% margin that we've laid out in Investor Day."

Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our second quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
As noted last quarter, this year, we revised the earnings release and financial supplement to focus on housing and lifestyle. Net operating income reflects contributions from our operating segments: Assurant Solutions, Assurant Specialty Property and Corporate, as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude Assurant Health run-off operations, the amortization of deferred gains from dispositions and other variable items.
We believe these changes provide a more meaningful presentation of our financials and better reflect our go-forward strategy. On today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on those measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available at assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with prepared remarks before moving to Q&A session. Some of the statements we make on today's call may be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release, as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2015 Form 10-K and first quarter Form 10-Q.

Overall results were consistent with our outlook as we continue to execute our multiyear transformation. While earnings were down for the quarter, we believe the steps we are taking to build a more compelling business portfolio, deported by our evolution to a more integrated global operating model, will enable us to deliver profitable growth long term.
As outlined at our Investor Day in March, we measure our progress with 3 key financial metrics: net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity, all exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of weather.
Through the first 6 months of 2016, net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, decreased to 16% to $215 million, primarily due to the expected declines in lender placed, lower results from legacy business as well as the loss of the tablet program. Higher tax expenses at Corporate also contributed to the decrease.
Operating earnings per diluted share, excluding catastrophe losses, declined 9% to $3.34. Lower earnings were partially offset by share buyback activity. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI and catastrophe losses, was 11.9%, in line with 2015. Our fee-based and capital light businesses, comprising Connected Living, mortgage solutions and multi-family housing, now represent 52% of our revenue and nearly 1/3 of our earnings.
Our balance sheet remains strong, with $725 million of holding company capital as of June 30. So far, through July 22nd of this year, we have returned a total of $548 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our intent to return $1.5 billion by the end of 2017.
Let me now share some highlights from the quarter to illustrate our progress in building a stronger Assurant for the future and achieving our longer-term profitability goals.
In June, we received final notification from CMS of the 2015 ACA risk mitigation payments, which were near our estimates. This represents another important milestone in winding down our health operations.
In addition, we were able to dividend $84 million to the holding company during the second quarter. We also received $604 million in dividends related to the sale of Employee Benefits, with more expected later this year and into 2017 as we release capital formerly supporting the business. This capital, along with cash generated from solutions and Specialty Property, provides us significant flexibility to return capital to shareholders and to invest in attractive businesses where we can now perform.
This quarter, we also took several actions to strengthen our housing and lifestyle offerings. At solutions, our focus remains on growing earnings and improving margins through a combination of profitable growth and operating efficiencies worldwide.
For example, we expanded an existing OEM partnership in Chile and Italy, through the introduction of new device upgrade programs. We also launched a program with Vodafone U.K. to replace mobile phones in as a little as 4 hours of unapproved claim. Through innovative products and services such as these, we have broadened our market share and are now protecting more than 31 million devices.
To drive greater efficiency, we also implemented expense management actions at solutions, primarily focus on our legacy run-off businesses. All of these initiatives, along with steady contributions from our vehicle protection and pre-need offerings, will help us deliver on our commitment to increase net operating income by 10% on average annually over time.
At specialty Property, we're evolving the lender-placed platform as we look to enhance our market-leading position. The investments we have made to better serve homeowners and clients, together with our continued focus on compliance, remain key differentiators.
We're pleased to announce that we will start to on board approximately 700,000 loans later in the third quarter, including the return of a block of loans that was previously transferred to a competitor in 2014.
Leveraging our strong position as a trusted advisor in lender-placed, we continued to expand our offerings across the broader mortgage value chain. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of American Title, a leader in title and valuation services, specifically for home equity lenders. With nearly $50 million of annualized fees, this represents another important extension of our fee-based capital light offerings in mortgage solutions.
In addition to strengthening our business portfolio, we are realigning our operating model to better support profitable growth. On July 1, Gene Mergelmeyer moved into his role as Chief Operating Officer, overseeing all of Assurant's global business lines. In the months ahead, he will evolve our organizational structure to deliver greater coordination across our operations and improve execution. We believe this operating model will more efficiently leverage our enterprise scale to create competitive advantages in the key markets we serve. But perhaps the most important outcome of this transformation will be an ability to greater value to our customers and more opportunities for our employees.
Another important step in shaping our enterprise model is the addition of Richard, who join Assurant last week as CFO and Treasurer. Richard is an accomplished leader, holding a number of key finance positions in leading global insurance organizations over the past 22 years. His expertise will be critical in enhancing the ways in which finance supports the business, while at the same time helping us to deliver on our broader strategic objectives. He will build on Chris [indiscernible] strong track record by further integrating our global financial operations and executing our capital management strategy. I know Richard is looking forward to fostering a strong partnership between finance and risk.
On behalf of our employees, I'd also like to thank Chris for his leadership and many contributions as CFO. Now as Chris moves into a chief role,  a chief officer role, he will strengthen our robust risk management framework even more.
We've made tremendous progress executing our transformation in the first half of the year. Our focus for the balance of 2016 will be on substantially concluding the wind down of health, implementing a more integrated operating structure and positioning Assurant for profitable growth in 2017 and beyond.
Before Chris reviews our second quarter results in greater detail, I'll ask Richard to share some thoughts on what's ahead. Richard?"

I'm glad to have you on board and I look forward to working together to support Assurant's long-term strategic and financial objectives.Turning to the quarter, solutions results included $10 million of higher onetime tax benefits year-o",947,"Thanks, Richard. I'm glad to have you on board and I look forward to working together to support Assurant's long-term strategic and financial objectives.
Turning to the quarter, solutions results included $10 million of higher onetime tax benefits year-over-year. Excluding these items, earnings decreased by $9 million to $43 million. This expected decline was driven by lower production from North American retailers and the impact of the loss of the tablet program. We also incurred $2.4 million of severance-related costs as we continue to streamline non-growth operations.
Total revenue at solutions grew 3% from the prior period, due to increase covered mobile devices and double-digit growth in vehicle service contracts. Our auto business benefited from strong U.S. vehicle sales and a one-time contribution from a client.
This was partially offset by declines in certain North American retailers, the impact of the loss of the tablet program and foreign exchange volatility, particularly in Argentina.
While earnings at solutions were down for the first half of the year, performance was consistent with our outlook. For the full year 2016, we continued to expect net operating income to increase. Profitability will be driven by savings from expense initiatives, improved international profitability and the ramp-up in new mobile programs towards the end of the year.
At Specialty Property, earnings decreased year-over-year by $31 million to $57 million. $10 million of the decline was attributable to higher catastrophe losses and the remainder reflects the expected normalization of lender-placed, lower real estate owned policies and the impact from the previous loss of client business.
The combined ratio for the risk-based lender-placed and manufactured housing lines of business increased 490 basis points to 87.3%. This was the result of severe flooding and hailstorms in Texas as well as lower lender-placed revenue.
The fee-based capital light offerings generated a pretax margin of 11.2%, 250 basis points lower than the prior year, related to additional expenses to support growth in our mortgage valuation business. 
Overall, net earned premiums and fees at Specialty Property decreased 12%, primarily due to lower placement and premium rates for lender-placed as well as lower real estate owned policies. We did, however, see continued expansion in multi-family housing and mortgage solutions.
Multi-family housing revenue increased over 11% from growth in our affinity channels and property management network. Mortgage solutions fee income grew 4%, with increases in property preservation and default appraisals.
The catastrophe activity in the quarter serves an important reminder of the need for comprehensive coverage. In June, we finalized our 2016 Catastrophe Reinsurance Program, purchasing $1.4 billion of coverage on attractive terms. We also lowered our U.S. retention to $125 million, a decrease of nearly 20%, mainly due to declining exposure.
Our outlook for the segment is unchanged. We continued to expect lower revenue and profits for 2016, reflecting the normalization of lender-placed. Expense efficiencies and growth in targeted areas will partially offset the decline.
Please note that the new block of loans Alan referenced as a higher placement rate than our overall average, but it will transfer to Assurant at renewal, and therefore isn't expected to generate much premium until 2017.
Turning to health and run-off operations. The segment reported a net loss of $5 million, slightly better than expected. A reduction in estimated recoverables for the 2015 risk mitigation programs was partially offset by more favorable claims development and the pharmacy rebate. Results also included $4 million in severance-related costs as well as other indirect expenses not included in the previously established premium deficiency reserves. 
The wind down of health is moving along as planned, and we believe the risk for volatility in claims development is relatively low. In June, we received final notice from CMS regarding risk mitigation payments for 2015 ACA policies. The final amount, including a lower risk adjustment payment, is reflected in our second quarter financials. We have already received $66 million in reinsurance payments this year. And as of June 30, around $419 million of net receivables remain on our balance sheet. CMS expects to remit payments for these outstanding balances starting in the third quarter.
Year-to-date, we've taken $149 million in dividends from health. Consistent with initial estimates, we expect the holding company to receive another $325 million later this year, subject to regulatory approval and receipt of the 2015 risk mitigation payments.
Moving to Corporate. The loss for the quarter increased $10 million to $19 million, primarily due to higher taxes, which will reverse during the remainder of the year.
For full year 2016, we continued to expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million. We are working to integrate support functions and ultimately eliminate residual expenses from Employee Benefits, which will create a more efficient operating model for the future.
Moving to Capital, we ended the second quarter with $475 million in deployable capital. In addition to the $688 million of dividends from the sale of Employee Benefits and wind down of health, we received $86 million from solutions and Specialty Property during the quarter. Our strong cash flow generation and receipt of the Employee Benefits proceeds at the holding company during the quarter, allowed us to repay the $250 million of short-term financing secured earlier in the year, returned $226 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, invest $9 million in mobile technology capabilities and set aside $45 million for the July 1 closing of American Title.
Through July 22, we bought an additional 363,000 shares, bringing the total shares repurchased year-to-date to just over 6 million. Overall, we are committed to executing our transformation strategy to ensure long-term profitable growth in housing and lifestyle.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

We thought about 2016 very much as a transition year as we set up Assurant for long-term profitable growth. And we've really been focused on 3 things. One is getting our portfolio really focus on the market-leading positions we have in solutions and in property, and we feel very good about the progress with the proceeds coming up from Employee Benefits. As you heard Chris say, and I said, health is now effectively on track to the wind down. And we've been continuing to make selective investments to really strengthen our position as we did this quarter with American Title or as what we're about to do in July. The second thing we've really been focused on is getting to a more kind of agile and efficient operating model, and that includes things like moving to the Chief Operating Officer structure which really sets up opportunities for us to go after improving the coordination across our products and improving the kind of efficiency of our operations. And we brought on board significant outside talent, [indiscernible] joining us a few months ago, as a Chief Technology Officer. Richard joining us as the CFO. And the third thing we've really been focused on is deploying capital. And you've seen our commitment to return $1.5 billion over a couple of years and deploy it. We feel transition year, we said we expect earnings overall to be down, not true in solutions, but earnings overall to be down. And we feel like the progress is well underway. But with that said, Chris, you want to talk about the solutions in the second half?"

So second half '16 better than first half '16. And that full-year '16 will be higher than full-year '15. And then, of course, longer term, we do view the 10% average annual NOI growth as an achievable target. So in terms of specifics around, we did take some action on expenses, where we'll start to see the benefit in the second half. The other thing to keep in mind that the revenue growth will potentially be muted within solutions, but think about a rotation that's going on, the run-off of the big-box retailers and the non-growth credit business, for example, being offset by growth in the higher margin fee-based business, in particular, on the mobile side. So you combine this rotation to higher margin product with expense initiatives, we think you're going to see -- while you may not see revenue growth, you're going to see growth in the bottom line, and that's what we're thinking for the second half."

Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Dziadzio, who joined Assurant last week as our new Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Risk Officer and former CFO.
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our second quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
As noted last quarter, this year, we revised the earnings release and financial supplement to focus on housing and lifestyle. Net operating income reflects contributions from our operating segments: Assurant Solutions, Assurant Specialty Property and Corporate as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude Assurant Health run-off operations, the amortization of deferred gains from dispositions and other variable items.
We believe these changes provide a more meaningful presentation of our financials and better reflect our go-forward strategy. On today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on those measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available at assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with prepared remarks before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2015 Form 10-K and first quarter Form 10-Q.
Now I'll turn the call over to Alan."

Overall results were consistent with our outlook as we continue to execute our multiyear transformation. While earnings were down for the quarter, we believe the steps we are taking to build a more compelling business portfolio, supported by our evolution to a more integrated global operating model, will enable us to deliver profitable growth long term.
As outlined at our Investor Day in March, we measure our progress with 3 key financial metrics: net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity, all exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of weather.
Through the first 6 months of 2016, net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, decreased to 16% to $215 million, primarily due to the expected declines in lender placed, lower results from legacy business as well as the loss of a tablet program. Higher tax expenses at Corporate also contributed to the decrease.
Operating earnings per diluted share, excluding catastrophe losses, declined 9% to $3.34. Lower earnings were partially offset by share buyback activity. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI and catastrophe losses, was 11.9%, in line with 2015. Our fee-based and capital-light businesses, comprising Connected Living, mortgage solutions and multi-family housing, now represent 52% of our revenue and nearly 1/3 of our earnings.
Our balance sheet remains strong, with $725 million of holding company capital as of June 30. So far, through July 22 of this year, we have returned a total of $548 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our intent to return $1.5 billion by the end of 2017.
Let me now share some highlights from the quarter to illustrate our progress in building a stronger Assurant for the future and achieving our longer-term profitability goals.
In June, we received final notification from CMS of the 2015 ACA risk mitigation payments, which were near our estimates. This represents another important milestone in winding down our Health operations.
In addition, we were able to dividend $84 million to the holding company during the second quarter. We also received $604 million in dividends related to the sale of Employee Benefits, with more expected later this year and into 2017 as we release capital formerly supporting the business. This capital, along with cash generated from Solutions and Specialty Property, provides us significant flexibility to return capital to shareholders and to invest in attractive businesses where we can outperform.
This quarter, we also took several actions to strengthen our housing and lifestyle offerings. At Solutions, our focus remains on growing earnings and improving margins through a combination of profitable growth and operating efficiencies worldwide.
For example, we expanded an existing OEM partnership in Chile and Italy through the introduction of new device upgrade programs. We also launched a program with Vodafone U.K. to replace mobile phones in as a little as 4 hours of an approved claim. Through innovative products and services such as these, we have broadened our market share and are now protecting more than 31 million devices.
To drive greater efficiency, we also implemented expense management actions at Solutions, primarily focused on our legacy run-off businesses. All of these initiatives, along with steady contributions from our vehicle protection and pre-need offerings, will help us deliver on our commitment to increase net operating income by 10% on average annually over time.
At Specialty Property, we're evolving the lender-placed platform as we look to enhance our market-leading position. The investments we have made to better serve homeowners and clients, together with our continued focus on compliance, remain key differentiators.
We're pleased to announce that we will start to on board approximately 700,000 loans later in the third quarter, including the return of a block of loans that was previously transferred to a competitor in 2014.
Leveraging our strong position as a trusted adviser in lender placed, we continue to expand our offerings across the broader mortgage value chain. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of American Title, a leader in title and valuation services, specifically for home equity lenders. With nearly $50 million of annualized fees, this represents another important extension of our fee-based, capital-light offerings in mortgage solutions.
In addition to strengthening our business portfolio, we are realigning our operating model to better support profitable growth. On July 1, Gene Mergelmeyer moved into his role as Chief Operating Officer, overseeing all of Assurant's global business lines. In the months ahead, he will evolve our organizational structure to deliver greater coordination across our operations and improve execution. We believe this operating model will more efficiently leverage our enterprise scale to create competitive advantages in the key markets we serve. But perhaps the most important outcome of this transformation will be an ability to deliver greater value to our customers and more opportunities for our employees.
Another important step in shaping our enterprise model is the addition of Richard Dziadzio, who joined Assurant last week as CFO and Treasurer. Richard is an accomplished leader, holding a number of key finance positions in leading global insurance organizations over the past 22 years. His expertise will be critical in enhancing the ways in which finance supports the business while, at the same time, helping us to deliver on our broader strategic objectives. He will build on Chris Pagano's strong track record by further integrating our global financial operations and executing our capital management strategy. I know Richard is looking forward to fostering a strong partnership between Finance and Risk.
On behalf of our employees, I'd also like to thank Chris for his leadership and many contributions as CFO. Now as Chris moves into the chief role -- Chief Risk Officer role, he will strengthen our robust risk management framework even more.
We've made tremendous progress executing our transformation in the first half of the year. Our focus for the balance of 2016 will be on substantially concluding the wind down of Health, implementing a more integrated operating structure and positioning Assurant for profitable growth in 2017 and beyond.
Before Chris reviews our second quarter results in greater detail, I'll ask Richard to share some thoughts on what's ahead. Richard?"

I also view our strong cash flow generation and disciplined approach to capital management as key differentiators. We will continue to return capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, while also investing in specialty businesses to strengthen our capabilities, offerings and distribution channels.
In the next several months, I'll focus on aligning the finance team with our new global operating model to support growth in housing and lifestyle and I'll work to evolve our financial reporting framework. 
Since joining Assurant last week, I received strong support from Alan, Chris and the senior leadership team as well as the entire finance organization. In the near term, I will spend time listening to understand where we're strong, while continuing to enhance our process and approach.
During this period, I will have the opportunity to visit with many of you, and I look forward to it. With that, I will turn the call over to Chris to review the quarter in more detail."

I'm glad to have you onboard, and I look forward to working together to support Assurant's long-term strategic and financial objectives.Turning to the quarter, Solutions results included $10 million of higher onetime tax benefits year-o",946,"Thanks, Richard. I'm glad to have you onboard, and I look forward to working together to support Assurant's long-term strategic and financial objectives.
Turning to the quarter, Solutions results included $10 million of higher onetime tax benefits year-over-year. Excluding these items, earnings decreased by $9 million to $43 million. This expected decline was driven by lower production from North American retailers and the impact of the loss of a tablet program. We also incurred $2.4 million of severance-related costs as we continue to streamline non-growth operations.
Total revenue at Solutions grew 3% from the prior period, due to increase covered mobile devices and double-digit growth in vehicle service contracts. Our auto business benefited from strong U.S. vehicle sales and a onetime contribution from a client.
This was partially offset by declines in certain North American retailers, the impact of the loss of the tablet program and foreign exchange volatility, particularly in Argentina.
While earnings at solutions were down for the first half of the year, performance was consistent with our outlook. For the full year 2016, we continued to expect net operating income to increase. Profitability will be driven by savings from expense initiatives, improved international profitability and the ramp-up in new mobile programs toward the end of the year.
At Specialty Property, earnings decreased year-over-year by $31 million to $57 million. $10 million of the decline was attributable to higher catastrophe losses and the remainder reflects the expected normalization of lender placed, lower real estate owned policies and the impact from the previous loss of client business.
The combined ratio for the risk-based lender-placed and manufactured housing lines of business increased 490 basis points to 87.3%. This was the result of severe flooding and hailstorms in Texas as well as lower lender-placed revenue.
The fee-based, capital-light offerings generated a pretax margin of 11.2%, 250 basis points lower than the prior year, related to additional expenses to support growth in our mortgage valuation business. 
Overall net earned premiums and fees at Specialty Property decreased 12%, primarily due to lower placement and premium rates for lender placed as well as lower real estate-owned policies. We did, however, see continued expansion in multi-family housing and mortgage solutions.
Multi-family housing revenue increased over 11% from growth in our affinity channels and property management network. Mortgage solutions fee income grew 4%, with increases in property preservation and default appraisals.
The catastrophe activity in the quarter serves as an important reminder of the need for comprehensive coverage. In June, we finalized our 2016 Catastrophe Reinsurance Program, purchasing $1.4 billion of coverage on attractive terms. We also lowered our U.S. retention to $125 million, a decrease of nearly 20%, mainly due to declining exposure.
Our outlook for the segment is unchanged. We continue to expect lower revenue and profits for 2016, reflecting the normalization of lender placed. Expense efficiencies and growth in targeted areas will partially offset the decline.
Please note that the new block of loans Alan referenced has a higher placement rate than our overall average, but it will transfer to Assurant at renewal and, therefore, isn't expected to generate much premium until 2017.
Turning to Health and run-off operations. The segment reported a net loss of $5 million, slightly better than expected. A reduction in estimated recoverables for the 2015 risk mitigation programs was partially offset by more favorable claims development and a pharmacy rebate. Results also included $4 million in severance-related costs as well as other indirect expenses not included in a previously established premium deficiency reserves. 
The wind-down of health is moving along as planned, and we believe the risk for volatility in claims development is relatively low. In June, we received final notice from CMS regarding risk mitigation payments for 2015 ACA policies. The final amount, including a lower risk adjustment payment, is reflected in our second quarter financials. We have already received $66 million in reinsurance payments this year. And as of June 30, around $419 million of net receivables remain on our balance sheet. CMS expects to remit payments for these outstanding balances starting in the third quarter.
Year-to-date, we've taken $149 million in dividends from Health. Consistent with initial estimates, we expect the holding company to receive another $325 million later this year, subject to regulatory approval and receipt of the 2015 risk mitigation payments.
Moving to Corporate. The loss for the quarter increased $10 million to $19 million, primarily due to higher taxes, which will reverse during the remainder of the year.
For full year 2016, we continue to expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million. We are working to integrate support functions and ultimately eliminate residual expenses from Employee Benefits, which will create a more efficient operating model for the future.
Moving to capital. We ended the second quarter with $475 million in deployable capital. In addition to the $688 million of dividends from the sale of Employee Benefits and wind-down of Health, we received $86 million from Solutions and Specialty Property during the quarter. Our strong cash flow generation and receipt of the Employee Benefits proceeds at the holding company during the quarter allowed us to repay the $250 million of short-term financing secured earlier in the year, return $226 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, invest $9 million in mobile technology capabilities and set aside $45 million for the July 1 closing of American Title.
Through July 22, we bought an additional 363,000 shares, bringing the total shares repurchased year-to-date to just over 6 million. Overall, we are committed to executing our transformation strategy to ensure long-term profitable growth in housing and lifestyle.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

One is getting our portfolio really focused on the market-leading positions we have in Solutions and in Property, and we feel very good about the progress with the proceeds coming up from Employee Benefits. As you heard Chris say, and I said, Health is now effectively on track to the wind-down. And we've been continuing to make selective investments to really strengthen our position, as we did this quarter with American Title -- or as we're about to do in July. The second thing we've really been focused on is getting to a more kind of agile, efficient operating model, and that includes things like moving to the Chief Operating Officer structure, which really sets up opportunities for us to go after improving the coordination across our products and improving the kind of efficiency of our operations. And we've brought onboard significant outside talent, Ajay Waghray joining us a few months ago as the Chief Technology Officer; Richard joining us as the CFO. And the third thing we've really been focused on is deploying capital. And you've seen our commitment to return $1.5 billion over a couple of years and deploy it. So we feel -- yes, transition year, we said we expect earnings overall to be down, not true in Solutions, but earnings overall to be down. And we feel like the progress is well under way. But with that said, Chris, you want to talk about Solutions in the second half?"

And then, of course, longer term, we do view the 10% average annual NOI growth as an achievable target. So in terms of specifics around -- we did take some action on expenses, where we'll start to see the benefit in the second half. The other thing to keep in mind is that the revenue growth will potentially be muted within Solutions, but think about a rotation that's going on, the run-off of the big-box retailers and the non-growth credit business, for example, being offset by growth in the higher-margin fee-based business, in particular, on the mobile side. So you combine this rotation to higher-margin product with expense initiatives, we think you're going to see -- while you may not see revenue growth, you're going to see growth in the bottom line, and that's what we're thinking for the second half."

Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Dziadzio, who joined Assurant last week as our new Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Risk Officer and former CFO.
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our second quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
As noted last quarter, this year, we revised the earnings release and financial supplement to focus on housing and lifestyle. Net operating income reflects contributions from our operating segments: Assurant Solutions, Assurant Specialty Property and Corporate as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude Assurant Health run-off operations, the amortization of deferred gains from dispositions and other variable items.
We believe these changes provide a more meaningful presentation of our financials and better reflect our go-forward strategy. On today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on those measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available at assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with prepared remarks before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2015 Form 10-K and first quarter Form 10-Q.
Now I'll turn the call over to Alan."

Overall results were consistent with our outlook as we continue to execute our multi-year transformation. While earnings were down for the quarter, we believe the steps we are taking to build a more compelling business portfolio, supported by our evolution to a more integrated global operating model, will enable us to deliver profitable growth long term.
As outlined at our Investor Day in March, we measure our progress with 3 key financial metrics: net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity, all exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of weather.
Through the first 6 months of 2016, net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, decreased to 16% to $215 million, primarily due to the expected declines in lender placed, lower results from legacy business as well as the loss of a tablet program. Higher tax expenses at Corporate also contributed to the decrease.
Operating earnings per diluted share, excluding catastrophe losses, declined 9% to $3.34. Lower earnings were partially offset by share buyback activity. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI and catastrophe losses, was 11.9%, in line with 2015. Our fee-based and capital-light businesses, comprising Connected Living, mortgage solutions and multi-family housing, now represent 52% of our revenue and nearly 1/3 of our earnings.
Our balance sheet remains strong, with $725 million of holding company capital as of June 30. So far, through July 22 of this year, we have returned a total of $548 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our intent to return $1.5 billion by the end of 2017.
Let me now share some highlights from the quarter to illustrate our progress in building a stronger Assurant for the future and achieving our longer-term profitability goals.
In June, we received final notification from CMS of the 2015 ACA risk mitigation payments, which were near our estimates. This represents another important milestone in winding down our Health operations.
In addition, we were able to dividend $84 million to the holding company during the second quarter. We also received $604 million in dividends related to the sale of Employee Benefits, with more expected later this year and into 2017 as we release capital formerly supporting the business. This capital, along with cash generated from Solutions and Specialty Property, provides us significant flexibility to return capital to shareholders and to invest in attractive businesses where we can outperform.
This quarter, we also took several actions to strengthen our housing and lifestyle offerings. At Solutions, our focus remains on growing earnings and improving margins through a combination of profitable growth and operating efficiencies worldwide.
For example, we expanded an existing OEM partnership in Chile and Italy through the introduction of new device upgrade programs. We also launched a program with Vodafone U.K. to replace mobile phones in as a little as 4 hours of an approved claim. Through innovative products and services such as these, we have broadened our market share and are now protecting more than 31 million devices.
To drive greater efficiency, we also implemented expense management actions at Solutions, primarily focused on our legacy run-off businesses. All of these initiatives, along with steady contributions from our vehicle protection and pre-need offerings, will help us deliver on our commitment to increase net operating income by 10% on average annually over time.
At Specialty Property, we're evolving the lender-placed platform as we look to enhance our market-leading position. The investments we have made to better serve homeowners and clients, together with our continued focus on compliance, remain key differentiators.
We're pleased to announce that we will start to on-board approximately 700,000 loans later in the third quarter, including the return of a block of loans that was previously transferred to a competitor in 2014.
Leveraging our strong position as a trusted adviser in lender-placed, we continue to expand our offerings across the broader mortgage value chain. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of American Title, a leader in title and valuation services, specifically for home equity lenders. With nearly $50 million of annualized fees, this represents another important extension of our fee-based, capital-light offerings in mortgage solutions.
In addition to strengthening our business portfolio, we are realigning our operating model to better support profitable growth. On July 1, Gene Mergelmeyer moved into his role as Chief Operating Officer, overseeing all of Assurant's global business lines. In the months ahead, he will evolve our organizational structure to deliver greater coordination across our operations and improve execution. We believe this operating model will more efficiently leverage our enterprise scale to create competitive advantages in the key markets we serve. But perhaps the most important outcome of this transformation will be an ability to deliver greater value to our customers and more opportunities for our employees.
Another important step in shaping our enterprise model is the addition of Richard Dziadzio, who joined Assurant last week as CFO and Treasurer. Richard is an accomplished leader, holding a number of key finance positions in leading global insurance organizations over the past 22 years. His expertise will be critical in enhancing the ways in which finance supports the business while, at the same time, helping us to deliver on our broader strategic objectives. He will build on Chris Pagano's strong track record by further integrating our global financial operations and executing our capital management strategy. I know Richard is looking forward to fostering a strong partnership between Finance and Risk.
On behalf of our employees, I'd also like to thank Chris for his leadership and many contributions as CFO. Now as Chris moves into the chief role -- Chief Risk Officer role, he will strengthen our robust risk management framework even more.
We've made tremendous progress executing our transformation in the first half of the year. Our focus for the balance of 2016 will be on substantially concluding the wind down of Health, implementing a more integrated operating structure and positioning Assurant for profitable growth in 2017 and beyond.
Before Chris reviews our second quarter results in greater detail, I'll ask Richard to share some thoughts on what's ahead. Richard?"

I'm glad to have you onboard, and I look forward to working together to support Assurant's long-term strategic and financial objectives.
Turning to the quarter, Solutions results included $10 million of higher onetime tax benefits year-over-year. Excluding these items, earnings decreased by $9 million to $43 million. This expected decline was driven by lower production from North American retailers and the impact of the loss of the tablet program. We also incurred $2.4 million of severance-related costs as we continue to streamline non-growth operations.
Total revenue at Solutions grew 3% from the prior period, due to increase covered mobile devices and double-digit growth in vehicle service contracts. Our auto business benefited from strong U.S. vehicle sales and a onetime contribution from a client.
This was partially offset by declines in certain North American retailers, the impact of the loss of the tablet program and foreign exchange volatility, particularly in Argentina.
While earnings at solutions were down for the first half of the year, performance was consistent with our outlook. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect net operating income to increase. Profitability will be driven by savings from expense initiatives, improved international profitability and the ramp-up in new mobile programs toward the end of the year.
At Specialty Property, earnings decreased year-over-year by $31 million to $57 million. $10 million of the decline was attributable to higher catastrophe losses and the remainder reflects the expected normalization of lender placed, lower real estate owned policies and the impact from the previous loss of client business.
The combined ratio for the risk-based lender-placed and manufactured housing lines of business increased 490 basis points to 87.3%. This was the result of severe flooding and hailstorms in Texas as well as lower lender-placed revenue.
The fee-based, capital-light offerings generated a pretax margin of 11.2%, 250 basis points lower than the prior year, related to additional expenses to support growth in our mortgage valuation business. 
Overall net earned premiums and fees at Specialty Property decreased 12%, primarily due to lower placement and premium rates for lender placed as well as lower real estate-owned policies. We did, however, see continued expansion in multi-family housing and mortgage solutions.
Multi-family housing revenue increased over 11% from growth in our affinity channels and property management network. Mortgage solutions fee income grew 4%, with increases in property preservation and default appraisals.
The catastrophe activity in the quarter serves as an important reminder of the need for comprehensive coverage. In June, we finalized our 2016 Catastrophe Reinsurance Program, purchasing $1.4 billion of coverage on attractive terms. We also lowered our U.S. retention to $125 million, a decrease of nearly 20%, mainly due to declining exposure.
Our outlook for the segment is unchanged. We continue to expect lower revenue and profits for 2016, reflecting the normalization of lender placed. Expense efficiencies and growth in targeted areas will partially offset the decline.
Please note that the new block of loans Alan referenced has a higher placement rate than our overall average, but it will transfer to Assurant at renewal and, therefore, isn't expected to generate much premium until 2017.
Turning to Health and runoff operations. The segment reported a net loss of $5 million, slightly better than expected. A reduction in estimated recoverables for the 2015 risk mitigation programs was partially offset by more favorable claims development and a pharmacy rebate. Results also included $4 million in severance-related costs as well as other indirect expenses not included in the previously established premium deficiency reserves. 
The wind down of health is moving along as planned, and we believe the risk for volatility in claims development is relatively low. In June, we received final notice from CMS regarding risk mitigation payments for 2015 ACA policies. The final amount, including a lower risk adjustment payment, is reflected in our second quarter financials. We have already received $66 million in reinsurance payments this year. And as of June 30, around $419 million of net receivables remain on our balance sheet. CMS expects to remit payments for these outstanding balances starting in the third quarter.
Year-to-date, we've taken $149 million in dividends from Health. Consistent with initial estimates, we expect the holding company to receive another $325 million later this year, subject to regulatory approval and receipt of the 2015 risk mitigation payments.
Moving to Corporate. The loss for the quarter increased $10 million to $19 million, primarily due to higher taxes, which will reverse during the remainder of the year.
For full year 2016, we continue to expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million. We are working to integrate support functions and ultimately eliminate residual expenses from Employee Benefits, which will create a more efficient operating model for the future.
Moving to capital. We ended the second quarter with $475 million in deployable capital. In addition to the $688 million of dividends from the sale of Employee Benefits and wind down of Health, we received $86 million from Solutions and Specialty Property during the quarter. Our strong cash flow generation and receipt of the Employee Benefits proceeds at the holding company during the quarter allowed us to repay the $250 million of short-term financing secured earlier in the year, return $226 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, invest $9 million in mobile technology capabilities and set aside $45 million for the July 1 closing of American Title.
Through July 22, we bought an additional 363,000 shares, bringing the total shares repurchased year-to-date to just over 6 million. Overall, we are committed to executing our transformation strategy to ensure long-term profitable growth in housing and lifestyle.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

We thought about 2016 very much as a transition year as we set up Assurant for long-term profitable growth. And we've really been focused on 3 things. One is getting our portfolio really focused on the market-leading positions we have in Solutions and in Property, and we feel very good about the progress with the proceeds coming up from Employee Benefits. As you heard Chris say, and I said, Health is now effectively on track to the wind-down. And we've been continuing to make selective investments to really strengthen our position, as we did this quarter with American Title -- or as we're about to do in July. The second thing we've really been focused on is getting to a more kind of agile, efficient operating model, and that includes things like moving to the Chief Operating Officer structure, which really sets up opportunities for us to go after improving the coordination across our products and improving the kind of efficiency of our operations. And we've brought onboard significant outside talent, Ajay Waghray joining us a few months ago as the Chief Technology Officer; Richard joining us as the CFO. And the third thing we've really been focused on is deploying capital. And you've seen our commitment to return $1.5 billion over a couple of years and deploy it. So we feel -- yes, transition year, we said we expect earnings overall to be down, not true in Solutions, but earnings overall to be down. And we feel like the progress is well under way. But with that said, Chris, you want to talk about Solutions in the second half?"

Seth, so again, we don't comment on specific clients, but what I can tell you around the mobile business and what we're looking at for the second half is first half was weaker but as expected. We do think that we're still comfortable with our expectations, our outlook that the second half of the year will be better than the first half, so second half '16 better than first half '16; and that full year '16 will be higher than full year '15. And then, of course, longer term, we do view the 10% average annual NOI growth as an achievable target. So in terms of specifics around -- we did take some action on expenses, where we'll start to see the benefit in the second half. The other thing to keep in mind is that the revenue growth will potentially be muted within Solutions, but think about a rotation that's going on, the run-off of the big-box retailers and the non-growth credit business, for example, being offset by growth in the higher-margin fee-based business, in particular, on the mobile side. So you combine this rotation to higher-margin product with expense initiatives, we think you're going to see -- while you may not see revenue growth, you're going to see growth in the bottom line, and that's what we're thinking for the second half."

Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Richard Dziadzio, who joined Assurant last week as our new Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Chris Pagano, our Chief Risk Officer and former CFO.
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our second quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
As noted last quarter, this year, we revised the earnings release and financial supplement to focus on housing and lifestyle. Net operating income reflects contributions from our operating segments: Assurant Solutions, Assurant Specialty Property and Corporate as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude Assurant Health run-off operations, the amortization of deferred gains from dispositions and other variable items.
We believe these changes provide a more meaningful presentation of our financials and better reflect our go-forward strategy. On today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on those measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available at assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with prepared remarks before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking, and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2015 Form 10-K and first quarter Form 10-Q.
Now I'll turn the call over to Alan."

Overall results were consistent with our outlook as we continue to execute our multi-year transformation. While earnings were down for the quarter, we believe the steps we are taking to build a more compelling business portfolio, supported by our evolution to a more integrated global operating model, will enable us to deliver profitable growth long term.
As outlined at our Investor Day in March, we measure our progress with 3 key financial metrics: net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity, all exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of weather.
Through the first 6 months of 2016, net operating income, excluding reportable catastrophe losses, decreased to 16% to $215 million, primarily due to the expected declines in lender placed, lower results from legacy business as well as the loss of a tablet program. Higher tax expenses at Corporate also contributed to the decrease.
Operating earnings per diluted share, excluding catastrophe losses, declined 9% to $3.34. Lower earnings were partially offset by share buyback activity. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI and catastrophe losses, was 11.9%, in line with 2015. Our fee-based and capital-light businesses, comprising Connected Living, mortgage solutions and multi-family housing, now represent 52% of our revenue and nearly 1/3 of our earnings.
Our balance sheet remains strong, with $725 million of holding company capital as of June 30. So far, through July 22 of this year, we have returned a total of $548 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, consistent with our intent to return $1.5 billion by the end of 2017.
Let me now share some highlights from the quarter to illustrate our progress in building a stronger Assurant for the future and achieving our longer-term profitability goals.
In June, we received final notification from CMS of the 2015 ACA risk mitigation payments, which were near our estimates. This represents another important milestone in winding down our Health operations.
In addition, we were able to dividend $84 million to the holding company during the second quarter. We also received $604 million in dividends related to the sale of Employee Benefits, with more expected later this year and into 2017 as we release capital formerly supporting the business. This capital, along with cash generated from Solutions and Specialty Property, provides us significant flexibility to return capital to shareholders and to invest in attractive businesses where we can outperform.
This quarter, we also took several actions to strengthen our housing and lifestyle offerings. At Solutions, our focus remains on growing earnings and improving margins through a combination of profitable growth and operating efficiencies worldwide.
For example, we expanded an existing OEM partnership in Chile and Italy through the introduction of new device upgrade programs. We also launched a program with Vodafone U.K. to replace mobile phones in as a little as 4 hours of an approved claim. Through innovative products and services such as these, we have broadened our market share and are now protecting more than 31 million devices.
To drive greater efficiency, we also implemented expense management actions at Solutions, primarily focused on our legacy run-off businesses. All of these initiatives, along with steady contributions from our vehicle protection and pre-need offerings, will help us deliver on our commitment to increase net operating income by 10% on average annually over time.
At Specialty Property, we're evolving the lender-placed platform as we look to enhance our market-leading position. The investments we have made to better serve homeowners and clients, together with our continued focus on compliance, remain key differentiators.
We're pleased to announce that we will start to on-board approximately 700,000 loans later in the third quarter, including the return of a block of loans that was previously transferred to a competitor in 2014.
Leveraging our strong position as a trusted adviser in lender-placed, we continue to expand our offerings across the broader mortgage value chain. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of American Title, a leader in title and valuation services, specifically for home equity lenders. With nearly $50 million of annualized fees, this represents another important extension of our fee-based, capital-light offerings in mortgage solutions.
In addition to strengthening our business portfolio, we are realigning our operating model to better support profitable growth. On July 1, Gene Mergelmeyer moved into his role as Chief Operating Officer, overseeing all of Assurant's global business lines. In the months ahead, he will evolve our organizational structure to deliver greater coordination across our operations and improve execution. We believe this operating model will more efficiently leverage our enterprise scale to create competitive advantages in the key markets we serve. But perhaps the most important outcome of this transformation will be an ability to deliver greater value to our customers and more opportunities for our employees.
Another important step in shaping our enterprise model is the addition of Richard Dziadzio, who joined Assurant last week as CFO and Treasurer. Richard is an accomplished leader, holding a number of key finance positions in leading global insurance organizations over the past 22 years. His expertise will be critical in enhancing the ways in which finance supports the business while, at the same time, helping us to deliver on our broader strategic objectives. He will build on Chris Pagano's strong track record by further integrating our global financial operations and executing our capital management strategy. I know Richard is looking forward to fostering a strong partnership between Finance and Risk.
On behalf of our employees, I'd also like to thank Chris for his leadership and many contributions as CFO. Now as Chris moves into the chief role -- Chief Risk Officer role, he will strengthen our robust risk management framework even more.
We've made tremendous progress executing our transformation in the first half of the year. Our focus for the balance of 2016 will be on substantially concluding the wind down of Health, implementing a more integrated operating structure and positioning Assurant for profitable growth in 2017 and beyond.
Before Chris reviews our second quarter results in greater detail, I'll ask Richard to share some thoughts on what's ahead. Richard?"

In the next several months, I'll focus on aligning the finance team with our new global operating model to support growth in housing and lifestyle and I'll work to evolve our financial reporting framework. 
Since joining Assurant last week, I received strong support from Alan, Chris and the senior leadership team as well as the entire finance organization. In the near term, I will spend time listening to understand where we're strong, while continuing to enhance our process and approach.

I'm glad to have you onboard, and I look forward to working together to support Assurant's long-term strategic and financial objectives.Turning to the quarter, Solutions results included $10 million of higher onetime tax benefits year-o",948,"Thanks, Richard. I'm glad to have you onboard, and I look forward to working together to support Assurant's long-term strategic and financial objectives.
Turning to the quarter, Solutions results included $10 million of higher onetime tax benefits year-over-year. Excluding these items, earnings decreased by $9 million to $43 million. This expected decline was driven by lower production from North American retailers and the impact of the loss of the tablet program. We also incurred $2.4 million of severance-related costs as we continue to streamline non-growth operations.
Total revenue at Solutions grew 3% from the prior period, due to increase covered mobile devices and double-digit growth in vehicle service contracts. Our auto business benefited from strong U.S. vehicle sales and a onetime contribution from a client.
This was partially offset by declines in certain North American retailers, the impact of the loss of the tablet program and foreign exchange volatility, particularly in Argentina.
While earnings at solutions were down for the first half of the year, performance was consistent with our outlook. For the full year 2016, we continue to expect net operating income to increase. Profitability will be driven by savings from expense initiatives, improved international profitability and the ramp-up in new mobile programs toward the end of the year.
At Specialty Property, earnings decreased year-over-year by $31 million to $57 million. $10 million of the decline was attributable to higher catastrophe losses and the remainder reflects the expected normalization of lender placed, lower real estate owned policies and the impact from the previous loss of client business.
The combined ratio for the risk-based lender-placed and manufactured housing lines of business increased 490 basis points to 87.3%. This was the result of severe flooding and hailstorms in Texas as well as lower lender-placed revenue.
The fee-based, capital-light offerings generated a pretax margin of 11.2%, 250 basis points lower than the prior year, related to additional expenses to support growth in our mortgage valuation business. 
Overall net earned premiums and fees at Specialty Property decreased 12%, primarily due to lower placement and premium rates for lender placed as well as lower real estate-owned policies. We did, however, see continued expansion in multi-family housing and mortgage solutions.
Multi-family housing revenue increased over 11% from growth in our affinity channels and property management network. Mortgage solutions fee income grew 4%, with increases in property preservation and default appraisals.
The catastrophe activity in the quarter serves as an important reminder of the need for comprehensive coverage. In June, we finalized our 2016 Catastrophe Reinsurance Program, purchasing $1.4 billion of coverage on attractive terms. We also lowered our U.S. retention to $125 million, a decrease of nearly 20%, mainly due to declining exposure.
Our outlook for the segment is unchanged. We continue to expect lower revenue and profits for 2016, reflecting the normalization of lender placed. Expense efficiencies and growth in targeted areas will partially offset the decline.
Please note that the new block of loans Alan referenced has a higher placement rate than our overall average, but it will transfer to Assurant at renewal and, therefore, isn't expected to generate much premium until 2017.
Turning to Health and runoff operations. The segment reported a net loss of $5 million, slightly better than expected. A reduction in estimated recoverables for the 2015 risk mitigation programs was partially offset by more favorable claims development and a pharmacy rebate. Results also included $4 million in severance-related costs as well as other indirect expenses not included in the previously established premium deficiency reserves. 
The wind down of health is moving along as planned, and we believe the risk for volatility in claims development is relatively low. In June, we received final notice from CMS regarding risk mitigation payments for 2015 ACA policies. The final amount, including a lower risk adjustment payment, is reflected in our second quarter financials. We have already received $66 million in reinsurance payments this year. And as of June 30, around $419 million of net receivables remain on our balance sheet. CMS expects to remit payments for these outstanding balances starting in the third quarter.
Year-to-date, we've taken $149 million in dividends from Health. Consistent with initial estimates, we expect the holding company to receive another $325 million later this year, subject to regulatory approval and receipt of the 2015 risk mitigation payments.
Moving to Corporate. The loss for the quarter increased $10 million to $19 million, primarily due to higher taxes, which will reverse during the remainder of the year.
For full year 2016, we continue to expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million. We are working to integrate support functions and ultimately eliminate residual expenses from Employee Benefits, which will create a more efficient operating model for the future.
Moving to capital. We ended the second quarter with $475 million in deployable capital. In addition to the $688 million of dividends from the sale of Employee Benefits and wind down of Health, we received $86 million from Solutions and Specialty Property during the quarter. Our strong cash flow generation and receipt of the Employee Benefits proceeds at the holding company during the quarter allowed us to repay the $250 million of short-term financing secured earlier in the year, return $226 million to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends, invest $9 million in mobile technology capabilities and set aside $45 million for the July 1 closing of American Title.
Through July 22, we bought an additional 363,000 shares, bringing the total shares repurchased year-to-date to just over 6 million. Overall, we are committed to executing our transformation strategy to ensure long-term profitable growth in housing and lifestyle.
And with that, operator, please open the call for questions."

One is getting our portfolio really focused on the market-leading positions we have in Solutions and in Property, and we feel very good about the progress with the proceeds coming up from Employee Benefits. As you heard Chris say, and I said, Health is now effectively on track to the wind-down. And we've been continuing to make selective investments to really strengthen our position, as we did this quarter with American Title -- or as we're about to do in July. The second thing we've really been focused on is getting to a more kind of agile, efficient operating model, and that includes things like moving to the Chief Operating Officer structure, which really sets up opportunities for us to go after improving the coordination across our products and improving the kind of efficiency of our operations. And we've brought onboard significant outside talent, Ajay Waghray joining us a few months ago as the Chief Technology Officer; Richard joining us as the CFO. And the third thing we've really been focused on is deploying capital. And you've seen our commitment to return $1.5 billion over a couple of years and deploy it. So we feel -- yes, transition year, we said we expect earnings overall to be down, not true in Solutions, but earnings overall to be down. And we feel like the progress is well under way.

And then, of course, longer term, we do view the 10% average annual NOI growth as an achievable target. So in terms of specifics around -- we did take some action on expenses, where we'll start to see the benefit in the second half. The other thing to keep in mind is that the revenue growth will potentially be muted within Solutions, but think about a rotation that's going on, the run-off of the big-box retailers and the non-growth credit business, for example, being offset by growth in the higher-margin fee-based business, in particular, on the mobile side. So you combine this rotation to higher-margin product with expense initiatives, we think you're going to see -- while you may not see revenue growth, you're going to see growth in the bottom line, and that's what we're thinking for the second half."

We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2016 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our third quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
Earlier this year, we revised the earnings release and financial supplement to focus on Housing and Lifestyle. Net operating income reflects contributions from our operating segments: Assurant Solutions, Specialty Property and Corporate as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude Assurant Health runoff operations, the amortization of deferred gains from dispositions and other variable items. We believe these changes provide a more meaningful representation of our financials and better reflect our go-forward strategy. 
On today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with prepared remarks before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2015 Form 10-K and first quarter Form 10-Q.

Overall performance for the third quarter was disappointing and fell short of our expectations. As we announced last week, the year-over-year decline in earnings was driven by increased catastrophe losses as well as lower than expected mobile results. However, we don't believe this quarter is reflective of the long-term potential of our housing and lifestyle offerings. 
Throughout this year, we've implemented the critical building blocks of our transformation. We've done so, first, by ensuring we're focused on the most attractive housing and lifestyle markets, where we can achieve leadership positions and generate attractive returns. And second, by implementing a more integrated organizational framework that will enable us to become more efficient and effective.
Starting with Lifestyle, mobile and the broader Connected Living market offer attractive opportunities for growth. So far in 2016, we've added new partnerships and expanded our fee-based offerings across distribution channels. We're also taking steps to expand margins over time by ensuring we have the appropriate platforms and cost structures in place across our operations worldwide. Critical is the more robust technology infrastructures that maximizes our global capabilities.
Together, these actions set a stronger foundation for future profitable growth. While we no longer expect Solutions net operating income to increase this year, we remain confident that we have the right strategy, business mix and capabilities to deliver 10% average annual growth in net operating income over the long term.
Turning to Housing, we've invested in the transformation of our lender placed platform to further strengthen our leadership position in this important market. Just this quarter, we added a total of 2.7 million loans from 2 new clients and the block of loans we announced last quarter. We believe these wins demonstrate our clients' recognition of our strong platform, compliance processes and superior customer service.
The severe flooding in Louisiana and Hurricane Matthew are reminders of the importance of our products to homeowners across the country. Our commitment is brought to life by the rigor and dedication of our employees as they assess damages and pay claims as promptly as possible. To date, on behalf of Louisiana homeowners, we process more than 2,000 claims with an over 95% completion rate. In addition, we also helped to administer claims for the National Flood Insurance Program as its second largest administrator.
Just this month, Hurricane Matthew inflicted severe flooding and wind damage, particularly in parts of Georgia, the Carolinas and the Caribbean. Our claims field adjusters were again on site shortly after the hurricane passed through these regions to assess damage and begin processing claims.
While it's still very early, we estimate losses from Hurricane Matthew could total up to $70 million after tax. This estimate is still preliminary, and we will update the market as we have a more complete view of the impact.
The wind down of Assurant Health is moving along as scheduled and represents another key aspect of our portfolio realignment. In the third quarter, we took an additional $189 million in dividends from Health. These dividends, along with capital releases from the sale of Employee Benefits, give us the added flexibility to return capital to shareholders and invest in housing and lifestyle markets where we can outperform long term.
In 2016, we also took several steps to transform our organizational model worldwide, focusing on both functional areas and our lines of business. We've now set the foundation for a global business unit structure under the leadership of [indiscernible] as or Chief Operating Officer. We're also realigning our technology, risk, strategy and financial organizations and expect to have that work completed by year-end.
As part of that effort, Richard and the finance team are also evaluating our financial reporting framework. We expect changes to be implemented early next year.
Our work to transform Assurant and build a strong future is on track. As we look ahead to 2017, our focus will be on profitable growth. To accomplish this, we'll continue to offer innovative products and services to meet consumer needs as well as completing the rollout of our new operating model to enhance efficiency across our global operations. And we'll continue to prudently deploy capital to maximize returns.
Progress will be measured against 3 key financial metrics: Net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity. All of these metrics exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of weather.
Through the 9 months of 2016, net operating income decreased by 14% to $308 million, primarily due to the expected decline of underplaced, the loss of the tablet program and lower contributions from legacy businesses.
Operating earnings per diluted share declined 6% to $4.89 driven by the factors I noted earlier. As we execute our transformation, we expect to grow net operating income and deploy capital prudently to support average annual operating EPS growth to 15% over time.
Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 11.3%. Expansion of our fee-based offerings will be an important driver to achieve our goal of 15% operating ROE by 2020.
At the end of September, holding company capital totaled $875 million after returning $783 million to shareholders through the first 9 months of 2016. This return represents more than half of our commitment to return $1.5 billion of capital through dividends and buybacks by the end of 2017.
While there is more work to do, we believe our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more predictable, more diversified earnings that will continue to generate strong cash flow.
I will now turn the call over to Richard to review results for the quarter and the outlook in greeter detail. Richard?"

Let's start with Solutions, which reported earnings of $43 million. As Alan said, this was below our expectations for the quarter. Excluding a $4.5 million tax benefit in the prior year period, earnings were down",1087,"Thanks, Alan, and good morning, everyone. Let's start with Solutions, which reported earnings of $43 million. As Alan said, this was below our expectations for the quarter. Excluding a $4.5 million tax benefit in the prior year period, earnings were down $5 million. The decrease was due to lower than expected contributions for mobile and the anticipated declines in legacy service contracts and domestic credit insurance. Specifically, core mobile results were down by nearly $6 million year-over-year, largely driven by $3 million of higher technology expenses, modernized certain systems.
We also realized lower mobile repair and logistics volumes as customers upgraded or traded in significantly fewer phones this quarter. Declines in legacy businesses accounted for another $3 million. These factors were partially offset by $3 million of higher real estate joint venture income.
Turning to revenue. [indiscernible] top line increased by 3% from the prior year period, primarily reflecting fee income, growth from new mobile subscribers.
Premiums are also increased slightly year-over-year. Growth from vehicle service contracts was tempered by declines from certain North American retailers in our domestic credit business. Foreign exchange was also a factor, given the depreciation of the British pound and the Argentinian peso [ph].
For the full year 2016, we revised our outlook and now expect Solutions earnings to decline modestly from 2015. While fundamentals in our mobile business are promising, in 2016, we no longer expect growth from new and existing programs to offset declines in legacy businesses nor the loss of the tablet program. We are taking steps to help improve Solutions performance in 2017, including more rigorous expense management to generate profitable growth.
Let's now move to Specialty Property. Earnings decreased $43 million to $45 million. This is primarily due to 2 factors. Order included $33 million of reportable catastrophe losses from flooding in Louisiana. The remaining $10 million is related to ongoing normalization of lender-placed [indiscernible].
As a result of the catastrophe losses, the combined ratio of our risk-based businesses increased 12 points to 92%. Absent cats, combined ratio was flat year-over-year as lower general expenses helped offset declining lender-placed premiums. Our fee-based capital light offerings that comprised multi-family housing and mortgage solutions generated a pretax margin of 9.7%. This was down 5.5 points from the prior period. The decrease was mainly driven by higher expenses needed to support growth in our field services and valuation businesses.
While we believe we've grown revenues well in excess of the market, we do need to drive greater operating efficiencies across our mortgage solutions platform to deliver our margin target of 15% to 20% by 2020 for all of the property fee-based capital light offerings.
Turning to revenue. Net earned premiums and fees in Specialty Property decreased 3%, primarily due to lower placement and premium rates and lender-placed, while multi-family housing and mortgage solutions increased by 16%.
Diving deeper, multi-family housing revenue increased 10% from the prior year period. This reflects a higher volume of renters policies sold through our channels and increased penetration rates across our property management network.
For mortgage solutions, fee income was up 22%, including the July acquisition of American Title. Organic growth in the quarter totaled 7% due to greater production from valuation services.
Our 2016 outlook for Specialty Property's unchanged. We continue to expect lower revenue and profits, primarily reflecting the normalization of our lender-placed business. As Alan noted earlier, catastrophe loss from Hurricane Matthew will impact our fourth quarter results.
Looking ahead to 2017, we anticipate a continued decline of lender-placed revenue and earnings as we move closer to a normalized steady state. The 2.7 million loans onboarded this quarter are expected to produce modest premiums next year, though not enough to offset the overall declining lender-placed market. We also expect ongoing expansion from our fee-based capital light offerings to account for a larger proportion of Specialty Property's results.
Turning now to Health run-off operations. Results were slightly better than anticipated. The $2 million loss in the quarter reflects slight reduction in estimated recoveries from the 2015 risk mitigation programs, which were offset by favorable claims development. Results also included some severance related costs as well as other indirect expenses not included in the premium deficiency reserve.
Year-to-date, we received $378 million in reinsurance and risk adjustment payments related to the 2015 Affordable Care Act policies. As of September 30, around $99 million of net receivables remain on our balance sheet. We expect CMS to remit the payments for these outstanding balances in 2017.
So far this year, we brought up $338 million to the holding company in dividends from Health. We continue to expect to receive approximately a total of $475 million. Of course, the timing will depend on regulatory approval.
Moving to Corporate. Loss for the quarter decreased $9 million to $17 million. This was primarily due to lower taxes and employee benefit cost. For the full year, we still expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million.
Throughout the year, we've taken steps to increase efficiencies in Corporate, such as freezing our pension plan. We also recognized the need for additional investments to support our transformation, some of which are expected to flow through Corporate in 2017. 
We will provide more details on our 2017 outlook for all of our operating segments on the fourth quarter earnings call in February.
Moving on to capital. We ended the third quarter with $625 million in deployable capital at the holding company. We received $418 million in total dividends in the third quarter, $339 million of dividends of capital previously supporting Employee Benefits business and Health run-off operation, $79 million from Solutions and Specialty Property. 
Our strong cash flow generation during the quarter allowed us to do 2 things. We returned $266 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and we invested $11 million in emerging technologies in the mobile and rental value chains.
In the first 3 weeks of October, we bought back an additional 742,000 shares, bringing the total number of shares we purchased year-to-date to just over 9 million. 
So to summarize, while the results were disappointing, we remain committed to executing our transformation strategy to realize our potential to ensure long-term profitable growth in Housing and Lifestyle.
Finally, I do want to thank those of you who I'd had a chance to meet over the last couple of months at Assurant. I appreciate all your input and support. It's made my onboarding into the company both smooth and productive.

The real negative in the quarter, other than the IT, which Richard will talk about, was we just had lower trading volumes, where people are not -- they didn't trade in as many phones, they didn't upgrade or claim or whatever it might be.

In addition to that, as I mentioned, there were some higher IT expenses. We are investing capabilities. We are becoming more agile. We're looking longer term with a business and trying to become more variable, add more variable expenses. So that was one part of it. There's also increased expenses from our legacy business or continued expenses, I guess I should say, from our legacy business, which was offset a little bit from some real estate [indiscernible]."

First of all, if I step back and look at Assurant overall, we're in the middle, as we've talked about, of a multiyear transformation to really reposition this company, addressing the lender-placed normalization and putting us very focused on growth markets and growth opportunities in housing and lifestyle. And if you look at 2016, I think a lot of forward progress on that. We've largely completed the repositioning of the portfolio with benefits closed and most of those proceeds now up to the holding company. The Health wind down, more now complete than not. And the other critical thing we did this year was to realign our organization, which will create the opportunity to really take out effectiveness or improve effectiveness and improve our cost structure over time. If you think about mobile specifically, one of the ways we've been gaining share, we've been gaining share now for multiple years. If you look at this business, it is dramatically bigger and stronger today than it was 3 years ago. The way we've gained that share is investing in capabilities, so that's kind of ongoing. This quarter, we had a little bit more than we expected. We made some decisions to continue to invest in technology around things like automating some of our processes, trying to better align our cost structure with some of those variabilities in volumes. And so again, on '17, we'll provide outlook for '17 in February as well with our fourth quarter earnings, but at a high level, that's how I think about what's going on."

So let me start with just a comment broadly. As we think about our business and build it over the long term, we do have some quarter-to-quarter variability, just naturally with the size of our client programs and some of the businesses we operate in. But really 3 things were a little bit different than we had expected as we went into the back half of the year in the third quarter. We've got good growth out of the new programs that we've announced over the last year or so but a little bit less than we expected and that was the shift that began to develop and played down in the third quarter. The IT expenses, really choices we make. As we look at our spending, we made some decisions to invest more in certain areas because we saw opportunities to even expand capabilities, we think positions us for long term. That was a choice that we made in the quarter. And then we were a little bit surprised as the whole industry was on the decline in trading activity in the third quarter. That could be just a function of people waiting for the new phones to come out, some of the noise in the market around some of the introductions that happened in August and September. But fundamentally, if we take a long-term view on this business, if you think about Solutions now, we put out in 2013 a goal that we could grow net operating income on average 10% per year in that business, not linear and we reaffirmed that in '15. Fervently, since 2013, we've more than achieved that goal. Obviously, in 2016, we're disappointed with what we are, but it doesn't change our longer term outlook that we have had great momentum in this business. We continue to invest and we feel very well-positioned for continued growth in Solutions and in mobile."

We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2016 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our third quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
Earlier this year, we revised the earnings release and financial supplement to focus on Housing and Lifestyle. Net operating income reflects contributions from our operating segments: Assurant Solutions, Specialty Property and Corporate as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude Assurant Health runoff operations, the amortization of deferred gains from dispositions and other variable items. We believe these changes provide a more meaningful representation of our financials and better reflect our go-forward strategy.
On today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with prepared remarks before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2015 Form 10-K and first quarter Form 10-Q.
Now I will turn the call over to Alan."

Overall performance for the third quarter was disappointing and fell short of our expectations. As we announced last week, the year-over-year decline in earnings was driven by increased catastrophe losses as we",948,"Thanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. Overall performance for the third quarter was disappointing and fell short of our expectations. As we announced last week, the year-over-year decline in earnings was driven by increased catastrophe losses as well as lower than expected mobile results. However, we don't believe this quarter is reflective of the long-term potential of our housing and lifestyle offerings. 
Throughout this year, we've implemented the critical building blocks of our transformation. We've done so, first, by ensuring we're focused on the most attractive housing and lifestyle markets, where we can achieve leadership positions and generate attractive returns. And second, by implementing a more integrated organizational framework that will enable us to become more efficient and effective.
Starting with Lifestyle, mobile and the broader Connected Living market offer attractive opportunities for growth. So far in 2016, we've added new partnerships and expanded our fee-based offerings across distribution channels. We're also taking steps to expand margins over time by ensuring we have the appropriate platforms and cost structures in place across our operations worldwide. Critical because this is a more robust technology infrastructure that maximizes our global capabilities.
Together, these actions set a stronger foundation for future profitable growth. While we no longer expect Solutions net operating income to increase this year, we remain confident that we have the right strategy, business mix and the capabilities to deliver 10% average annual growth in net operating income over the long term.
Turning to Housing, we've invested in the transformation of our lender placed platform to further strengthen our leadership position in this important market. Just this quarter, we added a total of 2.7 million loans from 2 new clients and the block of loans we announced last quarter. We believe these wins demonstrate our clients' recognition of our strong platform, compliance processes and superior customer service.
The severe flooding in Louisiana and Hurricane Matthew are reminders of the importance of our products to homeowners across the country. Our commitment is brought to light by the rigor and dedication of our employees as they assess damages and pay claims as promptly as possible. To date, on behalf of Louisiana homeowners, we processed more than 2,000 claims with an over 95% completion rate. In addition, we also help to administer claims for the National Flood Insurance Program as its second largest administrator.
Just this month, Hurricane Matthew inflicted severe flooding and wind damage, particularly in parts of Georgia, the Carolinas and the Caribbean. Our claims field adjusters were again on site shortly after the hurricane passed through these regions to assess damage and begin processing claims.
While it's still very early, we estimate losses from Hurricane Matthew could total up to $70 million after tax. This estimate is still preliminary, and we will update the market as we have a more complete view of the impact.
The wind down of Assurant Health is moving along as scheduled and represents another key aspect of our portfolio realignment. In the third quarter, we took an additional $189 million in dividends from Health. These dividends, along with capital releases from the sale of Employee Benefits, give us the added flexibility to return capital to shareholders and invest in housing and lifestyle markets where we can outperform long term.
In 2016, we also took several steps to transform our organizational model worldwide, focusing on both functional areas and our lines of business. We've now set the foundation for a global business unit structure under the leadership of Gene Mergelmeyer as our Chief Operating Officer. We're also realigning our technology, risk, strategy and financial organizations and expect to have that work completed by year-end.
As part of that effort, Richard and the finance team are also evaluating our financial reporting framework. We expect changes to be implemented early next year.
Our work to transform Assurant and build a strong future is on track. As we look ahead to 2017, our focus will be on profitable growth. To accomplish this, we'll continue to offer innovative products and services to meet consumer needs as well as completing the rollout of our new operating model to enhance efficiency across our global operations. And we'll continue to prudently deploy capital to maximize returns.
Progress will be measured against 3 key financial metrics: Net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity. All of these metrics exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of weather.
Through the 9 months of 2016, net operating income decreased by 14% to $308 million, primarily due to the expected decline of underplaced, the loss of the tablet program and lower contributions from legacy businesses.
Operating earnings per diluted share declined 6% to $4.89 driven by the factors I noted earlier. As we execute our transformation, we expect to grow net operating income and deploy capital prudently to support average annual operating EPS growth to 15% over time.
Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 11.3%. Expansion of our fee-based offerings will be an important driver to achieve our goal of 15% operating ROE by 2020.
At the end of September, holding company capital totaled $875 million after returning $783 million to shareholders through the first 9 months of 2016. This return represents more than half of our commitment to return $1.5 billion of capital through dividends and buybacks by the end of 2017.
While there is more work to do, we believe our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more predictable, more diversified earnings that will continue to generate strong cash flow.
I will now turn the call over to Richard to review results for the quarter and the outlook in greater detail. Richard?"

As Alan said, this was below our expectations for the quarter. Excluding a $4.5 million tax benefit in the prior year period, earnings were down $5 million. The decrease was due to lower than expected contributions for mobile and the anticipated declines in legacy service contracts and domestic credit insurance. Specifically, core mobile results were down by nearly $6 million year-over-year, largely driven by $3 million of higher technology expenses, modernized certain systems.
We also realized lower mobile repair and logistics volumes as customers upgraded or traded in significantly fewer phones this quarter. Declines in legacy businesses accounted for another $3 million. These factors were partially offset by $3 million of higher real estate joint venture income.
Turning to revenue. Solutions top line increased by 3% from the prior year period, primarily reflecting fee income, growth from new mobile subscribers.
Premiums were also increased slightly year-over-year. Growth from vehicle service contracts was tempered by declines from certain North American retailers in our Domestic Credit business. Foreign exchange was also a factor, given the depreciation of the British pound and the Argentinian peso.
For the full year 2016, we've revised our outlook and now expect Solutions earnings to decline modestly from 2015. While fundamentals in our mobile business are promising, in 2016, we no longer expect growth from new and existing programs to offset declines in legacy businesses nor the loss of the tablet program. We are taking steps to help improve Solutions performance in 2017, including more rigorous expense management to generate profitable growth.
Let's now move to Specialty Property. Earnings decreased $43 million to $45 million. This is primarily due to 2 factors. Order included $33 million of reportable catastrophe losses from flooding in Louisiana. The remaining $10 million is related to ongoing normalization of lender-placed.
As a result of the catastrophe losses, the combined ratio of our risk-based businesses increased 12 points to 92%. Absent cats combined ratio was flat year-over-year as lower general expenses helped offset declining lender-placed premiums. Our fee-based capital light offerings that comprised multi-family housing and mortgage solutions generated a pretax margin of 9.7%. This was down 5.5 points from the prior period. The decrease was mainly driven by higher expenses needed to support growth in our field services and valuation businesses.
While we believe we've grown revenues well in excess of the market, we do need to drive greater operating efficiencies across our mortgage solutions platform to deliver our margin target of 15% to 20% by 2020 for all of the property fee-based capital light offerings.
Turning to revenue. Net earned premiums and fees in Specialty Property decreased 3%, primarily due to lower placement and premium rates and lender-placed, while multi-family housing and mortgage solutions increased by 16%.
Diving deeper, multi-family housing revenue increased 10% from the prior year period. This reflects a higher volume of renters policies sold through our affinity channels and increased penetration rates across our property management network.
For mortgage solutions, fee income was up 22%, including the July acquisition of American Title. Organic growth in the quarter totaled 7% due to greater production from valuation services.
Our 2016 outlook for Specialty Property is unchanged. We continue to expect lower revenue and profits, primarily reflecting the normalization of our lender-placed business. As Alan noted earlier, catastrophe losses from Hurricane Matthew will impact our fourth quarter results.
Looking ahead to 2017, we anticipate a continued decline of lender-placed revenue and earnings as we move closer to a normalized steady state. The 2.7 million loans onboarded this quarter are expected to produce modest premiums next year, though not enough to offset the overall declining lender-placed market. We also expect ongoing expansion from our fee-based capital light offerings to account for a larger proportion of Specialty Property's results.
Turning now to Health run-off operations. Results were slightly better than anticipated. The $2 million loss in the quarter reflects slight reduction in estimated recoveries from the 2015 risk mitigation programs, which were offset by favorable claims development. Results also included some severance related costs as well as other indirect expenses not included in the premium deficiency reserve.
Year-to-date, we received $378 million in reinsurance and risk adjustment payments related to the 2015 Affordable Care Act policies. As of September 30, around $99 million of net receivables remain on our balance sheet. We expect CMS to remit the payments for these outstanding balances in 2017.
So far this year, we brought up $338 million to the holding company in dividends from Health. We continue to expect to receive approximately a total of $475 million. Of course, the timing will depend on regulatory approval.
Moving to Corporate. Loss for the quarter decreased $9 million to $17 million. This was primarily due to lower taxes and employee benefit cost. For the full year, we still expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million.
Throughout the year, we've taken steps to increase efficiencies in Corporate, such as freezing our pension plan. We also recognized the need for some additional investments to support our transformation, some of which are expected to flow through Corporate in 2017.
We will provide more details on our 2017 outlook for all of our operating segments on the fourth quarter earnings call in February.
Moving on to capital. We ended the third quarter with $625 million in deployable capital at the holding company. We received $418 million in total dividends in the third quarter, $339 million of dividends from capital previously supporting the Employee Benefits business and Health run-off operation, $79 million from Solutions and Specialty Property.
Our strong cash flow generation during the quarter allowed us to do 2 things. We returned $266 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and we invested $11 million in emerging technologies in the mobile and rental value chains.
In the first 3 weeks of October, we bought back an additional 742,000 shares, bringing the total number of shares we purchased year-to-date to just over 9 million.
So to summarize, while the results were disappointing, we remain committed to executing our transformation strategy to realize our potential to ensure long-term profitable growth in Housing and Lifestyle.
Finally, I do want to thank those of you who I'd had a chance to meet over the last couple of months at Assurant. I appreciate all your input and support. It's made my onboarding into the company both smooth and productive.

The real negative in the quarter, other than the IT, which Richard will talk about, was we just had lower trading volumes, where people are not -- or they didn't trade in as many phones, or they didn't upgrade or claim or whatever it might be. And that really varies a bit quarter-to-quarter, depending on our client programs, what's going on with competition and timing of new phone introductions availability.

In addition to that, as I mentioned, there were some higher IT expenses. I mean, we are investing in capabilities. We are becoming more agile. We're looking longer term with the business and trying to become more variable, add more variable expenses. So that was one part of it.

I mean, first of all, if I step back and look at Assurant overall, we're in the middle, as we've talked about, of a multiyear transformation to really reposition this company, addressing the lender-placed normalization and putting us very focused on growth markets and growth opportunities in housing and lifestyle. And if you look at 2016, I think a lot of forward progress on that. We've largely completed the repositioning of the portfolio with benefits closed and most of those proceeds now up to the holding company. The Health wind down, more now complete than not. And the other critical thing we did this year was to realign our organization, which will create the opportunity to really take out effectiveness or improve effectiveness and improve our cost structure over time. If you think about mobile specifically, one of the ways we've been gaining share, and we've been gaining share now for multiple years. If you look at this business, it is dramatically bigger and stronger today than it was 3 years ago. The way we've gained that share is investing in capabilities, so that's kind of ongoing. This quarter, we had a little bit more than we expected. We made some decisions to continue to invest in technology around things like automating some of our processes, trying to better align our cost structure with some of those variabilities in volumes. And so again, on '17, we'll provide a outlook for '17 in February as well is to with our fourth quarter earnings, but at a high level, that's how I think about what's going on."

So let me start with just a comment broadly. As we think about our business and build it over the long term, we do have some quarter-to-quarter variability, just naturally with the size of our client programs and some of the businesses we operate in. But really 3 things were a little bit different than we had expected as we went into the back half of the year in the third quarter. We got good growth out of the new programs that we've announced over the last year or so, but a little bit less than we expected and that was the shift that began to develop and play down in the third quarter. The IT expenses, really choices we made. As we look at our spending, we made some decisions to invest more in certain areas because we saw opportunities to even expand capabilities, we think positions us for long term. That was a choice we made in the quarter. And then we were a little bit surprised as the whole industry was on the decline in trading activity in the third quarter. That could be just a function of people waiting for the new phones to come out, some of the noise in the market around and some of the introductions that happened in August and September. But fundamentally, if we take a long-term view on this business, if you think about, I'm going to talk about Solutions now, we put out in 2013 a goal that we could grow net operating income on average 10% per year in that business, not linear and we reaffirmed that in '15. Fervently, since 2013, we've more than achieved that goal. Obviously, in 2016, we're disappointed with what we are, but it doesn't change our longer term outlook that we have had great momentum in this business. We continue to invest and we feel very well positioned for continued growth in Solutions and in mobile."

We look forward to discussing our third quarter 2016 results with you today. Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our third quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
Earlier this year, we revised the earnings release and financial supplement to focus on Housing and Lifestyle. Net operating income reflects contributions from our operating segments: Assurant Solutions, Specialty Property and Corporate as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude Assurant Health runoff operations, the amortization of deferred gains from dispositions and other variable items. We believe these changes provide a more meaningful representation of our financials and better reflect our go-forward strategy.
On today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with prepared remarks before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2015 Form 10-K and first quarter Form 10-Q.

Overall performance for the third quarter was disappointing and fell short of our expectations. As we announced last week, the year-over-year decline in earnings was driven by increased catastrophe losses as we",948,"Thanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. Overall performance for the third quarter was disappointing and fell short of our expectations. As we announced last week, the year-over-year decline in earnings was driven by increased catastrophe losses as well as lower than expected mobile results. However, we don't believe this quarter is reflective of the long-term potential of our housing and lifestyle offerings. 
Throughout this year, we've implemented the critical building blocks of our transformation. We've done so, first, by ensuring we're focused on the most attractive housing and lifestyle markets, where we can achieve leadership positions and generate attractive returns. And second, by implementing a more integrated organizational framework that will enable us to become more efficient and effective.
Starting with Lifestyle, mobile and the broader Connected Living market offer attractive opportunities for growth. So far in 2016, we've added new partnerships and expanded our fee-based offerings across distribution channels. We're also taking steps to expand margins over time by ensuring we have the appropriate platforms and cost structures in place across our operations worldwide. Critical for this is a more robust technology infrastructure that maximizes our global capabilities.
Together, these actions set a stronger foundation for future profitable growth. While we no longer expect Solutions net operating income to increase this year, we remain confident that we have the right strategy, business mix and the capabilities to deliver 10% average annual growth in net operating income over the long term.
Turning to Housing, we've invested in the transformation of our lender placed platform to further strengthen our leadership position in this important market. Just this quarter, we added a total of 2.7 million loans from 2 new clients and the block of loans we announced last quarter. We believe these wins demonstrate our clients' recognition of our strong platform, compliance processes and superior customer service.
The severe flooding in Louisiana and Hurricane Matthew are reminders of the importance of our products to homeowners across the country. Our commitment is brought to light by the rigor and dedication of our employees as they assess damages and pay claims as promptly as possible. To date, on behalf of Louisiana homeowners, we processed more than 2,000 claims with an over 95% completion rate. In addition, we also help to administer claims for the National Flood Insurance Program as its second largest administrator.
Just this month, Hurricane Matthew inflicted severe flooding and wind damage, particularly in parts of Georgia, the Carolinas and the Caribbean. Our claims field adjusters were again on site shortly after the hurricane passed through these regions to assess damage and begin processing claims.
While it's still very early, we estimate losses from Hurricane Matthew could total up to $70 million after tax. This estimate is still preliminary, and we will update the market as we have a more complete view of the impact.
The wind down of Assurant Health is moving along as scheduled and represents another key aspect of our portfolio realignment. In the third quarter, we took an additional $189 million in dividends from Health. These dividends, along with capital releases from the sale of Employee Benefits, give us the added flexibility to return capital to shareholders and invest in housing and lifestyle markets where we can outperform long term.
In 2016, we also took several steps to transform our organizational model worldwide, focusing on both functional areas and our lines of business. We've now set the foundation for a global business unit structure under the leadership of Gene Mergelmeyer as our Chief Operating Officer. We're also realigning our technology, risk, strategy and financial organizations and expect to have that work completed by year-end.
As part of that effort, Richard and the finance team are also evaluating our financial reporting framework. We expect changes to be implemented early next year.
Our work to transform Assurant and build a strong future is on track. As we look ahead to 2017, our focus will be on profitable growth. To accomplish this, we'll continue to offer innovative products and services to meet consumer needs as well as completing the rollout of our new operating model to enhance efficiency across our global operations. And we'll continue to prudently deploy capital to maximize returns.
Progress will be measured against 3 key financial metrics: Net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity. All of these metrics exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of weather.
Through the 9 months of 2016, net operating income decreased by 14% to $308 million, primarily due to the expected decline of underplaced, the loss of the tablet program and lower contributions from legacy businesses.
Operating earnings per diluted share declined 6% to $4.89 driven by the factors I noted earlier. As we execute our transformation, we expect to grow net operating income and deploy capital prudently to support average annual operating EPS growth to 15% over time.
Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 11.3%. Expansion of our fee-based offerings will be an important driver to achieve our goal of 15% operating ROE by 2020.
At the end of September, holding company capital totaled $875 million after returning $783 million to shareholders through the first 9 months of 2016. This return represents more than half of our commitment to return $1.5 billion of capital through dividends and buybacks by the end of 2017.
While there is more work to do, we believe our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more predictable, more diversified earnings that will continue to generate strong cash flow.
I will now turn the call over to Richard to review results for the quarter and the outlook in greater detail. Richard?"

As Alan said, this was below our expectations for the quarter. Excluding a $4.5 million tax benefit in the prior year period, earnings were down $5 million. The decrease was due to lower than expected contributions for mobile and the anticipated declines in legacy service contracts and domestic credit insurance. Specifically, core mobile results were down by nearly $6 million year-over-year, largely driven by $3 million of higher technology expenses, modernized certain systems.
We also realized lower mobile repair and logistics volumes as customers upgraded or traded in significantly fewer phones this quarter. Declines in legacy businesses accounted for another $3 million. These factors were partially offset by $3 million of higher real estate joint venture income.
Turning to revenue. Solutions top line increased by 3% from the prior year period, primarily reflecting fee income, growth from new mobile subscribers.
Premiums were also increased slightly year-over-year. Growth from vehicle service contracts was tempered by declines from certain North American retailers in our Domestic Credit business. Foreign exchange was also a factor, given the depreciation of the British pound and the Argentinian peso.
For the full year 2016, we've revised our outlook and now expect Solutions earnings to decline modestly from 2015. While fundamentals in our mobile business are promising, in 2016, we no longer expect growth from new and existing programs to offset declines in legacy businesses nor the loss of the tablet program. We are taking steps to help improve Solutions performance in 2017, including more rigorous expense management to generate profitable growth.
Let's now move to Specialty Property. Earnings decreased $43 million to $45 million. This is primarily due to 2 factors. Order included $33 million of reportable catastrophe losses from flooding in Louisiana. The remaining $10 million is related to ongoing normalization of lender-placed.
As a result of the catastrophe losses, the combined ratio of our risk-based businesses increased 12 points to 92%. Absent cats combined ratio was flat year-over-year as lower general expenses helped offset declining lender-placed premiums. Our fee-based capital light offerings that comprised multi-family housing and mortgage solutions generated a pretax margin of 9.7%. This was down 5.5 points from the prior period. The decrease was mainly driven by higher expenses needed to support growth in our field services and valuation businesses.
While we believe we've grown revenues well in excess of the market, we do need to drive greater operating efficiencies across our mortgage solutions platform to deliver our margin target of 15% to 20% by 2020 for all of the property fee-based capital light offerings.
Turning to revenue. Net earned premiums and fees in Specialty Property decreased 3%, primarily due to lower placement and premium rates and lender-placed, while multi-family housing and mortgage solutions increased by 16%.
Diving deeper, multi-family housing revenue increased 10% from the prior year period. This reflects a higher volume of renters policies sold through our affinity channels and increased penetration rates across our property management network.
For mortgage solutions, fee income was up 22%, including the July acquisition of American Title. Organic growth in the quarter totaled 7% due to greater production from valuation services.
Our 2016 outlook for Specialty Property is unchanged. We continue to expect lower revenue and profits, primarily reflecting the normalization of our lender-placed business. As Alan noted earlier, catastrophe losses from Hurricane Matthew will impact our fourth quarter results.
Looking ahead to 2017, we anticipate a continued decline of lender-placed revenue and earnings as we move closer to a normalized steady state. The 2.7 million loans onboarded this quarter are expected to produce modest premiums next year, though not enough to offset the overall declining lender-placed market. We also expect ongoing expansion from our fee-based capital light offerings to account for a larger proportion of Specialty Property's results.
Turning now to Health run-off operations. Results were slightly better than anticipated. The $2 million loss in the quarter reflects slight reduction in estimated recoveries from the 2015 risk mitigation programs, which were offset by favorable claims development. Results also included some severance related costs as well as other indirect expenses not included in the premium deficiency reserve.
Year-to-date, we received $378 million in reinsurance and risk adjustment payments related to the 2015 Affordable Care Act policies. As of September 30, around $99 million of net receivables remain on our balance sheet. We expect CMS to remit the payments for these outstanding balances in 2017.
So far this year, we brought up $338 million to the holding company in dividends from Health. We continue to expect to receive approximately a total of $475 million. Of course, the timing will depend on regulatory approval.
Moving to Corporate. Loss for the quarter decreased $9 million to $17 million. This was primarily due to lower taxes and employee benefit cost. For the full year, we still expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million.
Throughout the year, we've taken steps to increase efficiencies in Corporate, such as freezing our pension plan. We also recognized the need for some additional investments to support our transformation, some of which are expected to flow through Corporate in 2017.
We will provide more details on our 2017 outlook for all of our operating segments on the fourth quarter earnings call in February.
Moving on to capital. We ended the third quarter with $625 million in deployable capital at the holding company. We received $418 million in total dividends in the third quarter, $339 million of dividends from capital previously supporting the Employee Benefits business and Health run-off operation, $79 million from Solutions and Specialty Property.
Our strong cash flow generation during the quarter allowed us to do 2 things. We returned $266 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and we invested $11 million in emerging technologies in the mobile and rental value chains.
In the first 3 weeks of October, we bought back an additional 742,000 shares, bringing the total number of shares we purchased year-to-date to just over 9 million.
So to summarize, while the results were disappointing, we remain committed to executing our transformation strategy to realize our potential to ensure long-term profitable growth in Housing and Lifestyle.
Finally, I do want to thank those of you who I'd had a chance to meet over the last couple of months at Assurant. I appreciate all your input and support. It's made my onboarding into the company both smooth and productive.

And if you look at the quarter at a high level, the positive was continued growth in subscribers so people signing up for our programs and the handset programs. The real negative in the quarter, other than the IT, which Richard will talk about, was we just had lower trading volumes, where people are not -- or they didn't trade in as many phones, or they didn't upgrade or claim or whatever it might be. And that really varies a bit quarter-to-quarter, depending on our client programs, what's going on with competition and timing of new phone introductions availability.

In addition to that, as I mentioned, there were some higher IT expenses. I mean, we are investing in capabilities. We are becoming more agile. We're looking longer term with the business and trying to become more variable, add more variable expenses. So that was one part of it. There's also increased expenses from our legacy business or continued expenses, I guess, I should say from our legacy business, which was offset a little bit from some real estate JV income."

I mean, first of all, if I step back and look at Assurant overall, we're in the middle, as we've talked about, of a multiyear transformation to really reposition this company, addressing the lender-placed normalization and putting us very focused on growth markets and growth opportunities in housing and lifestyle. And if you look at 2016, I think a lot of forward progress on that. We've largely completed the repositioning of the portfolio with benefits closed and most of those proceeds now up to the holding company. The Health wind down, more now complete than not. And the other critical thing we did this year was to realign our organization, which will create the opportunity to really take out effectiveness or improve effectiveness and improve our cost structure over time. If you think about mobile specifically, one of the ways we've been gaining share, and we've been gaining share now for multiple years. If you look at this business, it is dramatically bigger and stronger today than it was 3 years ago. The way we've gained that share is investing in capabilities, so that's kind of ongoing. This quarter, we had a little bit more than we expected. We made some decisions to continue to invest in technology around things like automating some of our processes, trying to better align our cost structure with some of those variabilities in volumes. And so again, on '17, we'll provide a outlook for '17 in February as we always do with our fourth quarter earnings, but at a high level, that's how I think about what's going on."

So let me start with just a comment broadly. As we think about our business and build it over the long term, we do have some quarter-to-quarter variability, just naturally with the size of our client programs and some of the businesses we operate in. But really 3 things were a little bit different than we had expected as we went into the back half of the year in the third quarter. We got good growth out of the new programs that we've announced over the last year or so, but a little bit less than we expected and that was the shift that began to develop and play down in the third quarter. The IT expenses, really choices we made. As we looked at our spending, we made some decisions to invest more in certain areas because we saw opportunities to keep and expand capabilities, we think positions us for long term. That was a choice we made in the quarter. And then we were a little bit surprised as the whole industry was on the decline in trading activity in the third quarter. That could be just a function of people waiting for the new phones to come out, some of the noise in the market around some of the introductions that happened in August and September. But fundamentally, if we take a long-term view on this business, if you think about, I'm going to talk about Solutions now, we put out in 2013 a goal that we could grow net operating income on average 10% per year in that business, not linear and we reaffirmed that in '15. Certainly, since 2013, we've more than achieved that goal. Obviously, in 2016, we're disappointed with what we are, but it doesn't change our longer term outlook that we have had great momentum in this business. We continue to invest and we feel very well positioned for continued growth in Solutions and in mobile."

Joining me for Assurant's conference call are Alan Colberg, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Richard Dziadzio, our Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer.
Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our third quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com.
Earlier this year, we revised the earnings release and financial supplement to focus on Housing and Lifestyle. Net operating income reflects contributions from our operating segments: Assurant Solutions, Specialty Property and Corporate as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude Assurant Health runoff operations, the amortization of deferred gains from dispositions and other variable items. We believe these changes provide a more meaningful representation of our financials and better reflect our go-forward strategy.
On today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with prepared remarks before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2015 Form 10-K and first quarter Form 10-Q.

4026111,403594998,1062459,"Assurant, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. Overall performance for the third quarter was disappointing and fell short of our expectations. As we announced last week, the year-over-year decline in earnings was driven by increased catastrophe losses as we",948,"Thanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. Overall performance for the third quarter was disappointing and fell short of our expectations. As we announced last week, the year-over-year decline in earnings was driven by increased catastrophe losses as well as lower than expected mobile results. However, we don't believe this quarter is reflective of the long-term potential of our housing and lifestyle offerings. 
Throughout this year, we've implemented the critical building blocks of our transformation. We've done so, first, by ensuring we're focused on the most attractive housing and lifestyle markets, where we can achieve leadership positions and generate attractive returns. And second, by implementing a more integrated organizational framework that will enable us to become more efficient and effective.
Starting with Lifestyle, mobile and the broader Connected Living market offer attractive opportunities for growth. So far in 2016, we've added new partnerships and expanded our fee-based offerings across distribution channels. We're also taking steps to expand margins over time by ensuring we have the appropriate platforms and cost structures in place across our operations worldwide. Critical for this is a more robust technology infrastructure that maximizes our global capabilities.
Together, these actions set a stronger foundation for future profitable growth. While we no longer expect Solutions net operating income to increase this year, we remain confident that we have the right strategy, business mix and the capabilities to deliver 10% average annual growth in net operating income over the long term.
Turning to Housing, we've invested in the transformation of our lender placed platform to further strengthen our leadership position in this important market. Just this quarter, we added a total of 2.7 million loans from 2 new clients and the block of loans we announced last quarter. We believe these wins demonstrate our clients' recognition of our strong platform, compliance processes and superior customer service.
The severe flooding in Louisiana and Hurricane Matthew are reminders of the importance of our products to homeowners across the country. Our commitment is brought to light by the rigor and dedication of our employees as they assess damages and pay claims as promptly as possible. To date, on behalf of Louisiana homeowners, we processed more than 2,000 claims with an over 95% completion rate. In addition, we also help to administer claims for the National Flood Insurance Program as its second largest administrator.
Just this month, Hurricane Matthew inflicted severe flooding and wind damage, particularly in parts of Georgia, the Carolinas and the Caribbean. Our claims field adjusters were again on site shortly after the hurricane passed through these regions to assess damage and begin processing claims.
While it's still very early, we estimate losses from Hurricane Matthew could total up to $70 million after tax. This estimate is still preliminary, and we will update the market as we have a more complete view of the impact.
The wind down of Assurant Health is moving along as scheduled and represents another key aspect of our portfolio realignment. In the third quarter, we took an additional $189 million in dividends from Health. These dividends, along with capital releases from the sale of Employee Benefits, give us the added flexibility to return capital to shareholders and invest in housing and lifestyle markets where we can outperform long term.
In 2016, we also took several steps to transform our organizational model worldwide, focusing on both functional areas and our lines of business. We've now set the foundation for a global business unit structure under the leadership of Gene Mergelmeyer as our Chief Operating Officer. We're also realigning our technology, risk, strategy and financial organizations and expect to have that work completed by year-end.
As part of that effort, Richard and the finance team are also evaluating our financial reporting framework. We expect changes to be implemented early next year.
Our work to transform Assurant and build a strong future is on track. As we look ahead to 2017, our focus will be on profitable growth. To accomplish this, we'll continue to offer innovative products and services to meet consumer needs as well as completing the rollout of our new operating model to enhance efficiency across our global operations. And we'll continue to prudently deploy capital to maximize returns.
Progress will be measured against 3 key financial metrics: Net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity. All of these metrics exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of weather.
Through the 9 months of 2016, net operating income decreased by 14% to $308 million, primarily due to the expected decline of underplaced, the loss of the tablet program and lower contributions from legacy businesses.
Operating earnings per diluted share declined 6% to $4.89 driven by the factors I noted earlier. As we execute our transformation, we expect to grow net operating income and deploy capital prudently to support average annual operating EPS growth to 15% over time.
Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 11.3%. Expansion of our fee-based offerings will be an important driver to achieve our goal of 15% operating ROE by 2020.
At the end of September, holding company capital totaled $875 million after returning $783 million to shareholders through the first 9 months of 2016. This return represents more than half of our commitment to return $1.5 billion of capital through dividends and buybacks by the end of 2017.
While there is more work to do, we believe our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more predictable, more diversified earnings that will continue to generate strong cash flow.
I will now turn the call over to Richard to review results for the quarter and the outlook in greater detail. Richard?"

As Alan said, this was below our expectations for the quarter. Excluding a $4.5 million tax benefit in the prior year period, earnings were down $5 million. The decrease was due to lower than expected contributions for mobile and the anticipated declines in legacy service contracts and domestic credit insurance. Specifically, core mobile results were down by nearly $6 million year-over-year, largely driven by $3 million of higher technology expenses, modernized certain systems.
We also realized lower mobile repair and logistics volumes as customers upgraded or traded in significantly fewer phones this quarter. Declines in legacy businesses accounted for another $3 million. These factors were partially offset by $3 million of higher real estate joint venture income.
Turning to revenue. Solutions top line increased by 3% from the prior year period, primarily reflecting fee income, growth from new mobile subscribers.
Premiums were also increased slightly year-over-year. Growth from vehicle service contracts was tempered by declines from certain North American retailers in our Domestic Credit business. Foreign exchange was also a factor, given the depreciation of the British pound and the Argentinian peso.
For the full year 2016, we've revised our outlook and now expect Solutions earnings to decline modestly from 2015. While fundamentals in our mobile business are promising, in 2016, we no longer expect growth from new and existing programs to offset declines in legacy businesses nor the loss of the tablet program. We are taking steps to help improve Solutions performance in 2017, including more rigorous expense management to generate profitable growth.
Let's now move to Specialty Property. Earnings decreased $43 million to $45 million. This is primarily due to 2 factors. Order included $33 million of reportable catastrophe losses from flooding in Louisiana. The remaining $10 million is related to ongoing normalization of lender-placed.
As a result of the catastrophe losses, the combined ratio of our risk-based businesses increased 12 points to 92%. Absent cats combined ratio was flat year-over-year as lower general expenses helped offset declining lender-placed premiums. Our fee-based capital light offerings that comprised multi-family housing and mortgage solutions generated a pretax margin of 9.7%. This was down 5.5 points from the prior period. The decrease was mainly driven by higher expenses needed to support growth in our field services and valuation businesses.
While we believe we've grown revenues well in excess of the market, we do need to drive greater operating efficiencies across our mortgage solutions platform to deliver our margin target of 15% to 20% by 2020 for all of the property fee-based capital light offerings.
Turning to revenue. Net earned premiums and fees in Specialty Property decreased 3%, primarily due to lower placement and premium rates and lender-placed, while multi-family housing and mortgage solutions increased by 16%.
Diving deeper, multi-family housing revenue increased 10% from the prior year period. This reflects a higher volume of renters policies sold through our affinity channels and increased penetration rates across our property management network.
For mortgage solutions, fee income was up 22%, including the July acquisition of American Title. Organic growth in the quarter totaled 7% due to greater production from valuation services.
Our 2016 outlook for Specialty Property is unchanged. We continue to expect lower revenue and profits, primarily reflecting the normalization of our lender-placed business. As Alan noted earlier, catastrophe losses from Hurricane Matthew will impact our fourth quarter results.
Looking ahead to 2017, we anticipate a continued decline of lender-placed revenue and earnings as we move closer to a normalized steady state. The 2.7 million loans onboarded this quarter are expected to produce modest premiums next year, though not enough to offset the overall declining lender-placed market. We also expect ongoing expansion from our fee-based capital light offerings to account for a larger proportion of Specialty Property's results.
Turning now to Health run-off operations. Results were slightly better than anticipated. The $2 million loss in the quarter reflects slight reduction in estimated recoveries from the 2015 risk mitigation programs, which were offset by favorable claims development. Results also included some severance related costs as well as other indirect expenses not included in the premium deficiency reserve.
Year-to-date, we received $378 million in reinsurance and risk adjustment payments related to the 2015 Affordable Care Act policies. As of September 30, around $99 million of net receivables remain on our balance sheet. We expect CMS to remit the payments for these outstanding balances in 2017.
So far this year, we brought up $338 million to the holding company in dividends from Health. We continue to expect to receive approximately a total of $475 million. Of course, the timing will depend on regulatory approval.
Moving to Corporate. Loss for the quarter decreased $9 million to $17 million. This was primarily due to lower taxes and employee benefit cost. For the full year, we still expect the Corporate loss to approximate $70 million.
Throughout the year, we've taken steps to increase efficiencies in Corporate, such as freezing our pension plan. We also recognized the need for some additional investments to support our transformation, some of which are expected to flow through Corporate in 2017.
We will provide more details on our 2017 outlook for all of our operating segments on the fourth quarter earnings call in February.
Moving on to capital. We ended the third quarter with $625 million in deployable capital at the holding company. We received $418 million in total dividends in the third quarter, $339 million of dividends from capital previously supporting the Employee Benefits business and Health run-off operation, $79 million from Solutions and Specialty Property.
Our strong cash flow generation during the quarter allowed us to do 2 things. We returned $266 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and we invested $11 million in emerging technologies in the mobile and rental value chains.
In the first 3 weeks of October, we bought back an additional 742,000 shares, bringing the total number of shares we purchased year-to-date to just over 9 million.
So to summarize, while the results were disappointing, we remain committed to executing our transformation strategy to realize our potential to ensure long-term profitable growth in Housing and Lifestyle.

The real negative in the quarter, other than the IT, which Richard will talk about, was we just had lower trading volumes, where people are not -- or they didn't trade in as many phones, or they didn't upgrade or claim or whatever it might be. And that really varies a bit quarter-to-quarter, depending on our client programs, what's going on with competition and timing of new phone introductions availability.

I mean, first of all, if I step back and look at Assurant overall, we're in the middle, as we've talked about, of a multiyear transformation to really reposition this company, addressing the lender-placed normalization and putting us very focused on growth markets and growth opportunities in housing and lifestyle. And if you look at 2016, I think a lot of forward progress on that. We've largely completed the repositioning of the portfolio with benefits closed and most of those proceeds now up to the holding company. The Health wind down, more now complete than not. And the other critical thing we did this year was to realign our organization, which will create the opportunity to really take out effectiveness or improve effectiveness and improve our cost structure over time. If you think about mobile specifically, one of the ways we've been gaining share, and we've been gaining share now for multiple years. If you look at this business, it is dramatically bigger and stronger today than it was 3 years ago. The way we've gained that share is investing in capabilities, so that's kind of ongoing. This quarter, we had a little bit more than we expected. We made some decisions to continue to invest in technology around things like automating some of our processes, trying to better align our cost structure with some of those variabilities in volumes. And so again, on '17, we'll provide a outlook for '17 in February as we always do with our fourth quarter earnings, but at a high level, that's how I think about what's going on."

So let me start with just a comment broadly. As we think about our business and build it over the long term, we do have some quarter-to-quarter variability, just naturally with the size of our client programs and some of the businesses we operate in. But really 3 things were a little bit different than we had expected as we went into the back half of the year in the third quarter. We got good growth out of the new programs that we've announced over the last year or so, but a little bit less than we expected and that was the shift that began to develop and play down in the third quarter. The IT expenses, really choices we made. As we looked at our spending, we made some decisions to invest more in certain areas because we saw opportunities to keep and expand capabilities, we think positions us for long term. That was a choice we made in the quarter. And then we were a little bit surprised as the whole industry was on the decline in trading activity in the third quarter. That could be just a function of people waiting for the new phones to come out, some of the noise in the market around some of the introductions that happened in August and September. But fundamentally, if we take a long-term view on this business, if you think about, I'm going to talk about Solutions now, we put out in 2013 a goal that we could grow net operating income on average 10% per year in that business, not linear and we reaffirmed that in '15. Certainly, since 2013, we've more than achieved that goal. Obviously, in 2016, we're disappointed with what we are, but it doesn't change our longer term outlook that we have had great momentum in this business. We continue to invest and we feel very well positioned for continued growth in Solutions and in mobile."

Yesterday, after the market closed, we issued a news release announcing our third quarter 2016 results. The release and corresponding financial supplement are available at assurant.com. Earlier this year, we revised the earnings release and financial supplement to focus on housing and lifestyle. 
Net operating income reflects contributions from our operating segments: Assurant Solutions, Specialty Property and Corporate as well as interest expense. Operating results exclude Assurant Health runoff operations, the amortization of deferred gains from dispositions and other variable item. We believe these changes provide a more meaningful representation of our financials and better reflect our go-forward strategy.
On today's call, we will refer to other non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For more details on these measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation of the two, please refer to the news release and financial supplement available on assurant.com.
We'll begin our call this morning with prepared remarks before moving to Q&A. Some of the statements made today may be forward-looking and actual results may differ materially from those projected in these statements. Additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ from those projected can be found in yesterday's news release, as well as in our SEC reports, including our 2015 Form 10-K and first quarter Form 10-Q.

4026111,403594998,1067774,"Assurant, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 26, 2016",2016-10-26,"Earnings Calls","Assurant, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Suzanne, and good morning, everyone. Overall performance for the third quarter was disappointing and fell short of our expectations.

Overall performance for the third quarter was disappointing and fell short of our expectations. As we announced last week, the year-over-year decline in earnings was driven by increased catastrophe losses as well as lower than expected mobile results. However, we don't believe this quarter is reflective of the long-term potential of our housing and lifestyle offerings. 
Throughout this year, we've implemented the critical building blocks of our transformation. We've done so, first, by ensuring we're focused on the most attractive housing and lifestyle markets, where we can achieve leadership positions and generate attractive returns. And second, by implementing a more integrated organizational framework that will enable us to become more efficient and effective.
Starting with lifestyle, mobile and the broader connected living market offer attractive opportunities for growth. So far in 2016, we've added new partnerships and expanded our fee-based offerings across distribution channels. We're also taking steps to expand margins over time by ensuring we have the appropriate platforms and cost structures in place across our operations worldwide. Critical for this is a more robust technology infrastructure that maximizes our global capabilities.
Together, these actions set a stronger foundation for future profitable growth. While we no longer expect solutions net operating income to increase this year, we remain confident that we have the right strategy, business mix and capabilities to deliver 10% average annual growth and net operating income over the long term.
Turning to housing. We've invested in the transformation of our lender placed platform to further strengthen our leadership position in this important market. Just this quarter, we added a total of 2.7 million loans from 2 new clients and the block of loans we announced last quarter. We believe these wins demonstrate our clients' recognition of our strong platform, compliance processes and superior customer service.
The severe flooding in Louisiana and Hurricane Matthew are reminders of the importance of our products to homeowners across the country. Our commitment is brought to life by the rigor and dedication of our employees as they assess damages and pay claims as promptly as possible. To date, on behalf of Louisiana homeowners, we processed more than 2,000 claims with an over 95% completion rate. In addition, we also helped to administer claims for the National Flood Insurance Program as its second largest administrator. 
Just this month, Hurricane Matthew inflicted severe flooding and wind damage, particularly in parts of Georgia, the Carolinas and the Caribbean. Our claims field adjusters were again on site shortly after the hurricane passed through these regions to assess damage and begin processing claims. While it's still very early, we estimate losses from Hurricane Matthew could total up to $70 million after tax. This estimate is still preliminary, and we will update the market as we have a more complete view of the impact.
The wind down of Assurant Health is moving along as scheduled and represents another key aspect of our portfolio realignment. In the third quarter, we took an additional $189 million in dividends from health. These dividends, along with capital releases from the sale of employee benefits, give us the added flexibility to return capital to shareholders and invest in housing and lifestyle markets where we can outperform long term.
In 2016, we also took several steps to transform our organizational model worldwide, focusing on both functional areas and our lines of business. We've now set the foundation for a global business unit structure under the leadership of Gene Mergelmeyer as our Chief Operating Officer. We're also realigning our technology, risk, strategy and finance organizations and expect to have that work completed by year-end. As part of that effort, Richard and the finance team are also evaluating our financial reporting framework. We expect changes to be implemented early next year.
Our work to transform Assurant and build a strong future is on track. As we look ahead to 2017, our focus will be on profitable growth. To accomplish this, we'll continue to offer innovative products and services to meet consumer needs as well as completing the rollout of our new operating model to enhance efficiency across our global operations. And we'll continue to prudently deploy capital and maximize returns.
Progress will be measured against 3 key financial metrics: net operating income, operating earnings per diluted share and operating return on equity. All of these metrics exclude reportable catastrophe losses given the inherent volatility of weather. Through the 9 months of 2016, net operating income decreased by 14% to $308 million, primarily due to the expected decline of underplaced, the loss of the tablet program and lower contributions from legacy businesses.
Operating earnings per diluted share declined 6% to $4.89 driven by the factors I noted earlier. As we execute our transformation, we expect to grow net operating income and deploy capital prudently to support average annual operating EPS growth of 15% over time. Annualized operating ROE, excluding AOCI, was 11.3%. Expansion of our fee-based offerings will be an important driver to achieve our goal of 15% operating ROE by 2020.
At the end of September, holding company capital totaled $875 million after returning $783 million to shareholders through the first 9 months of 2016. This return represents more than half of our commitment to return $1.5 billion of capital through dividends and buybacks by the end of 2017. While there is more work to do, we believe our attractive business portfolio, combined with a more efficient operating structure, will produce more predictable, more diversified earnings that will continue to generate strong cash flow.
I will now turn the call over to Richard to review results for the quarter and the outlook in greater detail. Richard?"

As Alan said, this was below our expectations for the quarter. Excluding a $4.5 million tax benefit in the prior year period, earnings were down $5 million. The decrease was due to lower-than-expected contributions from mobile and the anticipated declines in legacy service contracts and domestic credit insurance. Specifically, core mobile results were down by nearly $6 million year-over-year, largely driven by $3 million of higher technology expenses to modernize certain systems.
We also realized lower mobile repair and logistics volumes as customers upgraded or traded in significantly fewer phones this quarter. Declines in legacy businesses accounted for another $3 million. These factors were partially offset by $3 million of higher real estate joint venture income.
Turning to revenue. Solutions' top line increased by 3% from the prior year period, primarily reflecting fee income, growth from new mobile subscribers. Premiums were also increased slightly year-over-year. Growth from vehicle service contracts was tempered by declines from certain North American retailers and our domestic credit business. Foreign exchange was also a factor, given the depreciation of the British pound and the Argentinian peso.
For the full year 2016, we've revised our outlook and now expect Solutions' earnings to decline modestly from 2015. While fundamentals in our mobile business are promising, in 2016, we no longer expect growth from new and existing programs to offset declines in legacy businesses nor the loss of the tablet program. We are taking steps to help improve Solutions' performance in 2017, including more rigorous expense management, to generate profitable growth.
Let's now move to Specialty Property. Earnings decreased $43 million to $45 million. This is primarily due to 2 factors. The quarter included $33 million of reportable catastrophe losses from flooding in Louisiana. The remaining $10 million related to ongoing normalization of lender placed. As a result of the catastrophe losses, the combined ratio for our risk-based businesses increased 12 points to 92%. Absent cats, the combined ratio was flat year-over-year, as lower general expenses helped offset declining lender-placed premiums. 
Our fee-based capital light offerings that comprise multi-family housing and mortgage solutions generated a pretax margin of 9.7%. This was down 5.5 points from the prior year period. The decrease was mainly driven by higher expenses needed to support growth in our field services and valuation businesses. While we believe we've grown revenues well in excess of the market, we do need to drive greater operating efficiencies across our mortgage solutions platform to deliver our margin target of 15% to 20% by 2020 for all of the property fee-based capital light offerings.
Turning to revenue. Net earned premiums and fees in Specialty Property decreased 3%, primarily due to lower placement in premium rates and lender placed, while multi-family housing and mortgage solutions increased by 16%. Diving deeper, multi-family housing revenue increased 10% from the prior year period. This reflects a higher volume of renters' policies sold through our affinity channels and increased penetration rates across our property management network.
For mortgage solutions, fee income was up 22%, including the July acquisition of American Title. Organic growth in the quarter totaled 7% due to greater production from valuation services. Our 2016 outlook for Specialty Property is unchanged. We continue to expect lower revenue and profits, primarily reflecting the normalization of our lender-placed business. As Alan noted earlier, catastrophe losses from Hurricane Matthew will impact our fourth quarter results.
Looking ahead to 2017, we anticipate a continued decline of lender-placed revenue and earnings as we move closer to a normalized steady state. The 2.7 million loans onboarded this quarter are expected to produce modest premiums next year, though not enough to offset the overall declining lender-placed market. We also expect ongoing expansion from our fee-based capital light offerings to account for a larger proportion of Specialty Property's results.
Turning now to health run-off operations. Results were slightly better than anticipated. The $2 million loss in the quarter reflects a slight reduction in estimated recoveries from the 2015 risk mitigation programs, which were offset by favorable claims development. Results also included some severance related costs as well as other indirect expenses not included in the premium deficiency reserve. Year-to-date, we received $378 million in reinsurance and risk adjustment payments related to the 2015 Affordable Care Act policies. As of September 30, around $99 million of net receivables remained on our balance sheet. We expect CMS to remit the payments for these outstanding balances in 2017. So far this year, we've brought up $338 million to the holding company in dividends from health. We continue to expect to receive approximately a total of $475 million. Of course, the timing will depend on regulatory approval.
Moving to corporate. The loss for the quarter decreased $9 million to $17 million. This was primarily due to lower taxes and employee benefit costs. For the full year, we still expect the corporate loss to approximate $70 million. Throughout the year, we've taken steps to increase efficiencies in corporate, such as freezing our pension plan. We also recognize the need for some additional investments to support our transformation, some of which are expected to flow through corporate in 2017. We will provide more details on our 2017 outlook for all of our operating segments on the fourth quarter earnings call in February.
Moving on to capital. We ended the third quarter with $625 million in deployable capital at the holding company. We received $418 million in total dividends in the third quarter. $339 million of dividends from capital previously supporting the employee benefits business and health run-off operation, $79 million from Solutions and Specialty Property.
Our strong cash flow generation during the quarter allowed us to do 2 things: We returned $266 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and we invested $11 million in emerging technologies in the mobile and rental value chains. In the first 3 weeks of October, we bought back an additional 742,000 shares, bringing the total number of shares repurchased year-to-date to just over 9 million.
So to summarize, while the results were disappointing, we remain committed to executing our transformation strategy to realize our potential to ensure long-term profitable growth in housing and lifestyle. Finally, I do want to thank those of you who I've had a chance to meet over the last couple of months at Assurant. I appreciate all your input and support. It's made my onboarding into the company both smooth and productive.

And if you look at the quarter at a high level, the positive was continued growth in subscribers, so people signing up for our programs and the handset programs. The real negative in the quarter, other than the IT, which Richard will talk about, was we just had lower trade-in volumes, where people are not -- they didn't trade in as many phones for either an upgrade or a claim or whatever it might be. And that really varies a bit quarter-to-quarter depending on our client programs, what's going on with competition, timing of new phone introductions, availability.

I mean, we are investing in capabilities. We are becoming more agile. We're looking longer term with the business and trying to become more variable, have more variable expenses.

There's also increased expenses from our legacy business or continued expenses, I guess I should say from our legacy business which was offset a little bit from some real estate JV income."

I mean, first of all, if I step back and look at Assurant overall, we're in the middle, as we've talked about, of a multiyear transformation to really reposition this company, addressing the lender-placed normalization and putting us very focused on growth markets and growth opportunities in housing and lifestyle. And if you look at 2016, I think a lot of forward progress on that. We've largely completed the repositioning of the portfolio with benefits closed and most of those proceeds now up to the holding company, the health wind down more now complete than not. And the other critical thing we did this year was to realign our organization which will create the opportunity to really take out effectiveness or improve effectiveness and improve our cost structure over time. If you think about mobile specifically, one of the ways we've been gaining share, and we've been gaining share now for multiple years. If you look at this business, it is dramatically bigger and stronger today than it was 3 years ago. The way we've gained that share is investing in capabilities, so that's kind of ongoing. This quarter, we had a little bit more than we expected. We made some decisions to continue to invest in technology around things like automating some of our processes, trying to better align our cost structure with some of those variabilities and volumes. And so again, on '17, we'll provide a outlook for '17 in February as we always do with our fourth quarter earnings, but at a high level, that's how I think about what's going on."

So let me start with just a comment broadly. As we think about our business and build it over the long term, we do have some quarter-to-quarter variability, just naturally with the size of our client programs and some of the businesses we operate in. But really 3 things were a little bit different than we had expected as we went into the back half of the year in the third quarter. We got good growth out of the new programs that we've announced over the last year or so, but a little bit less than we expected and that was a shift that began to develop and play out in the third quarter. The IT expenses, really choices we made. As we looked at our spending, we made some decisions to invest more in certain areas because we saw opportunities to deepen and expand capabilities we think positions us for the long term. That was a choice we made in the quarter. And then we were a little bit surprised, as the whole industry was, on the decline in trade-in activity in the third quarter. That could be just a function of people waiting for the new phones to come out, some of the noise in the market around some of the introductions that happened in August and September. But fundamentally, if we take a long-term view on this business, if you think about, I'm going to talk about Solutions now, we put out in 2013 a goal that we could grow net operating income on average 10% per year in that business, not linear, and we reaffirmed that in '15. Certainly, since 2013, we've more than achieved that goal. Obviously, in 2016, we're disappointed with what we are, but it doesn't change our longer-term outlook that we have had great momentum in this business, we continue to invest and we feel very well positioned for continued growth in Solutions and in mobile."

Our thesis was that we had unique advantaged opportunities, leveraging our partnerships with mortgage companies, and that's played out well, and you've seen the very strong organic growth we've had so far. We see no reason why that can't continue. Our market shares are still very modest. We're focused on really now translating that growth from the top line, which we think is going to continue, to bottom line. And we've said, we think we can get to 15% to 20% pretax margins long term over not only mortgage solutions but all the capital fee light -- capital light fee income businesses and property. But no, we're encouraged by the growth in that business. Just as an aside, we just hired a leader to come in and integrate those businesses together. We've now acquired 4 different companies and really allow us to continue the momentum there."
