Let me start off with the headlines for our 2015 results. Our organic sales grew 5%, that's at the high end of our 3% to 5% target. We achieved excellent cost savings and margin improvements, helping us deliver adjusted earnings per share toward the high end of our original guidance. And finally, we continued to improve our capital efficiency and return cash to shareholders. 
Now let's take a look at the details for our results. Let's start with sales. Fourth quarter net sales were $4.5 billion, that's down 6% with an 11-drag from currency rates. Full-year net sales were $18.6 billion, down 6% including a currency headwind of more than 10%. Organic sales rose was about 5%, for both the fourth quarter and the full year. 
On profitability, fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was 36%. The full year was 35.9%, up 160 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating margin was 17.2% in the fourth quarter. The full-year margin was 17.3%, that's up 120 basis points compared to the prior year. I'm encouraged that operating margins were up in all 3 business segments and across all 3 geographies. North America, developed markets and developing and emerging markets, excluding the impact of the Venezuelan devaluation. 
Our teams delivered $365 million of FORCE cost savings in 2015. That was above our initial target of at least $300 million and just $5 million shy of our all-time record. We expect another strong year in 2016, with a savings target of at least $350 million. 
In addition, our organizational restructuring is on track and it generated $65 million of savings in 2015. We expect additional savings of at least $50 million from this program in 2016. 
Commodities were $150 million benefit for the year, mostly in oil-based materials. That was at the high-end of our original assumption for the year. But on the other hand, currency declines severely impacted our earnings. For the year, the all-in earnings drag was about 25%, well above our going in to the year assumption for a drag of more than 15%. 
On the bottom line, fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.42, bringing the full-year to $5.76. That was up 5% compared to the results from continuing operations in 2014 and toward the high-end of our original guidance range of $5.60 to $5.80 per share. 
Turning to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations was $2.3 billion for the year versus $2.8 billion in 2014. A number of factors drove the lower cash amount, including our debt-financed pension contribution, the Halyard's spin-off and higher total working capital. I expect the significant improvement in cash generation in 2016. 
We reduced our primary working capital cash conversion cycle by 8 days in 2015 as a result of extending payables terms. On adjusted return on invested capital, we improved this metric 360 basis points, including benefits from the spin-off of Halyard Health. 
On capital allocation. In 2015, we returned $2.1 billion shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. For 2016, we plan to repurchase between $600 million and $900 million of Kimberly-Clark stock. We also expect to increase the dividend at a mid single-digit rate. That's generally consistent with the 5% growth in adjusted earnings per share that we delivered in 2015. 
Now let's look at the segments. 
In personal care. Organic sales rose 7%, continuing our long track record of delivering strong growth in this segment. Our personal care business grew 14% in developing and emerging markets. Operating margins were 20.5% in personal care, up 180 basis points. The improvement was enabled by organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input costs. 
In consumer tissue, organic sales were up more than 1%, including volume growth of 6% in North America. Consumer tissue operating margins were 17.5%, that was up 150 basis points and includes benefits from another year of excellent cost savings performance. 
In K-C Professional, organic sales increased 4% overall with 6% growth in developing and emerging markets. The segment top line also included a 1.5-point benefit from sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health in conjunction with a limited term supply agreement. Those sales should be somewhat lower in 2016. K-C Professional operating margins were healthy at 18.3%, up 50 basis points year-on-year. 
To summarize, our fourth quarter results capped off a very good year overall as we achieved mid single-digit growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share. We delivered strong cost savings and broad-based margin improvements and we continue to improve ROIC and allocate capital in shareholder friendly ways. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

I'll share my perspectives on our full year 2015 results and then I'll comment on our outlook for 2016. 
So starting with this past year. We delivered another year of good financial performance in a challenging environment. As Maria just mentioned, our organic sales grew about 5%. This reflects very good execution and compares favorably to many other consumer packaged goods companies. Our volume growth was 4% and that's our best performance since 2007 on this metric. 
Our business in the developing and emerging markets had another great year with 10% organic sales growth. This performance was highlighted by 14% growth in personal care. That's the fifth consecutive year this part of our portfolio has grown organically at a double-digit rate. 
Looking at some of our targeted growth initiatives in the developing and emerging markets. In diapers, our organic sales increased more than 35% in Eastern Europe, 25% in China and 10% in Brazil. Innovation across all these markets continues to help drive our growth. And in 2016, we will launch more product upgrades on Huggies throughout the developing and emerging markets. In China, Huggies Diapers are now sold in 115 cities and we're targeting to be in 130 cities by the end of the year. And in Brazil, as a result of the continued decline in the real, we've recently indicated -- initiated price increases across these categories. 
Elsewhere in personal care, our organic sales and feminine care rose double digits in developing and emerging markets. Our performance and fem care was especially strong in Latin America, led by Argentina and Brazil. We also had a very good year in China and in the Middle East and Eastern Europe and Africa on fem care. In addition, our adult care and baby wipes businesses also grew organic sales at double-digit rates in developing and emerging markets. 
K-C Professional organic sales rose mid-single digits in developing and emerging markets even though demand has slowed in some places toward the end of the year. 
Overall, our business in the developing and emerging markets was 30% of company's sales in 2015. Even though volatility has increased and economies are slowing in some parts of the world, we remain very optimistic about our growth prospects. For 2016, we're targeting organic sales growth of at least high single digits for our business in the developing and emerging markets. 
Turning to our developed markets business outside of North America. Organic sales for 2015 were even with the prior year. We continue to generate very solid growth in South Korea while market conditions were relatively soft in Western and Central Europe. 
Moving to our North American consumer business. We delivered 5% volume growth and excellent operating profit performance. At adult care, we delivered high single-digit volume growth with benefits from innovations, brand investments and category growth. Our market shares improved sequentially as the year progressed, with shares up 1 point in the second half of the year compared to the first half. 
In baby and child care, volumes were up mid-single digits on Huggies Baby Wipes and low single digits on Huggies Diapers. Our second quarter relaunch of Snug ‘N Dry Diapers is on track and helped deliver volume growth in 2015. 
In consumer tissue, volumes were up mid-single digits, with benefits from market share gains, good retail execution and increased promotion support. Performance was led by Cotonelle bathroom tissue and Viva towels. 
In K-C Professional in North America, volumes increased mid-single digits on our higher-margin wiper products business. In our washroom products, organic sales were up low single digits, roughly in line with the overall market. 
Maria has already highlighted how we continue to manage our company with financial discipline. So I'll just add that I'm encouraged with our cost savings delivery, our margin improvements, our improvements on return on invested capital and the cash that we've been able to return to our shareholders. 
I'm also pleased that we delivered bottom line earnings growth toward the high end of our original commitment even though currency rates were much worse than we had planned for the year. So all in all, I am proud of our team's accomplishments in 2015. We have good momentum overall and are focused on driving further improvements going forward. 
Now let's move on to our outlook for 2016. We will continue to focus on the fundamentals that create shareholder value. So in 2016, we will deliver healthy levels of organic sales growth, cost savings and margin expansion. We'll improve working capital, cash from operations and return on invested capital. And we will return a significant amount of cash to shareholders, again, in 2016. At the same time, we will continue to invest in our brands, our growth initiatives and our capabilities in order to improve Kimberly-Clark over the long term. 
In terms of our specific 2016 targets. 
On the top line, we expect organic sales growth of 3% to 5%. That's consistent with our long-term objective. 
On the bottom line, we're targeting adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.95 to $6.15. That's up 3% to 7% year-on-year. 
Similar to this past year, at this point, we're expecting that earnings will be higher in the second of the year compared to the first half. 
Like other multinational companies, we're facing continued currency headwinds. We're planning that currency translation will reduce sales and earnings by 5% to 6% this year. The all-in drag on earnings, including currency transaction we expect to approach 15%. These projections are based on forward exchange rates as of a couple of weeks ago which are pretty consistent with recent spot rates in most cases. 
To reduce the impact of currency headwinds, we plan to raise selling prices in some of our international markets. We are expecting a relatively benign year on the commodity front. We're starting the year planning for a total impact between $100 million of cost deflation to $50 million of cost inflation. Although some commodity costs should benefit from lower oil prices, others like polypropylene resin in North America are being impacted by market-specific dynamics. In addition, cost for materials in some international markets are expected to increase due to local inflation. 
So as we've said before, it's important to look at currencies, commodities and selling price assumptions together since they're all somewhat related. On average, we're expecting the net impact of these 3 factors to result in a high single-digit drag in our 2016 earnings. 
With that in mind, the underlying growth of 3% to 7% EPS growth that we've included in our outlook is pretty healthy. As we always do, we'll continue to closely monitor the environment and we'll provide updates on our progress and our outlook each quarter as the year unfolds. 
So in summary, we delivered another year of good financial performance in 2015. We expect to continue our momentum in 2016 and we remain very optimistic about our prospects to generate attractive shareholder returns through our Global Business Plan. 
This wraps up our prepared remarks. And now, we'll begin to take your questions."

We believe our primary competitor does as well. So I would guess that the current level of competitive activity will continue. We forget [ph] about the progress and our unit volume growth on diapers in North America and feel like we've got good momentum on diapers and training pants for sure. In China, we saw a bit more competitive pricing being spent in the market by some of the competitors which we matched up to at some extent. But we saw some of that in the third quarter. And as you may recall, we had a very strong volume quarter again and again have lots of innovation coming. So still tons of competition around, but I wouldn't say it's getting worse but it is continuing."

In Brazil for example, we saw category volumes decline a bit in the fourth quarter for both diapers and bathroom tissue, which you don't see that too often. At Eastern Europe, the Ukraine in particular has been a market that's been hard headed, if you look at category volumes. Some of that is because there's been quite a bit of parallel imports there that because of some value-added taxes that they put in place. So we are watching the consumer. On the other hand, where you've got real transaction exposure hitting these markets, you're trying to cover the transaction cost just to try to keep the shape of the P&L in order. I think every major CPG is in that balancing act right now."

And then we look at share buybacks to balance out what we do with the remainder of both our cash flow and our remaining debt capacity under the A credit rating metric. So we'll see how that unfolds during the year. You know that we took our debt up in 2015 and ended the year at $7.8 billion. But as a reminder, a big chunk of that came from the debt finance pension contribution that we made in 2015. But going forward, we expect stronger cash flows in 2016 from operations.

And so there really was very minimal margin drag on the company. In fact, this year, because they shrunk as a percent of the company's overall sales, we actually had a slight margin tailwind this year from a mix standpoint. But getting back to the root cause, we tend to focus on gross margins in emerging markets and trying to narrow that gap. And narrowing the gap is a little closer than the operating margin. Because in some markets where we are investing in A&P or building infrastructure to support a larger business, we're not quite as efficient between the lines in the international market shift. But it's -- that's one that seems working on them. And our markets that are at scale like Korea, you see margins there that are at or above the North American levels in individual categories."

And part of the other expense hit we took in the quarter was the devaluation that happened in the December. That probably was a $0.03 hit to our fourth quarter results. But I actually feel pretty optimistic about Argentina over the long term. And so as we see the new government coming in place and they're opening up their markets, so there's some product categories for example that were imported, like our PCB [ph] business in Argentina, had to import all their safety products so they're not manufacturing anything local there. Well, over the last year so, we were not allowed to import. So we had to kind of go out of that business. That's all going to open up in '16. So there will be a translation and transaction hit. But I'm more optimistic about the future of Argentina going forward."

They sold more out-the-door than they purchased in-the-door. So I think those guys are calendar year end and they were doing some inventory level trimming as they hit their year end. I'd say in other markets like Brazil, which is a big market for KCP, there, you've seen more. Just the decline in GDP has had a pretty big impact on business activities. It's the fact to keep KCP market much more than the consumer market for the year. And in other markets, China kind of a mixed bag, a little bit of a weaker quarter for us. And some of that was execution on our front that we need to improve. And there is plenty of competition there, probably a bit of the economic slowdown. But again, that's market still growing overall.

So if you can help us understand kind of like the sustainability of that, how much of this earnings growth in 2016 has to do with savings versus leverage versus that kind of absorb as much? Because one of the things that I noticed now is that the share repos are coming down relative to the past. So basically, the financial side of the EPS growth is less of a contributor. So if you can explain to us, what is -- what do you think is the earnings power of this company? Because 30 -- 20% on top of 30% currency neutral EPS growth is pretty substantial. Thank you. .

So the things that helped us get further along in 2015 and will help us again in 2016 has been strong volume growth. And so good organic topline and a strong cost savings programs and we've been ramping that up over the years and it's been never more important that in times like this. And so if you look at the organic topline drivers, we feel pretty good about the innovation program that we've got as well as the portfolio of markets that we are growing, and when the categories that are still growing, there's opportunity for geographic expansion. On the cost savings front, the 3 factors that are driving us there are negotiated material savings, our basic productivity programs and material specification changes. And we're getting organized to deliver that in an even more consistent basis going forward with some of the work that we're doing with a new global supply chain leader.

And then how you adjust for Europe and how you're kind of both sources and uses, please."

We're fortunate that have a lot of opportunity to invest in higher returning capital projects that support both our topline growth and savings. If you",484,"Sure. Let me take a crack at it and then Tom can certainly jump in here. On -- let me start with CapEx. We're fortunate that have a lot of opportunity to invest in higher returning capital projects that support both our topline growth and savings. If you think about our CapEx, you can think of the spend in 3 areas: Growth, which support expansion capital, and also investment behind our innovation; cost savings, which is the second category, a lot of that supports the for savings that you're seeing come through and that we talk about; and then the third category on maintenance, we fund our operations to adequately maintain a productive and safe manufacturing environment. So those are the 3 categories. And I think the range of $950 million to $1.50 billion is about the right way given our business and the opportunity that we have in the size of our operations and the opportunities that we have expansion in some of the geographies. We'll continue to monitor that overtime. As you know, we hired a Head of Global Supply Chain and [indiscernible] our organizations will work with the finance team and the local operators to make sure that we continue to make sure that we're optimized there at the CapEx spend as we move forward. On working capital, I said that I thought our working capital usage was a bit higher than we'd like it to be. I think the areas of opportunities that we have in 2016 are around areas like inventory. We talked about strong performance on payables in 2015. And so again, with our global supply chain organization working with our local teams, we'll be focusing on what we can do on the inventory side. And then in '15, we also had some negative impact on working capital from currency, on our derivative settlements that we used to manage our exposures on the balance sheet. And then also, we had a large tax receivable that moved up into AR at the end of the year. So when you look at the numbers, it's there, that's in there too. I think the third part of your question was around buyback. And that goes back to what I said earlier that we are very focused on maintaining our A credit rating. So there is, as you know, a set of metrics around A and we watch those very closely. And then look at how the cash flow come in, make sure that we fund the dividend, invest our business through CapEx and then, the remainder determines how much we buyback. And we use the cash flow and then any capacity that we have on the debt side within that A rating to really fund buybacks. So depending on where the results of the operations come in will depend on the fact within the range of the share buyback for 2016."

You're only taking about 6% price mix, say, in those -- in that market, in the personal care business. So there's still a very large gap between the currency and what you are taking from a pricing perspective. In your goal of taking prices further up, what gap should we think about between those 2 numbers as a target?"

We are trying to cover the transaction exposure. But as we -- as you look at our net income impact, that also includes things like the balance sheet remeasurement in Argentina that flowed through other expense or any other hedging gains and losses. And so they're looking more like the run rate transaction exposure on the impact on imported materials and what their ongoing cost of goods is going to be and using that to think about pricing going forward. And then balancing that with what does your renovation plan look like. What are the things can we do to substitute the local source material and avoid the transaction exposure. And so it is a market by market approach. And again, I would say, in Latin America and Eastern Europe is where you found both those markets are, I guess, I'd say used to dealing with high inflation. And so when you get hit with this, people aren't shy about taking price. But in other markets, you're not going to see that in Korea. You're not going to see that in Australia."

And focus, if you could, and answer a little bit on China specifically given the massive volume improvements you've seen, your massive growth you've seen in volume as opposed to pricing. And perhaps, you guys have seen it and we certainly see it, the disconnect in the Nielsen data in China which clearly is not perfect [indiscernible] all channels. But there's a very quick deceleration on the back end of the quarter last year. And do see that being a disconnect because online is growing more or the data isn't that good or what's going on there. Because you're going to have to continue to get very good numbers in terms of growth in China to make some of your top line targets for this year.

So single day was November 11, which was huge for us as well as for all of the online players. So that probably skewed the Nielsen data which tends to look at measured and baby stores because there was a lot of online activity, and particularly in November. But again, I'd say, if you were to decompose our growth in China, we increased the number of cities. I think we started the year at 105 and we ended the year at 115. We'll be at 130 by the end of this year. Now each incremental city is incrementally a little bit smaller. But you still are seeing good geographic expansion. We're still growing share in the cities that we're in. We're doing a ton at e-commerce. And that channel is growing pretty dramatically in China. So it's probably 1/3 of our diaper sales were in e-commerce which is overweight the rest of the category. We're still seeing good mid tier Super Premium segment growth where we tended to do better. So again, I'd say China, we're pretty bullish, lots of competition. But good growth in innovation coming and some geography expansion as well."

Let me start off with the headlines for our 2015 results. Our organic sales grew 5%. That's at the high end of our 3% to 5% target. We achieved excellent cost savings and margin improvements, helping us deliver adjusted earnings per share towards the high end of our original guidance. And finally, we continue to improve our capital efficiency and return cash to shareholders. 
Now let's take a look at the details for our results. Let's start with sales. Fourth quarter net sales were $4.5 billion, that's down 6% with an 11-drag from currency rates. Full year net sales were $18.6 billion, down 6% including a currency headwind of more than 10%. Organic sales growth was about 5%, for both the fourth quarter and the full year. 
On profitability, fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was 36%. The full year was 35.9%, up 160 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating margin was 17.2% in the fourth quarter. The full year margin was 17.3%, that's up 120 basis points compared to the prior year. I'm encouraged that operating margins were up in all 3 business segments and across all 3 geographies. North America, developed markets and developing and emerging markets, excluding the impact of the Venezuelan devaluation. 
Our teams delivered $365 million of FORCE cost savings in 2015. That was above our initial target of at least $300 million and just $5 million shy of our all-time record. We expect another strong year in 2016, with a savings target of at least $350 million. 
In addition, our organizational restructuring is on track and it generated $65 million of savings in 2015. We expect additional savings of at least $50 million from this program in 2016. 
Commodities were $150 million benefit for the year, mostly in oil-based materials. That was at the high end of our original assumption for the year. But on the other hand, currency declines severely impacted our earnings. For the year, the all-in earnings drag was about 25%, well above our going in to the year assumption for a drag of more than 15%. 
On the bottom line, fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.42, bringing the full year to $5.76. That was up 5% compared to the results from continuing operations in 2014 and towards the high end of our original guidance range of $5.60 to $5.80 per share. 
Turning to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations was $2.3 billion for the year versus $2.8 billion in 2014. A number of factors drove the lower cash amount, including our debt-financed pension contribution, the Halyard spin-off and higher total working capital. I expect a significant improvement in cash generation in 2016. 
We reduced our primary working capital cash conversion cycle by 8 days in 2015 as a result of extending payables terms. On adjusted return on invested capital, we improved this metric 360 basis points, including benefits from the spin-off of Halyard Health. 
On capital allocation. In 2015, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. For 2016, we plan to repurchase between $600 million and $900 million of Kimberly-Clark stock. We also expect to increase the dividend at a mid-single-digit rate. That's generally consistent with the 5% growth in adjusted earnings per share that we delivered in 2015. 
Now let's look at the segments. 
In personal care, organic sales rose 7%, continuing our long track record of delivering strong growth in this segment. Our personal care business grew 14% in developing and emerging markets. Operating margins were 20.5% in personal care, up 180 basis points. The improvement was enabled by organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input costs. 
In consumer tissue, organic sales were up more than 1%, including volume growth of 6% in North America. Consumer tissue operating margins were 17.5% that was up 150 basis points and includes benefits from another year of excellent cost savings performance. 
In K-C Professional, organic sales increased 4% overall, with 6% growth in developing and emerging markets. The segment top line also included a 1.5-points benefit from sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health in conjunction with a limited-term supply agreement. Those sales should be somewhat lower in 2016. K-C Professional operating margins were healthy at 18.3%, up 50 basis points year-on-year. 
To summarize, our fourth quarter results capped off a very good year overall as we achieved mid-single-digit growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share. We delivered strong cost savings and broad-based margin improvements, and we continue to improve ROIC and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

I'll share my perspectives on our full year 2015 results, and then I'll comment on our outlook for 2016. 
So starting with this past year. We delivered another year of good financial performance in a challenging environment. As Maria just mentioned, our organic sales grew about 5%. This reflects very good execution and compares favorably to many other consumer packaged goods companies. Our volume growth was 4% and that's our best performance since 2007 on this metric. 
Our business in the developing and emerging markets had another great year with 10% organic sales growth. This performance was highlighted by 14% growth in personal care. That's the fifth consecutive year this part of our portfolio has grown organically at a double-digit rate. 
Looking at some of our targeted growth initiatives in the developing and emerging markets. In diapers, our organic sales increased more than 35% in Eastern Europe, 25% in China and 10% in Brazil. Innovation across all these markets continues to help drive our growth. And in 2016, we will launch more product upgrades on Huggies throughout the developing and emerging markets. In China, Huggies Diapers are now sold in 115 cities, and we're targeting to be in 130 cities by the end of the year. And in Brazil, as a result of the continued decline in the real, we've recently indicated -- initiated price increases across these categories. 
Elsewhere in personal care, our organic sales and feminine care rose double digits in developing and emerging markets. Our performance in fem care was especially strong in Latin America, led by Argentina and Brazil. We also had a very good year in China and in the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa on fem care. In addition, our adult care and baby wipes businesses also grew organic sales at double-digit rates in developing and emerging markets. 
K-C Professional organic sales rose mid-single digits in developing and emerging markets even though demand has slowed in some places towards the end of the year. 
Overall, our business in the developing and emerging markets was 30% of company's sales in 2015. Even though volatility has increased and economies are slowing, in some parts of the world, we remain very optimistic about our growth prospects. For 2016, we're targeting organic sales growth of at least high single digits for our business in the developing and emerging markets. 
Turning to our developed markets business outside of North America. Organic sales for 2015 were even with the prior year. We continue to generate very solid growth in South Korea, while market conditions were relatively soft in Western and Central Europe. 
Moving to our North American consumer business. We delivered 5% volume growth and excellent operating profit performance. In adult care, we delivered high single-digit volume growth with benefits from innovations, brand investments and category growth. Our market shares improved sequentially as the year progressed, with shares up 1 point in the second half of the year compared to the first half. 
In baby and child care, volumes were up mid-single digits on Huggies Baby Wipes and low single digits on Huggies Diapers. Our second quarter relaunch of Snug & Dry Diapers is on track and helped deliver volume growth in 2015. 
In consumer tissue, volumes were up mid-single digits, with benefits from market share gains, good retail execution and increased promotion support. Performance was led by Cotonelle bathroom tissue and Viva towels. 
In K-C Professional, North America, volumes increased mid-single digits on our higher-margin wiper products business. And in washroom products, organic sales were up low single digits, roughly in line with the overall market. 
Maria has already highlighted how we continue to manage our company with financial discipline. So I'll just add that I'm encouraged with our cost savings delivery, our margin improvements, our improvements on return on invested capital and the cash that we've been able to return to our shareholders. 
I'm also pleased that we delivered bottom line earnings growth toward the high end of our original commitment even though currency rates were much worse than we had planned for the year. So all in all, I'm proud of our team's accomplishments in 2015. We have good momentum overall, and we're focused on driving further improvements going forward. 
Now let's move on to our outlook for 2016. We will continue to focus on the fundamentals that create shareholder value. So in 2016, we'll deliver healthy levels of organic sales growth, cost savings and margin expansion. We'll improve working capital, cash from operations and return on invested capital. And we will return a significant amount of cash to shareholders, again, in 2016. At the same time, we'll continue to invest in our brands, our growth initiatives and our capabilities in order to improve Kimberly-Clark over the long term. 
In terms of our specific 2016 targets. 
On the top line, we expect organic sales growth of 3% to 5%. That's consistent with our long-term objective. 
On the bottom line, we're targeting adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.95 to $6.15. That's up 3% to 7% year-on-year. 
Similar to this past year, at this point, we're expecting that earnings will be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half. 
Like other multinational companies, we're facing continued currency headwinds. We're planning that currency translation will reduce sales and earnings by 5% to 6% this year. The all-in drag on earnings, including currency transaction we'd expect to do approach 15%. These projections are based on forward exchange rates as of a couple of weeks ago which are pretty consistent with recent spot rates in most cases. 
To reduce the impact of currency headwinds, we plan to raise selling prices in some of our international markets. We are expecting a relatively benign year on the commodity front. We're starting the year, planning for a total impact between $100 million of cost deflation to $50 million of cost inflation. Although some commodity costs should benefit from lower oil prices, others like polypropylene resin in North America are being impacted by market-specific dynamics. In addition, cost for materials in some international markets are expected to increase due to local inflation. 
So as we've said before, it's important to look at currencies, commodities and selling price assumptions together since they're all somewhat related. On average, we're expecting the net impact of these 3 factors to result in a high single-digit drag in our 2016 earnings. 
With that in mind, the underlying growth of 3% to 7% EPS growth that we've included in our outlook is pretty healthy. As we always do, we'll continue to closely monitor the environment, and we'll provide updates on our progress and our outlook each quarter as the year unfolds. 
So in summary, we delivered another year of good financial performance in 2015. We expect to continue our momentum in 2016 and we remain very optimistic about our prospects to generate attractive shareholder returns through our Global Business Plan. 
This wraps up our prepared remarks. And now, we'll begin to take your questions."

We believe our primary competitor does as well. So I would guess that the current level of competitive activity will continue. We forget about the progress and our unit volume growth on diapers in North America and feel like we've got good momentum on diapers and training pants for sure. In China, we saw a bit more competitive pricing being spent in the market by some of the competitors which we matched up to at some extent. But we saw some of that in the third quarter, as you may recall, but had a very strong volume quarter again and again have lots of innovation coming. So still tons of competition around, but I wouldn't say it's getting worse but it is continuing."

In Eastern Europe, the Ukraine in particular has been a market that's been hard headed, if you look at category volumes. Some of that is because there's been quite a bit of parallel imports there that because of some value-added taxes that they put in place. So we are watching the consumer. On the other hand, where you've got real transaction exposure hitting these markets, you're trying to cover the transaction cost just to try to keep the shape of the P&L in order. I think every major CPG is in that balancing act right now."

And then we look at share buybacks to balance out what we do with the remainder of both our cash flow and our remaining debt capacity under the A credit rating metric. So we'll see how that unfolds during the year. You know that we took our debt up in 2015 and ended the year at $7.8 billion. But as a reminder, a big chunk of that came from the debt finance pension contribution that we made in 2015. But going forward, we expect stronger cash flows in 2016 from operations.

In fact, this year, because they shrunk as a percent of the company's overall sales, we actually had a slight margin tailwind this year from a mix standpoint. But getting back to the root cause, we tend to focus on gross margins in emerging markets and trying to narrow that gap. And narrow the gap is a little closer than operating margin. Because in some markets where we are investing in A&P or building infrastructure to support a larger business, we're not quite as efficient between the lines in the international market shift. But it's -- that's one that seems working on. And our markets that are at scale like Korea, you see margins there that are at or above the North American levels in individual categories."

We had a little softer fourth quarter on top line than we were expecting. Overall for the year, they had decent organic growth which is what we tend to look at. In North America, we saw some distributor inventory, destocking, because we look at our out-the-door sales versus our in-the-door sales in the fourth quarter. They sold more out-the-door than they purchased in-the-door. So I think those guys are calendar year-ends. They were doing some inventory level trimming as they hit their year-end. I'd say in other markets like Brazil, which is a big market for KCP, there, you've seen more. Just the decline in GDP has had a pretty big impact on business activities. It's affected the key KCP market much more than the consumer market for the year. And other markets, China kind of a mixed bag, with a little weaker quarter for us. And some of that was execution on our front that we need to improve. And there is plenty of competition there, probably a bit of the economic slowdown. But again, that market's still growing overall. It's just not at the same pace that it once was. So lots of different issues in individual markets that kind of added up to a little less than we were thinking we were going to get on the top line."

Because one of the things that I'm noticing now is that the share repos are coming down relative to the past. So basically, the financial side of the EPS growth is less of a contributor.

So the things that helped us get further along in 2015 and will help us, again, in 2016 has been strong volume growth. And so good organic top line and a strong cost savings programs, and we've been ramping that up over the years. And it's been never more important than in times like this. And so if you look at the organic top line drivers, we feel pretty good about the innovation program that we've got as well as the portfolio of markets that we're growing, and with the categories are still growing, there's still opportunity for geographic expansion. On the cost savings front, the 3 factors that are driving us there are negotiated material savings, our basic productivity programs and material specification changes. And we are getting organized to deliver that in an even more consistent basis going forward, with some of the work that we're doing with a new global supply chain leader.

Eastern Europe has been the other place where you've seen real currency volatility, where everyone in those markets has been pretty aggressive on pricing. And so that would account for most of it. If you looked at a lot of the other developed markets like Australia, where there's been a little bit of currency movement or even Western Europe, you're probably not going to get a lot of pricing for the sized currency moves that you're seeing there. It will be very low single digits, if at all. And so I think that's sort of the way it's shaking out as you get a few hotspots, where there's been big currency swings where you get price recovery because everybody is being hit with the same wave of transactional cost hits.

Let me take a crack at it and Tom can certainly jump in here. On -- let me start with CapEx. We're fortunate to have a lot of opportunity to invest in high returning capital projects that support both our top line growth and savings. If you think about our CapEx, you can think of the spend in 3 areas: Growth, which support expansion capital, and also investment behind our innovation; cost savings, which is the second category, a lot of that supports the FORCE savings that you're seeing come through and that we talk about; and then the third category on maintenance. We fund our operations to adequately maintain a productive and safe manufacturing environment. So those are the 3 categories. And I think the range of $950 million to $1.50 billion is about right for our business now and given the opportunities that we have in the size of our operations and the opportunities that we have for expansion in some of the geographies. We'll continue to monitor that over time. As you know, we hired a Head of Global Supply Chain and under her, organizations will work with the finance team and the local operators to make sure that we continue to make sure that we're optimized there at CapEx spend as we move forward. On working capital, I said that I thought our working capital usage was a bit higher than we'd like it to be. I think the areas of opportunities that we have in 2016 are around areas like inventory. We talked about strong performance on payables in 2015. And so again, with our global supply chain organization working with our local teams, we'll be focusing on what we can do on the inventory side. And then in '15, we also had some negative impacts on working capital from currency, on our derivative settlements that we used to manage our exposures on the balance sheet. And then also, we had a large tax receivable that moved up into AR at the end of the year. So when you look at the numbers, that's in there too. I think the third part of your question was around buyback. And that goes back to what I said earlier that we're very focused on maintaining our A credit rating. So there is, as you know, a set of metrics around A, and we watch those very closely. And then look at how did the cash flows come in, make sure that we fund the dividend, invest our business through CapEx and then, the remainder determines how much we buyback. And we use the cash flow and then any capacity that we have on the debt side within that A rating to really fund buybacks. So depending on where the results of the operations come in will depend on the fact within the range on the share buybacks for 2016."

We are trying to cover the transaction exposure. But as we -- as you look at our net income impact, that also includes things like the balance sheet remeasurement in Argentina that flowed through other expense or any other hedging gains and losses. And so they're looking more like the run rate transaction exposure on the impact on imported materials and what their ongoing cost of goods is going to be and using that to think about pricing going forward. And then balancing that with what's your innovation plan look like. What are the things can we do to substitute a local source material and avoid the transaction exposure. And so it is a market-by-market approach. And again, I would say, in Latin America and Eastern Europe is where you found both those markets are, I guess, I'd say used to dealing with high inflation. And so when you get hit with this, people aren't shy about taking price. But in other markets, you're not going to see that in Korea. You're not going to see that in Australia."

You actually decelerated a little bit to high single as opposed to low doubles but still very, very strong. Can you try to help, again, with how much of that is kind of shelf space gaining or distribution gaining versus same-store sales? And focus, if you could, and then answer a little bit on China specifically, given the massive volume improvements you've seen, or massive growth you've seen in volumes as opposed to pricing. And perhaps, you guys have seen it. We certainly seen it, the disconnect in the Nielsen data in China, which clearly is not perfect because it doesn't cover all channels. But there's a very quick deceleration in the back end of the quarter last year. And do you see that being a disconnect because online is growing more, or the data isn't that good or what's going on there? Because you're going to have to continue to get very good numbers in terms of growth in China to make some of your top line targets for this year, so I'm trying to figure out that data and how that's a disconnect there?"

And so single day was November 11, which was huge for us as well as for all of the online players. So that probably skewed the Nielsen data which tends to look at measured and baby stores because there was a lot of online activity, and particularly in November. But again, I'd say, if you were to decompose our growth in China, we increased the number of cities. I think we started the year at 105. We ended the year at 115. We'll be at 130 by the end of this year. Now each incremental city is incrementally, a little bit smaller. But you still are seeing good geographic expansion. We're still growing share in the cities that we're in. We're doing a ton in e-commerce. And that channel is growing pretty dramatically in China. And so it's probably 1/3 of our diaper sales were in e-commerce, which is overweight the rest of the category. We're still seeing good mid-tier Super Premium segment growth, where we tended to do better. So again, I'd say China, we're pretty bullish, lots of competition, but good growth in innovation coming and some geography expansion as well."

From a capacity standpoint, they are -- the Canadian market should be pretty stable for a while. They have to run the mills this time of the year or they freeze up.

Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start off with the headlines for our 2015 results. Our organic sales grew 5%. That's at the high end of our 3% to 5% target.

Let me start off with the headlines for our 2015 results. Our organic sales grew 5%. That's at the high end of our 3% to 5% target. We achieved excellent cost savings and margin improvements, helping us deliver adjusted earnings per share towards the high end of our original guidance. And finally, we continue to improve our capital efficiency and return cash to shareholders. 
Now let's take a look at the details for our results. Let's start with sales. Fourth quarter net sales were $4.5 billion, that's down 6% with an 11-point drag from currency rates. Full year net sales were $18.6 billion, down 6% including a currency headwind of more than 10%. Organic sales growth was about 5%, for both the fourth quarter and the full year. 
On profitability, fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was 36%. The full year was 35.9%, up 160 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating margin was 17.2% in the fourth quarter. The full year margin was 17.3%, that's up 120 basis points compared to the prior year. I'm encouraged that operating margins were up in all 3 business segments and across all 3 geographies. North America, developed markets and developing and emerging markets, excluding the impact of the Venezuelan devaluation. 
Our teams delivered $365 million of FORCE cost savings in 2015. That was above our initial target of at least $300 million and just $5 million shy of our all-time record. We expect another strong year in 2016, with a savings target of at least $350 million. 
In addition, our organizational restructuring is on track and it generated $65 million of savings in 2015. We expect additional savings of at least $50 million from this program in 2016. 
Commodities were $150 million benefit for the year, mostly in oil-based materials. That was at the high end of our original assumption for the year. But on the other hand, currency declines severely impacted our earnings. For the year, the all-in earnings drag was about 25%, well above our going in to the year assumption for a drag of more than 15%. 
On the bottom line, fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.42, bringing the full year to $5.76. That was up 5% compared to the results from continuing operations in 2014 and towards the high end of our original guidance range of $5.60 to $5.80 per share. 
Turning to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations was $2.3 billion for the year versus $2.8 billion in 2014. A number of factors drove the lower cash amount, including our debt-financed pension contribution, the Halyard spin-off and higher total working capital. I expect a significant improvement in cash generation in 2016. 
We reduced our primary working capital cash conversion cycle by 8 days in 2015 as a result of extending payables terms. On adjusted return on invested capital, we improved this metric 360 basis points, including benefits from the spin-off of Halyard Health. 
On capital allocation. In 2015, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. For 2016, we plan to repurchase between $600 million and $900 million of Kimberly-Clark stock. We also expect to increase the dividend at a mid-single-digit rate. That's generally consistent with the 5% growth in adjusted earnings per share that we delivered in 2015. 
Now let's look at the segments. 
In personal care, organic sales rose 7%, continuing our long track record of delivering strong growth in this segment. Our personal care business grew 14% in developing and emerging markets. Operating margins were 20.5% in personal care, up 180 basis points. The improvement was enabled by organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input costs. 
In consumer tissue, organic sales were up more than 1%, including volume growth of 6% in North America. Consumer tissue operating margins were 17.5% that was up 150 basis points and includes benefits from another year of excellent cost savings performance. 
In K-C Professional, organic sales increased 4% overall, with 6% growth in developing and emerging markets. The segment top line also included a 1.5-points benefit from sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health in conjunction with a limited-term supply agreement. Those sales should be somewhat lower in 2016. K-C Professional operating margins were healthy at 18.3%, up 50 basis points year-on-year. 
To summarize, our fourth quarter results capped off a very good year overall as we achieved mid-single-digit growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share. We delivered strong cost savings and broad-based margin improvements, and we continue to improve ROIC and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

This reflects very good execution and compares favorably to many other consumer packaged goods companies. Our volume growth was 4% and that's our best performance since 2007 on this metric. 
Our business in the developing and emerging markets had another great year with 10% organic sales growth. This performance was highlighted by 14% growth in personal care. That's the fifth consecutive year this part of our portfolio has grown organically at a double-digit rate. 
Looking at some of our targeted growth initiatives in the developing and emerging markets. In diapers, our organic sales increased more than 35% in Eastern Europe, 25% in China and 10% in Brazil. Innovation across all these markets continues to help drive our growth. And in 2016, we will launch more product upgrades on Huggies throughout the developing and emerging markets. In China, Huggies Diapers are now sold in 115 cities, and we're targeting to be in 130 cities by the end of the year. And in Brazil, as a result of the continued decline in the real, we've recently indicated -- initiated price increases across these categories. 
Elsewhere in personal care, our organic sales and feminine care rose double digits in developing and emerging markets. Our performance in fem care was especially strong in Latin America, led by Argentina and Brazil. We also had a very good year in China and in the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa on fem care. In addition, our adult care and baby wipes businesses also grew organic sales at double-digit rates in developing and emerging markets. 
K-C Professional organic sales rose mid-single digits in developing and emerging markets even though demand has slowed in some places towards the end of the year. 
Overall, our business in the developing and emerging markets was 30% of company's sales in 2015. Even though volatility has increased and economies are slowing in some parts of the world, we remain very optimistic about our growth prospects. For 2016, we're targeting organic sales growth of at least high single digits for our business in the developing and emerging markets. 
Turning to our developed markets business outside of North America. Organic sales for 2015 were even with the prior year. We continue to generate very solid growth in South Korea, while market conditions were relatively soft in Western and Central Europe. 
Moving to our North American consumer business. We delivered 5% volume growth and excellent operating profit performance. In adult care, we delivered high single-digit volume growth with benefits from innovations, brand investments and category growth. Our market shares improved sequentially as the year progressed, with shares up 1 point in the second half of the year compared to the first half. 
In baby and child care, volumes were up mid-single digits on Huggies Baby Wipes and low single digits on Huggies Diapers. Our second quarter relaunch of Snug & Dry Diapers is on track and helped deliver volume growth in 2015. 
In consumer tissue, volumes were up mid-single digits, with benefits from market share gains, good retail execution and increased promotion support. Performance was led by Cottonelle bathroom tissue and Viva towels. 
In K-C Professional, North America, volumes increased mid-single digits on our higher-margin wiper products business. And in washroom products, organic sales were up low single digits, roughly in line with the overall market. 
Maria has already highlighted how we continue to manage our company with financial discipline. So I'll just add that I'm encouraged with our cost savings delivery, our margin improvements, our improvements on return on invested capital and the cash that we've been able to return to our shareholders. 
I'm also pleased that we delivered bottom line earnings growth toward the high end of our original commitment even though currency rates were much worse than we had planned for the year. So all in all, I'm proud of our team's accomplishments in 2015. We have good momentum overall, and we're focused on driving further improvements going forward. 
Now let's move on to our outlook for 2016. We will continue to focus on the fundamentals that create shareholder value. So in 2016, we'll deliver healthy levels of organic sales growth, cost savings and margin expansion. We'll improve working capital, cash from operations and return on invested capital. And we will return a significant amount of cash to shareholders, again, in 2016. At the same time, we'll continue to invest in our brands, our growth initiatives and our capabilities in order to improve Kimberly-Clark over the long term. 
In terms of our specific 2016 targets. On the top line, we expect organic sales growth of 3% to 5%. That's consistent with our long-term objective. On the bottom line, we're targeting adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.95 to $6.15. That's up 3% to 7% year-on-year. 
Similar to this past year, at this point, we're expecting that earnings will be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half. 
Like other multinational companies, we're facing continued currency headwinds. We're planning that currency translation will reduce sales and earnings by 5% to 6% this year. The all-in drag on earnings, including currency transaction is expected to approach 15%. These projections are based on foreign exchange rates as of a couple of weeks ago which are pretty consistent with recent spot rates in most cases. 
To reduce the impact of currency headwinds, we plan to raise selling prices in some of our international markets. We are expecting a relatively benign year on the commodity front. We're starting the year, planning for a total impact between $100 million of cost deflation to $50 million of cost inflation. Although some commodity costs should benefit from lower oil prices, others like polypropylene resin in North America are being impacted by market-specific dynamics. In addition, cost for materials in some international markets are expected to increase due to local inflation. 
So as we've said before, it's important to look at currencies, commodities and selling price assumptions together since they're all somewhat related. On average, we're expecting the net impact of these 3 factors to result in a high single-digit drag in our 2016 earnings. 
With that in mind, the underlying growth of 3% to 7% EPS growth that we've included in our outlook is pretty healthy. As we always do, we'll continue to closely monitor the environment, and we'll provide updates on our progress and our outlook each quarter as the year unfolds. 
So in summary, we delivered another year of good financial performance in 2015. We expect to continue our momentum in 2016 and we remain very optimistic about our prospects to generate attractive shareholder returns through our Global Business Plan. 
This wraps up our prepared remarks. And now, we'll begin to take your questions."

But also, there's more activity in the second half of 2015 than there was in the first half. So if you looked at percent sold on deal and the level of A&P support across the category, it was probably increased for all the major brands. We've got quite a bit of innovation coming in 2016. We believe our primary competitor does as well. So I would guess that the current level of competitive activity will continue. We feel good about the progress and our unit volume growth on diapers in North America and feel like we've got good momentum on diapers and training pants for sure. In China, we saw a bit more competitive pricing being spent in the market by some of the competitors which we matched up to at some extent. But we saw some of that in the third quarter, as you may recall that had a very strong volume quarter again and again have lots of innovation coming. So still tons of competition around, but I wouldn't say it's getting worse but it is continuing."

In Brazil for example, we saw category volumes decline a bit in the fourth quarter for both diapers and bathroom tissue, which you don't see that too often. In Eastern Europe, the Ukraine in particular has been a market that's been hard hit, if you look at category volumes. Some of that is because there's been quite a bit of parallel imports there that because of some value-added taxes that they put in place. So we are watching the consumer. On the other hand, where you've got real transaction exposure hitting these markets, you're trying to cover the transaction cost just to try to keep the shape of the P&L in order. I think every major CPG is in that balancing act right now."

So at any point in time, we're looking at what our expected cash flows, our focus is on continuing to fund the dividend, to spend CapEx at healthy levels given the significant opportunities that we have in our business for high ROI return types of projects. And then we look at share buybacks to balance out what we do with the remainder of both our cash flow and our remaining debt capacity under the A credit rating metric. So we'll see how that unfolds during the year. You know that we took our debt up in 2015 and ended the year at $7.8 billion. But as a reminder, a big chunk of that came from the debt finance pension contribution that we made in 2015. But going forward, we expect stronger cash flows in 2016 from operations. And so we'll balance those things out as we go through the year."

In fact, this year, because they shrunk as a percent of the company's overall sales, we actually had a slight margin tailwind this year from a mix standpoint. But getting back to the root cause, we tend to focus on gross margins in emerging markets and trying to narrow that gap. And narrow the gap is a little closer than operating margin. Because in some markets where we are investing in A&P or building infrastructure to support a larger business, we're not quite as efficient between the lines in the international market shift. But it's -- that's one that the team is working on. And our markets that are at scale like Korea, you see margins there that are at or above the North American levels in individual categories."

They sold more out-the-door than they purchased in-the-door. So I think those guys are calendar year-ends. They were doing some inventory level trimming as they hit their year-end. I'd say in other markets like Brazil, which is a big market for KCP, there, you've seen more -- just the decline in GDP has had a pretty big impact on business activities. It's affected the key KCP market much more than the consumer market for the year. And other markets, China kind of a mixed bag, with a little weaker quarter for us. And some of that was execution on our front that we need to improve. And there is plenty of competition there, probably a bit of the economic slowdown. But again, that market's still growing overall.

So if you can help us understand kind of like the sustainability of that, how much of this earnings growth in 2016 has to do with savings versus leverage versus that can absorb as much? Because one of the things that I'm noticing now is that the share repos are coming down relative to the past. So basically, the financial side of the EPS growth is less of a contributor.

And when you net those 3 things together, it's a little smaller drag. As we talked about for 2016, it's probably a high single-digit drag. So then to deliver 3% to 7% growth puts your real earnings power more in the low double-digit range, which is still above where our historical average has been. So the things that helped us get further along in 2015 and will help us, again, in 2016 has been strong volume growth. And so good organic top line and a strong cost savings programs, and we've been ramping that up over the years. And it's been never more important than in times like this. And so if you look at the organic top line drivers, we feel pretty good about the innovation program that we've got as well as the portfolio of markets that we're growing, and when the categories are still growing, there's still opportunity for geographic expansion. On the cost savings front, the 3 factors that are driving us there are negotiated material savings, our basic productivity programs and material specification changes. And we are getting organized to deliver that in an even more consistent basis going forward, with some of the work that we're doing with a new global supply chain leader. So I feel pretty good about volume growth and our cost savings performance.

I think anytime you have a discussion about this, it's always the other guy that started it. So I'm sure there are some cases where we were aggressive behind innovation and trying to drive our business, and that may have precipitated the response or maybe the converse is true.

It will be very low single digits, if at all. And so I think that's sort of the way it's shaking out as you get a few hotspots, where there's been big currency swings where you get price recovery because everybody is being hit with the same wave of transactional cost hits.

Let me take a crack at it and Tom can certainly jump in here. On -- let me start with CapEx. We're fortunate to have a lot of opportunity to invest in high returning capital projects that support both our top line growth and savings. If you think about our CapEx, you can think of the spend in 3 areas: Growth, which support expansion capital, and also investment behind our innovation; cost savings, which is the second category, a lot of that supports the FORCE savings that you're seeing come through and that we talk about. And then the third category on maintenance, we fund our operations to adequately maintain a productive and safe manufacturing environment. So those are the 3 categories. And I think the range of $950 million to $1.50 billion is about right for our business now and given the opportunities that we have in the size of our operations and the opportunities that we have for expansion in some of the geographies. We'll continue to monitor that over time. As you know, we hired a Head of Global Supply Chain and under her, organizations will work with the finance team and the local operators to make sure that we continue to make sure that we're optimized there at CapEx spend as we move forward. On working capital, I said that I thought our working capital usage was a bit higher than we'd like it to be. I think the areas of opportunities that we have in 2016 are around areas like inventory. We talked about strong performance on payables in 2015. And so again, with our global supply chain organization working with our local teams, we'll be focusing on what we can do on the inventory side. And then in '15, we also had some negative impacts on working capital from currency, on our derivative settlements that we used to manage our exposures on the balance sheet. And then also, we had a large tax receivable that moved up into AR at the end of the year. So when you look at the numbers, that's in there too. I think the third part of your question was around buyback. And that goes back to what I said earlier that we're very focused on maintaining our A credit rating. So there is, as you know, a set of metrics around A, and we watch those very closely. And then look at how did the cash flows come in, make sure that we fund the dividend, invest our business through CapEx and then, the remainder determines how much we buy back. And we use the cash flow and then any capacity that we have on the debt side within that A rating to really fund buybacks. So depending on where the results of the operations come in will depend on the flex within the range on the share buybacks for 2016."

But you're only taking about 6% price mix, say, in those -- in that market, at least in the personal care business.

And so they're looking more like the run rate transaction exposure on the impact on imported materials and what their ongoing cost of goods is going to be and using that to think about pricing going forward. And then balancing that with what's your innovation plan look like. What other things can we do to substitute a local source material and avoid the transaction exposure. And so it is a market-by-market approach. And again, I would say, in Latin America and Eastern Europe is where you found both those markets are, I guess, I'd say used to dealing with high inflation. And so when you get hit with this, people aren't shy about taking price. But in other markets, you're not going to see that in Korea. You're not going to see that in Australia."

So that probably skewed the Nielsen data which tends to look at measured and baby stores because there was a lot of online activity, and particularly in November. But again, I'd say, if you were to decompose our growth in China, we increased the number of cities. I think we started the year at 105. We ended the year at 115. We'll be at 130 by the end of this year. Now each incremental city is incrementally, a little bit smaller. But you still are seeing good geographic expansion. We're still growing share in the cities that we're in. We're doing a ton in e-commerce. And that channel is growing pretty dramatically in China. And so it's probably 1/3 of our diaper sales were in e-commerce, which is overweight the rest of the category. We're still seeing good mid-tier Super Premium segment growth, where we tended to do better. So again, I'd say China, we're pretty bullish, lots of competition, but good growth in innovation coming and some geography expansion as well."

Thanks for joining the call today. Let me start off with the headlines for our 2015 results. Our organic sales grew 5%. That's at the high end of our 3% to 5% target.

Let me start off with the headlines for our 2015 results. Our organic sales grew 5%. That's at the high end of our 3% to 5% target. We achieved excellent cost savings and margin improvements, helping us deliver adjusted earnings per share towards the high end of our original guidance. And finally, we continue to improve our capital efficiency and return cash to shareholders. 
Now let's take a look at the details for our results. Let's start with sales. Fourth quarter net sales were $4.5 billion, that's down 6% with an 11-point drag from currency rates. Full year net sales were $18.6 billion, down 6% including a currency headwind of more than 10%. Organic sales growth was about 5%, for both the fourth quarter and the full year. 
On profitability, fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was 36%. The full year was 35.9%, up 160 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating margin was 17.2% in the fourth quarter. The full year margin was 17.3%, that's up 120 basis points compared to the prior year. I'm encouraged that operating margins were up in all 3 business segments and across all 3 geographies. North America, developed markets and developing and emerging markets, excluding the impact of the Venezuelan devaluation. 
Our teams delivered $365 million of FORCE cost savings in 2015. That was above our initial target of at least $300 million and just $5 million shy of our all-time record. We expect another strong year in 2016, with a savings target of at least $350 million. 
In addition, our organizational restructuring is on track and it generated $65 million of savings in 2015. We expect additional savings of at least $50 million from this program in 2016. 
Commodities were $150 million benefit for the year, mostly in oil-based materials. That was at the high end of our original assumption for the year. But on the other hand, currency declines severely impacted our earnings. For the year, the all-in earnings drag was about 25%, well above our going in to the year assumption for a drag of more than 15%. 
On the bottom line, fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.42, bringing the full year to $5.76. That was up 5% compared to the results from continuing operations in 2014 and towards the high end of our original guidance range of $5.60 to $5.80 per share. 
Turning to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations was $2.3 billion for the year versus $2.8 billion in 2014. A number of factors drove the lower cash amount, including our debt-financed pension contribution, the Halyard spin-off and higher total working capital. I expect a significant improvement in cash generation in 2016. 
We reduced our primary working capital cash conversion cycle by 8 days in 2015 as a result of extending payables terms. On adjusted return on invested capital, we improved this metric 360 basis points, including benefits from the spin-off of Halyard Health. 
On capital allocation. In 2015, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. For 2016, we plan to repurchase between $600 million and $900 million of Kimberly-Clark stock. We also expect to increase the dividend at a mid-single-digit rate. That's generally consistent with the 5% growth in adjusted earnings per share that we delivered in 2015. 
Now let's look at the segments. 
In personal care, organic sales rose 7%, continuing our long track record of delivering strong growth in this segment. Our personal care business grew 14% in developing and emerging markets. Operating margins were 20.5% in personal care, up 180 basis points. The improvement was enabled by organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input costs. 
In consumer tissue, organic sales were up more than 1%, including volume growth of 6% in North America. Consumer tissue operating margins were 17.5% that was up 150 basis points and includes benefits from another year of excellent cost savings performance. 
In K-C Professional, organic sales increased 4% overall, with 6% growth in developing and emerging markets. The segment top line also included a 1.5-points benefit from sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health in conjunction with a limited-term supply agreement. Those sales should be somewhat lower in 2016. K-C Professional operating margins were healthy at 18.3%, up 50 basis points year-on-year. 
To summarize, our fourth quarter results capped off a very good year overall as we achieved mid-single-digit growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share. We delivered strong cost savings and broad-based margin improvements, and we continue to improve ROIC and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

I'll share my perspectives on our full year 2015 results, and then I'll comment on our outlook for 2016. 
So starting with this past year. We delivered another year of good financial performance in a challenging environment. As Maria just mentioned, our organic sales grew about 5%. This reflects very good execution and compares favorably to many other consumer packaged goods companies. Our volume growth was 4% and that's our best performance since 2007 on this metric. 
Our business in the developing and emerging markets had another great year with 10% organic sales growth. This performance was highlighted by 14% growth in personal care. That's the fifth consecutive year this part of our portfolio has grown organically at a double-digit rate. 
Looking at some of our targeted growth initiatives in the developing and emerging markets. In diapers, our organic sales increased more than 35% in Eastern Europe, 25% in China and 10% in Brazil. Innovation across all these markets continues to help drive our growth. And in 2016, we will launch more product upgrades on Huggies throughout the developing and emerging markets. In China, Huggies Diapers are now sold in 115 cities, and we're targeting to be in 130 cities by the end of the year. And in Brazil, as a result of the continued decline in the real, we've recently indicated -- initiated price increases across these categories. 
Elsewhere in personal care, our organic sales and feminine care rose double digits in developing and emerging markets. Our performance in fem care was especially strong in Latin America, led by Argentina and Brazil. We also had a very good year in China and in the Middle East, Eastern Europe and Africa on fem care. In addition, our adult care and baby wipes businesses also grew organic sales at double-digit rates in developing and emerging markets. 
K-C Professional organic sales rose mid-single digits in developing and emerging markets even though demand has slowed in some places towards the end of the year. 
Overall, our business in the developing and emerging markets was 30% of company's sales in 2015. Even though volatility has increased and economies are slowing in some parts of the world, we remain very optimistic about our growth prospects. For 2016, we're targeting organic sales growth of at least high single digits for our business in the developing and emerging markets. 
Turning to our developed markets business outside of North America. Organic sales for 2015 were even with the prior year. We continue to generate very solid growth in South Korea, while market conditions were relatively soft in Western and Central Europe. 
Moving to our North American consumer business. We delivered 5% volume growth and excellent operating profit performance. In adult care, we delivered high single-digit volume growth with benefits from innovations, brand investments and category growth. Our market shares improved sequentially as the year progressed, with shares up 1 point in the second half of the year compared to the first half. 
In baby and child care, volumes were up mid-single digits on Huggies Baby Wipes and low single digits on Huggies Diapers. Our second quarter relaunch of Snug & Dry Diapers is on track and helped deliver volume growth in 2015. 
In consumer tissue, volumes were up mid-single digits, with benefits from market share gains, good retail execution and increased promotion support. Performance was led by Cottonelle bathroom tissue and Viva towels. 
In K-C Professional, North America, volumes increased mid-single digits on our higher-margin wiper products business. And in washroom products, organic sales were up low single digits, roughly in line with the overall market. 
Maria has already highlighted how we continue to manage our company with financial discipline. So I'll just add that I'm encouraged with our cost savings delivery, our margin improvements, our improvements on return on invested capital and the cash that we've been able to return to our shareholders. 
I'm also pleased that we delivered bottom line earnings growth toward the high end of our original commitment even though currency rates were much worse than we had planned for the year. So all in all, I'm proud of our team's accomplishments in 2015. We have good momentum overall, and we're focused on driving further improvements going forward. 
Now let's move on to our outlook for 2016. We will continue to focus on the fundamentals that create shareholder value. So in 2016, we'll deliver healthy levels of organic sales growth, cost savings and margin expansion. We'll improve working capital, cash from operations and return on invested capital. And we will return a significant amount of cash to shareholders, again, in 2016. At the same time, we'll continue to invest in our brands, our growth initiatives and our capabilities in order to improve Kimberly-Clark over the long term. 
In terms of our specific 2016 targets. On the top line, we expect organic sales growth of 3% to 5%. That's consistent with our long-term objective. On the bottom line, we're targeting adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.95 to $6.15. That's up 3% to 7% year-on-year. 
Similar to this past year, at this point, we're expecting that earnings will be higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half. 
Like other multinational companies, we're facing continued currency headwinds. We're planning that currency translation will reduce sales and earnings by 5% to 6% this year. The all-in drag on earnings, including currency transaction is expected to approach 15%. These projections are based on foreign exchange rates as of a couple of weeks ago which are pretty consistent with recent spot rates in most cases. 
To reduce the impact of currency headwinds, we plan to raise selling prices in some of our international markets. We are expecting a relatively benign year on the commodity front. We're starting the year, planning for a total impact between $100 million of cost deflation to $50 million of cost inflation. Although some commodity costs should benefit from lower oil prices, others like polypropylene resin in North America are being impacted by market-specific dynamics. In addition, cost for materials in some international markets are expected to increase due to local inflation. 
So as we've said before, it's important to look at currencies, commodities and selling price assumptions together since they're all somewhat related. On average, we're expecting the net impact of these 3 factors to result in a high single-digit drag in our 2016 earnings. 
With that in mind, the underlying growth of 3% to 7% EPS growth that we've included in our outlook is pretty healthy. As we always do, we'll continue to closely monitor the environment, and we'll provide updates on our progress and our outlook each quarter as the year unfolds. 
So in summary, we delivered another year of good financial performance in 2015. We expect to continue our momentum in 2016 and we remain very optimistic about our prospects to generate attractive shareholder returns through our Global Business Plan. 
This wraps up our prepared remarks. And now, we'll begin to take your questions."

We believe our primary competitor does as well. So I would guess that the current level of competitive activity will continue. We feel good about the progress and our unit volume growth on diapers in North America and feel like we've got good momentum on diapers and training pants for sure. In China, we saw a bit more competitive pricing being spent in the market by some of the competitors which we matched up to at some extent. But we saw some of that in the third quarter, as you may recall that had a very strong volume quarter again and again have lots of innovation coming. So still tons of competition around, but I wouldn't say it's getting worse but it is continuing."

In Eastern Europe, the Ukraine in particular has been a market that's been hard hit, if you look at category volumes. Some of that is because there's been quite a bit of parallel imports there that because of some value-added taxes that they put in place. So we are watching the consumer. On the other hand, where you've got real transaction exposure hitting these markets, you're trying to cover the transaction cost just to try to keep the shape of the P&L in order.

And then we look at share buybacks to balance out what we do with the remainder of both our cash flow and our remaining debt capacity under the A credit rating metric. So we'll see how that unfolds during the year. You know that we took our debt up in 2015 and ended the year at $7.8 billion. But as a reminder, a big chunk of that came from the debt finance pension contribution that we made in 2015. But going forward, we expect stronger cash flows in 2016 from operations.

And so there -- really, it was very minimal margin drag on the company. In fact, this year, because they shrunk as a percent of the company's overall sales, we actually had a slight margin tailwind this year from a mix standpoint. But getting back to the root cause, we tend to focus on gross margins in emerging markets and trying to narrow that gap. And narrow the gap is a little closer than operating margin. Because in some markets where we are investing in A&P or building infrastructure to support a larger business, we're not quite as efficient between the lines in the international market shift. But it's -- that's one that the team is working on. And our markets that are at scale like Korea, you see margins there that are at or above the North American levels in individual categories."

I'd say in other markets like Brazil, which is a big market for KCP, there, you've seen more -- just the decline in GDP has had a pretty big impact on business activities. It's affected the key KCP market much more than the consumer market for the year. And other markets, China kind of a mixed bag, with a little weaker quarter for us. And some of that was execution on our front that we need to improve. And there is plenty of competition there, probably a bit of the economic slowdown. But again, that market's still growing overall.

This year, you're targeting something about 20% currency-neutral earnings. So if you can help us understand kind of like the sustainability of that, how much of this earnings growth in 2016 has to do with savings versus leverage versus that can absorb as much? Because one of the things that I'm noticing now is that the share repos are coming down relative to the past. So basically, the financial side of the EPS growth is less of a contributor. So if you can explain us, what is -- what do you think is the earnings power of this company? Because 30 -- 20% on top of 30% currency neutral EPS growth is pretty substantial."

And when you net those 3 things together, it's a little smaller drag. As we talked about for 2016, it's probably a high single-digit drag. So then to deliver 3% to 7% growth puts your real earnings power more in the low double-digit range, which is still above where our historical average has been. So the things that helped us get further along in 2015 and will help us, again, in 2016 has been strong volume growth. And so good organic top line and a strong cost savings programs, and we've been ramping that up over the years. And it's been never more important than in times like this. And so if you look at the organic top line drivers, we feel pretty good about the innovation program that we've got as well as the portfolio of markets that we're growing, and when the categories are still growing, there's still opportunity for geographic expansion. On the cost savings front, the 3 factors that are driving us there are negotiated material savings, our basic productivity programs and material specification changes. And we are getting organized to deliver that in an even more consistent basis going forward, with some of the work that we're doing with a new global supply chain leader. So I feel pretty good about volume growth and our cost savings performance.

I think anytime you have a discussion about this, it's always the other guy that started it. So I'm sure there are some cases where we were aggressive behind innovation and trying to drive our business, and that may have precipitated the response or maybe the converse is true.

It will be very low single digits, if at all. And so I think that's sort of the way it's shaking out as you get a few hotspots, where there's been big currency swings where you get price recovery because everybody is being hit with the same wave of transactional cost hits.

Let me take a crack at it and Tom can certainly jump in here. On -- let me start with CapEx. We're fortunate to have a lot of opportunity to invest in high returning capital projects that support both our top line growth and savings. If you think about our CapEx, you can think of the spend in 3 areas: Growth, which support expansion capital, and also investment behind our innovation; cost savings, which is the second category, a lot of that supports the FORCE savings that you're seeing come through and that we talk about. And then the third category on maintenance, we fund our operations to adequately maintain a productive and safe manufacturing environment. So those are the 3 categories. And I think the range of $950 million to $1.50 billion is about right for our business now and given the opportunities that we have in the size of our operations and the opportunities that we have for expansion in some of the geographies. We'll continue to monitor that over time. As you know, we hired a Head of Global Supply Chain and under her, organizations will work with the finance team and the local operators to make sure that we continue to make sure that we're optimized there at CapEx spend as we move forward. On working capital, I said that I thought our working capital usage was a bit higher than we'd like it to be. I think the areas of opportunities that we have in 2016 are around areas like inventory. We talked about strong performance on payables in 2015. And so again, with our global supply chain organization working with our local teams, we'll be focusing on what we can do on the inventory side. And then in '15, we also had some negative impacts on working capital from currency, on our derivative settlements that we used to manage our exposures on the balance sheet. And then also, we had a large tax receivable that moved up into AR at the end of the year. So when you look at the numbers, that's in there too. I think the third part of your question was around buyback. And that goes back to what I said earlier that we're very focused on maintaining our A credit rating. So there is, as you know, a set of metrics around A, and we watch those very closely. And then look at how did the cash flows come in, make sure that we fund the dividend, invest our business through CapEx and then, the remainder determines how much we buy back. And we use the cash flow and then any capacity that we have on the debt side within that A rating to really fund buybacks. So depending on where the results of the operations come in will depend on the flex within the range on the share buybacks for 2016."

But you're only taking about 6% price mix, say, in those -- in that market, at least in the personal care business.

And so they're looking more like the run rate transaction exposure on the impact on imported materials and what their ongoing cost of goods is going to be and using that to think about pricing going forward. And then balancing that with what's your innovation plan look like. What other things can we do to substitute a local source material and avoid the transaction exposure. And so it is a market-by-market approach. And again, I would say, in Latin America and Eastern Europe is where you found both those markets are, I guess, I'd say used to dealing with high inflation. And so when you get hit with this, people aren't shy about taking price. But in other markets, you're not going to see that in Korea. You're not going to see that in Australia."

So that probably skewed the Nielsen data which tends to look at measured and baby stores because there was a lot of online activity, and particularly in November. But again, I'd say, if you were to decompose our growth in China, we increased the number of cities. I think we started the year at 105. We ended the year at 115. We'll be at 130 by the end of this year. Now each incremental city is incrementally, a little bit smaller. But you still are seeing good geographic expansion. We're still growing share in the cities that we're in. We're doing a ton in e-commerce. And that channel is growing pretty dramatically in China. And so it's probably 1/3 of our diaper sales were in e-commerce, which is overweight the rest of the category. We're still seeing good mid-tier Super Premium segment growth, where we tended to do better. So again, I'd say China, we're pretty bullish, lots of competition, but good growth in innovation coming and some geography expansion as well."

Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were up more than 2%, mostly due to higher volumes. We achieved strong cost savings, margin improvements and growth in adjusted earnings per share. And cash generation was healthy, and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. 
Now let's cover the details, starting with sales.  Our first quarter net sales were $4.5 billion. That's down 5% with a 7-point drag from currency rate. Organic sales rose more than 2% in the quarter. That was slightly below our 3% to 5% full year target, and Tom is going to provide more color on our top line in just a few minutes. 
On profitability, first quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.6%, up 100 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was 18.3%. That's up 90 basis points.  In addition to this overall improvement, I'm encouraged that margins were up in all 3 business segments. 
Our FORCE cost savings for the quarter were $95 million, so we're off to a good start relative to our full year target of at least $350 million. Our FORCE cost program continues to help us offset currency headwinds and fund growth investments on our brands.
Our organization restructuring remains on track and generated $15 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities were a $30 million benefit, mostly in oil-based materials. Offsetting these benefits, the total earnings drag from currency this quarter was more than 20%. In addition to translation effects of about 7%, that figure includes transaction effects in developing and emerging markets. Despite this headwinds, our margins in the D&E market were essentially even with year-ago levels, mostly from the benefit of price increases and cost savings.
On the bottom line, first quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.53. That's up 8% year-on-year. And lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed about 6 points of that earnings growth. As we said in January, the quarterly tax rate could be more variable this year. This is the result of timing of benefits from tax planning initiatives. For the full year, we continue to expect the tax rate to be between 30.5% and 32.5%.
Now let's turn to cash flow. Cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $553 million and in line with our expectations. 
On capital allocation, first quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled nearly $0.5 billion. In February, we announced a 4.5% increase in our dividend, taking it to $3.68 on an annual basis. This was our 44th consecutive annual increase in the dividend, helping us maintain our top-tier payout in the CPG industry. We continue to expect that full year dividends and share repurchases should total between $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion.
Looking at the segment results, in personal care, organic sales rose more than 4%. That included 7% growth in developing and emerging markets. Overall personal care operating margins were 20.3%, up 60 basis points. The improvement was driven by organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input costs. 
In consumer tissue, organic sales were even with year ago as growth in North America was offset by declines in developed markets. Consumer tissue operating margins of 18.7% were strong and up 20 basis points. 
Our K-C Professional business grew organic sales 1%. That included 4% growth in both North America and developing and emerging markets. Lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health reduced the segment top line by about 2%. K-C Professional operating margins were 19.7%. That's up 280 basis points year-on-year and includes benefits from organic sales growth and cost savings.
Before wrapping up, let me go ahead and recap. We delivered growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share along with significant cost savings and margin improvements. And we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

Since Maria just reviewed the financial details of the quarter, I'll focus my comments on organic sales growth and our full year earnings outlook. Then we'll open it up for your questions.
So starting with the top line, as Maria mentioned, our organic sales increased more than 2% in the quarter. North America had a good start to the year with volumes up nicely in all 3 business segments. Internationally, we continued to grow, albeit at a lower-than-normal rate this quarter. I'll review our top line results in a bit more detail, and I'll start with our international business.
In developing and emerging markets, organic sales increased 5%. Looking at some of our key growth markets, in Eastern Europe, organic sales in diapers rose 25%. That's on top of a 55% growth rate in the year-ago period, which included significant volume gains in Russia in advance of a price increase. 
In China, organic sales in diapers were up about 5% compared to a very strong growth rate of 35% last year. Our volume growth in China remains healthy, although results were impacted by competitive promotion activity. We expect better organic growth for the full year on Huggies in China, particularly in the second half. And that reflects our plans for innovation, brand investment, city expansion and improving category growth. 
In Brazil, organic sales in personal care fell about 5% compared to 20% growth in the base period. Volumes were impacted earlier in the quarter, particularly in diapers by the price increases that we initiated in January. Category demand also continues to be down in Brazil. Nonetheless, our sales improved as the quarter progressed. We expect better results across the balance of the year.
Elsewhere in developing and emerging markets, our feminine care and adult care organic sales were up double digits in the quarter. And baby wipes organic sales were up high single digits. So we remain very optimistic about our developing and emerging markets businesses and we continue to target high single-digit organic sales growth for the full year. Stronger results in Brazil and China, along with more benefits from innovations, launches and selling price increases should help us deliver higher growth compared to the first quarter.
Moving to our developed markets business outside North America, organic sales were down slightly. We continued to generate good growth in South Korea, while market conditions were challenging in Western and Central Europe. 
Turning to our North American consumer businesses, our teams there delivered another strong quarter with 4% volume growth and healthy market shares. Innovation, great marketing programs and good retail execution continued to drive results across our portfolio. Adult care volumes increased to double digits in the quarter, with the strength on both Poise and Depend. Baby wipes and childcare volumes each rose mid-single digits. Consumer tissue volumes improved 3% with growth in all categories led by viva and Scott paper towels and Kleenex facial tissue.
Overall, our brand positions are healthy North America. Our first quarter market shares improved or were even with prior year levels in 7 of the 8 consumer products categories in which we compete. And that includes the diapers where Huggies shares were up more than 0.5 point year-on-year and almost up 2 points sequentially.
Looking ahead, we have a number of near-term innovations launching in North America. That includes our best-ever Pull-Ups Training Pants, upgrades on Huggies diapers and baby wipes and new and improved Poise and Depend adult care products.
Finally, in K-C Professional in North America, our organic sales were up 4% in the first quarter. Execution and volume growth was good in both washroom products in our higher-margin wiper category.
Now moving on to our outlook for the year, we continue to target organic sales growth of 3% to 5% for 2016. Compared to the first quarter, we expect more benefits from targeted growth initiatives, product innovations and improved net realized revenue. 
Our currency and commodity markets remain volatile. As we mentioned in this morning's news release, our current assumptions have improved somewhat compared to 3 months ago. And while this helps our U.S. dollar results, it also means -- we're expecting less benefits from selling price increases this year.  As we've said before, it's important to look at currencies, commodities and selling prices together since they are related. We are now planning that the net impact of these 3 factors will be a mid- to high single-digit drag in our bottom line growth this year, and that's slightly better than what we shared with you January. If this turns out to be the case, we'll have added flexibility to invest more behind our top line growth initiatives. 
So putting it all together, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.95 to $6.15. That represents 3% to 7% growth year-on-year, which we continue to believe is a good outcome in this environment.
So in summary, we continue to execute our Global Business Plan strategies. We expect to deliver in our financial commitments again this year. And we're optimistic about our prospects to continue to generate attractive long-term shareholder returns.
So that wraps our prepared remarks and now, we'll begin to take your questions."

The category volume for diapers and bath tissue is probably down about 4%, at least in the measured -- from the Nielsen category, value was pretty flat from pricing. So you don't see category consumption go negative in markets in diapers and bathroom area often. So that was probably a bit unusual. It reflects the kind of the tougher economic conditions in Brazil. And I'd say so that was probably one that we'll be facing this year. On the other hand, yes, we -- we pushed hard on price in January. Some retailers pushed back. So we had a little bit of volume hit on that front. That picked up sequentially as the pricing went into the marketplace. And so that gives us some confidence that through price and a little bit better volume in the back half of the year, we'll put a better result on the board in Brazil. China had more price competition in the quarter. We had a very strong fourth quarter with a big push on Singles Day and e-commerce, a strong January with some Chinese New Year stuff. And I think some of the other competitors spent a little bit more aggressively, and we wanted to make sure we sustain our momentum. So we met competitive pricing where we needed to, to make sure we kept our volume growth going and had good double-digit volume growth in China. so I expect that to continue as well. And if you look going forward in China, price competition kind of did heat up in the second half of the year. So our comps get a little easier on that as we roll into the back half of this year."

So if you look at diapers in China and Brazil, which were the 2 soft spots and set those aside for a second and say, gosh, up fem care was up double digits in D&E. Adult care was up double digits in D&E. Baby wipes were up high single digits in D&E. So really a continued strong performance of the trajectory that we've been on, pretty broadly based across lots markets behind great innovation, behind great marketing, behind good execution and marketing. So that's all going to continue. And so I think on the China and Brazil question, we talked about those. China had underlying volume growth in diapers was good. The price competitiveness was tougher than maybe we expected going in. On the other hand, we're going to lap some when that started in the second half of this year. And so we'll see where it goes from here, but our expectation is that it's not going to get worse. And then Brazil, that's probably one where the categories have had some more challenges. And so we have been aggressive on pushing price, given the currency transaction hit that's taken place there. And to the question of the contradiction, I mean, I don't think it's comparing the 2 different things. So one compared to our original guidance for the year. We're probably going to get a little less price than we thought because currency is a little bit less negative than we thought. So the need to get prices is not as great. On the other hand, sequentially, we still are going to get year-on-year benefit from price as we roll through the year. So we didn't get it all in January. We announced it during the quarter. And so we'll get some benefit as the year takes up, but not quite as much as we thought going into the year.

Yes, it was still strong double digits in diapers and in fem care. The pricing comps get easier because some of the pricing competitiveness than we started in the second half of last year. So I'm confident China is going to post another solid growth year, though they started out in diapers a little slow due to the lapping or the rollover of the pricing initiatives. And as you look across our markets, Brazil, we talked a bit about a slow start. We expect that to pick up and close the gap, but we had good underlying performance really in most of our underlying markets. So I'm pretty confident in the team delivering the plan this year."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were up more than 2%, mostly due to higher volumes.

Organic sales were up more than 2%, mostly due to higher volumes. We achieved strong cost savings, margin improvements and growth in adjusted earnings per share. And cash generation was healthy, and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. 
Now let's cover the details, starting with sales. Our first quarter net sales were $4.5 billion. That's down 5% with a 7 point drag from currency rates. Organic sales rose more than 2% in the quarter. That was slightly below our 3% to 5% full year target. And Tom is going to provide more color on our top line in just a few minutes. 
On profitability, first quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.6%, up 100 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating margin was 18.3%. That's up 90 basis points. In addition to this overall improvement, I'm encouraged that our margins were up in all 3 business segments. Our FORCE cost savings for the quarter were $95 million, so we're off to a good start relative to our full year target of at least $350 million. Our FORCE cost program continues to help us offset currency headwinds and fund growth investments on our brands.
Our Organization Restructuring remains on track and generated $15 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities were a $30 million benefit, mostly in oil-based materials. Offsetting those benefits, the total earnings drag from currency this quarter was more than 20%. In addition to translation effects of about 7%, that figure includes substantial transaction effects in developing and emerging markets. Despite these headwinds, our margins in the D&E markets were essentially even with year-ago levels, mostly from the benefit of price increases and cost savings.
On the bottom line, first quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.53. That's up 8% year-on-year. A lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed about 6 points of that earnings growth. As we said in January, the quarterly tax rate could be more variable this year. This is the result of timing of benefits from tax planning initiatives. For the full year, we continue to expect the tax rate to be between 30.5% and 32.5%.
Now let's turn to cash flow. Cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $553 million and in line with our expectations. On capital allocation, first quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled nearly $0.5 billion. In February, we announced a 4.5% increase in our dividend, taking it to $3.68 on an annual basis. This was our 44th consecutive annual increase in the dividend, helping us maintain our top-tier payout in the CPG industry. We continue to expect that full year dividends and share repurchases should total between $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion.
Looking at the segment results. In personal care, organic sales rose more than 4%. That included 7% growth in developing and emerging markets. Overall personal care operating margins were 20.3%, up 60 basis points. The improvement was driven by organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input costs. In consumer tissue, organic sales were even with year ago as growth in North America was offset by declines in developed markets. Consumer tissue operating margins of 18.7% were strong and up 20 basis points. Our K-C Professional business grew organic sales 1%. That included 4% growth in both North America and developing and emerging markets. Lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health reduced the segment top line by about 2%. K-C Professional operating margins were 19.7%. That's up 280 basis points year-on-year and includes benefits from organic sales growth and cost savings.
Before wrapping up, let me go ahead and recap. We delivered growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share along with significant cost savings and margin improvements and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

Since Maria just reviewed the financial details of the quarter, I'll focus my comments on organic sales growth and our full year earnings outlook. Then we'll open it up for your questions.So starting with the t",875,"Thanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Since Maria just reviewed the financial details of the quarter, I'll focus my comments on organic sales growth and our full year earnings outlook. Then we'll open it up for your questions.
So starting with the top line. As Maria mentioned, our organic sales increased more than 2% in the quarter. North America had a good start to the year with volumes up nicely in all 3 business segments. Internationally, we continued to grow, although at a lower-than-normal rate this quarter. I'll then review our top line results in a bit more detail, and I'll start with our international business.
In developing and emerging markets, organic sales increased 5%. Looking at some of our key growth markets, in Eastern Europe, organic sales in diapers rose 25%. That's on top of a 55% growth rate in the year-ago period, which included significant volume gains in Russia in advance of a price increase. In China, organic sales in diapers were up about 5% compared to a very strong growth rate of 35% last year. Our volume growth in China remains healthy, although results were impacted by competitive promotion activity. We expect better organic growth for the full year on Huggies in China, particularly in the second half. And that reflects our plans for innovation, brand investment, city expansion and improving category growth. 
In Brazil, organic sales in personal care fell about 5% compared to 20% growth in the base period. Volumes were impacted early in the quarter, particularly in diapers, by the price increases that we initiated in January. Category demand also continues to be down in Brazil. Nonetheless, our sales improved as the quarter progressed and we expect better results across the balance of the year. Elsewhere in developing and emerging markets, our feminine care and adult care organic sales were up double digits in the quarter. And baby wipes organic sales were up high single digits. So we remain very optimistic about our developing and emerging markets businesses and we continue to target high single-digit organic sales growth for the full year. Stronger results in Brazil and China, along with more benefits from innovation launches and selling price increases should help us deliver higher growth compared to the first quarter.
Moving to our developed markets business outside North America. Organic sales were down slightly. We continued to generate good growth in South Korea while market conditions were challenging in Western and Central Europe. Turning to our North American consumer businesses, our teams there delivered another strong quarter with 4% volume growth and healthy market shares. Innovation, great marketing programs and good retail execution continue to drive results across our portfolio. Adult care volumes increased to double digits in the quarter with strength on both Poise and Depend. Baby wipes and childcare volumes each rose mid-single digits. Consumer tissue volumes improved 3% with growth in all categories led by Viva and Scott paper towels and Kleenex facial tissue.
Overall, our brand positions are healthy in North America. Our first quarter market shares improved or were even with prior year levels in 7 of the 8 consumer products categories in which we compete. And that includes the diapers, where Huggies shares were up more than 0.5 point year-on-year and up almost 2 points sequentially. Looking ahead, we have a number of near-term innovations launching in North America. That includes our best-ever Pull-Ups Training Pants, upgrades on Huggies diapers and baby wipes and new and improved Poise and Depend adult care products. Finally, in K-C Professional in North America, our organic sales were up 4% in the first quarter. Execution and volume growth was good in both washroom products and our higher-margin wiper category.
Now moving on to our outlook for the year. We continue to target organic sales growth of 3% to 5% for 2016. Compared to the first quarter, we expect more benefits from targeted growth initiatives, product innovations and improved net realized revenue. Our currency and commodity markets remain volatile. As we mentioned in this morning's news release, our current assumptions have improved somewhat compared to 3 months ago. And while this helps our U.S. dollar results, it also means we're expecting less benefits from selling price increases this year. As we've said before, it's important to look at currencies, commodities and selling prices together since they are all related. 
We're now planning that the net impact of these 3 factors will be a mid- to high single-digit drag on our bottom line growth this year. And that's slightly better than what we've shared with you in January. If this turns out to be the case, we'll have added flexibility to invest more behind our top line growth initiatives. So putting it all together, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.95 to $6.15. That represents 3% to 7% growth year-on-year, which we continue to believe is a good outcome in this environment.
So in summary, we continue to execute our Global Business Plan strategies. We expect to deliver on our financial commitments again this year. And we're optimistic about our prospects to continue to generate attractive long-term shareholder returns. So that wraps our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions."

Brazil, in particular, the category volume for diapers and bath tissue is probably down about 4%, at least in the measured -- from Nielsen category. Value was pretty flat from pricing. So you don't see category consumption go negative in markets in diapers and bath very often, so that was probably a bit unusual. It reflects the kind of the tougher economic conditions in Brazil. And I'd say so that was probably one that we'll be facing this year. On the other hand, we pushed hard on price in January. Some retailers pushed back. So we had a little bit of a volume hit on that front. That picked up sequentially as the pricing went into the marketplace. And so that gives us some confidence that through price and a little bit better volume in the back half of the year, we'll put a better result on the board in Brazil. China had more price competition in the quarter. We had a very strong fourth quarter with a big push on Singles' Day and e-commerce, a strong January with some Chinese New Year stuff. And I think some of the other competitors spent a little bit more aggressively, and we wanted to make sure that we sustain our momentum. So we met competitive pricing where we needed to, to make sure we kept our volume growth going and had good double-digit volume growth in China. And so I expect that to continue as well. And if you look going forward in China, price competition kind of did heat up in the second half of the year, so our comps get a little easier on that as we roll into the back half of this year."

You mentioned you have 3 drivers, targeted growth initiatives. I would love to understand what that means.

It doesn't look like it's abating in the U.S., if there's a little bit of a tougher consumer market in Brazil and in Latin America broadly.

So really a continued strong performance of the trajectory that we've been on pretty broadly based across lots of markets behind good innovation, behind great marketing, behind good execution in market. And so that's all going to continue. And so I think on the China and Brazil question, we talked about those. So China's underlying volume growth in diapers was good. The price competitiveness was tougher than maybe we expected going in. On the other hand, we're going to lap some when that started in the second half of this year. And so we'll see where it goes from here. But our expectation is that it's not going to get worse. And in Brazil, that's probably one where the categories have had some more challenges. And so we have been aggressive on pushing price, given the currency transaction hit that's taken place there. And to the question of the contradiction, I mean, I don't think it's -- we're comparing the 2 different things. So one was compared to our original guidance for the year. We're probably going to get a little less price than we thought because currency is a little bit less negative than we thought. So the need to get price is not as great. On the other hand, sequentially, we still are going to get year-on-year benefit from price as we roll through the year. And so we didn't get it all in January, we announced it during the quarter. And so we'll get some benefit as the year picks up but not quite as much as we thought going into the year.

Last year, I think they were up 25% in the first quarter. And this challenge has got some linkage to the oil trade, although not as much as others. But they've suffered from some of the same currency devaluation and have pulled through. If you look at Eastern Europe, what's going on in Russia and CIS, big currency devaluation, strong price increases, some negative GDP, and yet we're still seeing really reasonably strong underlying volume growth in category demand. And so Brazil is a little bit of an outlier right now that we're trying to make sure we understand what's actually going on there from the consumer standpoint. On the tissue front, you saw in lots of markets this quarter, slight negative volume and positive price because we were pushing hard to get price in that market, especially because you're buying pulp in dollars and you've got a big transactional impact and you've got to recover some of that to hold your P&L in shape.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were up more than 2%, mostly due to higher volumes.

Organic sales were up more than 2%, mostly due to higher volumes. We achieved strong cost savings, margin improvements and growth in adjusted earnings per share. And cash generation was healthy, and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. 
Now let's cover the details, starting with sales. Our first quarter net sales were $4.5 billion. That's down 5% with a 7-point drag from currency rates. Organic sales rose more than 2% in the quarter. That was slightly below our 3% to 5% full year target. And Tom is going to provide some more color on our top line in just a few minutes. 
On profitability, first quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.6%, up 100 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted operating margin was 18.3%. That's up 90 basis points. In addition to this overall improvement, I'm encouraged that our margins were up in all 3 business segments. Our FORCE cost savings for the quarter were $95 million, so we're off to a good start relative to our full year target of at least $350 million. Our FORCE cost program continues to help us offset currency headwinds and fund growth investments on our brands.
Our Organization Restructuring remains on track and generated $15 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities were a $30 million benefit, mostly in oil-based materials. Offsetting those benefits, the total earnings drag from currency this quarter was more than 20%. In addition to translation effects of about 7%, that figure includes substantial transaction effects in developing and emerging markets. Despite this headwind, our margins in the D&E markets were essentially even with year-ago levels, mostly from the benefit of price increases and cost savings.
On the bottom line, first quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.53. That's up 8% year-on-year. A lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed about 6 points of that earnings growth. As we said in January, the quarterly tax rate could be more variable this year. This is the result of timing of benefits from tax planning initiatives. For the full year, we continue to expect the tax rate to be between 30.5% and 32.5%.
Now let's turn to cash flow. Cash provided by operations in the first quarter was $553 million and in line with our expectations. On capital allocation, first quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled nearly $0.5 billion. In February, we announced a 4.5% increase in our dividend, taking it to $3.68 on an annual basis. This was our 44th consecutive annual increase in the dividend, helping us maintain our top-tier payout in the CPG industry. We continue to expect that full year dividends and share repurchases should total between $1.9 billion and $2.2 billion.
Looking at the segment results. In personal care, organic sales rose more than 4%. That included 7% growth in developing and emerging markets. Overall personal care operating margins were 20.3%, up 60 basis points. The improvement was driven by organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input costs. In consumer tissue, organic sales were even with year ago as growth in North America was offset by declines in developed markets. Consumer tissue operating margins of 18.7% were strong and up 20 basis points. Our K-C Professional business grew organic sales 1%. That included 4% growth in both North America and developing and emerging markets. Lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health reduced the segment top line by about 2%. K-C Professional operating margins were 19.7%. That's up 280 basis points year-on-year and includes benefits from organic sales growth and cost savings.
Before wrapping up, let me go ahead and recap. We delivered growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share along with significant cost savings and margin improvements and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

Since Maria just reviewed the financial details of the quarter, I'll focus my comments on organic sales growth and our full year earnings outlook. Then we'll open it up for your questions.
So starting with the top line. As Maria mentioned, our organic sales increased more than 2% in the quarter. North America had a good start to the year with volumes up nicely in all 3 business segments. Internationally, we continued to grow, although at a lower-than-normal rate this quarter. Let me review our top line results in a bit more detail, and I'll start with our international business.
In developing and emerging markets, organic sales increased 5%. Looking at some of our key growth markets, in Eastern Europe, organic sales in diapers rose 25%. That's on top of a 55% growth rate in the year-ago period, which included significant volume gains in Russia in advance of a price increase. In China, organic sales in diapers were up about 5% compared to a very strong growth rate of 35% last year. Our volume growth in China remains healthy, although results were impacted by competitive promotion activity. We expect better organic growth for the full year on Huggies in China, particularly in the second half. And that reflects our plans for innovation, brand investment, city expansion and improving category growth. 
In Brazil, organic sales in personal care fell about 5% compared to 20% growth in the base period. Volumes were impacted early in the quarter, particularly in diapers, by the price increases that we initiated in January. Category demand also continues to be down in Brazil. Nonetheless, our sales improved as the quarter progressed, and we expect better results across the balance of the year. Elsewhere in developing and emerging markets, our feminine care and adult care organic sales were up double digits in the quarter. And baby wipes organic sales were up high single digits. So we remain very optimistic about our developing and emerging markets businesses, and we continue to target high single-digit organic sales growth for the full year. Stronger results in Brazil and China, along with more benefits from innovation launches and selling price increases should help us deliver higher growth compared to the first quarter.
Moving to our developed markets business outside North America. Organic sales were down slightly. We continued to generate good growth in South Korea while market conditions were challenging in Western and Central Europe. Turning to our North American consumer businesses, our teams there delivered another strong quarter with 4% volume growth and healthy market shares. Innovation, great marketing programs and good retail execution continue to drive results across our portfolio. Adult care volumes increased double digits in the quarter with strength on both Poise and Depend. Baby wipes and childcare volumes each rose mid-single digits. Consumer tissue volumes improved 3% with growth in all categories led by Viva and Scott paper towels and Kleenex facial tissue.
Overall, our brand positions are healthy in North America. Our first quarter market shares improved or were even with prior year levels in 7 of the 8 consumer products categories in which we compete. And that includes diapers, where Huggies shares were up more than 0.5 point year-on-year and up almost 2 points sequentially. Looking ahead, we have a number of near-term innovations launching in North America. That includes our best-ever Pull-Ups Training Pants, upgrades on Huggies diapers and baby wipes and new and improved Poise and Depend adult care products. Finally, in K-C Professional in North America, our organic sales were up 4% in the first quarter. Execution and volume growth was good in both washroom products and our higher-margin wiper category.
Now moving on to our outlook for the year. We continue to target organic sales growth of 3% to 5% for 2016. Compared to the first quarter, we expect more benefits from targeted growth initiatives, product innovations and improved net realized revenue. Our currency and commodity markets remain volatile. As we mentioned in this morning's news release, our current assumptions have improved somewhat compared to 3 months ago. And while this helps our U.S. dollar results, it also means we're expecting less benefits from selling price increases this year. As we've said before, it's important to look at currencies, commodities and selling prices together since they are all related. 
We're now planning that the net impact of these 3 factors will be a mid- to high single-digit drag on our bottom line growth this year. And that's slightly better than what we've shared with you in January. If this turns out to be the case, we'll have added flexibility to invest more behind our top line growth initiatives. So putting it all together, we continue to expect adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.95 to $6.15. That represents 3% to 7% growth year-on-year, which we continue to believe is a good outcome in this environment.
So in summary, we continue to execute our Global Business Plan strategies. We expect to deliver on our financial commitments again this year. And we're optimistic about our prospects to continue to generate attractive long-term shareholder returns. So that wraps our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions."

Brazil, in particular, the category volume for diapers and bath tissue is probably down about 4%, at least in the measured -- from Nielsen category. Value was pretty flat from pricing. So you don't see category consumption go negative in markets in diapers and bath very often, so that was probably a bit unusual. It reflects the kind of the tougher economic conditions in Brazil. And I'd say so that was probably one that we'll be facing this year. On the other hand, we pushed hard on price in January. Some retailers pushed back. So we had a little bit of a volume hit on that front. That picked up sequentially as the pricing went into the marketplace. And so that gives us some confidence that through price and a little bit better volume in the back half of the year, we'll put a better result on the board in Brazil. China had more price competition in the quarter. We had a very strong fourth quarter with a big push on Singles' Day and e-commerce, a strong January with some Chinese New Year stuff. And I think some of the other competitors spent a little bit more aggressively, and we wanted to make sure that we sustain our momentum. So we met competitive pricing where we needed to, to make sure we kept our volume growth going and had good double-digit volume growth in China. And so I expect that to continue as well. And if you look going forward in China, price competition kind of did heat up in the second half of the year, so our comps get a little easier on that as we roll into the back half of this year."

And so I think that's a trend that will continue as more and more companies are really held to the same worker safety standards."

So really a continued strong performance of the trajectory that we've been on pretty broadly based across lots of markets behind good innovation, behind great marketing, behind good execution in market. And so that's all going to continue. And so I think on the China and Brazil question, we talked about those. So China's underlying volume growth in diapers was good. The price competitiveness was tougher than maybe we expected going in. On the other hand, we're going to lap some when that started in the second half of this year. And so we'll see where it goes from here. But our expectation is that it's not going to get worse. And in Brazil, that's probably one where the categories have had some more challenges. And so we have been aggressive on pushing price, given the currency transaction hit that's taken place there. And to the question of the contradiction, I mean, I don't think it's -- we're comparing the 2 different things. So one was compared to our original guidance for the year. We're probably going to get a little less price than we thought because currency is a little bit less negative than we thought. So the need to get price is not as great. On the other hand, sequentially, we still are going to get year-on-year benefit from price as we roll through the year. And so we didn't get it all in January, we announced it during the quarter. And so we'll get some benefit as the year picks up but not quite as much as we thought going into the year.

So if spot rates stay where they're at, there's probably more favorability on currency and maybe more risk on pricing. On commodities, pulp got a little better in this forecast than where it had been. In terms of underlying economic growth in individual markets, again we continue to say a relatively modest growth environment. We're not predicting a huge falloff or any other kind of economic crisis developing in a major market anywhere in the world at this point in time. Brazil is probably the one that we're watching most closely, is obviously expecting slower category growth, getting back to a -- for them, getting back to flat organic growth number for the year will be the first priority, given that they started out the quarter with negative 5% on diapers. In terms of the U.S., actually we saw probably better growth in our business than the underlying category growth because we picked up share in a number of markets and consumer is still responsive to innovation. We saw private-label shares flat to down in nearly every category that we're in, which is again another sign of health of the consumer for us and are probably maybe more bullish on the outlook in North America at this point in time than maybe we would have been even at the beginning of the year."

And it's not one that we usually talk about a lot because it's a relatively small market than the Indian market, but they had 20% organic growth. Last year, I think they were up 25% in the first quarter. And it’s challenged. It’s got some linkage to the oil trade, although not as much as others. But they've suffered from some of the same currency devaluation and have pulled through. If you look at Eastern Europe, what's going on in Russia and CIS, big currency devaluation, strong price increases, some negative GDP, and yet we're still seeing really reasonably strong underlying volume growth and category demand. And so Brazil is a little bit of an outlier right now that we're trying to make sure we understand what's actually going on there from the consumer standpoint. On the tissue front, you saw in lots of markets this quarter, slight negative volume and positive price because we were pushing hard to get price in that market, especially because you're buying pulp in dollars and you've got a big transactional impact and you've got to recover some of that to hold your P&L in shape.

Let me start off with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were up 3% with volume growth of 4%. We achieved significant cost savings, improved our margins and grew adjusted earnings per share. And we also increased cash flow, improved our capital efficiency and return cash to shareholders. 
Now let's cover the details starting with sales. Our second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion, that's down 1% with a 4-point drag from currency rate. Organic sales rose 3% in the quarter, that included a 7% volume increase in North American consumer products and 5% organic growth in developing and emerging markets. Tom is going to provide a some more color on our top line in just a few minutes. 
On profitability, second quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.3%, up 50 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 18%, that's up 100 basis points. 
Our teams continue to deliver significant cost savings in order to improve profitability and fund growth investments on our brands. Second quarter FORCE cost savings were $95 million. We have had strong performance on cost savings in the first half, and we're now targeting $350 million to $400 million of FORCE cost savings for the full year. In addition, our organization restructuring remains on track and generated $15 million of savings in the quarter. 
Commodities continue to be favorable, delivering $20 million of benefits, mostly from lower fiber costs. We expect full year deflation of $25 million to $125 million, which is broadly in line with our previous assumption. 
While currencies have improved since January, they remain a significant headwind year-over-year. The total earnings drag from currency was more than $0.15 per share in the second quarter and we now expect the full year drag on EPS to be at least 10%. 
On the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.53, up 9% year-on-year. A lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed about 5 points of that earnings growth. We expect the tax rate will be significantly higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. 
Moving on to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was strong at $860 million, that's up 11% year-on-year. On adjusted return on invested capital, halfway through the year, we're up 100 basis points. So we're on track to easily exceed our long-term goal of 20 to 40 basis points of annual improvement. 
On capital allocation, second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled nearly $0.5 billion. The full year amount should be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion. This will be the sixth consecutive year that dividends and share repurchases will total at least $2 billion.
Looking at the segment results. In Personal Care, organic sales rose 5%, that included 6% growth in developing and emerging markets and 4% improvement in North America. Overall Personal Care operating margins were healthy at 20%, although off 50 basis points year-on-year, including significant currency headwind. 
Moving on to consumer tissue. Organic sales were up 2%, led by 4% growth in North America. Consumer tissue operating margins of 18.4% were up 110 basis points with the benefit of organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input costs.
In our third segment, K-C Professional, organic sales were up slightly, including 6% growth in developing and emerging markets. Lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health reduced the segment top line by more than 1 point. K-C Professional operating margins were 18.6%, that's up 100 basis points year-on-year driven by cost savings.
Before wrapping up, let me recap. We achieved growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share. We delivered significant cost savings, margin improvements in cash flow and we continue to improve our balance sheet efficiency and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tom."
283857,327145889,1011307,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2016",2016-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Kimberly-Clark Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Maria.

I'll share my perspectives on our to and then I'll comment on our full year outlook. So overall, we continue to deliver good financial results, and we're executing well in a challenging environment. 
Starting with the second quarter, as Maria mentioned, organic sales increased by 3%. The mid [ph] progress on targeted growth initiatives and product innovations and that helped us achieve volume growth of 4%. In our developing and emerging markets, organic sales were up 5%. 
Let me comment specifically on some of our key growth markets. In Brazil, organic sales in Personal Care rose about 10% with both selling prices and volumes up year-on-year. While underlying category demand remains down in a tough economic environment, I'm encouraged by our second quarter results following a soft start to the year in the first quarter. 
Moving to China. Our diaper volumes there continue to grow with strong double-digit rates in the quarter and our market positions remained healthy. Nonetheless, because of increased price competition, our organic sales fell high single digits and that compared to a 30% growth comp last year. Competitive activity picked up during the quarter in China and we responded to protect our market share position and maintain our volume momentum. So I'm very bullish about our business in China. While the current pricing is robust dynamic, we have plans to continue to deliver strong volume growth with benefits from innovation, city expansion and category growth. 
Moving to Eastern Europe. Organic sales in diapers there rose more than 15%. Volumes up at a double-digit rate led by Huggies in Russia. Selling prices were also up modestly as we've now lapped most of the increases that we took last year. 
Elsewhere in developing and emerging markets, so our feminine care organic sales were up double digits in the quarter, including strong performances in Latin America. And adult care organic sales were up high single digits. For the full year, we're now targeting mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our developing and emerging markets business. We've lowered our expectations for selling price increases, primarily due to improved currency outlook in Latin America and Eastern Europe. We've also taken into account the dynamics in China and slowing economies in some parts of the world. 
I continue to be up as optimistic about our business in developing and emerging markets. Our market positions are generally improving, are holding steady and most of the key markets we compete in and we've got lots of innovation coming to have help drive our future growth. 
Now let's turn to our North American consumer businesses. Our teams there delivered another strong quarter with 7% volume growth and healthy market shares. Product innovations, great marketing programs and good retail execution continue to drive results across our portfolio. Promotion activity was also a little higher than average in the second quarter.
Our adult care, child care and feminine care volumes each increased by about 10%, including benefits from innovations on poise and depend, Pull-Ups and U by Kotex. Our Huggies diaper volumes rose mid-single digits and market shares improved by about 1 point as we continue to make progress following last year's Snug & Dry relaunch. Consumer tissue volumes improved 6% with mid- to high single-digit growth in all categories led by Kleenex facial tissue. So overall, our brand positions are very healthy in North America. Through the first half of the year, market shares improved or were even with prior year levels in 7 of the 8 consumer products categories in which we compete. So our volume comparison will be more difficult in the back half of the year but I'm encouraged by our execution and our momentum in North America. 
Moving beyond the sales. I'm also encouraged that our teams around the world continue to manage our company with financial discipline. At this point in the year, our FORCE cost savings are tracking to an all-time high. Our adjusted operating margins and return on invested capital are both up 100 basis points and cash flow has picked up significantly. And Maria ahs already highlighted our shareholder-friendly capital allocation. So these results demonstrates to me the continued strength of our business. 
So all in all, we've made progress in several areas in the first half of the year. We've got opportunities to improve further and we're broadly on track with our plans for 2016. 
Now let's move to our outlook for the full year. On the top line, we expect that currencies will reduce sales by 4% to 5%. Our prior assumption was for a negative impact of toward the low end of the 5% to 6% range. In terms of organic sales, we expect growth will be at the low end of our 3% to 5% target range. This assumes less benefits from selling price increases, primarily due to the improved currency outlook. Volume growth, which was 3% in the first half of the year should drive the vast majority of our organic sales growth for the full year. 
On the bottom line, we continue to target adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.95 to $6.15.
That's up 3% to 7% year-on-year despite an expected high single-digit drag from the combined impact of changes in currencies, commodities and selling prices. 
Through 6 months, we're on track relative to our full year earnings impact. That said, as Maria mentioned, the tax rate should be higher sequentially in the back half. We also continue to closely watch currency and commodity markets, competitive activity and economic conditions. 
So in summary, we continue to execute our Global Business Plan strategies well. We expect to deliver on our financial target again this year. And we're optimistic about our prospects to continue to generate attractive long-term shareholder returns. 
That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions."

Second quarter, the volume was positive in diapers and then significant amount of price. We expect to see more volume in the back half. And so I'd say, if you look at share positions, Brazil we're up a couple of points; in femcare, have a good momentum there; and are down about 0.5 point in diapers and we'd be looking to close that gap in the back half of the year. In China, we're really expecting the birthrate to pick up as we'd expect to see a little bit more volume come there in the back half. Pricing has been more competitive than we'd anticipated and yes, we're expecting it's going to continue to be competitive in the back half of the year.

I mean, I missed something here, but you're saying you've got good double-digit volume growth but that overall organic sales growth was kind of down a fair bit in the second quarter. I mean just mathematically, that suggest that you're seeing pricing China this kind of negative to the order of mid-teens at best and potentially worse than that. Can you comment at all on the kind of impact that's having on your gross margin position there as kind of everyone's got different cost structures, I guess? And then in terms of Brazil, clearly, you're gaining a lot of share in femcare there, but are you seeing underlying consumer recovery there as well as?

Yes, China gross margin, I'd say the team there was a done a good job of driving premium mix we can and taking cost out as well. So our overall K-C International team did a phenomenal job of delivering under FORCE cost savings and China certainly was a part of that. And so our Chinese gross margins were down a bit, but nowhere near the level of price change in the market. And so, again, we'd be pretty happy that China is an investable business with strong gross margin and margin potential. On the Brazilian consumer, you're still seeing some negative category trends and the economic outlook is still not terrific, although I was on the phone with our guy who runs Brazil last weekend, yes, I think, there are some early signs of optimism, perhaps, there that there's things expecting things to be better in '17 and so we'll see. I think economy is running expectations and hopefully the Brazilian consumer will start to be a little bit more optimistic and we'll see that translate into category growth.

But my general approach to this and our general approach to it over the years is to say, you're really trying to develop a loyal consumers that have a strong habit of using your brands to care for their families. And so, you typically want to drive volume growth at least ahead of or tracking with your category that you're in so that you're improving your volume market share in the percentage of time she's going to use your product to care for her family. And many of our products, particularly as you think about things like feminine care or bath tissue or facial tissue, you start using a product and you use it for your entire life if you find the solution that works for you. And so we typically generate price when there's big commodities swings on when that there's big currency swings. Other than that, we tend to plan for core volume growth as to lever to drive our business forward and I don't know enough about my competitors a strategy in-depth to know if that it's different from the way to think about it. But yes, where you can get mix through premiumnization and thorough off a driving the consumer into a better performing product, that's also an important element of our strategy but that's really about given them just good value for a product that works better in the end. So again, I think where we can drive volume, that I think the healthiest form of organic growth for us in our business model."

Our inventory, our inventories improved and so we're seeing good performance across the board. I continue to be optimistic about what we can do in this area.

And you're seeing some other economies that are moving a little slower than we would have been expected across Latin America, some parts of Eastern Europe as well are probably not quite as robust as they were in the -- in our plan at leats going into the year. Having said that, in markets like China where you're expecting a little -- of strong growth rate this year, a little uptick in the birthrate, we are investing in newborn and early category entrants to make sure we get more than our fair share of the new babies born in some of those key markets. And so you can see a little mix drag in that. It wasn't a big is our big impact but did was a big enough to talk about, I guess. As it shifts to the U.S, we had a lot of good stuff happening with the Pull-Ups relaunch kind of continuing through the second quarter and had strong double-digit growth of there. Femcare really had a lot of good execution at retail happening and that was a little bit more promotional intense. I think we saw double-digit volume growth, which was the first time we've seen that in our femcare business in a while. Adult care, we haven't lapped the poise impress [ph] launch, so some of that was lapping that from last year. But we still had high single-digit growth in our adult care business, ex Impressa. And got more good innovation coming. The comps gets a little tougher in the back half but again, but a lot of it was some of the bonus activity, some of the digital coupon activity as opposed to more trade funding. If anything, I'd say, the trade funding levels were pretty consistent year-on-year. It was maybe more the other strategic marketing investment that was probably a little elevated this quarter."

Let me start off with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were up 3% with volume growth of 4%. We achieved significant cost savings, improved our margins and grew adjusted earnings per share. And we also increased cash flow, improved our capital efficiency and returned cash to shareholders. 
Now let's cover the details, starting with sales. Our second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That's down 1% with a 4-point drag from currency rate. Organic sales rose 3% in the quarter. That included a 7% volume increase in North American consumer products and 5% organic growth in developing and emerging markets. Tom is going to provide some more color on our top line in just a few minutes. 
On profitability, second quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.3%, up 50 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 18%. That's up 100 basis points. 
Our teams continue to deliver significant cost savings in order to improve profitability and fund growth investments on our brands. Second quarter FORCE cost savings were $95 million. We have had strong performance on cost savings in the first half, and we're now targeting $350 million to $400 million of FORCE cost savings for the full year. In addition, our organization restructuring remains on track and generated $15 million of savings in the quarter. 
Commodities continue to be favorable, delivering $20 million of benefits, mostly from lower fiber costs. We expect full year deflation of $25 million to $125 million, which is broadly in line with our previous assumption. 
While currencies have improved since January, they remain a significant headwind year-over-year. The total earnings drag from currency was more than $0.15 per share in the second quarter, and we now expect the full year drag on EPS to be at least 10%. 
On the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.53, up 9% year-on-year. A lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed about 5 points of that earnings growth. We expect the tax rate will be significantly higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. 
Moving on to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was strong at $860 million. That's up 11% year-on-year. On adjusted return on invested capital, halfway through the year, we're up 100 basis points. So we're on track to easily exceed our long-term goal of 20 to 40 basis points of annual improvement. 
On capital allocation, second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled nearly $0.5 billion. The full year amount should be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion. This will be the sixth consecutive year that dividends and share repurchases will total at least $2 billion.
Looking at the segment results. In personal care, organic sales rose 5%. That included 6% growth in developing and emerging markets and 4% improvement in North America. Overall personal care operating margins were healthy at 20%, although off 50 basis points year-on-year, including significant currency headwind. 
Moving on to consumer tissue. Organic sales were up 2%, led by 4% growth in North America. Consumer tissue operating margins of 18.4% were up 110 basis points with the benefit of organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input costs.
In our third segment, K-C Professional, organic sales were up slightly, including 6% growth in developing and emerging markets. Lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health reduced the segment top line by more than 1 point. K-C Professional operating margins were 18.6%. That's up 100 basis points year-on-year, driven by cost savings.
Before wrapping up, let me recap. We achieved growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share. We delivered significant cost savings, margin improvements and cash flow, and we continued to improve our balance sheet efficiency and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tom."
283857,327145889,1011382,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2016",2016-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Kimberly-Clark Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone. I'll share my perspectives on our second quarter results, and then I'll comment on our full year outlook. So overall, we continue to deliver good financial results, and we're executing well in a challenging environme",974,"Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone. I'll share my perspectives on our second quarter results, and then I'll comment on our full year outlook. So overall, we continue to deliver good financial results, and we're executing well in a challenging environment. 
Starting with the second quarter. As Maria mentioned, our organic sales increased by 3%. We made progress on targeted growth initiatives and product innovations, and that helped us achieve volume growth of 4%. In our developing and emerging markets, organic sales were up 5%. 
Let me comment specifically on some of our key growth markets. In Brazil, organic sales in personal care rose about 10%, with both selling prices and volumes up year-on-year. While underlying category demand remains down in a tough economic environment, I'm encouraged by our second quarter results, following a soft start to the year in the first quarter. 
Moving to China. Our diaper volumes there continued to grow at strong double-digit rates in the quarter, and our market positions remained healthy. Nonetheless, because of increased price competition, our organic sales fell high single digits, and that compared to a 30% growth comp last year. Competitive activity picked up during the quarter in China, and we responded to protect our market share position and maintain our volume momentum. So I'm very bullish about our business in China. While the current pricing environment is dynamic, we have plans to continue to deliver strong volume growth with benefits from innovation, city expansion and category growth. 
Moving to Eastern Europe. Organic sales in diapers there rose more than 15%. Volumes were up at a double-digit rate, led by Huggies in Russia. Selling prices were also up modestly as we've now lapped most of the increases that we took last year. 
Elsewhere in developing and emerging markets, our feminine care organic sales were up double digits in the quarter, including strong performances in Latin America. And adult care organic sales were up high single digits. For the full year, we're now targeting mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our developing and emerging markets business. We've lowered our expectations for selling price increases, primarily due to an improved currency outlook in Latin America and Eastern Europe. We've also taken into account the dynamics in China and slowing economies in some parts of the world. 
I continue to be optimistic about our business in developing and emerging markets. Our market positions are generally improving, are holding steady in most of the key markets we compete in, and we've got lots of innovation coming to help drive our future growth. 
Now let's turn to our North American consumer businesses. Our teams there delivered another strong quarter, with 7% volume growth and healthy market shares. Product innovations, great marketing programs and good retail execution continue to drive results across our portfolio. Promotion activity was also a little higher than average in the second quarter.
Our adult care, child care and feminine care volumes each increased by about 10%, including benefits from innovations on Poise and Depend, Pull-Ups and U by Kotex. Our Huggies diaper volumes rose mid-single digits, and market shares improved by about 1 point as we continue to make progress following last year's Snug & Dry relaunch. Consumer tissue volumes improved 6% with mid- to high single-digit growth in all categories, led by Kleenex facial tissue. So overall, our brand positions are very healthy in North America. 
Through the first half of the year, market shares improved or were even with prior year levels in 7 of the 8 consumer products categories in which we compete. So our volume comparison will be more difficult in the back half of the year, but I'm encouraged by our execution and our momentum in North America. 
Moving beyond sales, I'm also encouraged that our teams around the world continue to manage our company with financial discipline. At this point in the year, our FORCE cost savings are tracking to an all-time high. Our adjusted operating margins and return on invested capital are both up 100 basis points, and cash flow has picked up significantly. And Maria has already highlighted our shareholder-friendly capital allocation. So these results demonstrate to me the continued strength of our business. 
So all in all, we've made progress in several areas in the first half of the year. We've got opportunities to improve further. We're broadly on track with our plans for 2016. 
Now let's move to our outlook for the full year. On the top line, we expect that currencies will reduce sales by 4% to 5%. Our prior assumption was for a negative impact toward the low end of the 5% to 6% range. In terms of organic sales, we expect growth will be at the low end of our 3% to 5% target range. This assumes less benefits from selling price increases, primarily due to the improved currency outlook. Volume growth, which was 3% in the first half of the year, should drive the vast majority of our organic sales growth for the full year. 
On the bottom line, we continue to target adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.95 to $6.15.
That's up 3% to 7% year-on-year despite an expected high single-digit drag from the combined impact of changes in currencies, commodities and selling prices. Through 6 months, we're on track relative to our full year earnings impact. 
That said, as Maria mentioned, the tax rate should be higher sequentially in the back half. We also continue to closely watch currency and commodity markets, competitive activity and economic conditions. 
So in summary, we continue to execute our Global Business Plan strategies well. We expect to deliver on our financial targets again this year. And we're optimistic about our prospects to continue to generate attractive long-term shareholder returns. 
That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions."

You decided not to change the guidance. You just kind of pushed people to the lower end. But even to get to the lower end, one would have to expect a little bit of an acceleration going forward, especially because the comp gets a little tougher with the 5% organic sales growth. So I'm struggling, again, to figure out what exactly is going to get better that you anticipate to get you on the low end. I guess you could round there, but just really to get to the low end feels like a little bit of a stretch given the comps that you have. So a little bit more detail there would be helpful to start."

I mean, I think, Brazil, if you look at it, how the year has played out is pretty tough start to the year with negative volume trends as we pushed pricing into the market. Second quarter, the volume was positive in diapers and then a significant amount of price. We expect to see more volume in the back half. And so I'd say, if you look at share positions, in Brazil, we're up a couple of points in femcare and have a good momentum there and are down about 0.5 point in diapers. And we'd be looking to close that gap in the back half of the year. In China, we're really expecting the birthrate to pick up, as we'd expect to see a little bit more volume come there in the back half. Pricing has been more competitive than we'd anticipated, and we're expecting it's going to continue to be competitive in the back half of the year. And that's probably one of the shifts in our thinking from the first quarter when we talked last."

So -- and Pull-Ups with a double-digit volume growth. It was the first time we've seen that in a while, so a little healthier category dynamics as well, which is probably good innovation on our front, probably a little healthier consumer on the -- front as well.

If you could comment at all on the kind of impact that's having on your gross margin position there as kind of everyone's got different cost structures, I guess. And then in terms of Brazil, it's -- clearly, you're gaining a lot of share in femcare there, but are you seeing underlying consumer recovery there as well?

Yes, on China gross margin, I'd say the team there has done a great job of driving premium mix where we can and taking cost out as well.

And so our Chinese gross margins were down a bit but nowhere near the level of price change in the market. And so -- again, we'd be pretty happy that China is an investable business and -- with strong gross margin and OP margin potential. On the Brazilian consumer, you're still seeing some negative category trends. And the economic outlook is still not terrific, although I was on the phone with our guy who runs Brazil last week and I think there are some early signs of optimism perhaps there that they're things -- expecting things to be a little better in '17. And so we'll see. I think economy is running on expectations, and hopefully the Brazilian consumer will start to be a little bit more optimistic and we'll see that translate into category growth.

Jonathan, that's kind of a deep philosophical question this morning. But my general approach to this and our general approach to it over the years is to say you're really trying to develop loyal consumers that have a strong habit of using your brands to care for their families. And so you typically want to drive volume growth at least ahead of or tracking with your category that you're in so that you're improving your volume market share in the percentage of time she's going to use your product to care for her family. And many of our products, particularly as you think about things like feminine care or bath tissue or facial tissue, you start using a product and you use it for your entire life if you find the solution that works for you. And so we typically generate price when there's big commodity swings or when there's big currency swings. Other than that, we tend to plan for core volume growth as the lever to drive our business forward. And I don't know enough about my competitors' strategies in depth to know if that's different from the way they think about it. But where you can get mix through premiumization and through up -- driving the consumer into a better-performing product, that's also an important element of our strategy, but that's really about giving them just good value for a product that works better in the end. So again, I think where we can drive volume, that's, I think, the healthiest form of organic growth for us in our business model."

That's probably been worse and stayed worse longer than we would have anticipated in our model for the year. And you're seeing some other economies that are moving a little slower than would have been expected across Latin America. Some parts of Eastern Europe as well are probably not quite as robust as they were in the -- in our plan at least going into the year. Having said that, in markets like China, where you're expecting a little -- a strong birth rate this year, a little uptick in the birthrate, we are investing in newborn and early category entrants to make sure we get more than our fair share of the new babies born in some of those key markets. And so you can see a little mix drag from that. It wasn't a big -- super big impact, but it was big enough to talk about, I guess. As it shifts to the U.S, we had a lot of good stuff happening with the Pull-Ups relaunch kind of continuing through the second quarter, and it's had strong double-digit growth there. Femcare really had a lot of good execution at retail happening, and that was a little bit more promotionally intense. On the other hand, we saw double-digit volume growth, which was the first time we've seen that in our femcare business in a while. Adult care, we're -- we haven't lapped the Poise Impressa launch, so some of that was lapping that from last year. But we still had high single-digit growth in our adult care business ex-Impressa. So -- and we've got more good innovation coming. Now the comps gets a little tougher in the back half, but again, a lot of it was some of the bonus pack activity, some of the digital coupon activity as opposed to more trade funding. If anything, I'd say the trade funding levels were pretty consistent year-on-year. It was maybe more the other strategic marketing investment that was probably a little elevated this quarter."

And so I think we're still trying to figure out what's happening with the category. I wouldn't blame much of it on Zika at this stage at least from what we can tell on the data. On the KCP question, I would say we were happy with some of the emerging market growth on KCP of kind of mid-single digit and probably a little slower in some of the developed markets in Europe and North America.

We also had pretty good performance in Korea. We've got a good adult care business in Australia. So there's pockets where we've seen this start to play out, but we still got a long way to go to really fully take advantage of the opportunity, I think. And so our teams are focused on getting there as quickly as we can. In terms of Impressa, I can -- I would say so far, so good.

And some of that's retail execution, some of that's making sure we're getting the marketing messaging out.

So we see diaper rate usage per day go up as they get more income. And so in a market like China, in the higher income households, you see diaper usage per day very similar to any other developed market. And in the more rural markets in China, where you have very low GDP, you might see consumers that either use no diapers at all or maybe use one a day just for overnight. And so I think that's when you -- as you think about like a market like Brazil, if you've got a middle-class consumer who became poor, she may still use diapers for overnight, but she may not use them as frequently during the day. And so I think that's the -- in terms of how the economics of the category play out, that's -- I think that's true across a number of consumer staple spaces."

And probably more established markets, if you looked at like Australia and the U.K. and maybe even China, the currencies have been pretty stable and they've had a history of being pretty stable. And you don't typically get a big price-driven impact from currencies. For example, the sterling has weakened a bit since the Brexit announcement. I don't think you're going to see a lot of suppliers taking price on the U.K. because, a, it wasn't that big of a swing; and b, it's a challenge to push price through with the U.K. retailer.

You're -- if you go back far enough, you're probably right that at various points, we were struggling to get into the low end of the range. And then the last several years, with the explosion in emerging markets, we've been bumping up against the high end of the range. We've even had some investors suggesting whether we take it up to 4% to 6%, and we said 3% to 5% still feels about the right range long term. You think categories are probably growing 3% to 4% typically in a -- if you looked at the kind of long-term trend data. So if you deliver that with some innovation and some share growth, you can see your way clear to playing in the full space of that range. You look at some more recent trends, where emerging market economies are under a little bit more pressure, like they are today. When the categories are going negative in Brazil, that affects that model a little bit, and I still think 3% to 5% is the right range. And in any given year, we're going to be aiming to be solidly in the middle of that.

I commented on the FORCE cost savings earlier and the fact that we increased our outlook for that in 2016 with good performance there. And then as you go down the P&L, on the cost side, we still continue to invest in some areas, particularly in selling and research, and we still have some local inflation on our general cost saves that you can see come through in the numbers.

Let me start off with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were up 3% with volume growth of 4%. We achieved significant cost savings, improved our margins and grew adjusted earnings per share. And we also increased cash flow, improved our capital efficiency and returned cash to shareholders. 
Now let's cover the details, starting with sales. Our second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That's down 1% with a 4-point drag from currency rate. Organic sales rose 3% in the quarter. That included a 7% volume increase in North American consumer products and 5% organic growth in developing and emerging markets. Tom is going to provide some more color on our top line in just a few minutes. 
On profitability, second quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.3%, up 50 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 18%. That's up 100 basis points. 
Our teams continue to deliver significant cost savings in order to improve profitability and fund growth investments on our brands. Second quarter FORCE cost savings were $95 million. We have had strong performance on cost savings in the first half, and we're now targeting $350 million to $400 million of FORCE cost savings for the full year. In addition, our organization restructuring remains on track and generated $15 million of savings in the quarter. 
Commodities continue to be favorable, delivering $20 million of benefits, mostly from lower fiber costs. We expect full year deflation of $25 million to $125 million, which is broadly in line with our previous assumption. 
While currencies have improved since January, they remain a significant headwind year-over-year. The total earnings drag from currency was more than $0.15 per share in the second quarter, and we now expect the full year drag on EPS to be at least 10%. 
On the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.53, up 9% year-on-year. A lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed about 5 points of that earnings growth. We expect the tax rate will be significantly higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. 
Moving on to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was strong at $860 million. That's up 11% year-on-year. On adjusted return on invested capital, halfway through the year, we're up 100 basis points. So we're on track to easily exceed our long-term goal of 20 to 40 basis points of annual improvement. 
On capital allocation, second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled nearly $0.5 billion. The full year amount should be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion. This will be the sixth consecutive year that dividends and share repurchases will total at least $2 billion.
Looking at the segment results. In personal care, organic sales rose 5%. That included 6% growth in developing and emerging markets and 4% improvement in North America. Overall personal care operating margins were healthy at 20%, although off 50 basis points year-on-year, including significant currency headwind. 
Moving on to consumer tissue. Organic sales were up 2%, led by 4% growth in North America. Consumer tissue operating margins of 18.4% were up 110 basis points with the benefit of organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input costs.
In our third segment, K-C Professional, organic sales were up slightly, including 6% growth in developing and emerging markets. Lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health reduced the segment top line by more than 1 point. K-C Professional operating margins were 18.6%. That's up 100 basis points year-on-year, driven by cost savings.
Before wrapping up, let me recap. We achieved growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share. We delivered significant cost savings, margin improvements and cash flow, and we continued to improve our balance sheet efficiency and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tom."
283857,327145889,1011412,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 25, 2016",2016-07-25,"Earnings Calls","Kimberly-Clark Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone. I'll share my perspectives on our second quarter results, and then I'll comment on our full year outlook.

I'll share my perspectives on our second quarter results, and then I'll comment on our full year outlook. So overall, we continue to deliver good financial results, and we're executing well in a challenging environment. 
Starting with the second quarter. As Maria mentioned, our organic sales increased by 3%. We made progress on targeted growth initiatives and product innovations, and that helped us achieve volume growth of 4%. In our developing and emerging markets, organic sales were up 5%. 
Let me comment specifically on some of our key growth markets. In Brazil, organic sales in personal care rose about 10%, with both selling prices and volumes up year-on-year. While underlying category demand remains down in a tough economic environment, I'm encouraged by our second quarter results, following a soft start to the year in the first quarter. 
Moving to China. Our diaper volumes there continued to grow at strong double-digit rates in the quarter, and our market positions remain healthy. Nonetheless, because of increased price competition, our organic sales fell high single digits, and that compared to a 30% growth comp last year. Competitive activity picked up during the quarter in China, and we responded to protect our market share position and maintain our volume momentum. So I'm very bullish about our business in China. While the current pricing environment is dynamic, we have plans to continue to deliver strong volume growth with benefits from innovation, city expansion and category growth. 
Moving to Eastern Europe. Organic sales in diapers there rose more than 15%. Volumes were up at a double-digit rate, led by Huggies in Russia. Selling prices were also up modestly as we've now lapped most of the increases that we took last year. 
Elsewhere in developing and emerging markets, our feminine care organic sales were up double digits in the quarter, including strong performances in Latin America. And adult care organic sales were up high single digits. For the full year, we're now targeting mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our developing and emerging markets business. We've lowered our expectations for selling price increases, primarily due to an improved currency outlook in Latin America and Eastern Europe. We've also taken into account the dynamics in China and slowing economies in some parts of the world. 
I continue to be optimistic about our business in developing and emerging markets. Our market positions are generally improving or holding steady in most of the key markets we compete in, and we've got lots of innovation coming to help drive our future growth. 
Now let's turn to our North American consumer businesses. Our teams there delivered another strong quarter, with 7% volume growth and healthy market shares. Product innovations, great marketing programs and good retail execution continue to drive results across our portfolio. Promotion activity was also a little higher than average in the second quarter.
Our adult care, child care and feminine care volumes each increased by about 10%, including benefits from innovations on Poise and Depend, Pull-Ups and U by Kotex. Our Huggies diaper volumes rose mid-single digits, and market shares improved by about 1 point as we continue to make progress following last year's Snug & Dry relaunch. Consumer tissue volumes improved 6% with mid- to high single-digit growth in all categories, led by Kleenex facial tissue. So overall, our brand positions are very healthy in North America. 
Through the first half of the year, market shares improved or were even with prior year levels in 7 of the 8 consumer products categories in which we compete. So our volume comparison will be more difficult in the back half of the year, but I'm encouraged by our execution and our momentum in North America. 
Moving beyond sales, I'm also encouraged that our teams around the world continue to manage our company with financial discipline. At this point in the year, our FORCE cost savings are tracking to an all-time high. Our adjusted operating margins and return on invested capital are both up 100 basis points, and cash flow has picked up significantly. And Maria has already highlighted our shareholder-friendly capital allocation. So these results demonstrate to me the continued strength of our business. 
So all in all, we've made progress in several areas in the first half of the year. While we've got opportunities to improve further, we're broadly on track with our plans for 2016. 
Now let's move to our outlook for the full year. On the top line, we expect that currencies will reduce sales by 4% to 5%. Our prior assumption was for a negative impact toward the low end of the 5% to 6% range. In terms of organic sales, we expect growth will be at the low end of our 3% to 5% target range. This assumes less benefits from selling price increases, primarily due to the improved currency outlook. Volume growth, which was 3% in the first half of the year, should drive the vast majority of our organic sales growth for the full year. 
On the bottom line, we continue to target adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.95 to $6.15.
That's up 3% to 7% year-on-year despite an expected high single-digit drag from the combined impact of changes in currencies, commodities and selling prices. Through 6 months, we're on track relative to our full year earnings impact. 
That said, as Maria mentioned, the tax rate should be higher sequentially in the back half. We also continue to closely watch currency and commodity markets, competitive activity and economic conditions. 
So in summary, we continue to execute our Global Business Plan strategies well. We expect to deliver on our financial targets again this year. And we're optimistic about our prospects to continue to generate attractive long-term shareholder returns. 
That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions."

You decided not to change the guidance. You just kind of pushed people to the lower end. But even to get to the lower end, one would have to expect a little bit of an acceleration going forward, especially because the comp gets a little bit tougher with the 5% organic sales growth. So I'm struggling, again, to figure out what exactly is going to get better that you anticipate to get you on the low end. I guess you could round there, but just really to get to the low end feels like a little bit of a stretch given the comps that you have. So a little bit more detail there would be helpful to start."

Second quarter, the volume was positive in diapers and then a significant amount of price. We expect to see more volume in the back half. And so I'd say, if you look at share positions, in Brazil, we're up a couple of points in femcare and have a good momentum there and are down about 0.5 point in diapers. And we'd be looking to close that gap in the back half of the year. In China, we're really expecting the birthrate to pick up, as we'd expect to see a little bit more volume come there in the back half. Pricing has been more competitive than we'd anticipated, and we're expecting it's going to continue to be competitive in the back half of the year. And that's probably one of the shifts in our thinking from the first quarter when we talked last."

If you could comment at all on the kind of impact that's having on your gross margin position there as kind of everyone's got different cost structures, I guess. And then in terms of Brazil, it's -- clearly, you're gaining a lot of share in femcare there, but are you seeing underlying consumer recovery there as well?

Yes, on China gross margin, I'd say the team there has done a great job of driving premium mix where we can and taking cost out as well. So our overall K-C International team did a phenomenal job of delivering on their FORCE cost savings, and China certainly was a part of that. And so our Chinese gross margins were down a bit but nowhere near the level of price change in the market. And so -- again, we'd be pretty happy that China is an investable business and -- with strong gross margin and OP margin potential. On the Brazilian consumer, you're still seeing some negative category trends. And the economic outlook is still not terrific, although I was on the phone with our guy who runs Brazil last week and I think there are some early signs of optimism perhaps there that they're things -- expecting things to be a little better in '17. And so we'll see. I think the economy is running on expectations, and hopefully the Brazilian consumer will start to be a little bit more optimistic and we'll see that translate into category growth.

Jonathan, that's kind of a deep philosophical question this morning. But my general approach to this and our general approach to it over the years is to say you're really trying to develop loyal consumers that have a strong habit of using your brands to care for their families. And so you typically want to drive volume growth at least ahead of or tracking with your category that you're in so that you're improving your volume market share in the percentage of time she's going to use your product to care for her family. And many of our products, particularly as you think about things like feminine care or bath tissue or facial tissue, you start using a product and you use it for your entire life if you find a solution that works for you. And so we typically generate price when there's big commodity swings or when there's big currency swings. Other than that, we tend to plan for core volume growth as the lever to drive our business forward. And I don't know enough about my competitors' strategies in depth to know if it's that different from the way they think about it. But where you can get mix through premiumization and through up -- driving the consumer into a better-performing product, that's also an important element of our strategy, but that's really about giving them just good value for a product that works better in the end. So again, I think where we can drive volume, that's, I think, the healthiest form of organic growth for us and our business model."

That's probably been worse and stayed worse longer than we would have anticipated in our model for the year. And you're seeing some other economies that are moving a little slower than would have been expected across Latin America. Some parts of Eastern Europe as well are probably not quite as robust as they were in the -- in our plan, at least going into the year. Having said that, in markets like China, where you're expecting a little -- a strong birth rate this year, a little uptick in the birth rate, we are investing in newborn and early category entrants to make sure we get more than our fair share of the new babies born in some of those key markets. And so you can see a little mix drag from that. It wasn't a big -- super big impact, but it was big enough to talk about, I guess. As it shifts to the U.S, we had a lot of good stuff happening with the Pull-Ups relaunch kind of continuing through the second quarter, and it's had strong double-digit growth there. Femcare really had a lot of good execution at retail happening, and that was a little bit more promotionally intense. On the other hand, we saw double-digit volume growth, which was the first time we've seen that in our femcare business in a while. Adult care, we're -- we haven't lapped the Poise Impressa launch, so some of that was lapping that from last year. But we still had high single-digit growth in our adult care business ex-Impressa. So -- and we've got more good innovation coming. Now the comps gets a little tougher in the back half, but again, a lot of it was some of the bonus pack activity, some of the digital coupon activity as opposed to more trade funding. If anything, I'd say the trade funding levels were pretty consistent year-on-year. It was maybe more the other strategic marketing investment that was probably a little elevated this quarter."

And again, it's -- we're still in the kind of 9-month gestation period where -- before you would really, I think, see any impact from that on the birth rate. And so I don't know if some of the negative category trends we're seeing in Brazil have something to do with the source of the data. Are consumers shifting into some less measured outlets, doing more in the down-the-trade, lower-quality products? Are some middle class becoming poorer and not able to afford even the basics? And so I think we're still trying to figure out what's happening with the category. I wouldn't blame much of it on Zika at this stage, at least from what we can tell on the data. On the KCP question, I would say we were happy with some of the emerging market growth on KCP of kind of mid-single digit and probably a little slower in some of the developed markets in Europe and North America. The Halyard stuff is kind of burning off. The supply agreement, I think, officially wraps up at the end of this year, and we may continue to supply each other after that at some level.

And there are some international markets where it is -- if you looked at Japan, for example, today, which we don't participate in to any great extent, but the adult care category is larger than the diaper category there. And so there is a huge opportunity as the population ages in many parts of the world. And we've got -- our adult care business grew high single digits in developing and emerging markets. We also had pretty good performance in Korea. We've got a good adult care business in Australia. So there's pockets where we've seen this start to play out, but we still got a long way to go to really fully take advantage of the opportunity, I think. And so our teams are focused on getting there as quickly as we can. In terms of Impressa, I can -- I would say so far, so good. It's probably maybe a little slower than expected, but it's also on -- in a new product form, it's sometimes hard to predict how quickly consumers will change habits. So, so far, retailers are happy with the movement, and we're continuing to look at generating trial. Our repeat rates are where we would hope for. So now it's really focusing on how do we make sure we're getting trial rates up where we'd like them to be. And some of that's retail execution, some of that's making sure we're getting the marketing messaging out.

And so in a market like China, in the higher-income households, you see diaper usage per day very similar to any other developed market. And in the more rural markets in China, where you have very low GDP, you might see consumers that either use no diapers at all or maybe use one a day just for overnight. And so I think that's when you -- as you think about like a market like Brazil, if you've got a middle-class consumer who became poorer, she may still use diapers for overnight, but she may not use them as frequently during the day. And so I think that's the -- in terms of how the economics of the category play out, that's -- I think that's true across a number of consumer staple spaces."

And you don't typically get a big price-driven impact from currencies. For example, the sterling has weakened a bit since the Brexit announcement. I don't think you're going to see a lot of suppliers taking price on the U.K. because, a, it wasn't that big of a swing; and b, it's a challenge to push price through with the U.K. retailer.

You go to China and you've got some of the Japanese players are in that market as well as Hengan, which is a local Chinese company. Hengan is probably the overall share leader in that market, and we're a relatively small player. We're growing nicely, but we're only about a 4 share in China.

And then the last several years, with the explosion in emerging markets, we've been bumping up against the high end of the range. We've even had some investors suggesting whether we take it up to 4% to 6%, and we said 3% to 5% still feels about the right range long term. You think categories are probably growing 3% to 4% typically in a -- if you looked at the kind of long-term trend data. So if you deliver that with some innovation and some share growth, you can see your way clear to playing in the full space of that range. You look at some more recent trends, where emerging market economies are under a little bit more pressure, like they are today. When the categories are going negative in Brazil, that affects that model a little bit, and I still think 3% to 5% is the right range. And in any given year, we're going to be aiming to be solidly in the middle of that.

On the oil-based materials, remember that we're buying oil-based derivatives where, on the polymer front, we were actually seeing inflation versus deflation. So the benefit that you would typically expect for us to get from the lower price of oil isn't as much given the derivatives that we purchase there. I'll follow up just kind of on your line of questioning beyond the commodity situation, where we did narrow the range of expectations for the year. I commented on the FORCE cost savings earlier and the fact that we increased our outlook for that in 2016 with good performance there. And then as you go down the P&L, on the cost side, we still continue to invest in some areas, particularly selling and research, and we still have some local inflation on our general cost saves that you can see come through in the numbers. But overall, we continue to focus aggressively on cost structure and to take money out of areas that add less value and to invest in areas that have more value and help us achieve the top line growth."

Let me start off with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were up 3% with volume growth of 4%. We achieved significant cost savings, improved our margins and grew adjusted earnings per share. And we also increased cash flow, improved our capital efficiency and returned cash to shareholders. 
Now let's cover the details, starting with sales. Our second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That's down 1% with a 4-point drag from currency rate. Organic sales rose 3% in the quarter. That included a 7% volume increase in North American consumer products and 5% organic growth in developing and emerging markets. Tom is going to provide some more color on our top line in just a few minutes. 
On profitability, second quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.3%, up 50 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 18%. That's up 100 basis points. 
Our teams continue to deliver significant cost savings in order to improve profitability and fund growth investments on our brands. Second quarter FORCE cost savings were $95 million. We have had strong performance on cost savings in the first half, and we're now targeting $350 million to $400 million of FORCE cost savings for the full year. In addition, our organization restructuring remains on track and generated $15 million of savings in the quarter. 
Commodities continue to be favorable, delivering $20 million of benefits, mostly from lower fiber costs. We expect full year deflation of $25 million to $125 million, which is broadly in line with our previous assumption. 
While currencies have improved since January, they remain a significant headwind year-over-year. The total earnings drag from currency was more than $0.15 per share in the second quarter, and we now expect the full year drag on EPS to be at least 10%. 
On the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.53, up 9% year-on-year. A lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed about 5 points of that earnings growth. We expect the tax rate will be significantly higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. 
Moving on to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was strong at $860 million. That's up 11% year-on-year. On adjusted return on invested capital, halfway through the year, we're up 100 basis points. So we're on track to easily exceed our long-term goal of 20 to 40 basis points of annual improvement. 
On capital allocation, second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled nearly $0.5 billion. The full year amount should be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion. This will be the sixth consecutive year that dividends and share repurchases will total at least $2 billion.
Looking at the segment results. In personal care, organic sales rose 5%. That included 6% growth in developing and emerging markets and 4% improvement in North America. Overall personal care operating margins were healthy at 20%, although off 50 basis points year-on-year, including significant currency headwind. 
Moving on to consumer tissue. Organic sales were up 2%, led by 4% growth in North America. Consumer tissue operating margins of 18.4% were up 110 basis points with the benefit of organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input costs.
In our third segment, K-C Professional, organic sales were up slightly, including 6% growth in developing and emerging markets. Lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health reduced the segment top line by more than 1 point. K-C Professional operating margins were 18.6%. That's up 100 basis points year-on-year, driven by cost savings.
Before wrapping up, let me recap. We achieved growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share. We delivered significant cost savings, margin improvements and cash flow, and we continued to improve our balance sheet efficiency and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

Good morning, everyone. I'll share my perspectives on our second quarter results, and then I'll comment on our full year outlook.

I'll share my perspectives on our second quarter results, and then I'll comment on our full year outlook. So overall, we continue to deliver good financial results, and we're executing well in a challenging environment. 
Starting with the second quarter. As Maria mentioned, our organic sales increased by 3%. We made progress on targeted growth initiatives and product innovations, and that helped us achieve volume growth of 4%. In our developing and emerging markets, organic sales were up 5%. 
Let me comment specifically on some of our key growth markets. In Brazil, organic sales in personal care rose about 10%, with both selling prices and volumes up year-on-year. While underlying category demand remains down in a tough economic environment, I'm encouraged by our second quarter results, following a soft start to the year in the first quarter. 
Moving to China. Our diaper volumes there continued to grow at strong double-digit rates in the quarter, and our market positions remain healthy. Nonetheless, because of increased price competition, our organic sales fell high single digits, and that compared to a 30% growth comp last year. Competitive activity picked up during the quarter in China, and we responded to protect our market share position and maintain our volume momentum. So I'm very bullish about our business in China. While the current pricing environment is dynamic, we have plans to continue to deliver strong volume growth with benefits from innovation, city expansion and category growth. 
Moving to Eastern Europe. Organic sales in diapers there rose more than 15%. Volumes were up at a double-digit rate, led by Huggies in Russia. Selling prices were also up modestly as we've now lapped most of the increases that we took last year. 
Elsewhere in developing and emerging markets, our feminine care organic sales were up double digits in the quarter, including strong performances in Latin America. And adult care organic sales were up high single digits. For the full year, we're now targeting mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our developing and emerging markets business. We've lowered our expectations for selling price increases, primarily due to an improved currency outlook in Latin America and Eastern Europe. We've also taken into account the dynamics in China and slowing economies in some parts of the world. 
I continue to be optimistic about our business in developing and emerging markets. Our market positions are generally improving or holding steady in most of the key markets we compete in, and we've got lots of innovation coming to help drive our future growth. 
Now let's turn to our North American consumer businesses. Our teams there delivered another strong quarter, with 7% volume growth and healthy market shares. Product innovations, great marketing programs and good retail execution continue to drive results across our portfolio. Promotion activity was also a little higher than average in the second quarter.
Our adult care, child care and feminine care volumes each increased by about 10%, including benefits from innovations on Poise and Depend, Pull-Ups and U by Kotex. Our Huggies diaper volumes rose mid-single digits, and market shares improved by about 1 point as we continue to make progress following last year's Snug & Dry relaunch. Consumer tissue volumes improved 6% with mid- to high single-digit growth in all categories, led by Kleenex facial tissue. So overall, our brand positions are very healthy in North America. 
Through the first half of the year, market shares improved or were even with prior year levels in 7 of the 8 consumer products categories in which we compete. So our volume comparison will be more difficult in the back half of the year, but I'm encouraged by our execution and our momentum in North America. 
Moving beyond sales, I'm also encouraged that our teams around the world continue to manage our company with financial discipline. At this point in the year, our FORCE cost savings are tracking to an all-time high. Our adjusted operating margins and return on invested capital are both up 100 basis points, and cash flow has picked up significantly. And Maria has already highlighted our shareholder-friendly capital allocation. So these results demonstrate to me the continued strength of our business. 
So all in all, we've made progress in several areas in the first half of the year. While we've got opportunities to improve further, we're broadly on track with our plans for 2016. 
Now let's move to our outlook for the full year. On the top line, we expect that currencies will reduce sales by 4% to 5%. Our prior assumption was for a negative impact toward the low end of the 5% to 6% range. In terms of organic sales, we expect growth will be at the low end of our 3% to 5% target range. This assumes less benefits from selling price increases, primarily due to the improved currency outlook. Volume growth, which was 3% in the first half of the year, should drive the vast majority of our organic sales growth for the full year. 
On the bottom line, we continue to target adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.95 to $6.15.
That's up 3% to 7% year-on-year despite an expected high single-digit drag from the combined impact of changes in currencies, commodities and selling prices. Through 6 months, we're on track relative to our full year earnings impact. 
That said, as Maria mentioned, the tax rate should be higher sequentially in the back half. We also continue to closely watch currency and commodity markets, competitive activity and economic conditions. 
So in summary, we continue to execute our Global Business Plan strategies well. We expect to deliver on our financial targets again this year. And we're optimistic about our prospects to continue to generate attractive long-term shareholder returns. 
That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions."

You decided not to change the guidance. You just kind of pushed people to the lower end. But even to get to the lower end, one would have to expect a little bit of an acceleration going forward, especially because the comp gets a little bit tougher with the 5% organic sales growth. So I'm struggling, again, to figure out what exactly is going to get better that you anticipate to get you on the low end. I guess you could round there, but just really to get to the low end feels like a little bit of a stretch given the comps that you have. So a little bit more detail there would be helpful to start."

And so I'd say, if you look at share positions, in Brazil, we're up a couple of points in femcare and have a good momentum there and are down about 0.5 point in diapers. And we'd be looking to close that gap in the back half of the year. In China, we're really expecting the birthrate to pick up, as we'd expect to see a little bit more volume come there in the back half. Pricing has been more competitive than we'd anticipated, and we're expecting it's going to continue to be competitive in the back half of the year. And that's probably one of the shifts in our thinking from the first quarter when we talked last."

And so -- again, we'd be pretty happy that China is an investable business and -- with strong gross margin and OP margin potential. On the Brazilian consumer, you're still seeing some negative category trends.

Jonathan, that's kind of a deep philosophical question this morning. But my general approach to this and our general approach to it over the years is to say you're really trying to develop loyal consumers that have a strong habit of using your brands to care for their families. And so you typically want to drive volume growth at least ahead of or tracking with your category that you're in so that you're improving your volume market share in the percentage of time she's going to use your product to care for her family. And many of our products, particularly as you think about things like feminine care or bath tissue or facial tissue, you start using a product and you use it for your entire life if you find a solution that works for you. And so we typically generate price when there's big commodity swings or when there's big currency swings. Other than that, we tend to plan for core volume growth as the lever to drive our business forward. And I don't know enough about my competitors' strategies in depth to know if it's that different from the way they think about it. But where you can get mix through premiumization and through up -- driving the consumer into a better-performing product, that's also an important element of our strategy, but that's really about giving them just good value for a product that works better in the end. So again, I think where we can drive volume, that's, I think, the healthiest form of organic growth for us and our business model."

That's probably been worse and stayed worse longer than we would have anticipated in our model for the year. And you're seeing some other economies that are moving a little slower than would have been expected across Latin America. Some parts of Eastern Europe as well are probably not quite as robust as they were in the -- in our plan, at least going into the year. Having said that, in markets like China, where you're expecting a little -- a strong birth rate this year, a little uptick in the birth rate, we are investing in newborn and early category entrants to make sure we get more than our fair share of the new babies born in some of those key markets. And so you can see a little mix drag from that. It wasn't a big -- super big impact, but it was big enough to talk about, I guess. As it shifts to the U.S, we had a lot of good stuff happening with the Pull-Ups relaunch kind of continuing through the second quarter, and it's had strong double-digit growth there. Femcare really had a lot of good execution at retail happening, and that was a little bit more promotionally intense. On the other hand, we saw double-digit volume growth, which was the first time we've seen that in our femcare business in a while. Adult care, we're -- we haven't lapped the Poise Impressa launch, so some of that was lapping that from last year. But we still had high single-digit growth in our adult care business ex-Impressa. So -- and we've got more good innovation coming. Now the comps gets a little tougher in the back half, but again, a lot of it was some of the bonus pack activity, some of the digital coupon activity as opposed to more trade funding. If anything, I'd say the trade funding levels were pretty consistent year-on-year. It was maybe more the other strategic marketing investment that was probably a little elevated this quarter."

The Halyard stuff is kind of burning off. The supply agreement, I think, officially wraps up at the end of this year, and we may continue to supply each other after that at some level. But we'd expect that there was going to be a spike last year that we'll probably burn off this year, and that's kind of playing out."

And there are some international markets where it is -- if you looked at Japan, for example, today, which we don't participate in to any great extent, but the adult care category is larger than the diaper category there. And so there is a huge opportunity as the population ages in many parts of the world. And we've got -- our adult care business grew high single digits in developing and emerging markets. We also had pretty good performance in Korea. We've got a good adult care business in Australia. So there's pockets where we've seen this start to play out, but we still got a long way to go to really fully take advantage of the opportunity, I think. And so our teams are focused on getting there as quickly as we can. In terms of Impressa, I can -- I would say so far, so good. It's probably maybe a little slower than expected, but it's also on -- in a new product form, it's sometimes hard to predict how quickly consumers will change habits. So, so far, retailers are happy with the movement, and we're continuing to look at generating trial. Our repeat rates are where we would hope for. So now it's really focusing on how do we make sure we're getting trial rates up where we'd like them to be.

And so in a market like China, in the higher-income households, you see diaper usage per day very similar to any other developed market. And in the more rural markets in China, where you have very low GDP, you might see consumers that either use no diapers at all or maybe use one a day just for overnight. And so I think that's when you -- as you think about like a market like Brazil, if you've got a middle-class consumer who became poorer, she may still use diapers for overnight, but she may not use them as frequently during the day. And so I think that's the -- in terms of how the economics of the category play out, that's -- I think that's true across a number of consumer staple spaces."

I mean that's kind of the way the market works. And probably more established markets, if you looked at like Australia and the U.K. and maybe even China, the currencies have been pretty stable and they've had a history of being pretty stable. And you don't typically get a big price-driven impact from currencies. For example, the sterling has weakened a bit since the Brexit announcement.

And we're -- we've just recently become the share leader in Brazil and continue to have good momentum there with our Intimus by Kotex brand there. You go to China and you've got some of the Japanese players are in that market as well as Hengan, which is a local Chinese company. Hengan is probably the overall share leader in that market, and we're a relatively small player. We're growing nicely, but we're only about a 4 share in China.

And then the last several years, with the explosion in emerging markets, we've been bumping up against the high end of the range. We've even had some investors suggesting whether we take it up to 4% to 6%, and we said 3% to 5% still feels about the right range long term. You think categories are probably growing 3% to 4% typically in a -- if you looked at the kind of long-term trend data. So if you deliver that with some innovation and some share growth, you can see your way clear to playing in the full space of that range. You look at some more recent trends, where emerging market economies are under a little bit more pressure, like they are today. When the categories are going negative in Brazil, that affects that model a little bit, and I still think 3% to 5% is the right range. And in any given year, we're going to be aiming to be solidly in the middle of that.

And that may have been why our -- some of our competitive activity was a little higher in the second quarter, was making sure we continue to show the value on Huggies. The good news is we still saw mid-single-digit volume gains on Huggies, and we're up 1 share point. So we feel like we're on the right track and anticipate that P&G will continue to be competitive."

In that context, can we turn into the belly of the P&L and talk a bit more about the cost saves and the inflation/deflation? This was -- certainly, the deflationary benefit has subsided into this quarter, following the abatement last quarter as well. And I think this is the first time in a while that fiber has been the primary driver. So 2 questions there. First, is it fair to say that the benefits of lower oil derivatives is now behind you? And secondly, what are you seeing in the pulp markets? Because something -- what we're seeing shows a market that's been a bit more stubborn than we would have hoped?"

We probably bought a little bit more spot tonnage in some of the northern softwood area, which gives us a little bit more benefit because there has been some good availability at attractive prices there. So again, I would say not too much change sequentially in our view of the pulp market. And we'll see what happens going forward.

On the oil-based materials, remember that we're buying oil-based derivatives where, on the polymer front, we were actually seeing inflation versus deflation. So the benefit that you would typically expect for us to get from the lower price of oil isn't as much given the derivatives that we purchase there. I'll follow up just kind of on your line of questioning beyond the commodity situation, where we did narrow the range of expectations for the year. I commented on the FORCE cost savings earlier and the fact that we increased our outlook for that in 2016 with good performance there. And then as you go down the P&L, on the cost side, we still continue to invest in some areas, particularly selling and research, and we still have some local inflation on our general cost saves that you can see come through in the numbers. But overall, we continue to focus aggressively on cost structure and to take money out of areas that add less value and to invest in areas that have more value and help us achieve the top line growth."

Let me start off with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were up 3% with volume growth of 4%. We achieved significant cost savings, improved our margins and grew adjusted earnings per share. And we also increased cash flow, improved our capital efficiency and returned cash to shareholders. 
Now let's cover the details, starting with sales. Our second quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That's down 1% with a 4-point drag from currency rate. Organic sales rose 3% in the quarter. That included a 7% volume increase in North American consumer products and 5% organic growth in developing and emerging markets. Tom is going to provide some more color on our top line in just a few minutes. 
On profitability, second quarter adjusted gross margin was 36.3%, up 50 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was 18%. That's up 100 basis points. 
Our teams continue to deliver significant cost savings in order to improve profitability and fund growth investments on our brands. Second quarter FORCE cost savings were $95 million. We have had strong performance on cost savings in the first half, and we're now targeting $350 million to $400 million of FORCE cost savings for the full year. In addition, our organization restructuring remains on track and generated $15 million of savings in the quarter. 
Commodities continue to be favorable, delivering $20 million of benefits, mostly from lower fiber costs. We expect full year deflation of $25 million to $125 million, which is broadly in line with our previous assumption. 
While currencies have improved since January, they remain a significant headwind year-over-year. The total earnings drag from currency was more than $0.15 per share in the second quarter, and we now expect the full year drag on EPS to be at least 10%. 
On the bottom line, second quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.53, up 9% year-on-year. A lower adjusted effective tax rate contributed about 5 points of that earnings growth. We expect the tax rate will be significantly higher in the second half of the year compared to the first half of the year. 
Moving on to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the second quarter was strong at $860 million. That's up 11% year-on-year. On adjusted return on invested capital, halfway through the year, we're up 100 basis points. So we're on track to easily exceed our long-term goal of 20 to 40 basis points of annual improvement. 
On capital allocation, second quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled nearly $0.5 billion. The full year amount should be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion. This will be the sixth consecutive year that dividends and share repurchases will total at least $2 billion.
Looking at the segment results. In personal care, organic sales rose 5%. That included 6% growth in developing and emerging markets and 4% improvement in North America. Overall personal care operating margins were healthy at 20%, although off 50 basis points year-on-year, including significant currency headwind. 
Moving on to consumer tissue. Organic sales were up 2%, led by 4% growth in North America. Consumer tissue operating margins of 18.4% were up 110 basis points with the benefit of organic sales growth, cost savings and lower input costs.
In our third segment, K-C Professional, organic sales were up slightly, including 6% growth in developing and emerging markets. Lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health reduced the segment top line by more than 1 point. K-C Professional operating margins were 18.6%. That's up 100 basis points year-on-year, driven by cost savings.
Before wrapping up, let me recap. We achieved growth in organic sales and adjusted earnings per share. We delivered significant cost savings, margin improvements and cash flow, and we continued to improve our balance sheet efficiency and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. 
I'll now turn the call over to Tom."

Good morning, everyone. I'll share my perspectives on our second quarter results, and then I'll comment on our full year outlook.

I'll share my perspectives on our second quarter results, and then I'll comment on our full year outlook. So overall, we continue to deliver good financial results, and we're executing well in a challenging environment. 
Starting with the second quarter. As Maria mentioned, our organic sales increased by 3%. We made progress on targeted growth initiatives and product innovations, and that helped us achieve volume growth of 4%. In our developing and emerging markets, organic sales were up 5%. 
Let me comment specifically on some of our key growth markets. In Brazil, organic sales in personal care rose about 10%, with both selling prices and volumes up year-on-year. While underlying category demand remains down in a tough economic environment, I'm encouraged by our second quarter results, following a soft start to the year in the first quarter. 
Moving to China. Our diaper volumes there continued to grow at strong double-digit rates in the quarter, and our market positions remain healthy. Nonetheless, because of increased price competition, our organic sales fell high single digits, and that compared to a 30% growth comp last year. Competitive activity picked up during the quarter in China, and we responded to protect our market share position and maintain our volume momentum. So I'm very bullish about our business in China. While the current pricing environment is dynamic, we have plans to continue to deliver strong volume growth with benefits from innovation, city expansion and category growth. 
Moving to Eastern Europe. Organic sales in diapers there rose more than 15%. Volumes were up at a double-digit rate, led by Huggies in Russia. Selling prices were also up modestly as we've now lapped most of the increases that we took last year. 
Elsewhere in developing and emerging markets, our feminine care organic sales were up double digits in the quarter, including strong performances in Latin America. And adult care organic sales were up high single digits. For the full year, we're now targeting mid-single-digit organic sales growth for our developing and emerging markets business. We've lowered our expectations for selling price increases, primarily due to an improved currency outlook in Latin America and Eastern Europe. We've also taken into account the dynamics in China and slowing economies in some parts of the world. 
I continue to be optimistic about our business in developing and emerging markets. Our market positions are generally improving or holding steady in most of the key markets we compete in, and we've got lots of innovation coming to help drive our future growth. 
Now let's turn to our North American consumer businesses. Our teams there delivered another strong quarter, with 7% volume growth and healthy market shares. Product innovations, great marketing programs and good retail execution continue to drive results across our portfolio. Promotion activity was also a little higher than average in the second quarter.
Our adult care, child care and feminine care volumes each increased by about 10%, including benefits from innovations on Poise and Depend, Pull-Ups and U by Kotex. Our Huggies diaper volumes rose mid-single digits, and market shares improved by about 1 point as we continue to make progress following last year's Snug & Dry relaunch. Consumer tissue volumes improved 6% with mid- to high single-digit growth in all categories, led by Kleenex facial tissue. So overall, our brand positions are very healthy in North America. 
Through the first half of the year, market shares improved or were even with prior year levels in 7 of the 8 consumer products categories in which we compete. So our volume comparison will be more difficult in the back half of the year, but I'm encouraged by our execution and our momentum in North America. 
Moving beyond sales, I'm also encouraged that our teams around the world continue to manage our company with financial discipline. At this point in the year, our FORCE cost savings are tracking to an all-time high. Our adjusted operating margins and return on invested capital are both up 100 basis points, and cash flow has picked up significantly. And Maria has already highlighted our shareholder-friendly capital allocation. So these results demonstrate to me the continued strength of our business. 
So all in all, we've made progress in several areas in the first half of the year. While we've got opportunities to improve further, we're broadly on track with our plans for 2016. 
Now let's move to our outlook for the full year. On the top line, we expect that currencies will reduce sales by 4% to 5%. Our prior assumption was for a negative impact toward the low end of the 5% to 6% range. In terms of organic sales, we expect growth will be at the low end of our 3% to 5% target range. This assumes less benefits from selling price increases, primarily due to the improved currency outlook. Volume growth, which was 3% in the first half of the year, should drive the vast majority of our organic sales growth for the full year. 
On the bottom line, we continue to target adjusted earnings per share in the range of $5.95 to $6.15.
That's up 3% to 7% year-on-year despite an expected high single-digit drag from the combined impact of changes in currencies, commodities and selling prices. Through 6 months, we're on track relative to our full year earnings impact. 
That said, as Maria mentioned, the tax rate should be higher sequentially in the back half. We also continue to closely watch currency and commodity markets, competitive activity and economic conditions. 
So in summary, we continue to execute our Global Business Plan strategies well. We expect to deliver on our financial targets again this year. And we're optimistic about our prospects to continue to generate attractive long-term shareholder returns. 
That wraps up our prepared remarks, and now we'll begin to take your questions."

You decided not to change the guidance. You just kind of pushed people to the lower end. But even to get to the lower end, one would have to expect a little bit of an acceleration going forward, especially because the comp gets a little bit tougher with the 5% organic sales growth. So I'm struggling, again, to figure out what exactly is going to get better that you anticipate to get you on the low end. I guess you could round there, but just really to get to the low end feels like a little bit of a stretch given the comps that you have. So a little bit more detail there would be helpful to start."

And so I'd say, if you look at share positions, in Brazil, we're up a couple of points in femcare and have a good momentum there and are down about 0.5 point in diapers. And we'd be looking to close that gap in the back half of the year. In China, we're really expecting the birthrate to pick up, as we'd expect to see a little bit more volume come there in the back half. Pricing has been more competitive than we'd anticipated, and we're expecting it's going to continue to be competitive in the back half of the year.

On the Brazilian consumer, you're still seeing some negative category trends.

Jonathan, that's kind of a deep philosophical question this morning. But my general approach to this and our general approach to it over the years is to say you're really trying to develop loyal consumers that have a strong habit of using your brands to care for their families. And so you typically want to drive volume growth at least ahead of or tracking with your category that you're in so that you're improving your volume market share in the percentage of time she's going to use your product to care for her family. And many of our products, particularly as you think about things like feminine care or bath tissue or facial tissue, you start using a product and you use it for your entire life if you find a solution that works for you. And so we typically generate price when there's big commodity swings or when there's big currency swings. Other than that, we tend to plan for core volume growth as the lever to drive our business forward. And I don't know enough about my competitors' strategies in depth to know if it's that different from the way they think about it. But where you can get mix through premiumization and through up -- driving the consumer into a better-performing product, that's also an important element of our strategy, but that's really about giving them just good value for a product that works better in the end. So again, I think where we can drive volume, that's, I think, the healthiest form of organic growth for us and our business model."

As it shifts to the U.S, we had a lot of good stuff happening with the Pull-Ups relaunch kind of continuing through the second quarter, and it's had strong double-digit growth there. Femcare really had a lot of good execution at retail happening, and that was a little bit more promotionally intense. On the other hand, we saw double-digit volume growth, which was the first time we've seen that in our femcare business in a while. Adult care, we're -- we haven't lapped the Poise Impressa launch, so some of that was lapping that from last year. But we still had high single-digit growth in our adult care business ex-Impressa. So -- and we've got more good innovation coming. Now the comps gets a little tougher in the back half, but again, a lot of it was some of the bonus pack activity, some of the digital coupon activity as opposed to more trade funding. If anything, I'd say the trade funding levels were pretty consistent year-on-year. It was maybe more the other strategic marketing investment that was probably a little elevated this quarter."

On the Zika question, we don't really have any good read on that. And again, it's -- we're still in the kind of 9-month gestation period where -- before you would really, I think, see any impact from that on the birth rate. And so I don't know if some of the negative category trends we're seeing in Brazil have something to do with the source of the data. Are consumers shifting into some less measured outlets, doing more in the down-the-trade, lower-quality products? Are some middle class becoming poorer and not able to afford even the basics? And so I think we're still trying to figure out what's happening with the category. I wouldn't blame much of it on Zika at this stage, at least from what we can tell on the data. On the KCP question, I would say we were happy with some of the emerging market growth on KCP of kind of mid-single digit and probably a little slower in some of the developed markets in Europe and North America. The Halyard stuff is kind of burning off. The supply agreement, I think, officially wraps up at the end of this year, and we may continue to supply each other after that at some level. But we'd expect that there was going to be a spike last year that we'll probably burn off this year, and that's kind of playing out."

And so there is a huge opportunity as the population ages in many parts of the world. And we've got -- our adult care business grew high single digits in developing and emerging markets. We also had pretty good performance in Korea. We've got a good adult care business in Australia. So there's pockets where we've seen this start to play out, but we still got a long way to go to really fully take advantage of the opportunity, I think. And so our teams are focused on getting there as quickly as we can. In terms of Impressa, I can -- I would say so far, so good. It's probably maybe a little slower than expected, but it's also on -- in a new product form, it's sometimes hard to predict how quickly consumers will change habits. So, so far, retailers are happy with the movement, and we're continuing to look at generating trial. Our repeat rates are where we would hope for. So now it's really focusing on how do we make sure we're getting trial rates up where we'd like them to be.

And so I think that's when you -- as you think about like a market like Brazil, if you've got a middle-class consumer who became poorer, she may still use diapers for overnight, but she may not use them as frequently during the day.

We've even had some investors suggesting whether we take it up to 4% to 6%, and we said 3% to 5% still feels about the right range long term. You think categories are probably growing 3% to 4% typically in a -- if you looked at the kind of long-term trend data. So if you deliver that with some innovation and some share growth, you can see your way clear to playing in the full space of that range. You look at some more recent trends, where emerging market economies are under a little bit more pressure, like they are today. When the categories are going negative in Brazil, that affects that model a little bit, and I still think 3% to 5% is the right range.

We were probably a little bit early in e-commerce and had more than our fair share of that space. Lots of other players are piling in there, and e-commerce is more competitive now than it was several years ago. And so yes, there's certainly -- it's certainly a competitive environment, especially when categories aren't growing as fast and everybody is still trying to get their volume growth.

In that context, can we turn into the belly of the P&L and talk a bit more about the cost saves and the inflation/deflation? This was -- certainly, the deflationary benefit has subsided into this quarter, following the abatement last quarter as well. And I think this is the first time in a while that fiber has been the primary driver. So 2 questions there. First, is it fair to say that the benefits of lower oil derivatives is now behind you? And secondly, what are you seeing in the pulp markets? Because something -- what we're seeing shows a market that's been a bit more stubborn than we would have hoped?"

We probably bought a little bit more spot tonnage in some of the northern softwood area, which gives us a little bit more benefit because there has been some good availability at attractive prices there.

On the oil-based materials, remember that we're buying oil-based derivatives where, on the polymer front, we were actually seeing inflation versus deflation. So the benefit that you would typically expect for us to get from the lower price of oil isn't as much given the derivatives that we purchase there. I'll follow up just kind of on your line of questioning beyond the commodity situation, where we did narrow the range of expectations for the year. I commented on the FORCE cost savings earlier and the fact that we increased our outlook for that in 2016 with good performance there. And then as you go down the P&L, on the cost side, we still continue to invest in some areas, particularly selling and research, and we still have some local inflation on our general cost saves that you can see come through in the numbers. But overall, we continue to focus aggressively on cost structure and to take money out of areas that add less value and to invest in areas that have more value and help us achieve the top line growth."

We achieved significant cost",524,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today.
Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were basically even year-on-year, including 3% growth in developing and emerging markets. We achieved significant cost savings and margin improvements and we increased cash flow, improved capital efficiency and returned cash to shareholders.
Now let's cover the details, starting with sales. Our third quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That's down about 3%,  including a currency drag of more than 2%. Tom will provide more color on our top line in just a few minutes.
On profitability, third quarter adjusted gross margins was 36.4%, up 30 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margins was 18.2%. That's up 70 basis points.
I'm encouraged that our teams continue to improve the shape of the P&L even in a tougher environment. Our cost savings initiatives continue to be a key driver of margin improvement.
Third quarter FORCE cost savings were $105 million, equal to our previous all-time record. Through 9 months, FORCE savings are $295 million. So we're tracking to be toward the high end of our $350 million to $400 million full year target. In addition, our Organization Restructuring generated $15 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities were favorable by $10 million, mostly due to lower fiber costs. Full year deflation should be toward the middle of our previous estimate of $25 million to $125 million.
On the bottom line, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.52, up 1% year-on-year. That's despite a currency drag of more than $0.10 per share, mostly from transaction effects.
Moving on to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was strong at $948 million. That's up 12% year-on-year, driven by improved working capital. Unadjusted return on invested capital through 9 months were up 100 basis points, nicely ahead of our long-term goal of 20 to 40 basis points of annual improvement.
On capital allocation, third quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $550 million. The full year amount should be approximately $2.1 billion.
Moving on to segment results. In personal care, organic sales rose more than 1%. That includes 4% growth in developing and emerging markets. Overall personal care operating margins were healthy at 19.8%, although off 70 basis points year-on-year, including significant currency headwinds.
Moving to consumer tissue. Organic sales fell 2%, driven by results in North America. Consumer tissue operating margins of 18.1% were up 110 basis points with benefits from cost savings and lower input costs.
In our third segment, K-C Professional, organic sales were down 1%. That included a 1 point impact from lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health. K-C Professional operating margins were 19.6%.  That's up 100 basis points year-on-year, driven by higher net selling prices and cost savings.
So overall, it was a soft quarter on the top line in a tough environment. Nonetheless, we delivered significant cost savings, improved our margins and increased cash flow. We also continued to improve our balance sheet efficiency and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways.
I'll now turn it over to Tom."

I'll share my perspectives on our third quarter results, and then I'll comment on our full year outlook.So starting with the third quarter, as Maria mentioned, our organic sales growth were about even year-on-y",901,"Thanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll share my perspectives on our third quarter results, and then I'll comment on our full year outlook.
So starting with the third quarter, as Maria mentioned, our organic sales growth were about even year-on-year and reflected a more challenging economic and competitive environment. Regardless of the reasons, I'm not satisfied with our top line results and I expect some improvement in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, I am broadly encouraged with our current market share positions. So we are holding up well in a challenging environment.
Let me give you some details about our third quarter sales and market conditions. In developing and emerging markets, organic sales were up 3%. That compares to a 5% growth in the second quarter as performance improved in China, but softened in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina.
In Brazil, organic sales in personal care fell about 5% year-on-year due to lower volumes. Results were impacted by competitive promotion activity and an even more difficult economic environment. We'll be launching more innovation in the next few quarters in Brazil while making sure we protect our brands appropriately.
In Argentina, while selling prices were up in the quarter, volumes were down low double-digits in a challenging consumer environment. Category volumes are declining at about the same rate as our volume decline and have worsened over the last 3 months.
Now, looking outside of Latin America. In Eastern Europe, organic sales in diapers increased 10% due to broad-based volume growth on Huggies across the region. In China, organic sales in diapers were up low single digits as strong volume growth was mostly offset by lower selling prices. Looking ahead in China, we expect our volume momentum will continue with benefits from innovation and healthy category demand. We also expect the promotion environment will remain competitive.
So overall, while organic growth in developing and emerging markets has moderated this year, that's mostly because of slower economic growth, which has resulted in weaker category dynamics. In most of our key businesses, our market positions are generally improving or holding steady.
I'm still very optimistic about our long-term growth prospects in developing and emerging markets because of the inherent category penetration opportunities that exist in this part of the world. Nonetheless, given the volatility in the current environment, it's difficult to predict when growth will pick back up significantly.
Turning to our North American consumer businesses. Consumer tissue volumes were down about 3%. The comparison included impacts from changes in the timing of promotional shipments and 6% growth in the year-ago period. Year-to-date, our volumes are up 2% on this business. That's a good indicator of our ongoing performance. In addition, our market shares in the third quarter are relatively stable sequentially. So we expect volume -- better volume performance going forward compared to the third quarter.
Personal care volumes in North America were up 1% compared to 10% growth last year. Child care volumes were up double-digits. They benefited from innovation and category growth. And baby wipes volumes were also up double-digits in the quarter. Volumes were up low single digits in diapers and mid-single digits in adult care. Both businesses have double-digit growth last year with increased promotion shipments and benefits from innovation.
Competitive promotion activity has also picked up somewhat recently, particularly in adult care. Our market shares in the third quarter were stable in diapers and down about 1 point in adult care.
In terms of overall market shares in North America, our positions remain healthy. Shares improved or were even with prior year levels in 7 of 8 consumer categories on a year-to-date basis and in 5 of 8 categories in the third quarter.
Now moving beyond sales, we continue to manage with financial discipline. As Maria highlighted, we delivered another quarter of strong performance on cost savings, margins, return on invested capital and cash generation while we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. These results demonstrate the continued strength of our business.
Now moving on to our outlook. We remain optimistic about our long-term future. We'll continue to execute our innovation, marketing and targeted growth initiatives to grow our brands. We'll also continue to focus on improving the profitability and efficiency of our businesses.
In terms of our guidance for full year 2016, we expect organic sales growth of 2%. Our previous target was 3%. On the bottom line, we're targeting full year adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.95 to $6.05. Compared to our previous guidance, we've lowered the top end of the range by $0.10 per share to reflect our new organic sales estimate. Our earnings outlook represents year-on-year growth of 3% to 5%, which I believe is pretty solid performance in this environment.
Over the next 3 months, we'll continue to assess the environment and finalize our detailed operating plans for 2017. And as we always do, we'll provide our guidance for the coming year in January when we announce year-end earnings.
So in summary, while it's been a more difficult environment to generate top line growth this year, we are competing effectively and our market positions are in good shape. We're managing the company with financial discipline. And we continue to execute our Global Business Plan strategies for long-term success and shareholder return.
That wraps up our prepared remarks. And now, we'll begin to take your questions."

Okay. So first, I actually wanted to ask about was margin performance because you showed really good margin expansion in both consumer tissue and K-C Professional, even with volumes down.

So I'd say there's no question that there's less growth out there in lots of places. And so Latin America was certainly the case where categories are -- have gone negative in a big way due to some of the economic impacts in places like Argentina. And there is just as many people chasing that growth, and so that does make it more competitive.
On the other hand, you saw some pretty heavy up activity in some markets in the third quarter that probably won't repeat at the same level. There was some very heavy adult care couponing in North America for example by both of our primary competitors. Think $14 digital coupons on a $13 [ph] item, but we don't see that reoccurring. This is probably more of a onetime thing. We also saw some pretty big easy ups couponing, more like $5 coupon, which is way above normal in that market as they were launching a new product, and again, don't see that continuing at that level. And we didn't match those offers, but that doesn't affect your short-term volume while that stuff is working its way through the market."

If you look at our year-to-date volume, we're up a couple of percent on consumer tissue in North America and expect to have a solid fourth quarter versus the negative trend in the third quarter.

Diapers has been more competitive. Category has been weaker. There has been some trade down in the category as well, and you've seen more Tier 2 growth. It's been more competitive. And so from a pricing standpoint, promotion standpoint, there's been more activity on that front as well. And I think within that, you've seen some either as household inventory destocking. Or it's moms who are using 4 or 5 diapers a day now using 3 or 4 diapers a day. So you take 1 diaper a day out of the equation, and that's a double-digit category decline for that consumer. And so I think it takes a little while to get household panel data to really understand what's driving, that. But it's gone on for long enough now. It's probably more than just inventory destocking where you're actually seeing the middle class, in some cases, in Brazil are getting poorer and having to make tough trade-offs. You see same kind of phenomena in Argentina as well as they're moving to more of a market-based economy in some areas. That's putting big pressure on consumer wallet. So while we're still well positioned and bullish long term on Brazil, it's been a tough economic environment. You've had a recession for the second year in a row. Their overall outlook is as not that optimistic. And economies run on expectations. And until people start to believe, it's going to get better, it's not going to snap back probably."

Europe, Eastern Europe, I'd say Western Europe and the U.K. was pretty weak overall economically.

And we had really good performance in working capital, particularly in reducing inventories. And that came through to help our cash flow numbers. In terms of CapEx, we do expect that we'll be below our original guidance than we gave coming into the year, but that is driven by a couple of things. First, we have had really strong productivity this year. And you see that showing up in our FORCE cost savings as one of the levers that we used to drive that. And we also do have lower volume and sales growth than we expected coming into the year. And so we're very rigorous on what we spend capital on and making sure that we're matching up the timing of when we're putting assets in the ground with our expectations. And with lower volume growth of this year, our capital is lower than we expected. This is an area we continue to drive. You know that we've set up a global supply chain organization last year. And that organization, partnering with a finance organization and the operating teams are continuing to drive added rigor to our capital process. And so we're not changing our long-term expectation there, but we are incredibly rigorous on that. And we'll flex that CapEx band with the needs of the business.

On the tissue comps, I mean again, as it was a -- we had a weaker promotional calendar in the third quarter as it turned out than we needed.

Thanks for joining the call today.Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were basically even year-on-year, including 3% growth in developing and emerging markets. We achieved significant cost",524,"Thanks, Paul. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call today.
Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were basically even year-on-year, including 3% growth in developing and emerging markets. We achieved significant cost savings and margin improvements and we increased cash flow, improved capital efficiency and returned cash to shareholders.
Now let's cover the details, starting with sales. Our third quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That's down about 3%,  including a currency drag of more than 2%. Tom will provide more color on our top line in just a few minutes.
On profitability, third quarter adjusted gross margins was 36.4%, up 30 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margins was 18.2%. That's up 70 basis points.
I'm encouraged that our teams continue to improve the shape of the P&L even in a tougher environment. Our cost savings initiatives continue to be a key driver of margin improvement.
Third quarter FORCE cost savings were $105 million, equal to our previous all-time record. Through 9 months, FORCE savings are $295 million. So we're tracking to be toward the high end of our $350 million to $400 million full year target. In addition, our Organization Restructuring generated $15 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities were favorable by $10 million, mostly due to lower fiber costs. Full year deflation should be toward the middle of our previous estimate of $25 million to $125 million.
On the bottom line, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.52, up 1% year-on-year. That's despite a currency drag of more than $0.10 per share, mostly from transaction effects.
Moving on to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was strong at $948 million. That's up 12% year-on-year, driven by improved working capital. Unadjusted return on invested capital through 9 months were up 100 basis points, nicely ahead of our long-term goal of 20 to 40 basis points of annual improvement.
On capital allocation, third quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $550 million. The full year amount should be approximately $2.1 billion.
Moving on to segment results. In personal care, organic sales rose more than 1%. That includes 4% growth in developing and emerging markets. Overall personal care operating margins were healthy at 19.8%, although off 70 basis points year-on-year, including significant currency headwinds.
Moving to consumer tissue. Organic sales fell 2%, driven by results in North America. Consumer tissue operating margins of 18.1% were up 110 basis points with benefits from cost savings and lower input costs.
In our third segment, K-C Professional, organic sales were down 1%. That included a 1 point impact from lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health. K-C Professional operating margins were 19.6%.  That's up 100 basis points year-on-year, driven by higher net selling prices and cost savings.
So overall, it was a soft quarter on the top line in a tough environment. Nonetheless, we delivered significant cost savings, improved our margins and increased cash flow. We also continued to improve our balance sheet efficiency and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways.
I'll now turn it over to Tom."

I'll share my perspectives on our third quarter results, and then I'll comment on our full year outlook.So starting with the third quarter, as Maria mentioned, our organic sales growth were about even year-on-y",901,"Thanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll share my perspectives on our third quarter results, and then I'll comment on our full year outlook.
So starting with the third quarter, as Maria mentioned, our organic sales growth were about even year-on-year and reflected a more challenging economic and competitive environment. Regardless of the reasons, I'm not satisfied with our top line results and I expect some improvement in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, I am broadly encouraged with our current market share positions. So we are holding up well in a challenging environment.
Let me give you some details about our third quarter sales and market conditions. In developing and emerging markets, organic sales were up 3%. That compares to a 5% growth in the second quarter as performance improved in China, but softened in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina.
In Brazil, organic sales in personal care fell about 5% year-on-year due to lower volumes. Results were impacted by competitive promotion activity and an even more difficult economic environment. We'll be launching more innovation in the next few quarters in Brazil while making sure we protect our brands appropriately.
In Argentina, while selling prices were up in the quarter, volumes were down low double-digits in a challenging consumer environment. Category volumes are declining at about the same rate as our volume decline and have worsened over the last 3 months.
Now, looking outside of Latin America. In Eastern Europe, organic sales in diapers increased 10% due to broad-based volume growth on Huggies across the region. In China, organic sales in diapers were up low single digits as strong volume growth was mostly offset by lower selling prices. Looking ahead in China, we expect our volume momentum will continue with benefits from innovation and healthy category demand. We also expect the promotion environment will remain competitive.
So overall, while organic growth in developing and emerging markets has moderated this year, that's mostly because of slower economic growth, which has resulted in weaker category dynamics. In most of our key businesses, our market positions are generally improving or holding steady.
I'm still very optimistic about our long-term growth prospects in developing and emerging markets because of the inherent category penetration opportunities that exist in this part of the world. Nonetheless, given the volatility in the current environment, it's difficult to predict when growth will pick back up significantly.
Turning to our North American consumer businesses. Consumer tissue volumes were down about 3%. The comparison included impacts from changes in the timing of promotional shipments and 6% growth in the year-ago period. Year-to-date, our volumes are up 2% on this business. That's a good indicator of our ongoing performance. In addition, our market shares in the third quarter are relatively stable sequentially. So we expect volume -- better volume performance going forward compared to the third quarter.
Personal care volumes in North America were up 1% compared to 10% growth last year. Child care volumes were up double-digits. They benefited from innovation and category growth. And baby wipes volumes were also up double-digits in the quarter. Volumes were up low single digits in diapers and mid-single digits in adult care. Both businesses have double-digit growth last year with increased promotion shipments and benefits from innovation.
Competitive promotion activity has also picked up somewhat recently, particularly in adult care. Our market shares in the third quarter were stable in diapers and down about 1 point in adult care.
In terms of overall market shares in North America, our positions remain healthy. Shares improved or were even with prior year levels in 7 of 8 consumer categories on a year-to-date basis and in 5 of 8 categories in the third quarter.
Now moving beyond sales, we continue to manage with financial discipline. As Maria highlighted, we delivered another quarter of strong performance on cost savings, margins, return on invested capital and cash generation while we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. These results demonstrate the continued strength of our business.
Now moving on to our outlook. We remain optimistic about our long-term future. We'll continue to execute our innovation, marketing and targeted growth initiatives to grow our brands. We'll also continue to focus on improving the profitability and efficiency of our businesses.
In terms of our guidance for full year 2016, we expect organic sales growth of 2%. Our previous target was 3%. On the bottom line, we're targeting full year adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.95 to $6.05. Compared to our previous guidance, we've lowered the top end of the range by $0.10 per share to reflect our new organic sales estimate. Our earnings outlook represents year-on-year growth of 3% to 5%, which I believe is pretty solid performance in this environment.
Over the next 3 months, we'll continue to assess the environment and finalize our detailed operating plans for 2017. And as we always do, we'll provide our guidance for the coming year in January when we announce year-end earnings.
So in summary, while it's been a more difficult environment to generate top line growth this year, we are competing effectively and our market positions are in good shape. We're managing the company with financial discipline. And we continue to execute our Global Business Plan strategies for long-term success and shareholder return.
That wraps up our prepared remarks. And now, we'll begin to take your questions."

Okay. So first, I actually wanted to ask about was margin performance because you showed really good margin expansion in both consumer tissue and K-C Professional, even with volumes down.

So I'd say there's no question that there's less growth out there in lots of places. And so Latin America was certainly the case where categories are -- have gone negative in a big way due to some of the economic impacts in places like Argentina. And there is just as many people chasing that growth, and so that does make it more competitive.
On the other hand, you saw some pretty heavy up activity in some markets in the third quarter that probably won't repeat at the same level. There was some very heavy adult care couponing in North America, for example, by both of our primary competitors, think $14 digital coupons on a $13 item. But we don't see that reoccurring. It was probably more of a onetime thing. We also saw some pretty big Easy Ups couponing, more like a $5 coupon, which is way above normal in that market as they were launching a new product. And again, don't see that continuing at that level. And we didn't match those offers, but that doesn't affect your short-term volume while that stuff is working its way through the market."

That's gotten a little bit better sequentially. So we'll see how that plays out in the fourth quarter.
If you looked at consumer tissue, there was more of a promotion timing 2Q versus 3Q. If you looked at our year-to-date volume, we're up a couple of percent on consumer tissue in North America and expect to have a solid fourth quarter versus the negative trend in the third quarter.
So there's a number of things that were probably working against us in the third quarter that will make the comparison a little easier in the fourth quarter."

Yes, that and Brazil would be the other big market that's had kind of mid-single digit negative category growth comps. Those will be things that would be a bigger drag on that standpoint.

Implying constant currency, despite the top line decel, you're still posting pretty solid double-digit earnings growth. Assuming rates hold, FX abates next year, what are some of the offsets that would prevent you from kind of getting to that sort of constant currency growth rate, whether it be in sort of inflation, what you see on that front, clearly slower end markets, et cetera?

So it's -- and I would say if there was a all of the above on your -- as an option for your answer, I'd probably -- it's probably a little bit of all of those things, but let me go more category by category.
So femcare, for us, is doing really well. I think we're up 3 share points year-to-date of category leadership, have launched a bunch of innovation. And I'd say that business looks pretty solid overall. Diapers has been more competitive. The category has been weaker. There has been some trade down in the category as well as you've seen more Tier 2 growth. It's been more competitive. And so from a pricing standpoint, promotion standpoint, there's been more activity on that front as well.
And I think within that, you've seen some either as household inventory destocking or it's moms who were using 4 or 5 diapers a day now using 3 or 4 diapers a day. And so you take one diaper a day out of the equation, and that's a double-digit category decline for that consumer. And so I think it takes a little while to get household panel data to really understand what's driving that, but it's gone on for long enough now.
It's probably more than just inventory destocking where you're actually seeing the middle class, in some cases, in Brazil are getting poorer and having to make tough trade-offs. You would certainly see the same kind of phenomenon in Argentina as well as they're moving to more of a market-based economy. In some areas, that's putting a big pressure on consumer wallet.
So while we're still well-positioned and bullish long-term on Brazil, it's been a tough economic environment. You've had a recession for the second year in a row. Their overall outlook is not that optimistic. And economies run on expectations. And until people start to believe it's going to get better, it's not going to snap back probably."

In terms of the pricing, I think, again, that's a place where it's one of the fastest-growing markets in the world. And you're seeing lots of competitors chasing it. So the 2 Japanese competitors as well as P&G are all very aggressive. And probably it's one of those things, Caroline, where everyone thinks the other guy started the price war, but we're all trying to drive our business in that market.

Although in the categories declining, you do still have more competitive activity as everyone's trying to hang on to their share of the business. In China, it's more competitive activity. The categories are fine. The birthrate is fine in China, and you're seeing good underlying category growth on a unit volume standpoint. In North America, honestly, on a year-to-date basis, we're fine. We had a tougher third quarter. We had tougher comps, for sure, in a lot of areas because of some of the launch activity last year. But if I look at consumer tissue in North America, which had a negative comp, that had more to do with we had a little heavier promotional schedule in the second quarter. We had great volume growth than we did in the third quarter, where we went backwards. We're expecting to finish with a strong fourth quarter. And that business is on track from a share perspective. Europe -- Eastern Europe -- I'd say Western Europe and the U.K. was pretty weak overall economically. Some of the reactions to the Brexit vote, you had a lot of people who didn't want to hold inventory for a while and have fairly weak growth in both the consumer and the KCP side. Eastern Europe is essentially fine. It's competitive, about like normal. Categories are performing reasonably well. So it is more of a region-by-region assessment. You do have somewhat both factors in both places. But I don't know if that helps you understand it better, but that's probably how I would break it down for you."

In terms of CapEx, we do expect that we'll be below our original guidance that we gave coming into the year, but that is driven by a couple of things. First, we have had really strong productivity this year. And you see that showing up in our FORCE cost savings as one of the levers that we used to drive that. And we also do have slower volume and sales growth than we expected coming into the year. And so we're very rigorous on what we spend capital on and making sure that we're matching up the timing of when we're putting assets in the ground with our expectations. And with slower volume growth this year, our capital is lower than we expected. This is an area that we continue to drive. You know that we've set up a global supply chain organization last year. And that organization, partnering with a finance organization, and the operating teams are continuing to drive added rigor into our capital process. And so we're not changing our long-term expectation there, but we are incredibly rigorous on that. And we'll flex the CapEx spend with the needs of the business.

So more consumers have more money to spend in categories like ours, which helps. We're continuing to drive our city expansion. So we're in now 130 cities, where we started the year at 115. And so we've got more geography to cover as well, which is fueling our growth. And we continue to launch innovation. And so we've been driving some improved newborn products, and that has really helped drive a lot of our near-term volume growth. But we've also -- we're also driving diaper pants hard across a number of tiers, both mainline and premium tiers. And so I think there's -- a combination of those factors has really helped our volume growth this year."

I wondered if you could just talk a little bit more about the pricing environment in Chinese diaper. I know you have touched on it, but I seem to recall the second quarter stage, you talked about it being down about mid-teens year-on-year. I was just wondering if that was a sort of similar level in the third quarter. And also, I think in some other kind of infant channels, we've seen some destocking in the C2C channel. I just wondered if there were any signs of that there. And then moving on to tissue, really high level, but your comps in Q4 is a couple of points tougher than your comp in Q3, yet you're talking about an improvement despite that. Do you have any color you can give on for drivers of this a bit more? And whether you think there's a risk that lower input costs from pulp coming down?

On China pricing and -- broadly, I would say the market got a little bit more competitive in Q3 than Q2. And so again, you saw lots of innovation, lots of good global competitors trying to drive their business. And the Chinese consumer is the beneficiary of that, for sure. I wouldn't say we've seen any significant destocking impacts in any of our businesses. I mean, we have a pretty big e-comm presence in China, and that business tends to be relative -- for us, at least, relatively efficient low inventory, and it flows pretty directly to the consumer. So again, China, good-growing, competitive market. We're competing well, and we feel pretty good about our position there. On the tissue comps, I mean, again, it was a -- we had a weaker promotional calendar in the third quarter as it turned out and -- than we needed. And we expect to have a stronger quarter going into the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter is also typically a little bit better facial tissue quarter. So we'll see how cold and flu shapes up. And on the pulp question, at the levels of pulp change that we're seeing, I wouldn't expect that to have much impact on pricing."

I think it was Cottonelle and Huggies and Viva had a really good back half last year. So you have to lap it again, I think, this year. And then a couple of follow-ups. The fourth quarter guide to get to 2% is between, like, 1.5% organic and 5% organic. So if I heard you right, you kind of think it's going to be at the low end of that sort of 1.5% to 5%.

On the tissue growth, some of it is timing of promotions and when they shift. I think overall, we had a pretty good promotional calendar. On the other hand, we probably underestimated the impact of front of ad circular Olympic stuff and how much lift that would provide to primary competitors. So in some cases, we had a promotion; we just didn't get as much out of it as we thought we were going to get. And that obviously has lapped in a little -- expect a little stronger performance going into the fourth quarter. And so we feel pretty good about the lineup we've got, and -- but again, year-to-date, we feel like the tissue business in North America is at or ahead of its plan. So we're comfortable with what we're doing on that front. The fourth quarter comps, I mean, I -- essentially, I would say is that to get to the low end of our guidance, we only need to deliver one. And so to put that in perspective, I wouldn't say I was predicting that, and we'll see what it looks like when we post it in January. As you guys know, I'd rather give you guys annual guidance anyway. And this is the one quarter of the year where I have to give you quarterly guidance. Otherwise, I'd just rather talk about where we're going from an annual plan and not manage the business quarter to quarter.

Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were basically even year-on-year, including 3% growth in developing and emerging markets. We achieved significant cost savings and margin improvements and we increased cash flow, improved capital efficiency and returned cash to shareholders.
Now let's cover the details, starting with sales. Our third quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That's down about 3%,  including a currency drag of more than 2%. Tom will provide more color on our top line in just a few minutes.
On profitability, third quarter adjusted gross margins was 36.4%, up 30 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margins was 18.2%. That's up 70 basis points.
I'm encouraged that our teams continue to improve the shape of the P&L even in a tougher environment. Our cost savings initiatives continue to be a key driver of margin improvement.
Third quarter FORCE cost savings were $105 million, equal to our previous all-time record. Through 9 months, FORCE savings are $295 million. So we're tracking to be toward the high end of our $350 million to $400 million full year target. In addition, our Organization Restructuring generated $15 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities were favorable by $10 million, mostly due to lower fiber costs. Full year deflation should be toward the middle of our previous estimate of $25 million to $125 million.
On the bottom line, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.52, up 1% year-on-year. That's despite a currency drag of more than $0.10 per share, mostly from transaction effects.
Moving on to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was strong at $948 million. That's up 12% year-on-year, driven by improved working capital. Unadjusted return on invested capital through 9 months were up 100 basis points, nicely ahead of our long-term goal of 20 to 40 basis points of annual improvement.
On capital allocation, third quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $550 million. The full year amount should be approximately $2.1 billion.
Moving on to segment results. In personal care, organic sales rose more than 1%. That includes 4% growth in developing and emerging markets. Overall personal care operating margins were healthy at 19.8%, although off 70 basis points year-on-year, including significant currency headwinds.
Moving to consumer tissue. Organic sales fell 2%, driven by results in North America. Consumer tissue operating margins of 18.1% were up 110 basis points with benefits from cost savings and lower input costs.
In our third segment, K-C Professional, organic sales were down 1%. That included a 1 point impact from lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health. K-C Professional operating margins were 19.6%.  That's up 100 basis points year-on-year, driven by higher net selling prices and cost savings.
So overall, it was a soft quarter on the top line in a tough environment. Nonetheless, we delivered significant cost savings, improved our margins and increased cash flow. We also continued to improve our balance sheet efficiency and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways.
I'll now turn it over to Tom."

I'll share my perspectives on our third quarter results, and then I'll comment on our full year outlook.So starting with the third quarter, as Maria mentioned, our organic sales growth were about even year-on-y",901,"Thanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll share my perspectives on our third quarter results, and then I'll comment on our full year outlook.
So starting with the third quarter, as Maria mentioned, our organic sales growth were about even year-on-year and reflected a more challenging economic and competitive environment. Regardless of the reasons, I'm not satisfied with our top line results and I expect some improvement in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, I am broadly encouraged with our current market share positions. So we are holding up well in a challenging environment.
Let me give you some details about our third quarter sales and market conditions. In developing and emerging markets, organic sales were up 3%. That compares to a 5% growth in the second quarter as performance improved in China, but softened in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina.
In Brazil, organic sales in personal care fell about 5% year-on-year due to lower volumes. Results were impacted by competitive promotion activity and an even more difficult economic environment. We'll be launching more innovation in the next few quarters in Brazil while making sure we protect our brands appropriately.
In Argentina, while selling prices were up in the quarter, volumes were down low double-digits in a challenging consumer environment. Category volumes are declining at about the same rate as our volume decline and have worsened over the last 3 months.
Now, looking outside of Latin America. In Eastern Europe, organic sales in diapers increased 10% due to broad-based volume growth on Huggies across the region. In China, organic sales in diapers were up low single digits as strong volume growth was mostly offset by lower selling prices. Looking ahead in China, we expect our volume momentum will continue with benefits from innovation and healthy category demand. We also expect the promotion environment will remain competitive.
So overall, while organic growth in developing and emerging markets has moderated this year, that's mostly because of slower economic growth, which has resulted in weaker category dynamics. In most of our key businesses, our market positions are generally improving or holding steady.
I'm still very optimistic about our long-term growth prospects in developing and emerging markets because of the inherent category penetration opportunities that exist in this part of the world. Nonetheless, given the volatility in the current environment, it's difficult to predict when growth will pick back up significantly.
Turning to our North American consumer businesses. Consumer tissue volumes were down about 3%. The comparison included impacts from changes in the timing of promotional shipments and 6% growth in the year-ago period. Year-to-date, our volumes are up 2% on this business. That's a good indicator of our ongoing performance. In addition, our market shares in the third quarter are relatively stable sequentially. So we expect volume -- better volume performance going forward compared to the third quarter.
Personal care volumes in North America were up 1% compared to 10% growth last year. Child care volumes were up double-digits. They benefited from innovation and category growth. And baby wipes volumes were also up double-digits in the quarter. Volumes were off low single digits in diapers and mid-single digits in adult care. Both businesses had double-digit growth last year with increased promotion shipments and benefits from innovation.
Competitive promotion activity has also picked up somewhat recently, particularly in adult care. Our market shares in the third quarter were stable in diapers and down about 1 point in adult care.
In terms of overall market shares in North America, our positions remain healthy. Shares improved or were even with prior year levels in 7 of 8 consumer categories on a year-to-date basis and in 5 of 8 categories in the third quarter.
Now moving beyond sales, we continue to manage with financial discipline. As Maria highlighted, we delivered another quarter of strong performance on cost savings, margins, return on invested capital and cash generation and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. These results demonstrate the continued strength of our business.
Now moving on to our outlook. We remain optimistic about our long-term future. We'll continue to execute our innovation, marketing and targeted growth initiatives to grow our brands. We'll also continue to focus on improving the profitability and efficiency of our businesses.
In terms of our guidance for full year 2016, we expect organic sales growth of 2%. Our previous target was 3%. On the bottom line, we're targeting full year adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.95 to $6.05. Compared to our previous guidance, we've lowered the top end of the range by $0.10 per share to reflect our new organic sales estimate. Our earnings outlook represents year-on-year growth of 3% to 5%, which I believe is pretty solid performance in this environment.
Over the next 3 months, we'll continue to assess the environment and finalize our detailed operating plans for 2017. And as we always do, we'll provide our guidance for the coming year in January when we announce year-end earnings.
So in summary, while it's been a more difficult environment to generate top line growth this year, we are competing effectively and our market positions are in good shape. We're managing the company with financial discipline. And we continue to execute our Global Business Plan strategies for long-term success and shareholder return.
That wraps up our prepared remarks. And now, we'll begin to take your questions."

Okay. So first, I actually wanted to ask about was margin performance because you showed really good margin expansion in both consumer tissue and K-C Professional, even with volumes down.

So I'd say there's no question that there's less growth out there in lots of places. And so Latin America was certainly the case where categories are -- have gone negative in a big way due to some of the economic impacts in places like Argentina. And there's just as many people chasing that growth, and so that does make it more competitive.
On the other hand, you saw some pretty heavy up activity in some markets in the third quarter that probably won't repeat at the same level. There was some very heavy adult care couponing in North America, for example, by both of our primary competitors, think $14 digital coupons on a $13 item. But we don't see that reoccurring.

If you looked at consumer tissue, there was more of a promotion timing 2Q versus 3Q. If you look at our year-to-date volume, we're up a couple of percent on consumer tissue in North America and expect to have a solid fourth quarter versus the negative trend in the third quarter.

So it's -- and I would say if there was a all of the above on your -- as an option for your answer, I'd probably -- it's probably a little bit of all of those things, but let me go more category by category.
So femcare, for us, is doing really well. I think we're up 3 share points year-to-date of category leadership, have launched a bunch of innovation. And I'd say that business looks pretty solid overall. Diapers has been more competitive. The category has been weaker. There has been some trade down in the category as well as you've seen more Tier 2 growth. It's been more competitive. And so from a pricing standpoint, promotion standpoint, there's been more activity on that front as well.
And I think within that, you've seen some either as household inventory destocking or it's moms who were using 4 or 5 diapers a day, now using 3 or 4 diapers a day. And so you take one diaper a day out of the equation, and that's a double-digit category decline for that consumer. And so I think it takes a little while to get household panel data to really understand what's driving that, but it's gone on for long enough now.
It's probably more than just inventory destocking where you're actually seeing the middle class, in some cases, in Brazil are getting poorer and having to make tough trade-offs. You would certainly see the same kind of phenomenon in Argentina as well as they're moving to more of a market-based economy. In some areas, that's putting big pressure on consumer wallet.
So while we're still well-positioned and bullish long-term on Brazil, it's been a tough economic environment. You've had a recession for the second year in a row. Their overall outlook is not that optimistic. And economies run on expectations. And until people start to believe it's going to get better, it's not going to snap back probably."

In North America, honestly, on a year-to-date basis, we're fine. We had a tougher third quarter. We had tougher comps, for sure, in a lot of areas because of some of the launch activity last year. But if I looked at consumer tissue in North America, which had a negative comp, that had more to do with we had a little heavier promotional schedule in the second quarter. We had great volume growth than we did in the third quarter, where we went backwards. We're expecting to finish with a strong fourth quarter. And that business is on track from a share perspective. Europe -- Eastern Europe -- I'd say Western Europe and the U.K. was pretty weak overall economically.

And so while there's -- if maybe we're going through a tougher economic period of time, I do think in the long term, there's still lots of room for category penetration here."

And we had really good performance in working capital, particularly in reducing inventories, and that came through to help our cash flow numbers. In terms of CapEx, we do expect that we'll be below our original guidance that we gave coming into the year, but that is driven by a couple of things. First, we have had really strong productivity this year. And you see that showing up in our FORCE cost savings as one of the levers that we used to drive that. And we also do have slower volume and sales growth than we expected coming into the year. And so we're very rigorous on what we spend capital on and making sure that we're matching up the timing of when we're putting assets in the ground with our expectations. And with slower volume growth this year, our capital is lower than we expected. This is an area that we continue to drive. You know that we've set up a global supply chain organization last year. And that organization, partnering with a finance organization, and the operating teams are continuing to drive added rigor into our capital process. And so we're not changing our long-term expectation there, but we are incredibly rigorous on that. And we'll flex the CapEx spend with the needs of the business.

Let me start with the headlines for the quarter. Organic sales were basically even year-on-year, including 3% growth in developing and emerging markets. We achieved significant cost savings and margin improvements and we increased cash flow, improved capital efficiency and returned cash to shareholders.
Now let's cover the details, starting with sales. Our third quarter net sales were $4.6 billion. That's down about 3%,  including a currency drag of more than 2%. Tom will provide more color on our top line in just a few minutes.
On profitability, third quarter adjusted gross margins was 36.4%, up 30 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margins was 18.2%. That's up 70 basis points.
I'm encouraged that our teams continue to improve the shape of the P&L even in a tougher environment. Our cost savings initiatives continue to be a key driver of margin improvement.
Third quarter FORCE cost savings were $105 million, equal to our previous all-time record. Through 9 months, FORCE savings are $295 million. So we're tracking to be toward the high end of our $350 million to $400 million full year target. In addition, our Organization Restructuring generated $15 million of savings in the quarter. Commodities were favorable by $10 million, mostly due to lower fiber costs. Full year deflation should be toward the middle of our previous estimate of $25 million to $125 million.
On the bottom line, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.52, up 1% year-on-year. That's despite a currency drag of more than $0.10 per share, mostly from transaction effects.
Moving on to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations in the third quarter was strong at $948 million. That's up 12% year-on-year, driven by improved working capital. Unadjusted return on invested capital through 9 months were up 100 basis points, nicely ahead of our long-term goal of 20 to 40 basis points of annual improvement.
On capital allocation, third quarter dividend payments and share repurchases totaled more than $550 million. The full year amount should be approximately $2.1 billion.
Moving on to segment results. In personal care, organic sales rose more than 1%. That includes 4% growth in developing and emerging markets. Overall personal care operating margins were healthy at 19.8%, although off 70 basis points year-on-year, including significant currency headwinds.
Moving to consumer tissue. Organic sales fell 2%, driven by results in North America. Consumer tissue operating margins of 18.1% were up 110 basis points with benefits from cost savings and lower input costs.
In our third segment, K-C Professional, organic sales were down 1%. That included a 1 point impact from lower sales of nonwovens to Halyard Health. K-C Professional operating margins were 19.6%.  That's up 100 basis points year-on-year, driven by higher net selling prices and cost savings.
So overall, it was a soft quarter on the top line in a tough environment. Nonetheless, we delivered significant cost savings, improved our margins and increased cash flow. We also continued to improve our balance sheet efficiency and allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways.
I'll now turn it over to Tom."

I'll share my perspectives on our third quarter results, and then I'll comment on our full year outlook.
So starting with the third quarter, as Maria mentioned, our organic sales growth were about even year-on-year and reflected a more challenging economic and competitive environment. Regardless of the reasons, I'm not satisfied with our top line results and I expect some improvement in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, I am broadly encouraged with our current market share positions. So we are holding up well in a challenging environment.
Let me give you some details about our third quarter sales and market conditions. In developing and emerging markets, organic sales were up 3%. That compares to a 5% growth in the second quarter as performance improved in China, but softened in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina.
In Brazil, organic sales in personal care fell about 5% year-on-year due to lower volumes. Results were impacted by competitive promotion activity and an even more difficult economic environment. We'll be launching more innovation in the next few quarters in Brazil while making sure we protect our brands appropriately.
In Argentina, while selling prices were up in the quarter, volumes were down low double-digits in a challenging consumer environment. Category volumes are declining at about the same rate as our volume decline and have worsened over the last 3 months.
Now, looking outside of Latin America. In Eastern Europe, organic sales in diapers increased 10% due to broad-based volume growth on Huggies across the region. In China, organic sales in diapers were up low single digits as strong volume growth was mostly offset by lower selling prices. Looking ahead in China, we expect our volume momentum will continue with benefits from innovation and healthy category demand. We also expect the promotion environment will remain competitive.
So overall, while organic growth in developing and emerging markets has moderated this year, that's mostly because of slower economic growth, which has resulted in weaker category dynamics. In most of our key businesses, our market positions are generally improving or holding steady.
I'm still very optimistic about our long-term growth prospects in developing and emerging markets because of the inherent category penetration opportunities that exist in this part of the world. Nonetheless, given the volatility in the current environment, it's difficult to predict when growth will pick back up significantly.
Turning to our North American consumer businesses. Consumer tissue volumes were down about 3%. The comparison included impacts from changes in the timing of promotional shipments and 6% growth in the year-ago period. Year-to-date, our volumes are up 2% on this business. That's a good indicator of our ongoing performance. In addition, our market shares in the third quarter are relatively stable sequentially. So we expect volume -- better volume performance going forward compared to the third quarter.
Personal care volumes in North America were up 1% compared to 10% growth last year. Child care volumes were up double-digits. They benefited from innovation and category growth. And baby wipes volumes were also up double-digits in the quarter. Volumes were off low single digits in diapers and mid-single digits in adult care. Both businesses had double-digit growth last year with increased promotion shipments and benefits from innovation.
Competitive promotion activity has also picked up somewhat recently, particularly in adult care. Our market shares in the third quarter were stable in diapers and down about 1 point in adult care.
In terms of overall market shares in North America, our positions remain healthy. Shares improved or were even with prior year levels in 7 of 8 consumer categories on a year-to-date basis and in 5 of 8 categories in the third quarter.
Now moving beyond sales, we continue to manage with financial discipline. As Maria highlighted, we delivered another quarter of strong performance on cost savings, margins, return on invested capital and cash generation and we continue to allocate capital in shareholder-friendly ways. These results demonstrate the continued strength of our business.
Now moving on to our outlook. We remain optimistic about our long-term future. We'll continue to execute our innovation, marketing and targeted growth initiatives to grow our brands. We'll also continue to focus on improving the profitability and efficiency of our businesses.
In terms of our guidance for full year 2016, we expect organic sales growth of 2%. Our previous target was 3%. On the bottom line, we're targeting full year adjusted earnings per share in a range of $5.95 to $6.05. Compared to our previous guidance, we've lowered the top end of the range by $0.10 per share to reflect our new organic sales estimate. Our earnings outlook represents year-on-year growth of 3% to 5%, which I believe is pretty solid performance in this environment.
Over the next 3 months, we'll continue to assess the environment and finalize our detailed operating plans for 2017. And as we always do, we'll provide our guidance for the coming year in January when we announce year-end earnings.
So in summary, while it's been a more difficult environment to generate top line growth this year, we are competing effectively and our market positions are in good shape. We're managing the company with financial discipline. And we continue to execute our Global Business Plan strategies for long-term success and shareholder return.
That wraps up our prepared remarks. And now, we'll begin to take your questions."

Okay. So first, I actually wanted to ask about was margin performance because you showed really good margin expansion in both consumer tissue and K-C Professional, even with volumes down.

So I'd say there's no question that there's less growth out there in lots of places. And so Latin America was certainly the case where categories are -- have gone negative in a big way due to some of the economic impacts in places like Argentina. And there's just as many people chasing that growth, and so that does make it more competitive.
On the other hand, you saw some pretty heavy up activity in some markets in the third quarter that probably won't repeat at the same level. There was some very heavy adult care couponing in North America, for example, by both of our primary competitors, think $14 digital coupons on a $13 item. But we don't see that reoccurring. It was probably more of a onetime thing. We also saw some pretty big Easy Ups couponing, more like a $5 coupon, which is way above normal in that market as they were launching a new product. And again, don't see that continuing at that level. And we didn't match those offers, but that does affect your short-term volume while that stuff is working its way through the market."

That's gotten a little bit better sequentially. So we'll see how that plays out in the fourth quarter.
If you looked at consumer tissue, there was more of a promotion timing 2Q versus 3Q. If you look at our year-to-date volume, we're up a couple of percent on consumer tissue in North America and expect to have a solid fourth quarter versus the negative trend in the third quarter.
So there's a number of things that were probably working against us in the third quarter that will make the comparison a little easier in the fourth quarter."

It sounds like, year-to-date, I think FX all-ins have been about a 12% headwind. Assuming sort of flatline in the fourth quarter, you're looking at sort of a maybe 9 point drag to EPS this year. Implying constant currency, despite the top line decel, you're still posting pretty solid double-digit earnings growth. Assuming rates hold, FX abates next year, what are some of the offsets that would prevent you from kind of getting to that sort of constant currency growth rate, whether it be in sort of inflation, what you see on that front, clearly slower end markets, et cetera?

So it's -- and I would say if there was a all of the above on your -- as an option for your answer, I'd probably -- it's probably a little bit of all of those things, but let me go more category by category.
So femcare, for us, is doing really well. I think we're up 3 share points year-to-date of category leadership, have launched a bunch of innovation. And I'd say that business looks pretty solid overall. Diapers has been more competitive. The category has been weaker. There has been some trade down in the category as well as you've seen more Tier 2 growth. It's been more competitive. And so from a pricing standpoint, promotion standpoint, there's been more activity on that front as well.
And I think within that, you've seen some either as household inventory destocking or it's moms who were using 4 or 5 diapers a day, now using 3 or 4 diapers a day. And so you take one diaper a day out of the equation, and that's a double-digit category decline for that consumer. And so I think it takes a little while to get household panel data to really understand what's driving that, but it's gone on for long enough now.
It's probably more than just inventory destocking where you're actually seeing the middle class, in some cases, in Brazil are getting poorer and having to make tough trade-offs. You would certainly see the same kind of phenomenon in Argentina as well as they're moving to more of a market-based economy. In some areas, that's putting big pressure on consumer wallet.
So while we're still well-positioned and bullish long-term on Brazil, it's been a tough economic environment. You've had a recession for the second year in a row. Their overall outlook is not that optimistic. And economies run on expectations. And until people start to believe it's going to get better, it's not going to snap back probably."

The categories are fine. The birthrate is fine in China, and you're seeing good underlying category growth on a unit volume standpoint. In North America, honestly, on a year-to-date basis, we're fine. We had a tougher third quarter. We had tougher comps, for sure, in a lot of areas because of some of the launch activity last year. But if I looked at consumer tissue in North America, which had a negative comp, that had more to do with we had a little heavier promotional schedule in the second quarter. We had great volume growth than we did in the third quarter, where we went backwards. We're expecting to finish with a strong fourth quarter. And that business is on track from a share perspective. Europe -- Eastern Europe -- I'd say Western Europe and the U.K. was pretty weak overall economically. Some of the reactions to the Brexit vote, you had a lot of people who didn't want to hold inventory for a while and have fairly weak growth in both the consumer and the KCP side. Eastern Europe is essentially fine. It's competitive, about like normal. Categories are performing reasonably well. So it is more of a region-by-region assessment. You do have somewhat both factors in both places. But I don't know if that helps you understand it better, but that's probably how I would break it down for you."

And does that signal anything about your expectations for structural growth? Because I think in prior periods, it probably did."

We did have really strong cash flow in the quarter, as you saw. And we had really good performance in working capital, particularly in reducing inventories, and that came through to help our cash flow numbers. In terms of CapEx, we do expect that we'll be below our original guidance that we gave coming into the year, but that is driven by a couple of things. First, we have had really strong productivity this year. And you see that showing up in our FORCE cost savings as one of the levers that we used to drive that. And we also do have slower volume and sales growth than we expected coming into the year. And so we're very rigorous on what we spend capital on and making sure that we're matching up the timing of when we're putting assets in the ground with our expectations. And with slower volume growth this year, our capital is lower than we expected. This is an area that we continue to drive. You know that we've set up a global supply chain organization last year. And that organization, partnering with a finance organization, and the operating teams are continuing to drive added rigor into our capital process. And so we're not changing our long-term expectation there, but we are incredibly rigorous on that. And we'll flex the CapEx spend with the needs of the business. I wouldn't take it as a signal for anything else, other than just where we are as a company this year."

How much maybe was that driven by the -- just overall category demand as opposed to innovation? And then more broadly, with regard to innovations across the categories that you compete in, I guess, in light of the tough macro backdrop as well as intense competitive activity, do you see your innovation skewing either more to the premium or the value end? Or has that not really shifted in light of what's going on?"

And it could be as much as 7% more live births in 2016 than there was in 2015. You're still seeing GDP per capita go up in China. So more consumers have more money to spend in categories like ours, which helps. We're continuing to drive our city expansion. So we're in now 130 cities, where we started the year at 115. And so we've got more geography to cover as well, which is fueling our growth. And we continue to launch innovation. And so we've been driving some improved newborn products, and that has really helped drive a lot of our near-term volume growth. But we've also -- we're also driving diaper pants hard across a number of tiers, both mainline and premium tiers. And so I think there's -- a combination of those factors has really helped our volume growth this year."

I wondered if you could just talk a little bit more about the pricing environment in Chinese diaper. I know you have touched on it, but I seem to recall that the second quarter stage, you talked about it being down about mid-teens year-on-year. I was just wondering if that was a sort of similar level in the third quarter. And also, I think in some other kind of infant channels, we've seen some destocking in the C2C channel. I just wondered if there were any signs of that there. And then moving on to tissue, really high level, but your comps in Q4 is a couple of points tougher than your comp in Q3, yet you're talking about an improvement despite that. Any color you can give on for drivers of this a bit more? And whether you think there's a risk that lower input costs from pulp coming down does translate into a tougher pricing environment, would be great."

On China pricing and -- broadly, I would say the market got a little bit more competitive in Q3 than Q2. And so again, you saw lots of innovation, lots of good global competitors trying to drive their business. And the Chinese consumer is the beneficiary of that, for sure. I wouldn't say we've seen any significant destocking impacts in any of our businesses. I mean, we have a pretty big e-comm presence in China, and that business tends to be relative -- for us, at least, relatively efficient low inventory, and it flows pretty directly to the consumer. So again, China, good-growing, competitive market. We're competing well, and we feel pretty good about our position there. On the tissue comps, I mean, again, it was a -- we had a weaker promotional calendar in the third quarter as it turned out and -- than we needed. And we expect to have a stronger quarter going into the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter is also typically a little bit better facial tissue quarter. So we'll see how cold and flu shapes up. And on the pulp question, at the levels of pulp change that we're seeing, I wouldn't expect that to have much impact on pricing."

Because it seems that you probably are planning on some promotions in the back half of the year, and they didn't come through. So how does that happen? I guess, is the first question. I think it was Cottonelle and Huggies and Viva had a really good back half last year. So you have to lap it again, I think, this year. And then a couple of follow-ups. The fourth quarter guide to get to 2% is between, like, 1.5% organic and 5% organic. So if I heard you right, you kind of think it's going to be at the low end of that sort of 1.5% to 5%. Is that fair? And then the last one is just on the SG&A leverage, which was great. Can you just talk about what's driving the SG&A growing substantially lower than sales and how sustainable that is?"

On the tissue growth, some of it is timing of promotions and when they shift. I think overall, we had a pretty good promotional calendar. On the other hand, we probably underestimated the impact of front of ad circular Olympic stuff and how much lift that would provide to primary competitors. So in some cases, we had the promotion; we just didn't get as much out of it as we thought we were going to get. And that obviously has lapped in a little -- expect a little stronger performance going into the fourth quarter. And so we feel pretty good about the lineup we've got, and -- but again, year-to-date, we feel like the tissue business in North America is at or ahead of its plan. So we're comfortable with what we're doing on that front. The fourth quarter comps, I mean, I essentially would say, is that to get to the low end of our guidance, we only need to deliver one. And so to put that in perspective, I wouldn't say I was predicting that, and we'll see what it looks like when we post it in January. As you guys know, I'd rather give you guys annual guidance anyway. And this is the one quarter of the year where I have to give you quarterly guidance. Otherwise, I'd just rather talk about where we're going from an annual plan and not manage the business quarter to quarter.
