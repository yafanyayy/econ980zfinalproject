So let's begin with highlights on",1361,"Okay. Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everybody, thanks for joining us. Before Mark gets into our financial results, I'd like to provide some color on the fourth quarter and 2015 full year as well as our outlook for 2016. 
So let's begin with highlights on Slide 5. In summary, we had another good quarter, which was a really nice finish to a challenging year in which we had very strong operating performance. Organic revenue growth was a rolloff 11% for the quarter and 6% for the full year, driven by just under 20% growth in China and roughly 30% growth in our Electrical Architecture and Electronic and Safety segments during the quarter. Operating income totaled a record $503 million, that was above our guidance. However, operating margins lagged the prior year, primarily the result of the sequential whipsaw in China volumes. You probably recall that in response to the third quarter slowdown in China, we actually reduced headcount by about 4,000 employees and then had to add back over 6,000 employees to meet the 40% sequential increase in volumes that we experienced in the fourth quarter. While growth over market inflected in the quarter due to nuance activity, our outlook and our performance also reflected higher manufacturing costs as a result of this increased launched activity. So to put it in perspective, operating team did an outstanding job executing on a record 75 major new program launches during the quarter and roughly 150 for the full year. 
Lastly, Mark will take you through the details, but FX was a bigger impact to margins in the quarter, especially at our E&S segment. For the full year, operating income totaled almost $2 billion, representing a 60-basis-point increase in operating margins. New business bookings exceeded 2014 levels, reaching a record $26 billion. And during the year, we further optimized our manufacturing footprint, improving the flexibility of our cost structure and we generated $1.7 billion of cash flow from operations and returned roughly $1.5 billion to shareholders through each share repurchases and dividends throughout the year while at the same time making significant progress realigning our product portfolio through accretive acquisitions and investments that strengthen our competitive position while exiting businesses that did not fit with our strategic and our financial objectives. 
Slide 6 covers 2015 new business bookings in more detail, which as I mentioned, totaled over $26 billion a year, we actually totaled over $4 billion for the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we had a number of important customer bookings as well as several conquest wins, including a GDi win with a major North American customer, Electrical Architecture work with both Toyota and PSA and the Second Wave Multi-domain Controller Award for the European OE. We continue to be successful retaining replacement business with our existing customers as reflected by our win rate on incumbent business of almost 90%. The right side of the chart reflects the balanced geographic mix of our bookings, which will drive strong revenue growth over the next few years. And as important, the increased geographic and customer diversity ensures that we're not dependent on any one region, segment or customer for growth. Given our focus on innovation, our portfolio of safe, green and connected technology solutions and our track record of flaw of execution, we continue to be an important strategic partners for our customers. 
Slide 7 outlines the view of the macro environment in 2016. Beginning with our view of the tailwinds on the left. Regulatory trends and consumer demands continue to influence fuel economy, a mission of vehicle safety standards, driving content for vehicle growth. As a result, we see strong demand for our safe, green and connected technologies. We continue to expect solid growth in global vehicle production, primarily driven by strong growth in China, North America and Western Europe. As you sit here today, we do not expect foreign exchange rates to be as significant as a headwind as they were in 2015. Additionally, customer price downs remain relatively stable. However, we are anticipating some headwinds as detailed on the right side of the slide, including continued softness in vehicle production of both South America and in Eastern Europe and ongoing weakness in the global commercial vehicle market. As such, we will continue to aggressively optimize our cost structure. The flexibility of our cost structure and ability to execute in a challenging macro environment gives us confidence we'll continue to deliver on both our short as well as our long-term financial commitments. 
Turning to Slide 8. Our strong bookings growth has led to a significant increase in major program launches, which in turn has accelerated revenue growth across each of our segments. To put this into perspective, major launches were up fivefold in the fourth quarter of 2015 and twofold for the 4 year -- for the full year revenue [ph]. We expect that trend to continue as launches more than doubled in the first quarter of 2016. These major launches require additional manufacturing resources as we trend to normalized run rates over the next couple of quarters, which translates into a steady increase of margins over the course of the year and we remain on track to deliver both 2016 and 2017 margin targets. 
Turning to Slide 9. Last month, we made our 20th appearance at the Consumer Electronics Show, which seemed to have a larger automotive presence each year. CES is a fantastic venue to showcase a few of our advanced technologies will create a safer, more connected vehicle and ultimately drive significant revenue and earnings growth. Our customers, our suppliers and investors had a chance to travel the Streets of Vegas in our 2 automated vehicles and experience firsthand some of our newer V2 Everything [ph] technologies. We returned from the show optimistic about the tremendous opportunities and extra safety, automated driving and vehicle conductivity, which is further validated by roughly 1.2 billion of active safety and 2 billion of infotainment bookings during 2015. And lastly, we're encouraged by the outlook for vehicle electrification. We're seeing accelerated quote activity and revenue growth, driven by this success of the hybrid vehicle technologies like 48-volt [ph] where content is more than 4 times our standard Powertrain content. 
Our capital allocation strategy outlined on Slide 10 remains an important leverage to enhance shareholder value. We expect CapEx to total roughly $800 million in 2016, supporting new program launches in North America, Europe and China, investments and information systems increased efficiency and productivity and supporting our ongoing footprint rotation to best stuff countries. We also believe in attractive dividend is another means of enhancing shareholder returns. As a reflection of our confidence in our underlying business, last month, we increased our dividend 16% to $1.16 per share, representing a dividend yield of 1.9%. And lastly, we remain focused on executing value enhancing portfolio modifications. As such, we intend to deploy roughly half of our operating cash flow for the value accretive strategic acquisitions and investments as well as share repurchases. On the M&A front, we hope to acquire and make investments and businesses and the technologies that further strengthen our competitive position, drive profitable growth and are accretive to shareholder value. To the extent we have access cash, we have a track record of returning it to shareholders via share repurchases as evidenced by the roughly $1.2 billion share repurchases we did last year. Our current 2016 guidance assumes $400 million of share repurchases. However, we have the flexibility to take advantage of dislocations in the market to ramp up the pace of our repurchase activity. 
As shown on Slide 11, we believe we are well positioned to deliver shareholder value in 2016. We will continue to optimize our cost structure by rotating our footprint to best cost countries, increase the flexibility of our workforce, optimize our regional service model and further integrate the Enterprise Operating System to ensure flawless execution although organically and through acquisitions, investing in safe, green and connected technologies that address our customers challenges and drive accelerated revenue growth, margin expansion and enhanced returns. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mark for more detailed look at our financial results. Mark?"

I'll begin by covering our fourth quarter and full year 2015 performance and then discuss our 2016 guidance. 
Consistent with prior calls, today's review of our actual and forecasted financials exclude restructuring and other special items and will address the continuing operations of Delphi. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP is included at the back of this presentation and the press release. 
Let me start on Slide 13 with a snapshot of our fourth quarter financial performance. As Kevin mentioned, we were pleased with our quarter results, which reflected robust revenue growth and record earnings. Revenue was up 3% or 11% adjusted for currency and commodity effects. Operating income grew 1% or 12%, excluding currency. Operating margin was down 20 basis points from prior year, including a negative 40 basis point impact from foreign currency and the sale of the Reception Systems business. Additionally, as Kevin mentioned, our margin rate for the quarter was impacted by the 40% sequential increase in China volumes as well as higher manufacturing and engineering spend to support major new growth program launches across all segments. Earnings per share grew 7%. However, adjusting for the effects of currency and commodity, EPS grew 19%. 
Slide 14 provides greater detail on revenue in the quarter. As you can see, currency and commodity effects were significant headwinds. However, organic growth was very strong at 11% and 8% over market, delivering on our growth outlook from early 2015. Regionally, Europe and Asia were exceptionally strong at 8 and 10 points over market, respectively. North America remained solid at 7% and 5 points over market. So our business performed better than the market in South America. The underlying market there remains weak. 
Turning to profit. Slide 15 walks the fourth quarter year-over-year change in operating income, highlighting the previously mentioned foreign exchange effects. The cost impact of the China volume recovery as well as the investment to support new program launches is captured in that performance. These items are expected to remain a headwind to our normal margin flow through in the first half of 2016 and accordingly, were included in our previously communicated guidance. We are confident in our ability to expand overall margins by roughly 50 basis points in 2016. 
Moving to Slide 16. Let's look at the performance by segment. With sales growth and operating performance, Electrical Architecture and Powertrain expanded margins 60 basis points year-over-year despite additional cost resulting from the sharp recovery in China volumes. As expected, Electronics and Safety growth accelerated in the quarter on new program launches. The reported E&S margin rate of 10.4% was negatively impacted 260 basis points by unfavorable foreign exchange, the impact of the Reception Systems divestiture and prior-year nonrecurring items. When adjusted for these items, E&S margins for the quarter were down 100 basis points on costs associated with support of new program launches. As it relates to 2016, we expect continued strong growth from launches. Margins will expand over the course of the year with lower volume flow-through in the first half. 
Turning to Slide 17. Increased earnings and lower share count drove EPS growth at 7% for the period. Excluding the effects of currency and commodities, earnings per share grew 19%. Taxes came in as expected in the quarter at 14% on an adjusted basis, 16% adjusted for the year. On a year-over-year basis, we were favorable by $0.01. However, that was offset by higher minority interest and versus our guidance [indiscernible] financing, which we completed in the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 18. Our full year results, we delivered record earnings in a challenging macro environment. In 2015, our results included unfavorable currency and commodity effects of $1.3 billion on revenue and $178 million on operating income. Organically, revenue was up 6% with our growth over market increasing through the year. Despite the previously mentioned headwinds, in 2015, we delivered more operating income, expanded margins 60 basis points and grew earnings per share 16%, excluding currency and commodities. 
Looking at this segment on Slide 19, we delivered solid growth across all segments with growth over market strengthening through the year. Our overall margin expansion came in as expected, and going forward, we project margin expansion to continue in line with our guidance and longer term financial targets. 
Turning to 2016. Slide 20 highlights our full year guidance assumptions. No change from last month. We expect growth in global vehicle production of roughly 2%, reflecting 3% growth in North America, growth in Europe of 2%, a 4% increase in China and a decline in South America of 10%. Our 2016 guidance maintains $1.10 Euro rate. 
On Slide 21, we reaffirm our 2016 guidance. Revenue is driven by accelerating organic growth and a full year effect of the HellermannTyton acquisition. Operating income growth for the year is 14% at the midpoint, expanding margins roughly 50 basis points. 2016 EPS is expected to be in the range of 5 80 to 6 10. No change from our prior outlook. We forecast first quarter revenue growth of 5% to 8% adjusted with margins up slightly versus the prior year at midpoint. And we expect first quarter EPS in the range of 1 28 to 1 38, up 10% at the midpoint. As Kevin mentioned, our guidance assumes 400 million of share buybacks in the year. We intend to be opportunistic while remaining committed to executing a balanced and disciplined capital allocation framework. 
In summary, Delphi overcame a number of headwinds and still delivered a great year. Our 2016 outlook is balanced and reflects our continued ability to adjust to changing market conditions. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin for some final thoughts before Q&A."

Now summarizing on Slide 22. 2015 was a record year, as Mark just said. Once again, we demonstrate our ability to deliver on our commitments even against the backdrop of a more challenging and volatile environment. While capital markets are reflecting uncertainty in the underlying macro conditions, we aren't seeing anything today that would change our assessment of the market or the guidance that we provided last month. And while we're counting on a slight lift from global production in the year, if you look at the numbers, the bulk of our growth is driven by our planned new launches and increased content opportunities. Now having said that, we continue to actively monitor the dynamics in the industry and plan our investments prudently. In the event conditions deteriorate, we've demonstrated several times the ability to respond quickly and surgically. The European slowdown in 2012 as an example where revenues declined 6% and our operating margins actually increased by 50 basis points and the China slowdown in the third quarter of 2015 where revenues actually declined $175 million, but we're able to offset that revenue shortfall with the productivity initiatives. Those are a few of these examples. We continue to increase our flexibility and reduce our operating cost to ensure that we're positioned to mitigate unplanned headwinds. Further, our strategy for value creation remains intact. We're supporting growth where we see opportunities and we remain disciplined in our allocation of capital. We continue to execute on the relevant breakthrough technologies that are driving incremental growth and margin expansion in 2016 and beyond, enabling us to outperform over the long term. You can expect to see and hear more about these innovations in our long-term road map at our Investor Day coming up in London on April 13. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions."

As well as foreign exchange as well as a onetime item in the fourth quarter of last year. And I think those amounts total roughly 250 to 260 basis points. The balance relates really to launch activity, launch activity, the significant ramp-up of launch activity that's reflecting the underlying growth rate at E&S. As you roll out for the full year, both the E&S as well as for Delphi in total, you're going to continue to see some ongoing costs related to the China inefficiencies as well as ramp costs into Q1, although at a much lower rate than what we have in the fourth quarter and then continue to dissipate [ph] through Q2 and be largely gone in Q3 and Q4.

We've seen no shifting in schedules from a Powertrain, quite frankly, or any of our other businesses. We've seen absolutely none. With respect to the growth rate of the Powertrain business, in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of this year, Powertrain segment growth will be a bit slower primarily the result of a challenging comp in our aftermarket business. So if you remember, Bryan, last year, we launched a major program with a U.S. independent aftermarket retailer that had very strong revenue. So that affects the year-over-year comp in the Powertrain segment. So that's one. Two, what you will see is consistent in reality with the balance of our businesses. Based on the timing of the ramp-up of all these launches, growth is going to be stronger in the second half of the calendar year than it is in the first half of the calendar year, consistent with the margin explanation that Mark talked about. So we're still very optimistic about the Powertrain segment. The other thing to underscore though, is we talked about it in the past and I mentioned it again in my comments, we're starting to see more demand more of a ramp up in vehicle electrification, including things like 48-volt. Those are very good for us. So 48-volt high-grade content is 4 to 5x content that we have on a traditional car, full ED [ph] is 7x the content. 48-volt is an area that, quite frankly, product that we'll be talking more with [indiscernible] about at our Investor Conference in April.

Good morning, everybody, thanks for joining us. Before Mark gets into our financial results, I'd like to provide some color on the fourth quarter and 2015 full year, as well as our outlook for 2016.  So let's begin with highlights on",1359,"Okay. Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everybody, thanks for joining us. Before Mark gets into our financial results, I'd like to provide some color on the fourth quarter and 2015 full year, as well as our outlook for 2016.  So let's begin with highlights on Slide 5. 
In summary, we had another good quarter, which was a really nice finish to a challenging year in which we had very strong operating performance. Organic revenue growth was a rolloff of 11% for the quarter and 6% for the full year, driven by just under 20% growth in China and roughly 13%  growth in our Electrical Architecture and Electronic and Safety segments during the quarter. Operating income totaled a record $503 million, that was above our guidance. However, operating margins lagged the prior year, primarily the result of the sequential whipsaw in China volumes. You probably recall that in response to the third quarter slowdown in China, we actually reduced headcount by about 4,000 employees and then had to add back over 6,000 employees to meet the 40% sequential increase in volumes that we experienced in the fourth quarter. While growth over market inflected in the quarter due to new launch activity, our outlook and our performance also reflected higher manufacturing costs as a result of this increased launch activity. So to put it in perspective, our operating team did an outstanding job executing on a record 75 major new program launches during the quarter and roughly 150 for the full year. 
Lastly, Mark will take you through the details, but FX was a bigger impact to margins in the quarter, especially at our E&S segment. For the full year, operating income totaled almost $2 billion, representing a 60-basis-point increase in operating margins. New business bookings exceeded 2014 levels, reaching a record $26 billion. And during the year, we further optimized our manufacturing footprint, improving the flexibility of our cost structure and we generated $1.7 billion of cash flow from operations and returned roughly $1.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends throughout the year while at the same time making significant progress realigning our product portfolio through accretive acquisitions and investments that strengthen our competitive position while exiting businesses that did not fit with our strategic and our financial objectives. 
Slide 6 covers 2015 new business bookings in more detail, which as I mentioned, totaled over $26 billion a year. We actually totaled over $4 billion for the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we had a number of important customer bookings as well as several conquest wins, including a GDi win with a major North American customer, Electrical Architecture award with both Toyota and PSA and a second wave multi-domain controller award with a European OE. We continue to be successful retaining replacement business with our existing customers as reflected by our win rate on incumbent business of almost 90%. 
The right side of the chart reflects the balanced geographic mix of our bookings, which will drive strong revenue growth over the next few years. And as important, the increased geographic and customer diversity ensures that we're not dependent on any one region, segment or customer for growth. Given our focus on innovation, our portfolio of safe, green and connected technology solutions and our track record of flaw of execution, we continue to be an important strategic partner for our customers. 
Slide 7 outlines the view of the macro environment in 2016, beginning with our view of the tailwinds on the left. Regulatory trends and consumer demands continue to influence fuel economy, emissions in the vehicle safety standards, driving content per vehicle growth. As a result, we see strong demand for our safe, green and connected technologies. We continue to expect solid growth in global vehicle production, primarily driven by strong growth in China, North America and Western Europe. As we sit here today, we do not expect foreign exchange rates to be as significant of a headwind as they were in 2015. Additionally, customer price downs remain relatively stable. However, we are anticipating some headwinds, as detailed on the right side of the slide, including continued softness in vehicle production in both South America and in Eastern Europe and ongoing weakness in the global commercial vehicle market. As such, we will continue to aggressively optimize our cost structure. The flexibility of our cost structure and ability to execute in a challenging macro environment gives us confidence we'll continue to deliver on both our short, as well as our long-term financial commitments. 
Turning to Slide 8. Our strong bookings growth has led to a significant increase in major program launches, which in turn has accelerated revenue growth across each of our segments. To put this into perspective, major launches were up fivefold in the fourth quarter of 2015 and twofold for the 4 year -- for the full year,  rather. We expect that trend to continue as launches more than doubled in the first quarter of 2016. These major launches require additional manufacturing resources as we trend to normalized run rates over the next couple of quarters, which translates into a steady increase in margins over the course of the year and we remain on track to deliver both 2016 and 2017 margin targets. 
Turning to Slide 9. Last month, we made our 20th appearance at the Consumer Electronics Show, which seems to have a larger automotive presence each year. CES is a fantastic venue to showcase a few of our advanced technologies that will create a safer, more connected vehicle and ultimately drive significant revenue and earnings growth. Our customers, our suppliers and investors had a chance to travel the streets of Vegas in our 2 automated vehicles and experience firsthand some of our newer V2 Everything technologies. We returned from the show optimistic about the tremendous opportunities in active safety, automated driving and vehicle connectivity, which is further validated by roughly 1.2 billion of active safety and 2 billion of infotainment bookings during 2015. And lastly, we're encouraged by the outlook for vehicle electrification. We're seeing accelerated quote activity and revenue growth, driven by the success of the hybrid vehicle technologies like 48-Volt where content is more than 4 times our standard Powertrain content. 
Our capital allocation strategy outlined on Slide 10 remains an important leverage to enhance shareholder value. We expect CapEx to total roughly $800 million in 2016, supporting new program launches in North America, Europe and China, investments in information systems and increased efficiency and productivity and supporting our ongoing footprint rotation to best cost countries. We also believe an attractive dividend is another means of enhancing shareholder returns. As a reflection of our confidence in our underlying business, last month, we increased our dividend 16% to $1.16 per share, representing a dividend yield of 1.9%. And lastly, we remain focused on executing value enhancing portfolio modifications. As such, we intend to deploy roughly half of our operating cash flow for value-accretive strategic acquisitions and investments, as well as share repurchases. On the M&A front, we hope to acquire and make investments and businesses in technologies that further strengthen our competitive position, drive profitable growth and are accretive to shareholder value. To the extent we have excess cash, we have a track record of returning it to shareholders via share repurchases, as evidenced by the roughly $1.2 billion in repurchases we did last year. Our current 2016 guidance assumes $400 million of share repurchases. However, we have the flexibility to take advantage of dislocations in the market to ramp up the pace of our repurchase activity. 
As shown on Slide 11, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver shareholder value in 2016. We will continue to optimize our cost structure by rotating our footprint to best cost countries, increase the flexibility of our workforce, optimize our regional service model and further integrate the Enterprise Operating System to ensure flawless execution both organically and through acquisitions, investing in safe, green and connected technologies that address our customers' challenges and drive accelerated revenue growth, margin expansion and enhanced returns. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mark for a more detailed look at our financial results. Mark?"

I'll begin by covering our fourth quarter and full year 2015 performance and then discuss our 2016 guidance. 
Consistent with prior calls, today's review of our actual and forecasted financials excludes restructuring and other special items and will address the continuing operations of Delphi. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP is included at the back of this presentation and the press release. 
Let me start on Slide 13 with a snapshot of our fourth quarter financial performance. As Kevin mentioned, we were pleased with our quarter results, which reflected robust revenue growth and record earnings. Revenue was up 3% or 11% adjusted for currency and commodity effects. Operating income grew 1%, or 12% excluding currency. Operating margin was down 20 basis points from prior year, including a negative 40 basis point impact from foreign currency and the sale of the reception systems business. Additionally, as Kevin mentioned, our margin rate for the quarter was impacted by the 40% sequential increase in China volumes, as well as higher manufacturing and engineering spend to support major new growth program launches across all segments. Earnings per share grew 7%. However, adjusting for the effects of currency and commodity, EPS grew 19%. 
Slide 14 provides greater detail on revenue in the quarter. As you can see, currency and commodity effects were significant headwinds. However, organic growth was very strong at 11% and 8% over market, delivering on our growth outlook from early 2015. Regionally, Europe and Asia were exceptionally strong at 8 and 10 points over market, respectively. North America remained solid at 7% and 5 points over market. Though our business performed better than the market in South America, the underlying market there remains weak. 
Turning to profit. Slide 15 walks the fourth quarter year-over-year change in operating income, highlighting the previously mentioned foreign exchange effects. The cost impact of the China volume recovery, as well as the investment to support new program launches, is captured in that performance. These items are expected to remain a headwind to our normal margin flow through in the first half of 2016, and accordingly, were included in our previously communicated guidance. We are confident in our ability to expand overall margins by roughly 50 basis points in 2016. 
Moving to Slide 16. Let's look at the performance by segment. With sales growth and operating performance, Electrical Architecture and Powertrain expanded margins 60 basis points year-over-year despite additional cost resulting from the sharp recovery in China volumes. As expected, Electronics and Safety growth accelerated in the quarter on new program launches. The reported E&S margin rate of 10.4% was negatively impacted 260 basis points by unfavorable foreign exchange, the impact of the reception systems divestiture and prior-year nonrecurring items. When adjusted for these items, E&S margins for the quarter were down 100 basis points on costs associated with support of new program launches. As it relates to 2016, we expect continued strong growth from launches. Margins will expand over the course of the year with lower volume flow-through in the first half. 
Turning to Slide 17. Increased earnings and lower share count drove EPS growth at 7% for the period. Excluding the effects of currency and commodities, earnings per share grew 19%. Taxes came in as expected in the quarter at 14% on an adjusted basis, 16% adjusted for the year. On a year-over-year basis, we were favorable by $0.01. However, that was offset by higher minority interest and versus our guidance, HellermannTyton financing, which we completed in the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 18, our full year results, we delivered record earnings in a challenging macro environment. In 2015, our results included unfavorable currency and commodity effects of $1.3 billion on revenue and $178 million on operating income. Organically, revenue was up 6% with our growth over market increasing through the year. Despite the previously mentioned headwinds, in 2015, we delivered more operating income, expanded margins 60 basis points and grew earnings per share 16%, excluding currency and commodities. 
Looking at the segments on Slide 19, we delivered solid growth across all segments, with growth over market strengthening through the year. Our overall margin expansion came in as expected, and going forward, we project margin expansion to continue in line with our guidance and longer-term financial targets. 
Turning to 2016. Slide 20 highlights our full year guidance assumptions. No change from last month. We expect growth in global vehicle production of roughly 2%, reflecting 3% growth in North America, growth in Europe of 2%, a 4% increase in China and a decline in South America of 10%. Our 2016 guidance maintains $1.10 euro rate. 
On Slide 21, we reaffirm our 2016 guidance. Revenue is driven by accelerating organic growth and the full year effect of the HellermannTyton acquisition. Operating income growth for the year is 14% at the midpoint, expanding margins roughly 50 basis points. 2016 EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.80 to $6.10., No change from our prior outlook. We forecast first quarter revenue growth of 5% to 8% adjusted, with margins up slightly versus the prior year at midpoint. And we expect first quarter EPS in the range of $1.28 to $1.38, up 10% at the midpoint. As Kevin mentioned, our guidance assumes 400 million of share buybacks in the year. We intend to be opportunistic while remaining committed to executing a balanced and disciplined capital allocation framework. 
In summary, Delphi overcame a number of headwinds and still delivered a great year. Our 2016 outlook is balanced and reflects our continued ability to adjust to changing market conditions. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin for some final thoughts before Q&A."

Now summarizing on Slide 22. 2015 was a record year, as Mark just said. Once again, we demonstrated our ability to deliver on our commitments, even against the backdrop of a more challenging and volatile environment. While capital markets are reflecting uncertainty in the underlying macro conditions, we aren't seeing anything today that would change our assessment of the market or the guidance that we provided last month. And while we're counting on a slight lift from global production in the year, if you look at the numbers, the bulk of our growth is driven by our planned new launches and increased content opportunities. Now having said that, we continue to actively monitor the dynamics in the industry and plan our investments prudently. In the event conditions deteriorate, we've demonstrated several times the ability to respond quickly and surgically. The European slowdown in 2012, as an example, where revenues declined 6% and our operating margins actually increased by 50 basis points; and the China slowdown in the third quarter of 2015 where revenues actually declined $175 million, but we're able to offset that revenue shortfall with productivity initiatives. Those are a few of the examples. 
We continue to increase our flexibility and reduce our operating cost to ensure that we're positioned to mitigate unplanned headwinds. Further, our strategy for value creation remains intact. We're supporting growth where we see opportunities and we remain disciplined in our allocation of capital. We continue to execute on the relevant breakthrough technologies that are driving incremental growth and margin expansion in 2016 and beyond, enabling us to outperform over the long term. You can expect to see and hear more about these innovations in our long-term road map at our Investor Day coming up in London on April 13. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions."

I think, first, Rod, I think to Mark's point, with respect to the year-over-year at E&S, there's a lot of noise in the numbers that you need to make adjustments for, including the divestiture of our reception systems business, right, as well as foreign exchange, as well as a kind of a onetime item in the fourth quarter of last year. I think those amounts total roughly 250 to 260 basis points. The balance relates really to the launch activity, the launch activity, the significant ramp-up in launch activity that's reflected in the underlying growth rate at E&S. As you roll off through the full year, both at E&S as well as for Delphi in total, you're going to continue to see some ongoing costs related to the China inefficiencies, as well as ramp costs into Q1, although at a much lower rate than what we have in the fourth quarter and then continue to dissipate  through Q2 and be largely gone in Q3 and Q4. So as you look at margin expansion throughout the year, both for Delphi as well as E&S, you'll see a gradual margin expansion on a sequential basis. As it relates to the FX exposure, Mark, do you want to talk about that?"

With respect to the growth rate of the Powertrain business, in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of this year, Powertrain segment growth will be a bit slower, primarily the result of a challenging comp in our aftermarket business. So if you remember, Brian, last year, we launched a major program with a U.S. independent aftermarket retailer that had very strong revenue. So that affects the year-over-year comp in the Powertrain segment. So that's one. Two, what you will see is consistent in reality with the balance of our businesses, based on the timing of the ramp-up of all these launches, growth is going to be stronger in the second half of the calendar year than it is in the first half of the calendar year, consistent with the margin explanation that Mark talked about. So we're still very optimistic about the Powertrain segment. The other thing to underscore though is we've talked about it in the past and I mentioned it again in my comments, we're starting to see more demand more of a ramp up in vehicle electrification, including things like 48-Volt. Those are very good for us. So 48-Volt  hybrid content is 4 to 5x the content that we have on a traditional car, full EV is 7x the content. 48-volt is an area that, quite frankly, a product that we'll be talking more with folks like yourselves about at our investor conference in April. But the great thing about it is it's 70% of the benefit at 30% of the cost for the OEs. So we think it's a great value proposition."

Good morning, everybody, thanks for joining us. Before Mark gets into our financial results, I'd like to provide some color on the fourth quarter and 2015 full year, as well as our outlook for 2016.  So let's begin with highlights on",1357,"Okay. Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everybody, thanks for joining us. Before Mark gets into our financial results, I'd like to provide some color on the fourth quarter and 2015 full year, as well as our outlook for 2016.  So let's begin with highlights on Slide 5. 
In summary, we had another good quarter, which was a really nice finish to a challenging year in which we had very strong operating performance. Organic revenue growth was a roll-up of 11% for the quarter and 6% for the full year, driven by just under 20% growth in China and roughly 13% growth in our Electrical Architecture and Electronics and Safety segments during the quarter. Operating income totaled a record $503 million. That was above our guidance. However, operating margins lagged the prior year, primarily the result of the sequential whipsaw in China volumes. You probably recall that in response to the third quarter slowdown in China, we actually reduced headcount by about 4,000 employees, and then had to add back over 6,000 employees to meet the 40% sequential increase in volumes that we experienced in the fourth quarter. While growth over market inflected in the quarter due to new launch activity, our outlook and our performance also reflected higher manufacturing costs as a result of this increased launch activity. So to put it in perspective, our operating team did an outstanding job executing on a record 75 major new program launches during the quarter and roughly 150 for the full year. 
Lastly, Mark will take you through the details, but FX was a bigger impact to margins in the quarter, especially at our E&S segment. For the full year, operating income totaled almost $2 billion, representing a 60 basis point increase in operating margins. New business bookings exceeded 2014 levels, reaching a record $26 billion. And during the year, we further optimized our manufacturing footprint, improving the flexibility of our cost structure, and we generated $1.7 billion of cash flow from operations and returned roughly $1.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends throughout the year, while at the same time making significant progress realigning our product portfolio through accretive acquisitions and investments that strengthen our competitive position while exiting businesses that did not fit with our strategic and our financial objectives. 
Slide 6 covers 2015 new business bookings in more detail, which as I mentioned, totaled over $26 billion a year. We actually totaled over $4 billion for the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we had a number of important customer bookings as well as several conquest wins, including a GDi win with a major North American customer, Electrical Architecture awards with both Toyota and PSA, and a second-wave multi-domain controller award with a European OE. We continue to be successful retaining replacement business with our existing customers, as reflected by our win rate on incumbent business of almost 90%. 
The right side of the chart reflects the balanced geographic mix of our bookings, which will drive strong revenue growth over the next few years. And as important, the increased geographic and customer diversity ensures that we're not dependent on any one region, segment or customer for growth. Given our focus on innovation, our portfolio of safe, green and connected technology solutions, and our track record of flawless execution, we continue to be an important strategic partner for our customers. 
Slide 7 outlines the view of the macro environment in 2016, beginning with our view of the tailwinds on the left. Regulatory trends and consumer demands continue to influence fuel economy, emissions and vehicle safety standards, driving content-per-vehicle growth. As a result, we see strong demand for our safe, green and connected technologies. We continue to expect solid growth in global vehicle production, primarily driven by strong growth in China, North America and Western Europe. As we sit here today, we do not expect foreign exchange rates to be as significant of a headwind as they were in 2015. Additionally, customer price-downs remain relatively stable. However, we are anticipating some headwinds, as detailed on the right side of the slide, including continued softness in vehicle production in both South America and in Eastern Europe, and ongoing weakness in the global commercial vehicle market. As such, we will continue to aggressively optimize our cost structure. The flexibility of our cost structure and ability to execute in a challenging macro environment gives us confidence we'll continue to deliver on both our short as well as our long-term financial commitments. 
Turning to Slide 8. Our strong bookings growth has led to a significant increase in major program launches, which in turn has accelerated revenue growth across each of our segments. To put this into perspective, major launches were up fivefold in the fourth quarter of 2015 and twofold for the 4 year -- for the full year, rather. We expect that trend to continue as launches more than double in the first quarter of 2016. These major launches require additional manufacturing resources as we trend to normalized run rates over the next couple of quarters, which translates into a steady increase in margins over the course of the year, and we remain on track to deliver both 2016 and 2017 margin targets. 
Turning to Slide 9. Last month, we made our 20th appearance at the Consumer Electronics Show, which seems to have a larger automotive presence each year. CES is a fantastic venue to showcase a few of our advanced technologies that will create a safer, more connected vehicle, and ultimately drive significant revenue and earnings growth. Our customers, our suppliers and investors had a chance to travel the streets of Vegas in our 2 automated vehicles and experience firsthand some of our newer V2 Everything technologies. We returned from the show optimistic about the tremendous opportunities in active safety, automated driving and vehicle connectivity, which is further validated by roughly $1.2 billion of active safety and $2 billion of infotainment bookings during 2015. And lastly, we're encouraged by the outlook for vehicle electrification. We're seeing accelerated quote activity and revenue growth, driven by the success of the hybrid vehicle technologies like 48-Volt, where content is more than 4x our standard Powertrain content. 
Our capital allocation strategy, outlined on Slide 10, remains an important leverage to enhance shareholder value. We expect CapEx to total roughly $800 million in 2016, supporting new program launches in North America, Europe and China; investments in information systems and increased efficiency and productivity; and supporting our ongoing footprint rotation to best-cost countries. We also believe an attractive dividend is another means of enhancing shareholder returns. As a reflection of our confidence in our underlying business, last month, we increased our dividend 16% to $1.16 per share, representing a dividend yield of 1.9% (sic) [ 1.8% ]. And lastly, we remain focused on executing value-enhancing portfolio modifications. As such, we intend to deploy roughly half of our operating cash flow toward value-accretive strategic acquisitions and investments, as well as share repurchases. On the M&A front, we hope to acquire and make investments in businesses and technologies that further strengthen our competitive position, drive profitable growth and are accretive to shareholder value. To the extent we have excess cash, we have a track record of returning it to shareholders via share repurchases, as evidenced by the roughly $1.2 billion in repurchases we did last year. Our current 2016 guidance assumes $400 million in share repurchases. However, we have the flexibility to take advantage of dislocations in the market to ramp up the pace of our repurchase activity. 
As shown on Slide 11, we believe we are well positioned to deliver shareholder value in 2016. We will continue to optimize our cost structure by rotating our footprint to best-cost countries, increase the flexibility of our workforce, optimize our regional service model and further integrate the Enterprise Operating System to ensure flawless execution, while both organically and through acquisitions, investing in safe, green and connected technologies that address our customers' challenges and drive accelerated revenue growth, margin expansion and enhanced returns. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mark for a more detailed look at our financial results. Mark?"

I'll begin by covering our fourth quarter and full year 2015 performance and then discuss our 2016 guidance. 
Consistent with prior calls, today's review of our actual and forecasted financials excludes restructuring and other special items and will address the continuing operations at Delphi. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP is included at the back of this presentation and the press release. 
Let me start on Slide 13 with a snapshot of our fourth quarter financial performance. As Kevin mentioned, we were pleased with our quarter results, which reflected robust revenue growth and record earnings. Revenue was up 3%, or 11% adjusted for currency and commodity effects. Operating income grew 1%, or 12% excluding currency. Operating margin was down 20 basis points from prior year, including a negative 40 basis point impact from foreign currency and the sale of the reception systems business. Additionally, as Kevin mentioned, our margin rate for the quarter was impacted by the 40% sequential increase in China volumes, as well as higher manufacturing and engineering spend to support major new growth program launches across all segments. Earnings per share grew 7%. However, adjusting for the effects of currency and commodities, EPS grew 19%. 
Slide 14 provides greater detail on revenue in the quarter. As you can see, currency and commodity effects were significant headwinds. However, organic growth was very strong at 11%, and 8% over market, delivering on our growth outlook from early 2015. Regionally, Europe and Asia were exceptionally strong at 8 and 10 points over market, respectively. North America remained solid at 7%, and 5 points over market. Though our business performed better than the market in South America, the underlying market there remains weak. 
Turning to profit. Slide 15 walks the fourth quarter year-over-year change in operating income, highlighting the previously mentioned foreign exchange effects. The cost impact of the China volume recovery, as well as the investment to support new program launches, is captured in net performance. These items are expected to remain a headwind to our normal margin flow-through in the first half of 2016, and accordingly, were included in our previously communicated guidance. We are confident in our ability to expand overall margins by roughly 50 basis points in 2016. 
Moving to Slide 16. Let's look at the performance by segment. With sales growth and operating performance, Electrical Architecture and Powertrain expanded margins 60 basis points year-over-year despite additional cost resulting from the sharp recovery in China volumes. As expected, Electronics and Safety growth accelerated in the quarter on new program launches. The reported E&S margin rate of 10.4% was negatively impacted 260 basis points by unfavorable foreign exchange, the impact of the reception systems divestiture and prior-year nonrecurring items. When adjusted for these items, E&S margins for the quarter were down 100 basis points on costs associated with support of new program launches. As it relates to 2016, we expect continued strong growth from launches. Margins will expand over the course of the year with lower volume flow-through in the first half. 
Turning to Slide 17. Increased earnings and lower share count drove EPS growth of 7% for the period. Excluding the effects of currency and commodities, earnings per share grew 19%. Taxes came in as expected in the quarter at 14% on an adjusted basis, 16% adjusted for the year. On a year-over-year basis, we were favorable by $0.01. However, that was offset by higher minority interest, and versus our guidance, HellermannTyton financing, which we completed in the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 18, our full year results. We delivered record earnings in a challenging macro environment. In 2015, our results included unfavorable currency and commodity effects of $1.3 billion on revenue and $178 million on operating income. Organically, revenue was up 6%, with our growth over market increasing through the year. Despite the previously mentioned headwinds, in 2015, we delivered more operating income, expanded margins 60 basis points and grew earnings per share 16%, excluding currency and commodities. 
Looking at the segments on Slide 19. We delivered solid growth across all segments, with growth over market strengthening through the year. Our overall margin expansion came in as expected, and going forward, we project margin expansion to continue in line with our guidance and longer-term financial targets. 
Turning to 2016. Slide 20 highlights our full year guidance assumptions. No change from last month. We expect growth in global vehicle production of roughly 2%, reflecting 3% growth in North America, growth in Europe of 2%, a 4% increase in China and a decline in South America of 10%. Our 2016 guidance maintains $1.10 euro rate. 
On Slide 21, we reaffirm our 2016 guidance. Revenue is driven by accelerating organic growth and the full year effect of the HellermannTyton acquisition. Operating income growth for the year is 14% at the midpoint, expanding margins roughly 50 basis points. 2016 EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.80 to $6.10, no change from our prior outlook. We forecast first quarter revenue growth of 5% to 8% adjusted, with margins up slightly versus the prior year at midpoint. And we expect first quarter EPS in the range of $1.28 to $1.38, up 10% at the midpoint. As Kevin mentioned, our guidance assumes $400 million of share buybacks in the year. We intend to be opportunistic while remaining committed to executing a balanced and disciplined capital allocation framework. 
In summary, Delphi overcame a number of headwinds and still delivered a great year. Our 2016 outlook is balanced and reflects our continued ability to adjust to changing market conditions. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin for some final thoughts before Q&A."

Now summarizing on Slide 22. 2015 was a record year, as Mark just said. Once again, we demonstrated our ability to deliver on our commitments, even against the backdrop of a more challenging and volatile environment. While capital markets are reflecting uncertainty in the underlying macro conditions, we aren't seeing anything today that would change our assessment of the market or the guidance that we provided last month. And while we're counting on a slight lift from global production in the year, if you look at the numbers, the bulk of our growth is driven by our planned new launches and increased content opportunities. Now having said that, we continue to actively monitor the dynamics in the industry and plan our investments prudently. In the event conditions deteriorate, we've demonstrated several times the ability to respond quickly and surgically. The European slowdown in 2012, as an example, where revenues declined 6% and our operating margins actually increased by 50 basis points; and the China slowdown in the third quarter of 2015, where revenues actually declined $175 million, but we were able to offset that revenue shortfall with productivity initiatives. Those are a few of the examples. 
We continue to increase our flexibility and reduce our operating cost to ensure that we're positioned to mitigate unplanned headwinds. Further, our strategy for value creation remains intact. We're supporting growth where we see opportunities and we remain disciplined in our allocation of capital. We continue to execute on the relevant breakthrough technologies that are driving incremental growth and margin expansion in 2016 and beyond, enabling us to outperform over the long term. You can expect to see and hear more about these innovations in our long-term road map at our Investor Day coming up in London on April 13. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions."

I think, first, Rod, I think to Mark's point, with respect to the year-over-year at E&S, there's a lot of noise in the numbers that you need to make adjustments for, including the divestiture of our reception systems business, right, as well as foreign exchange, as well as a kind of a onetime item in the fourth quarter of last year. I think those amounts total roughly 250 to 260 basis points. The balance relates really to the launch activity, the launch activity, the significant ramp-up in launch activity that's reflected in the underlying growth rate at E&S. As you roll out through the full year, both at E&S as well as for Delphi in total, you're going to continue to see some ongoing costs related to the China inefficiencies, as well as ramp costs into Q1, although at a much lower rate than what we have in the fourth quarter, and then continue to dissipate through Q2 and be largely gone in Q3 and Q4. So as you look at margin expansion throughout the year, both for Delphi as well as E&S, you'll see a gradual margin expansion on a sequential basis. As it relates to the FX exposure, Mark, do you want to talk about that?"

We've seen no shifting in schedules from Powertrain, quite frankly, or any of our other businesses. We've seen absolutely none. With respect to the growth rate of the Powertrain business, in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of this year, Powertrain segment growth will be a bit slower, primarily the result of a challenging comp in our aftermarket business. So if you remember, Brian, last year, we launched a major program with a U.S. independent aftermarket retailer that had very strong revenue. So that affects the year-over-year comp in the Powertrain segment. So that's one. Two, what you will see is, consistent in reality with the balance of our businesses, based on the timing of the ramp-up of all these launches, growth is going to be stronger in the second half of the calendar year than it is in the first half of the calendar year, consistent with the margin explanation that Mark talked about. So we're still very optimistic about the Powertrain segment. The other thing to underscore though is -- we've talked about it in the past and I mentioned it again in my comments, we're starting to see more demand, more of a ramp-up in vehicle electrification, including things like 48-Volt. Those are very good for us. So 48-Volt hybrid content is 4 to 5x the content that we have on a traditional car, full EV is 7x the content. 48-Volt is an area that -- quite frankly, a product that we'll be talking more with folks like yourselves about at our Investor Conference in April. But the great thing about it is it's 70% of the benefit at 30% of the cost for the OEs. So we think it's a great value proposition."

So let's begin with highlights on Sl",1362,"Okay. Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everybody, thanks for joining us. Before Mark gets into our financial results, I'd like to provide some color on the fourth quarter and 2015 full year as well as our outlook for 2016. So let's begin with highlights on Slide 5. 
In summary, we had another good quarter, which was a really nice finish to a challenging year in which we had very strong operating performance. Organic revenue growth was a roll-up of 11% for the quarter and 6% for the full year, driven by just under 20% growth in China and roughly 13% growth in our Electrical Architecture and Electronics and Safety segments during the quarter. Operating income totaled a record $503 million. That was above our guidance. However, operating margins lagged the prior year, primarily the result of the sequential whipsaw in China volumes. You probably recall that in response to the third quarter slowdown in China, we actually reduced headcount by about 4,000 employees, and then had to add back over 6,000 employees to meet the 40% sequential increase in volumes that we experienced in the fourth quarter. While growth over market inflected in the quarter due to new launch activity, our outlook and our performance also reflected higher manufacturing costs as a result of this increased launch activity. So to put it in perspective, our operating team did an outstanding job executing on a record 75 major new program launches during the quarter and roughly 150 for the full year. 
Lastly, Mark will take you through the details, but FX was a bigger impact to margins in the quarter, especially at our E&S segment. For the full year, operating income totaled almost $2 billion, representing a 60 basis point increase in operating margins. New business bookings exceeded 2014 levels, reaching a record $26 billion. And during the year, we further optimized our manufacturing footprint, improving the flexibility of our cost structure, and we generated $1.7 billion of cash flow from operations and returned roughly $1.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends throughout the year, while at the same time making significant progress realigning our product portfolio through accretive acquisitions and investments that strengthen our competitive position while exiting businesses that did not fit with our strategic and our financial objectives. 
Slide 6 covers 2015 new business bookings in more detail, which as I mentioned, totaled over $26 billion a year. We actually totaled over $4 billion for the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we had a number of important customer bookings as well as several conquest wins, including a GDi win with a major North American customer, Electrical Architecture awards with both Toyota and PSA, and a second-wave multi-domain controller award with a European OE. We continue to be successful retaining replacement business with our existing customers, as reflected by our win rate on incumbent business of almost 90%. 
The right side of the chart reflects the balanced geographic mix of our bookings, which will drive strong revenue growth over the next few years. And as important, the increased geographic and customer diversity ensures that we're not dependent on any one region, segment or customer for growth. Given our focus on innovation, our portfolio of safe, green and connected technology solutions, and our track record of flawless execution, we continue to be an important strategic partner for our customers. 
Slide 7 outlines the view of the macro environment in 2016, beginning with our view of the tailwinds on the left. Regulatory trends and consumer demands continue to influence fuel economy, emissions and vehicle safety standards, driving content per vehicle growth. As a result, we see strong demand for our safe, green and connected technologies. We continue to expect solid growth in global vehicle production, primarily driven by strong growth in China, North America and Western Europe. As we sit here today, we do not expect foreign exchange rates to be as significant of a headwind as they were in 2015. Additionally, customer price downs remain relatively stable. However, we are anticipating some headwinds, as detailed on the right side of the slide, including continued softness in vehicle production in both South America and in Eastern Europe, and ongoing weakness in the global commercial vehicle market. As such, we will continue to aggressively optimize our cost structure. The flexibility of our cost structure and ability to execute in a challenging macro environment gives us confidence we'll continue to deliver on both our short as well as our long-term financial commitments. 
Turning to Slide 8. Our strong bookings growth has led to a significant increase in major program launches, which in turn has accelerated revenue growth across each of our segments. To put this into perspective, major launches were up fivefold in the fourth quarter of 2015 and twofold for the 4 year -- for the full year, rather. We expect that trend to continue as launches more than double in the first quarter of 2016. These major launches require additional manufacturing resources as we trend to normalized run rates over the next couple of quarters, which translates into a steady increase in margins over the course of the year, and we remain on track to deliver both 2016 and 2017 margin targets. 
Turning to Slide 9. Last month, we made our 20th appearance at the Consumer Electronics Show, which seems to have a larger automotive presence each year. CES is a fantastic venue to showcase a few of our advanced technologies that will create a safer, more connected vehicle, and ultimately drive significant revenue and earnings growth. Our customers, our suppliers and investors had a chance to travel the streets of Vegas in our 2 automated vehicles and experience firsthand some of our newer V2 Everything technologies. We returned from the show optimistic about the tremendous opportunities in active safety, automated driving and vehicle connectivity, which is further validated by roughly $1.2 billion of active safety and $2 billion of infotainment bookings during 2015. And lastly, we're encouraged by the outlook for vehicle electrification. We're seeing accelerated quote activity and revenue growth, driven by the success of the hybrid vehicle technologies like 48-Volt, where content is more than 4x our standard Powertrain content. 
Our capital allocation strategy, outlined on Slide 10, remains an important leverage to enhance shareholder value. We expect CapEx to total roughly $800 million in 2016, supporting new program launches in North America, Europe and China; investments in information systems and increased efficiency and productivity; and supporting our ongoing footprint rotation to best cost countries. We also believe an attractive dividend is another means of enhancing shareholder returns. As a reflection of our confidence in our underlying business, last month, we increased our dividend 16% to $1.16 per share, representing a dividend yield of 1.9% (sic) [ 1.8% ]. And lastly, we remain focused on executing value-enhancing portfolio modifications. As such, we intend to deploy roughly half of our operating cash flow toward value-accretive strategic acquisitions and investments as well as share repurchases. On the M&A front, we hope to acquire and make investments in businesses and technologies that further strengthen our competitive position, drive profitable growth and are accretive to shareholder value. To the extent we have excess cash, we have a track record of returning it to shareholders via share repurchases, as evidenced by the roughly $1.2 billion in repurchases we did last year. Our current 2016 guidance assumes $400 million in share repurchases. However, we have the flexibility to take advantage of dislocations in the market to ramp up the pace of our repurchase activity. 
As shown on Slide 11, we believe we are well positioned to deliver shareholder value in 2016. We will continue to optimize our cost structure by rotating our footprint to best cost countries, increase the flexibility of our workforce, optimize our regional service model and further integrate the Enterprise Operating System to ensure flawless execution, while both organically and through acquisitions, investing in safe, green and connected technologies that address our customers' challenges and drive accelerated revenue growth, margin expansion and enhanced returns. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mark for a more detailed look at our financial results. Mark?"

I'll begin by covering our fourth quarter and full year 2015 performance and then discuss our 2016 guidance. 
Consistent with prior calls, today's review of our actual and forecasted financials excludes restructuring and other special items and will address the continuing operations at Delphi. The reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP is included at the back of this presentation and the press release. 
Let me start on Slide 13 with a snapshot of our fourth quarter financial performance. As Kevin mentioned, we were pleased with our quarter results, which reflected robust revenue growth and record earnings. Revenue was up 3%, or 11% adjusted for currency and commodity effects. Operating income grew 1%, or 12% excluding currency. Operating margin was down 20 basis points from prior year, including a negative 40 basis point impact from foreign currency and the sale of the reception systems business. Additionally, as Kevin mentioned, our margin rate for the quarter was impacted by the 40% sequential increase in China volumes as well as higher manufacturing and engineering spend to support major new growth program launches across all segments. Earnings per share grew 7%. However, adjusting for the effects of currency and commodities, EPS grew 19%. 
Slide 14 provides greater detail on revenue in the quarter. As you can see, currency and commodity effects were significant headwinds. However, organic growth was very strong at 11%, and 8% over market, delivering on our growth outlook from early 2015. Regionally, Europe and Asia were exceptionally strong at 8 and 10 points over market, respectively. North America remained solid at 7%, and 5 points over market. Though our business performed better than the market in South America, the underlying market there remains weak. 
Turning to profit. Slide 15 walks the fourth quarter year-over-year change in operating income, highlighting the previously mentioned foreign exchange effects. The cost impact of the China volume recovery as well as the investment to support new program launches, is captured in net performance. These items are expected to remain a headwind to our normal margin flow-through in the first half of 2016, and accordingly, were included in our previously communicated guidance. We are confident in our ability to expand overall margins by roughly 50 basis points in 2016. 
Moving to Slide 16. Let's look at the performance by segment. With sales growth and operating performance, Electrical Architecture and Powertrain expanded margins 60 basis points year-over-year despite additional cost resulting from the sharp recovery in China volumes. As expected, Electronics and Safety growth accelerated in the quarter on new program launches. The reported E&S margin rate of 10.4% was negatively impacted 260 basis points by unfavorable foreign exchange, the impact of the reception systems divestiture and prior-year nonrecurring items. When adjusted for these items, E&S margins for the quarter were down 100 basis points on costs associated with support of new program launches. As it relates to 2016, we expect continued strong growth from launches. Margins will expand over the course of the year with lower volume flow-through in the first half. 
Turning to Slide 17. Increased earnings and lower share count drove EPS growth of 7% for the period. Excluding the effects of currency and commodities, earnings per share grew 19%. Taxes came in as expected in the quarter at 14% on an adjusted basis, 16% adjusted for the year. On a year-over-year basis, we were favorable by $0.01. However, that was offset by higher minority interest, and versus our guidance, HellermannTyton financing, which we completed in the quarter. 
Moving to Slide 18, our full year results. We delivered record earnings in a challenging macro environment. In 2015, our results included unfavorable currency and commodity effects of $1.3 billion on revenue and $178 million on operating income. Organically, revenue was up 6%, with our growth over market increasing through the year. Despite the previously mentioned headwinds, in 2015, we delivered more operating income, expanded margins 60 basis points and grew earnings per share 16%, excluding currency and commodities. 
Looking at the segments on Slide 19. We delivered solid growth across all segments, with growth over market strengthening through the year. Our overall margin expansion came in as expected, and going forward, we project margin expansion to continue in line with our guidance and longer-term financial targets. 
Turning to 2016. Slide 20 highlights our full year guidance assumptions. No change from last month. We expect growth in global vehicle production of roughly 2%, reflecting 3% growth in North America, growth in Europe of 2%, a 4% increase in China and a decline in South America of 10%. Our 2016 guidance maintains $1.10 euro rate. 
On Slide 21, we reaffirm our 2016 guidance. Revenue is driven by accelerating organic growth and the full year effect of the HellermannTyton acquisition. Operating income growth for the year is 14% at the midpoint, expanding margins roughly 50 basis points. 2016 EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.80 to $6.10, no change from our prior outlook. We forecast first quarter revenue growth of 5% to 8% adjusted, with margins up slightly versus the prior year at midpoint. And we expect first quarter EPS in the range of $1.28 to $1.38, up 10% at the midpoint. As Kevin mentioned, our guidance assumes $400 million of share buybacks in the year. We intend to be opportunistic while remaining committed to executing a balanced and disciplined capital allocation framework. 
In summary, Delphi overcame a number of headwinds and still delivered a great year. Our 2016 outlook is balanced and reflects our continued ability to adjust to changing market conditions. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin for some final thoughts before Q&A."

Now summarizing on Slide 22. 2015 was a record year, as Mark just said. Once again, we demonstrated our ability to deliver on our commitments, even against the backdrop of a more challenging and volatile environment. While capital markets are reflecting uncertainty in the underlying macro conditions, we aren't seeing anything today that would change our assessment of the market or the guidance that we provided last month. And while we're counting on a slight lift from global production in the year, if you look at the numbers, the bulk of our growth is driven by our planned new launches and increased content opportunities. Now having said that, we continue to actively monitor the dynamics in the industry and plan our investments prudently. In the event conditions deteriorate, we've demonstrated several times the ability to respond quickly and surgically. The European slowdown in 2012, as an example, where revenues declined 6% and our operating margins actually increased by 50 basis points; and the China slowdown in the third quarter of 2015, where revenues actually declined $175 million, but we were able to offset that revenue shortfall with productivity initiatives. Those are a few of the examples. 
We continue to increase our flexibility and reduce our operating cost to ensure that we're positioned to mitigate unplanned headwinds. Further, our strategy for value creation remains intact. We're supporting growth where we see opportunities and we remain disciplined in our allocation of capital. We continue to execute on the relevant breakthrough technologies that are driving incremental growth and margin expansion in 2016 and beyond, enabling us to outperform over the long term. You can expect to see and hear more about these innovations in our long-term road map at our Investor Day coming up in London on April 13. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions."

I think those amounts total roughly 250 to 260 basis points. The balance relates really to the launch activity, the launch activity, the significant ramp-up in launch activity that's reflected in the underlying growth rate at E&S. As you roll out through the full year, both at E&S as well as for Delphi in total, you're going to continue to see some ongoing costs related to the China inefficiencies as well as ramp costs into Q1, although at a much lower rate than what we have in the fourth quarter, and then continue to dissipate through Q2 and be largely gone in Q3 and Q4. So as you look at margin expansion throughout the year, both for Delphi as well as E&S, you'll see a gradual margin expansion on a sequential basis.

We've seen no shifting in schedules from Powertrain, quite frankly, or any of our other businesses. We've seen absolutely none. With respect to the growth rate of the Powertrain business, in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of this year, Powertrain segment growth will be a bit slower, primarily the result of a challenging comp in our aftermarket business. So if you remember, Brian, last year, we launched a major program with a U.S. independent aftermarket retailer that had very strong revenue. So that affects the year-over-year comp in the Powertrain segment. So that's one. Two, what you will see is, consistent in reality with the balance of our businesses, based on the timing of the ramp-up of all these launches, growth is going to be stronger in the second half of the calendar year than it is in the first half of the calendar year, consistent with the margin explanation that Mark talked about. So we're still very optimistic about the Powertrain segment. The other thing to underscore though is -- we've talked about it in the past and I mentioned it again in my comments, we're starting to see more demand, more of a ramp-up in vehicle electrification, including things like 48-Volt. Those are very good for us. So 48-Volt hybrid content is 4 to 5x the content that we have on a traditional car, full EV is 7x the content. 48-Volt is an area that -- quite frankly, a product that we'll be talking more with folks like yourselves about at our Investor Conference in April.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Excuse me. Before Joe gets to offers a result, let's provide some color of what was a great quarter for Delphi.
So let's begin with the highlights on Slide 5. In summary, we had another very solid quarter, meeting our commitments in delivering strong revenue and earnings growth. Adjusted revenue growth was 6%, driven by market share and content gains across the portfolio. Operating income increased to $509 million, margins expanded 20 basis points to 12.6%, and earnings per share increased 12% to $1.36. And lastly, we returned approximately $450 million of cash to shareholders.
We remain very confident in our 2016 guidance as originally communicated back in January. There is thing we see today that changes our view of the underlying macro environment, with something stronger than offsetting shortfalls elsewhere, I'll touch on the macros in greater detail on the next slide.
The ramp-up of new program launches will continue to drive accelerated revenue growth, and a strong focus on leveraging our robust business model will enable us to flex our cost structure to meet the challenges of virtually any environment.
In addition, we made a number of our recent investor update meeting in London. We unveiled a 40-vehicle solution, which improves engine performance while lowering CO2 emissions by more than 10%. I'll cover this in more detail later. We also announced the IRS Section 7874 issues behind us, and that we've prevailed in our appeal, concerning the phi should be treated as a U.K. tax entity under the U.S. tax code. And we announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program.  Coupled with the recent dividend increase, this underscores confidence in our medium and long-term outlook, which is driven by the safe, green and connected megatrends decorating new opportunities for Delphi, continued material manufacturing performance which is funding incremental growth investments and driving margin expansion which will translate into cash flow generation, providing additional levers to drive shareholder value.
During the quarter, we also acquired PureDepth, Inc, the leading provider of multilayer 3D display technology. Our collaboration with True Depth was on display on the consumer electronics show in a concept Mustang, which has driven significant customer interest.
Slide 6 is an update on our view of the macro environment, which as I just mentioned, continued to remain balanced relative the assumptions underlying our 2016 guidance. I'll hit a few of the highlights. Starting with positives on the left, regulatory trends and consumer demands continue to influence fuel economy, emissions and vehicle safety standards, driving content per vehicle growth. And we continue to expect steady growth in global vehicle production driven by continued growth in China, North America and Western Europe. 
Moving to the middle of the chart. Consistent with our initial planning assumptions, we expect commodities and pricing to remain relatively neutral for the balance of the year. While we're currently seeing a slightly stronger euro, this is being more than offset by the week in China is RMB, with China being meaningful part of our business. 
Moving to the challenges on the right, we've seen for the declines in vehicle production in both South America and Eastern Europe, and increased weakness in the global commercial vehicle market now expected to be down low single digits driven by double-digit declines in the North American off-highway market. 
Lastly, working closely with our suppliers and OEM customers to mitigate any near-term supply disruptions due to the recent earthquakes in Japan, which will affect the second quarter but will be made up during the balance of the year. Joe will provide more context on this a little bit later. Given the various puts and takes, our overall outlook remains in line with our prior guidance.
More on China on Slide 7. I just returned from the Beijing Auto Show where I met with several of our top customers. We heard a relatively consistent view with the China market both global and local OEMs remained very confident China will continue to drive increased global vehicle production, estimating 2016 growth in the 4% to 6% range, resulting from continued strong demand for SUVs and in crossovers. There's also increasing dialogue regarding new energy vehicles and electrification in this market, which given our product portfolio, provides further revenue opportunities. Delphi remains well-positioned in this market, and expect to grow 10 to 12 points above vehicle production in 2016, benefiting from market share gains and the trends towards higher content vehicle.
Growth in the China markets reflected in our new business bookings on Slide 8, which told approximately $7 billion during the first quarter. We had a number of important customer bookings as well as several conquest wins, including a major Electrical Architectural win with FCA on the RAM Truck in North America, Powertrain wins with [indiscernible] in China and Ford in North America, and the key entertainment wins with Volkswagen in North America as well as with SGM in China. 
The right side of the chart reflects the balanced geographic mix of our bookings which should will drive strong revenue growth over the next few years. The increased geographic and customer diversity ensures that we're not dependent on any one region, segment or customer for growth.
Now given our portfolio is safe, green and connected technology solutions, and our track record of false execution, we're increasingly becoming a strategic partner of choice for a number of our customers, which is reflected in our record bookings over the last few years.
Turning to Slide 9. These are just a few examples of launched programs driving revenue growth this past quarter. Our Electrical Architecture segment is benefiting from increased content on the BMW X5 some back onboard charger for plugin hybrid powertrains. Ultimate BMW, our Powertrain division launched several components on the new Active Tourer. And the Electronics and Safety division is launching multiple programs, including short range radar and the Kia Cadenza, and infotainment content on the Lincoln MKX, Buick Excelle and Dodge RAM Truck.
Moving to Slide 10. As we highlighted in our investor day and was reinforced in Beijing last week, customer interest in electrification is gaining momentum. Our customers increasingly see the need for electrification of the powertrain to close rgx gaps on CO2 emissions and fuel economy. and 48-Volt hybrids are the affordable, no compromise solution. An optimized Electrical Architecture system is necessary for the electrification of today's vehicles, which is the very foundation for our 48-Volt solution. Customer's response has been strong for [indiscernible] system solution which represents approximately 4x the content opportunity compared to a traditional internal combustion engine for Delphi.
Now in addition to the 2 global customer programs we've already been awarded, we've received a strong interest from several automakers to explore collaborating on this very interesting technology.
Turning to Slide 11. Delphi continues to be recognized for its technology leadership by both customers and industry experts. Delphi's proud to receive the first-ever General Motors Innovation Award for our V2X [ph] module, which will be introduced on the all-new Cadillac CT6. We are the first to the market with this breakthrough technology. We also won our 18th Automotive News PACE Awards, after once again, leading the industry with 3 nominations. The Dual Hub [ph] is a custom USB application that enables Apple CarPlay, allowing the radio and an iPhone to be recognized simultaneously as a host device. It's the only solution on the market with its versatile functionality. 
Leading in innovation is the foundation of our strategy for growth, and these industry awards are strong validation that we're solving our customer's most challenging problems with industry-leading technologies. 
Moving to Slide 12. Before I hand things over to Joe, I want to underscore commitment to driving consistent, sustainable and importantly, profitable growth. Since our IPO, we've completed several transactions that enhance our technology portfolio and better position us for the future. Our advanced technologies are aligned to the megatrends of safe, green and connected, positioning us for accelerated revenue growth.
Our lean cost structure and global footprint allows us to further leverage both our scale and regional capabilities to drive revenue growth and margin expansion. And lastly, we will continue to execute a very balanced and very disciplined capital allocation strategy to drive increased shareholder returns. Our track record conveys our execution capabilities, and we are very confident we will deliver continued outperformance for years to come.
I now want to turn the call over to Joe."
59502420,331536973,972075,"Delphi Automotive PLC, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Aptiv PLC","Executives","Great. Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by covering our first quarter performance and then discuss our second quarter and full year 2016 guidance.Let's start with Slide 14, with a snapshot of our first quarter financial performance.",1083,"Great. Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by covering our first quarter performance and then discuss our second quarter and full year 2016 guidance.
Let's start with Slide 14, with a snapshot of our first quarter financial performance. As Kevin mentioned, we were pleased with our results which reflected both strong revenue and earnings growth. Revenue was up 7% or 6% adjusted for currency, commodity, acquisitions and divestitures. Our operating margins expanded 20 basis points. Earnings per share grew 12%, largely the result of increased net income, and in the quarter, we purchased a 5.6 million shares totaling $370 million. The adjusted tax rate was 18% for the quarter.
Slide 15 provides greater detail of revenue for the quarter. Starting on the left, you can see we had strong sales growth, including the impact of M&A, primarily HellermannTyton, which had organic growth of 13% in the first quarter. 
Foreign exchange and commodities were slightly bigger headwind, primarily driven by dollar strengthening against the Chinese RMB and the price of copper. 
Moving to the right, North America, Europe and Asia saw strong growth in both -- on both the reported as well as on adjusted basis. And as you can see, the South American market remains very weak, and we are not planning on a near-term recovery.
Accordingly, we have taken significant steps in the past year to reduce our South American footprint and cost structure, including exiting our business in Argentina and reducing the number of Brazilian manufacturing facilities from 9 to 4. And while we remain able to serve our global customers in South America, we have significantly reduced the impact of the market downturn on Delphi.
Turning to operating income. Slide 16 walks the year-over-year change for the first quarter. Our operating results are consistent with our expectations. Strong flow-through from a volume growth contributed to the margin expansion in the quarter, helping to offset the impact of launching growth related activities in our net performance. The impact of the China volume ramp and the added cost to support new program launches in E&S and EEA totaled approximately $35 million in the quarter. The China inefficiencies discussed previously represented approximately $5 million in Q1 and will not have an impact going forward.  The remaining launch costs will further moderate over the course of the year, and continued to be factored into our full year 2016 guidance.
Slide 17 takes us to the performance by segment. Electrical Architecture had adjusted growth of 5%, and HellermannTyton contributed approximately $200 million of revenue in the quarter. EEA margins expanded 70 basis points year-over-year. 
Powertrain also delivered 5% organic growth driven by gas systems, partially offset by lower commercial vehicle volumes. And Powertrain continues to deliver strong margins despite nearly 40 basis points of FX headwinds, primarily driven by the Chinese RMB. Electronics and Safety organic growth accelerated to 13% on new program launches, particularly in active safety and infotainment programs in Europe and China, partially offset by lower mechatronic sales, which represented a 3% negative impact on E&S growth in the quarter.
Active safety and infotainment continued to see strong growth of approximately 70% and 10%, respectively. Our E&S margins of 10.3% were as expected and reflect the launch related activities I just discussed.
As it relates to the remainder of 2016, we expect continued strong growth from new launches and from margins to expand over the course of the year as we ramp production volumes and improve performance.
Turning now to Slide 18. We saw total EPS growth of $0.15 or 12% for the quarter, including $0.11 from increased earnings. Share repurchases contributed $0.07, more than offsetting the impact of a higher tax rate. As you know, the tax rate can vary very from quarter-to-quarter, however, there's no change to our 17% full-year estimate. 
Now turning to the outlook on Page 19. As Kevin mentioned, given the puts and takes, there are no changes to the 2016 guidance. Revenue is driven by accelerating organic growth throughout the year and the full year effect of the HellermannTyton acquisition. We expect to expand margins by roughly 50 basis points, and 2016 EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.80 to $6.10, reflecting year-over-year growth of 14%. 
Second quarter revenue was forecast in the range of our $4.125 billion to $4.225 billion. This includes the impact of the supply disruptions from the Japanese earthquake, estimated to be $75 million of revenue and $20 million of operating income at the midpoint of our guidance. While we continue to monitor and assess the potential impacts, conversations with our customers indicate that any near-term production disruptions will be made up over the balance of the year.
We expect second quarter EPS in the range of $1.50 to $1.60, up 16% at the midpoint, which includes the impact from the earthquake supply disruptions. Our strong balance sheet and capital allocation strategy outlined on Slide 20 remains an important leverage to enhance shareholder value. 
On the left, we expect cash flow from operations to grow approximately $2 billion, up almost 20% in 2015. And the deployment priorities on the right are consistent with our strategy, maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade rating.
We are investing in our business to increased capital expenditures, supporting new program launches, information systems that increase efficiency and productivity and ongoing footprint rotation to best cost centers. We are committed to paying a competitive dividend, and to the extent we have excess cash, we have a track record of returning it to shareholders via share repurchases, as evidenced by the $370 million of repurchases we did in the first quarter.
As we state here today, we do not expect repurchases to continue with the first fourth quarter pace. However, would tend to be opportunistic while remaining committed to executing a balanced and disciplined capital allocation framework.
Now before I hand things back to Kevin, and turning to Slide 21, we are focused on executing value enhancing portfolio modifications. As such in the quarter, we completed the final step in the divestiture of the thermal business of the sale of our stake in the Chinese joint ventures.  And we have acquired PureDepth, a leading provider of [indiscernible] 3D multilayer. You can expect us to continue to pursue investments that enhance our existing technology portfolio, [indiscernible] competitive position and drive increased value for our shareholders.
I'll now turn it over to Kevin for some closing remarks before we open up the call for questions."

Now summarizing on Slide 21. We delivered another strong quarter, executing on the relevant advanced technologies that enable us to outgrow the markets we serve.
We believe we're well positioned to deliver on our commitments in 2016, high single-digit organic growth, roughly 50 basis points of margin expansion, solid mid-teens EPS growth and $1.2 billion of free cash flow. 
We continue to optimize our cost structure, increase the flexibility of our workforce and execute flawlessly. We're investing and profitable growth where we see opportunities. We remain disciplined in our allocation of capital, investing in both organic and inorganic growth, and returning excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Through all of this, we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver on our commitments even against the backdrop of a dynamic environment.
So with that, we'll now open up the line for questions."

So Rod, with respect to guidance on pricing, we remain -- our guidance in the range of 1.5% to 2% pricing. I think this quarter was slightly higher than that. Given our much faster growth in E&S over the next 12 months, growth is roughly double our overall corporate growth, and as we've talked about in the past, E&S tends to have price downs of 2% to 3% versus the balance of our portfolio that is less than 2% and the rapid growth in that segment is what's driving the overall increase in price downs on a year-over-year basis. Other than that, nothing has changed from a business model standpoint. Joe, do you want to?"

What we've been told so far and what we're seeing, this is more a case of damage to in-process inventory than the facilities themselves. So that gives us some confidence that the delays will be both short-term in nature and recovery should be quicker. At the midpoint, we've estimated $75 million of revenue. That includes both direct. That's about 50-50 both direct impact as well as indirect. So direct would be where we don't have supply and can't ship to a customer. Indirect, and GM is a good example of that, would be a case where customer has told us they're impacted by another supplier. It won't be producing, so they're probably not going to ship to them either. At the high end, it could be $100 million of revenue and close to $30 million of OI.

If you look at IHS and based on conversations with the customers, that mix of EV and hybrids out in 2025 is actually increased over the last 6 months. And listen, I say their members may be an opportunity that accelerates further. Clearly, there's more dialogue and more interest from our customers as they focus on solutions to reducing CO2 emissions and increasing fuel economy, and things like 48-volt where you can get a significant benefit at a fraction of the cost, it's a great value proposition. It's a terrific value proposition. So we're having increasing dialogue, and it's really across the globe.

I think it's augmented with inverse and converters, battery packs, things like that, that we can bring to bear. And those products that we don't manufacturer today like electric motors, there are partners that we're using strategically to sell the whole system solution. When you look at the market, if there's a market that is right for electrification, where it should be easier to implement, it's the China market. Based on discussions with both the globals as well as the local EEs, everyone is convinced that the government is focused on enforcing regulations and reducing CO2 emissions and addressing the pollution problem.

But it's certainly something that internally we're making sure that we have the capabilities. It's why we bought companies like Ottomatika. It's why we've invested in companies like PureDepth. It's why we have the 40 engineers in Silicon Valley. It's why I'm headed to Israel next week to meet with technology partners there. So it's certainly something that we need to be ready for. And I think the challenge for players like us who have commitments to folks like you and investors -- is how do we strike the balance about making sure that we're perfectly positioned for the future and at the same time, ensuring that we are delivering several financial returns between now and then? And those are the trade-offs that we constantly think about, but obviously, there's more and more focus on software and systems integration and electrification.

Before Joe gets to our financial results, I'd like to provide some color of what was a great quarter for Delphi.
So let's begin with the highlights on Slide 5. In summary, we had another very solid quarter, meeting our commitments in delivering strong revenue and earnings growth. Adjusted revenue growth was 6%, driven by market share and content gains across the portfolio. Operating income increased to $509 million, margins expanded 20 basis points to 12.6%, and earnings per share increased 12% to $1.36. And lastly, we returned approximately $450 million of cash to shareholders.
We remain very confident in our 2016 guidance as originally communicated back in January. There is nothing we see today that changes our view of the underlying macro environment, with something stronger offsetting shortfalls elsewhere. I'll touch on the macros in greater detail on the next slide.
The ramp-up of new program launches will continue to drive accelerated revenue growth, and a strong focus on leveraging our robust business model will enable us to flex our cost structure to meet the challenges of virtually any environment.
In addition, we've made a number of important announcements during our recent investor update meeting in London. We unveiled a 40-vehicle solution, which improves the engine performance while lowering CO2 emissions by more than 10%. I'll cover this in more detail later. We also announced the IRS Section 7874 issues behind us, and that we've prevailed in our appeal contending that Delphi should be treated as a U.K. tax entity under the U.S. tax code. And we announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program. Coupled with the recent dividend increase, this underscores confidence in our medium- and long-term outlook, which is driven by the safe, green and connected mega trends that are creating new revenue opportunities for Delphi, continued material manufacturing performance which is funding incremental growth investments and driving margin expansion, which will translate into cash flow generation, providing additional levers to drive shareholder value.
During the quarter, we also acquired PureDepth, Inc., the leading provider of multi-layer 3D display technology. Our collaboration with PureDepth was on display at the Consumer Electronics Show in a concept Mustang, which has driven significant customer interest.
Slide 6 is an update on our view of the macro environment, which as I just mentioned continued to remain balanced relative to the assumptions underlying our 2016 guidance. I'll hit a few of the highlights. Starting with positives on the left, regulatory trends and consumer demands continue to influence fuel economy, emission and vehicle safety standards, driving content per vehicle growth. And we continue to expect steady growth in global vehicle production driven by continued growth in China, North America and Western Europe. 
Moving to the middle of the chart. Consistent with our initial planning assumptions, we expect commodities and pricing to remain relatively neutral for the balance of the year. While we're currently seeing a slightly stronger euro, this is being more than offset by the weakened Chinese RMB, with China being a meaningful part of our business. 
Moving to the challenges on the right, we've seen further declines in vehicle production in both South America and Eastern Europe, and increased weakness in the global commercial vehicle market, now expected to be down low single digits driven by double-digit declines in the North American off-highway market. 
Lastly, we're working closely with our suppliers and OEM customers to mitigate any near-term supply disruptions due to the recent earthquakes in Japan, which will affect the second quarter but will be made up during the balance of the year. Joe will provide more context on this a little bit later. Given the various puts and takes, our overall outlook remains in line with our prior guidance.
More on China on Slide 7. I just returned from the Beijing Auto Show, where I met with several of our top customers. We heard a relatively consistent view with the China market. Both global and local OEMs remained very confident China will continue to drive increased global vehicle production, estimating 2016 growth in the 4% to 6% range, resulting from continued strong demand for SUVs and crossovers. There's also increasing dialogue regarding new energy vehicles and electrification in this market, which given our product portfolio provides further revenue opportunities. Delphi remains well positioned in this market, and expects to grow 10 to 12 points above vehicle production in 2016, benefiting from market share gains and the trend towards higher content vehicle.
Growth in the China market is reflected in our new business bookings on Slide 8, which totaled approximately $7 billion during the first quarter. We had a number of important customer bookings as well as several conquest wins, including a major Electrical Architecture win with FCA on the Ram Truck in North America; Powertrain wins with China and in China; and Ford in North America; and key infotainment wins with Volkswagen in North America as well as with SGM in China. 
The right side of the chart reflects the balanced geographic mix of our bookings, which would drive strong revenue growth over the next few years. The increased geographic and customer diversity ensures that we're not dependent on any one region, segment or customer for growth.
Now given our portfolio of safe, green and connected technology solutions, and our track record of flawless execution, we're increasingly becoming a strategic partner of choice for a number of our customers, which is reflected in our record bookings over the last few years.
Turning to Slide 9. These are just a few examples of launched programs driving revenue growth this past quarter. Our Electrical Architecture segment is benefiting from increased content on the BMW X5 with an onboard charger for plug-in hybrid powertrains. Also with BMW, our Powertrain division launched several components on the new Active Tourer. And the Electronics and Safety division is launching multiple programs, including short-range radar in the Kia Cadenza and infotainment content on the Lincoln MKX, Buick Excelle and Dodge Ram Truck.
Moving to Slide 10. As we highlighted in our Investor Day and was reinforced in Beijing last week, customer interest in electrification is gaining momentum. Our customers increasingly see the need for electrification of the Powertrain to close regulatory gaps on CO2 emissions and fuel economy, and 48-volt hybrids are the affordable, no-compromise solution. An optimized Electrical Architecture system is necessary for the electrification of today's vehicles, which is the very foundation for our 48-volt solution. Customer response has been strong for our total system solution, which represents approximately 4x the content opportunity compared to a traditional internal combustion engine for Delphi.
Now in addition to the 2 global customer programs we've already been awarded, we've received strong interest from several automakers to explore collaborating under the very interesting technology.
Turning to Slide 11. Delphi continues to be recognized for its technology leadership by both customers and industry experts. Delphi is proud to receive the first-ever General Motors Innovation Award for our V2X module, which will be introduced on the all-new Cadillac CT6. We are the first to market with this breakthrough technology. We also won our 18th Automotive News PACE Awards once again, leading the industry with 3 nominations. The Dual Role Hub is a custom USB application that enables Apple CarPlay, allowing the radio in an iPhone to be recognized simultaneously as a host device. It's the only solution on the market with this versatile functionality.
Leading in innovation is the foundation of our strategy for growth, and these industry awards are strong validation that we're solving our customers' most challenging problems with industry-leading technologies. 
Moving to Slide 12. Before I hand things over to Joe, I want to underscore commitment to driving consistent, sustainable and importantly, profitable growth. Since our IPO, we've completed several transactions that enhance our technology portfolio and better positioned us for the future. Our advanced technologies are aligned to the mega trends of safe, green and connected, positioning us for accelerated revenue growth.
Our lean cost structure and global footprint allows us to further leverage both our scale and regional capabilities to drive revenue growth and margin expansion. And lastly, we will continue to execute a very balanced and very disciplined capital allocation strategy to drive increased shareholder returns. Our track record conveys our execution capabilities, and we are very confident we will deliver continued outperformance for years to come.
I now want to turn the call over to Joe."

I'll start by covering our first quarter performance and then discuss our second quarter and full year 2016 guidance.Let's start with Slide 14 with a snapshot of our first quarter financial performance.",1078,"Great. Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by covering our first quarter performance and then discuss our second quarter and full year 2016 guidance.
Let's start with Slide 14 with a snapshot of our first quarter financial performance. As Kevin mentioned, we were pleased with our results, which reflected both strong revenue and earnings growth. Revenue was up 7% or 6% adjusted for currency, commodity, acquisitions and divestitures. Our operating margins expanded 20 basis points. Earnings per share grew 12%, largely the result of increased net income. And in the quarter, we purchased 5.6 million shares totaling $370 million. The adjusted tax rate was 18% for the quarter.
Slide 15 provides greater detail of revenue for the quarter. Starting on the left, you can see we had strong sales growth, including the impact of M&A, primarily HellermannTyton, which had organic growth of 13% in the first quarter. 
Foreign exchange and commodities were a slightly bigger headwind, primarily driven by dollar strengthening against the Chinese RMB and the price of copper. 
Moving to the right. North America, Europe and Asia saw strong growth in both -- on both the reported as well as on adjusted basis. And as you can see, the South American market remains very weak, and we are not planning on a near-term recovery.
Accordingly, we have taken significant steps in the past year to reduce our South American footprint and cost structure, including exiting our business in Argentina and reducing the number of Brazilian manufacturing facilities from 9 to 4. And while we remain able to serve our global customers in South America, we have significantly reduced the impact of the market downturn on Delphi.
Turning to operating income. Slide 16 walks the year-over-year change for the first quarter. Our operating results are consistent with our expectations. Strong flow-through from volume growth contributed to margin expansion in the quarter, helping to offset the impacts of launching growth-related activities on our net performance. The impact of a China volume ramp and the added cost to support new program launches in E&S and EEA totaled approximately $35 million in the quarter. The China inefficiencies discussed previously represented approximately $5 million in Q1 and will not have an impact going forward. The remaining launch costs will further moderate over the course of the year and continue to be factored into our full year 2016 guidance.
Slide 17 takes us through the performance by segment. Electrical Architecture had adjusted growth of 5%, and HellermannTyton contributed approximately $200 million of revenue in the quarter. EEA margins expanded 70 basis points year-over-year. 
Powertrain also delivered 5% organic growth driven by gas systems, partially offset by lower commercial vehicle volumes. And Powertrain continues to deliver strong margins despite nearly 40 basis points of FX headwinds, primarily driven by the Chinese RMB. Electronics and Safety organic growth accelerated to 13% on new program launches, particularly in active safety and infotainment programs in Europe and China, partially offset by lower mechatronic sales, which represented a 3% negative impact on E&S growth in the quarter.
Active safety and infotainment continued to see strong growth of approximately 70% and 10%, respectively. Our E&S margins of 10.3% were as expected and reflect the launch related activities I just discussed.
As it relates to the remainder of 2016, we expect continued strong growth from new launches and from margins to expand over the course of the year as we ramp production volumes and improve performance.
Turning now to Slide 18. We saw total EPS growth of $0.15 or 12% for the quarter, including $0.11 from increased earnings. Share repurchases contributed $0.07, more than offsetting the impact of a higher tax rate. As you know, the tax rate can vary very from quarter-to-quarter, however, there is no change to our 17% full-year estimate. 
Now turning to the outlook on Page 19. As Kevin mentioned, given the puts and takes, there are no changes to the 2016 guidance. Revenue is driven by accelerating organic growth throughout the year and the full year effect of the HellermannTyton acquisition. We expect to expand margins by roughly 50 basis points, and 2016 EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.80 to $6.10, reflecting year-over-year growth of 14%. 
Second quarter revenue was forecast in the range of our $4.125 billion to $4.225 billion. This includes the impact of the supply disruptions from the Japanese earthquakes, estimated to be $75 million of revenue and $20 million of operating income at the midpoint of our guidance. While we continue to monitor and assess the potential impacts, conversations with our customers indicate that any near-term production disruptions will be made up over the balance of the year.
We expect second quarter EPS in the range of $1.50 to $1.60, up 16% of the midpoint, which includes the impact from the earthquake supply disruptions. Our strong balance sheet and capital allocation strategy outlined on Slide 20 remains an important leverage to enhance shareholder value. 
On the left, we expect cash flow from operations to grow approximately $2 billion, up almost 20% from 2015. And the deployment priorities on the right are consistent with our strategy, maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade rating.
We're investing in our business to increase capital expenditures, supporting new program launches, information systems that increase efficiency and productivity and ongoing footprint rotation to best-cost countries. We're committed to paying a competitive dividend, and to the extent we have excess cash, we have a track record of returning it to shareholders via share repurchases, as evidenced by the $370 million of repurchases we did in the first quarter.
As we state here today, we do not expect repurchases to continue with the first quarter pace. However, would tend to be opportunistic while remaining committed to executing a balanced and disciplined capital allocation framework.
Now before I hand things back to Kevin, turning to Slide 21. We are focused on executing value enhancing portfolio modifications. As such, in the quarter, we completed the final step of the divestiture of the thermal business, with the sale of our stake in the Chinese joint venture. And we've acquired PureDepth, the leading provider of patented 3D multi-layer display technology. You can expect us to continue to pursue investments that enhance our existing technology portfolio, strengthen our competitive position and drive increased value for our shareholders.
I'll now turn it over to Kevin for some closing remarks before we open up the call to questions."

We remain disciplined in our allocation of capital, investing in both organic and inorganic growth, and returning excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Through all of this, we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver on our commitments even against the backdrop of a dynamic environment.

So we all have a vested interest in ensuring there's as much visibility as possible, and that we're working together to resolve the problem to ensure that our OEs have the product to build the car. Joe, maybe you can comment more on the numbers."

Well, I think, from a -- again, as  we look at the numbers, obviously, a lot of dialogue with the suppliers. We have 2 suppliers, one is a little bit more significant than the other, that's impacted here. Obviously, talked to the customers as well. I would say the -- to put it in perspective, if you can take back to the tsunami, there you had physical damage to manufacturing facilities, and that tended to be over a longer period of time. What we've been told so far and what we're seeing, this is more a case of damage to in-process inventory than the facilities themselves, so that gives us some confidence that the delays will be both shorter term in nature and recovery should be quicker. At the midpoint, we've estimated $75 million of revenue. That includes both direct, and that's about 50-50, both direct impact as well as indirect. So direct would be where we don't have supply and can't ship to a customer. Indirect, and GM is a good example of that, would be a case where a customer has told us they're impacted by another supplier, it won't be producing, so they're probably not going to ship to them either. At the high end, it could be $100 million of revenue and close to $30 million of OI. That's reflected in the low end of our guidance. So high end of Japanese risk, low end of our guidance. At the high end of our guidance range, it's about $50 million of revenue and $10 million of OI."

The balance is hybrid and 48-Volt, and our estimate is 48-volt is roughly half, so call it 9 or 10 points. I think that reflects fairly rapid growth on the hybrid and 48-volt side. If you look at IHS and based on conversations with customers, that mix of EV and hybrids out in 2025 has actually increased over the last 6 months. And listen, I say, there's maybe an opportunity that accelerates further. Clearly, there's more dialogue and more interest from our customers as they focus on solutions to reducing CO2 emissions and increasing fuel economy. And things like 48-volt, where you can get a significant benefit at a fraction of the cost, it's a great value proposition. It's a terrific value proposition. So we're having increasing dialogue, and it's really across the globe. It's not just in Europe and in North America. There's actually a couple of customers in China that we're working with now on 48-volt systems solutions.

So we have the full portfolio that we can provide to our customer base in region, and we can meet their needs from a design standpoint as well as a cost standpoint. And I think that starts with Electrical Architecture. I think it's augmented with inverse and converters, battery packs, things like that, that we can bring to bear. And those products that we don't manufacture today, like electric motors, there are partners that we're using strategically to sell the whole system solution. When you look at the market, if there's a market that is right for electrification, where it should be easier to implement, it's the China market. Based on discussions with both the globals as well as the local OEs, everyone is convinced that the government is focused on enforcing regulations and reducing CO2 emissions and addressing the pollution problem. So enforcement this there. The infrastructure investment is easy to make. And from a growth standpoint, it's probably -- it probably is one of the biggest opportunities.

And then second is the regulatory/legal environment, and how you cross those bridges. I mean, as we said in the past, the biggest challenge to get to fully automated is not going to be the technology or the cost, it's really going to be regulation and legal liability. I think the important thing from our perspective as we said -- we look at automated driving as, quite frankly, the far end of the spectrum and active safety. And what excites us most is getting to level 2 automated driving, which is fully commercializable today. You can get to 80% of the active safety benefits, so really at a fraction of the cost. And that is really why we're seeing the tremendous demand for active safety solutions. As Joe mentioned in his comments, our active safety revenues grew 70% in the quarter.

Before Joe gets to our financial results, I'd like to provide some color of what was a great quarter for Delphi.So let's begin with the highlights on Slide 5. In summary, we had anothe",1417,"Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before Joe gets to our financial results, I'd like to provide some color of what was a great quarter for Delphi.
So let's begin with the highlights on Slide 5. In summary, we had another very solid quarter, meeting our commitments in delivering strong revenue and earnings growth. Adjusted revenue growth was 6%, driven by market share and content gains across the portfolio. Operating income increased to $509 million, margins expanded 20 basis points to 12.6%, and earnings per share increased 12% to $1.36. And lastly, we returned approximately $450 million of cash to shareholders.
We remain very confident in our 2016 guidance as originally communicated back in January. There is nothing we see today that changes our view of the underlying macro environment, with something stronger offsetting shortfalls elsewhere. I'll touch on the macros in greater detail on the next slide.
The ramp-up of new program launches will continue to drive accelerated revenue growth, and a strong focus on leveraging our robust business model will enable us to flex our cost structure to meet the challenges of virtually any environment.
In addition, we've made a number of important announcements during our recent investor update meeting in London. We unveiled a 48-volt vehicle solution, which improves the engine performance while lowering CO2 emissions by more than 10%. I'll cover this in more detail later. We also announced the IRS Section 7874 issues behind us, and that we've prevailed in our appeal contending that Delphi should be treated as a U.K. tax entity under the U.S. tax code. And we announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program. Coupled with the recent dividend increase, this underscores confidence in our medium- and long-term outlook, which is driven by the safe, green and connected mega trends that are creating new revenue opportunities for Delphi, continued material manufacturing performance which is funding incremental growth investments and driving margin expansion, which will translate into cash flow generation, providing additional levers to drive shareholder value.
During the quarter, we also acquired PureDepth, Inc., the leading provider of multi-layer 3D display technology. Our collaboration with PureDepth was on display at the Consumer Electronics Show in a concept Mustang, which has driven significant customer interest.
Slide 6 is an update on our view of the macro environment, which as I just mentioned, continued to remain balanced relative to the assumptions underlying our 2016 guidance. I'll hit a few of the highlights. Starting with positives on the left, regulatory trends and consumer demands continue to influence fuel economy, emissions and vehicle safety standards, driving content per vehicle growth. And we continue to expect steady growth in global vehicle production driven by continued growth in China, North America and Western Europe. 
Moving to the middle of the chart. Consistent with our initial planning assumptions, we expect commodities and pricing to remain relatively neutral for the balance of the year. While we're currently seeing a slightly stronger euro, this is being more than offset by the weakened Chinese RMB, with China being a meaningful part of our business. 
Moving to the challenges on the right, we've seen further declines in vehicle production in both South America and Eastern Europe, and increased weakness in the global commercial vehicle market, now expected to be down low single digits driven by double-digit declines in the North American off-highway market. 
Lastly, we're working closely with our suppliers and OEM customers to mitigate any near-term supply disruptions due to the recent earthquakes in Japan, which will affect the second quarter but will be made up during the balance of the year. Joe will provide more context on this a little bit later. Given the various puts and takes, our overall outlook remains in line with our prior guidance.
More on China on Slide 7. I just returned from the Beijing Auto Show, where I met with several of our top customers. We heard a relatively consistent view with the China market. Both global and local OEMs remained very confident China will continue to drive increased global vehicle production, estimating 2016 growth in the 4% to 6% range, resulting from continued strong demand for SUVs and crossovers. There's also increasing dialogue regarding new energy vehicles and electrification in this market, which given our product portfolio provides further revenue opportunities. Delphi remains well positioned in this market, and expects to grow 10 to 12 points above vehicle production in 2016, benefiting from market share gains and the trend towards higher content vehicle.
Growth in the China markets reflected in our new business bookings on Slide 8, which totaled approximately $7 billion during the first quarter. We had a number of important customer bookings as well as several conquest wins, including a major Electrical Architecture win with FCA on the Ram Truck in North America; Powertrain wins with Changhong in China; and Ford in North America; and key infotainment wins with Volkswagen in North America as well as with SGM in China. 
The right side of the chart reflects the balanced geographic mix of our bookings, which would drive strong revenue growth over the next few years. The increased geographic and customer diversity ensures that we're not dependent on any one region, segment or customer for growth.
Now given our portfolio of safe, green and connected technology solutions, and our track record of flawless execution, we're increasingly becoming a strategic partner of choice for a number of our customers, which is reflected in our record bookings over the last few years.
Turning to Slide 9. These are just a few examples of launched programs driving revenue growth this past quarter. Our Electrical Architecture segment is benefiting from increased content on the BMW X5 with an onboard charger for plug-in hybrid powertrains. Also with BMW, our Powertrain division launched several components on the new Active Tourer. And the Electronics and Safety division is launching multiple programs, including short-range radar in the Kia Cadenza and infotainment content on the Lincoln MKX, Buick Excelle and Dodge Ram Truck.
Moving to Slide 10. As we highlighted in our Investor Day and was reinforced in Beijing last week, customer interest in electrification is gaining momentum. Our customers increasingly see the need for electrification of the Powertrain to close regulatory gaps on CO2 emissions and fuel economy, and 48-volt hybrids are at affordable, no-compromise solution. An optimized Electrical Architecture system is necessary for the electrification of today's vehicles, which is the very foundation for our 48-volt solution. Customer response has been strong for our total system solution, which represents approximately 4x the content opportunity compared to a traditional internal combustion engine for Delphi.
Now in addition to the 2 global customer programs we've already been awarded, we've received strong interest from several automakers to explore collaborating on this very interesting technology.
Turning to Slide 11. Delphi continues to be recognized for its technology leadership by both customers and industry experts. Delphi is proud to have received the first-ever General Motors Innovation Award for our V2X module, which will be introduced on the all-new Cadillac CT6. We are the first to market with this breakthrough technology. We also won our 18th Automotive News PACE Award after once again, leading the industry with 3 nominations. The Dual Role Hub is a custom USB application that enables Apple CarPlay, allowing the radio in an iPhone to be recognized simultaneously as a host device. It's the only solution on the market with this versatile functionality.
Leading in innovation is the foundation of our strategy for growth, and these industry awards are strong validation that we're solving our customers' most challenging problems with industry-leading technologies. 
Moving to Slide 12. Before I hand things over to Joe, I want to underscore a commitment to driving consistent, sustainable and importantly, profitable growth. Since our IPO, we've completed several transactions that enhance our technology portfolio and better positioned us for the future. Our advanced technologies are aligned to the mega trends of safe, green and connected, positioning us for accelerated revenue growth.
Our lean cost structure and global footprint allows us to further leverage both our scale and regional capabilities to drive revenue growth and margin expansion. And lastly, we will continue to execute a very balanced and very disciplined capital allocation strategy to drive increased shareholder returns. Our track record conveys our execution capabilities, and we are very confident we will deliver continued outperformance for years to come.
I now want to turn the call over to Joe."

I'll start by covering our first quarter performance and then discuss our second quarter and full year 2016 guidance.Let's start on Slide 14 with a snapshot of our first quarter financial performance. As Kev",1076,"Great. Thanks, Kevin, good morning, everyone. I'll start by covering our first quarter performance and then discuss our second quarter and full year 2016 guidance.
Let's start on Slide 14 with a snapshot of our first quarter financial performance. As Kevin mentioned, we were pleased with our results, which reflected both strong revenue and earnings growth. Revenue was up 7% or 6% adjusted for currency, commodity, acquisitions and divestitures. Our operating margins expanded 20 basis points. Earnings per share grew 12%, largely the result of increased net income. And in the quarter, we purchased 5.6 million shares totaling $370 million. The adjusted tax rate was 18% for the quarter.
Slide 15 provides greater detail of revenue for the quarter. Starting on the left, you can see we had strong sales growth, including the impact of M&A, primarily HellermannTyton, which had organic growth of 13% in the first quarter. 
Foreign exchange and commodities were a slightly bigger headwind, primarily driven by dollar strengthening against the Chinese RMB and the price of copper. 
Moving to the right. North America, Europe and Asia saw strong growth in both -- on both the reported as well as on adjusted basis. And as you can see, the South American market remains very weak, and we are not planning on a near-term recovery.
Accordingly, we have taken significant steps in the past year to reduce our South American footprint and cost structure, including exiting our business in Argentina and reducing the number of Brazilian manufacturing facilities from 9 to 4. And while we remain able to serve our global customers in South America, we have significantly reduced the impact of the market downturn on Delphi.
Turning to operating income. Slide 16 walks the year-over-year change for the first quarter. Our operating results are consistent with our expectations. Strong flow-through from volume growth contributed to margin expansion in the quarter, helping to offset the impacts of launching growth-related activities on our net performance. The impact of the China volume ramp and the added cost to support new program launches in E&S and EEA totaled approximately $35 million in the quarter. The China inefficiencies discussed previously represented approximately $5 million in Q1 and will not have an impact going forward. The remaining launch costs will further moderate over the course of the year and continue to be factored into our full year 2016 guidance.
Slide 17 takes us through the performance by segment. Electrical Architecture had adjusted growth of 5%, and HellermannTyton contributed approximately $200 million of revenue in the quarter. EEA margins expanded 70 basis points year-over-year. 
Powertrain also delivered 5% organic growth driven by gas systems, partially offset by lower commercial vehicle volumes. And Powertrain continues to deliver strong margins despite nearly 40 basis points of FX headwinds, primarily driven by the Chinese RMB. Electronics and Safety organic growth accelerated to 13% on new program launches, particularly in active safety and infotainment programs in Europe and China, partially offset by lower mechatronic sales, which represented a 3% negative impact on E&S growth in the quarter.
Active safety and infotainment continued to see strong growth of approximately 70% and 10%, respectively. Our E&S margins of 10.3% were as expected and reflect the launch related activities I just discussed.
As it relates to the remainder of 2016, we expect continued strong growth from new launches and from margins to expand over the course of the year as we ramp production volumes and improve performance.
Turning now to Slide 18. We saw total EPS growth of $0.15 or 12% for the quarter, including $0.11 from increased earnings. Share repurchases contributed $0.07, more than offsetting the impact of a higher tax rate. As you know, the tax rate can vary from quarter-to-quarter, however, there is no change to our 17% full-year estimate. 
Now turning to the outlook on Page 19. As Kevin mentioned, given the puts and takes, there are no changes to the 2016 guidance. Revenue is driven by accelerating organic growth throughout the year and the full year effect of the HellermannTyton acquisition. We expect to expand margins by roughly 50 basis points, and 2016 EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.80 to $6.10, reflecting year-over-year growth of 14%. 
Second quarter revenue was forecast in the range of $4.125 billion to $4.225 billion. This includes the impact of the supply disruptions from the Japanese earthquakes, estimated to be $75 million of revenue and $20 million of operating income at the midpoint of our guidance. While we continue to monitor and assess the potential impacts, conversations with our customers indicate that any near-term production disruptions will be made up over the balance of the year.
We expect second quarter EPS in the range of $1.50 to $1.60, up 16% of the midpoint, which includes the impact from the earthquake supply disruptions. Our strong balance sheet and capital allocation strategy outlined on Slide 20 remains an important leverage to enhance shareholder value. 
On the left, we expect cash flow from operations to grow approximately $2 billion, up almost 20% from 2015. And the deployment priorities on the right are consistent with our strategy, maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade rating.
We're investing in our business to increase capital expenditures, supporting new program launches, information systems that increase efficiency and productivity and ongoing footprint rotation to best-cost countries. We are committed to paying a competitive dividend, and to the extent we have excess cash, we have a track record of returning it to shareholders via share repurchases, as evidenced by the $370 million of repurchases we did in the first quarter.
As we sit here today, we do not expect repurchases to continue with the first quarter pace. However, we intend to be opportunistic while remaining committed to executing a balanced and disciplined capital allocation framework.
Now before I hand things back to Kevin, turning to Slide 21. We are focused on executing value enhancing portfolio modifications. As such, in the quarter, we completed the final step of the divestiture of the thermal business, with the sale of our stake in the Chinese joint venture. And we've acquired PureDepth, the leading provider of patented 3D multi-layer display technology. You can expect us to continue to pursue investments that enhance our existing technology portfolio, strengthen our competitive position and drive increased value for our shareholders.
I'll now turn it over to Kevin for some closing remarks before we open up the call to questions."

We remain disciplined in our allocation of capital, investing in both organic and inorganic growth, and returning excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.

At the midpoint, we've estimated $75 million of revenue. That includes both direct, and that's about 50-50, both direct impact as well as indirect. So direct would be where we don't have supply and can't ship to a customer. Indirect, and GM's a good example of that, would be a case where a customer has told us they were impacted by another supplier and won't be producing, so they're -- probably we're not going to ship to them either.

Because there've been some articles recently discussing how -- whereas Europe was maybe behind Japan and the U.S. in terms of electrification, that maybe now there's going to be a big inflection. So perhaps, remind what is embedded in the long-term guidance from the Analyst Day, relative to electrification in Europe. And I'm curious if it already incorporates a big increase, or whether there might be a more upside based upon your latest conversations?"

The balance is hybrid and 48-volt, and our estimate is 48-volt is roughly half, so call it 9 or 10 points. I think that reflects fairly rapid growth on the hybrid and 48-volt side. If you look at IHS and based on conversations with customers, that mix of EV and hybrids out in 2025 has actually increased over the last 6 months. And listen, I'd say there's maybe an opportunity that accelerates further. Clearly, there's more dialogue and more interest from our customers as they focus on solutions to reducing CO2 emissions and increasing fuel economy. And things like 48-volt, where you can get a significant benefit at a fraction of the cost, it's a great value proposition. It's a terrific value proposition. So we're having increasing dialogue, and it's really across the globe. It's not just in Europe and in North America. There's actually a couple of customers in China that we're working with now on 48-volt systems solutions. And what positions us really, really well, as you think about it, being in the Powertrain business and the Electronics and Safety and then importantly, in that Electrical Architecture business, we actually have solutions to every single aspect you need to provide a complete system solution to the OE."

So when you think about it, let me start with -- as you know, David, you were just there. We've been in the China market for close to 25 years, serving the China market, and when you look at our capabilities everywhere from engineering, design, development to manufacturing, I would say there isn't a supplier out there that has the same capabilities. And we're localized in virtually all of our product lines. I think of our 33 product lines, where 30 or 31 are localized. So we have the full portfolio that we can provide to our customer base in region, and we can meet their needs from a design standpoint as well as a cost standpoint. And I think that starts with Electrical Architecture. I think it's augmented with inverters and converters, battery packs, things like that, that we can bring to bear. And those products that we don't manufacture today, like electric motors, there are partners that we're using strategically to sell the whole system solution. When you look at the market, if there's a market that is right for electrification, where it should be easier to implement, it's the China market. Based on discussions with both the globals as well as the local OEs, everyone is convinced that the government is focused on enforcing regulations and reducing CO2 emissions and addressing the pollution problem. So enforcement is there. The infrastructure investment is easy to make. And from a growth standpoint, it's probably -- it probably is one of the biggest opportunities. We'll see how quickly it comes to fruition, though, at this point in time."

I think the challenge for both customers as well as folks like ourselves are kind of twofold: near term, it's cost and how do we sell a commercially effective solution. And then second, it's the regulatory/legal environment, and how you cross those bridges. I mean, as we said in the past, the biggest challenge to get to fully automated is not going to be the technology or the cost, it's really going to be regulation and legal liability. I think the important thing from our perspective, as we said, we look at automated driving as, quite frankly, the far end of the spectrum on active safety. And what excites us most is getting to level 2 automated driving, which is fully commercializable today. You can get to 80% of the active safety benefits, so really at a fraction of the cost. And that is really why we're seeing the tremendous demand for active safety solutions. As Joe mentioned in his comments, our active safety revenues grew 70% in the quarter. And we expect, from a compounded growth rate standpoint, over the next few years, to grow up roughly 50%. And it's that sort of cost benefit analysis that's driving that growth."

So there is some transactional FX that impact that business. That's really what's driving that 40 basis points. That's going to be very RMB-dependent. I would say apart from that, we are seeing the margin progression in Powertrain that we would expect to, just given the volume increases and our typical levels of expected performance.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before Joe gets to our financial results, I'd like to provide some color of what was a great quarter for Delphi.So let's begin with the highlights on Slide 5. In summary, we had anothe",1417,"Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before Joe gets to our financial results, I'd like to provide some color of what was a great quarter for Delphi.
So let's begin with the highlights on Slide 5. In summary, we had another very solid quarter, meeting our commitments in delivering strong revenue and earnings growth. Adjusted revenue growth was 6%, driven by market share and content gains across the portfolio. Operating income increased to $509 million, margins expanded 20 basis points to 12.6%, and earnings per share increased 12% to $1.36. And lastly, we returned approximately $450 million of cash to shareholders.
We remain very confident in our 2016 guidance as originally communicated back in January. There is nothing we see today that changes our view of the underlying macro environment, with something stronger offsetting shortfalls elsewhere. I'll touch on the macros in greater detail on the next slide.
The ramp-up of new program launches will continue to drive accelerated revenue growth, and a strong focus on leveraging our robust business model will enable us to flex our cost structure to meet the challenges of virtually any environment.
In addition, we've made a number of important announcements during our recent investor update meeting in London. We unveiled a 48-volt vehicle solution, which improves the engine performance while lowering CO2 emissions by more than 10%. I'll cover this in more detail later. We also announced the IRS Section 7874 issues behind us, and that we've prevailed in our appeal contending that Delphi should be treated as a U.K. tax entity under the U.S. tax code. And we announced a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program. Coupled with the recent dividend increase, this underscores confidence in our medium- and long-term outlook, which is driven by the safe, green and connected mega trends that are creating new revenue opportunities for Delphi, continued material manufacturing performance which is funding incremental growth investments and driving margin expansion, which will translate into cash flow generation, providing additional levers to drive shareholder value.
During the quarter, we also acquired PureDepth, Inc., the leading provider of multi-layer 3D display technology. Our collaboration with PureDepth was on display at the Consumer Electronics Show in a concept Mustang, which has driven significant customer interest.
Slide 6 is an update on our view of the macro environment, which as I just mentioned, continued to remain balanced relative to the assumptions underlying our 2016 guidance. I'll hit a few of the highlights. Starting with positives on the left, regulatory trends and consumer demands continue to influence fuel economy, emissions and vehicle safety standards, driving content per vehicle growth. And we continue to expect steady growth in global vehicle production driven by continued growth in China, North America and Western Europe. 
Moving to the middle of the chart. Consistent with our initial planning assumptions, we expect commodities and pricing to remain relatively neutral for the balance of the year. While we're currently seeing a slightly stronger euro, this is being more than offset by the weakened Chinese RMB, with China being a meaningful part of our business. 
Moving to the challenges on the right, we've seen further declines in vehicle production in both South America and Eastern Europe, and increased weakness in the global commercial vehicle market, now expected to be down low single digits driven by double-digit declines in the North American off-highway market. 
Lastly, we're working closely with our suppliers and OEM customers to mitigate any near-term supply disruptions due to the recent earthquakes in Japan, which will affect the second quarter but will be made up during the balance of the year. Joe will provide more context on this a little bit later. Given the various puts and takes, our overall outlook remains in line with our prior guidance.
More on China on Slide 7. I just returned from the Beijing Auto Show, where I met with several of our top customers. We heard a relatively consistent view with the China market. Both global and local OEMs remained very confident China will continue to drive increased global vehicle production, estimating 2016 growth in the 4% to 6% range, resulting from continued strong demand for SUVs and crossovers. There's also increasing dialogue regarding new energy vehicles and electrification in this market, which given our product portfolio provides further revenue opportunities. Delphi remains well positioned in this market, and expects to grow 10 to 12 points above vehicle production in 2016, benefiting from market share gains and the trend towards higher content vehicle.
Growth in the China markets reflected in our new business bookings on Slide 8, which totaled approximately $7 billion during the first quarter. We had a number of important customer bookings as well as several conquest wins, including a major Electrical Architecture win with FCA on the Ram Truck in North America; Powertrain wins with Changhong in China; and Ford in North America; and key infotainment wins with Volkswagen in North America as well as with SGM in China. 
The right side of the chart reflects the balanced geographic mix of our bookings, which would drive strong revenue growth over the next few years. The increased geographic and customer diversity ensures that we're not dependent on any one region, segment or customer for growth.
Now given our portfolio of safe, green and connected technology solutions, and our track record of flawless execution, we're increasingly becoming a strategic partner of choice for a number of our customers, which is reflected in our record bookings over the last few years.
Turning to Slide 9. These are just a few examples of launched programs driving revenue growth this past quarter. Our Electrical Architecture segment is benefiting from increased content on the BMW X5 with an onboard charger for plug-in hybrid powertrains. Also with BMW, our Powertrain division launched several components on the new Active Tourer. And the Electronics and Safety division is launching multiple programs, including short-range radar in the Kia Cadenza and infotainment content on the Lincoln MKX, Buick Excelle and Dodge Ram Truck.
Moving to Slide 10. As we highlighted in our Investor Day and was reinforced in Beijing last week, customer interest in electrification is gaining momentum. Our customers increasingly see the need for electrification of the Powertrain to close regulatory gaps on CO2 emissions and fuel economy, and 48-volt hybrids are at affordable, no-compromise solution. An optimized Electrical Architecture system is necessary for the electrification of today's vehicles, which is the very foundation for our 48-volt solution. Customer response has been strong for our total system solution, which represents approximately 4x the content opportunity compared to a traditional internal combustion engine for Delphi.
Now in addition to the 2 global customer programs we've already been awarded, we've received strong interest from several automakers to explore collaborating on this very interesting technology.
Turning to Slide 11. Delphi continues to be recognized for its technology leadership by both customers and industry experts. Delphi is proud to have received the first-ever General Motors Innovation Award for our V2X module, which will be introduced on the all-new Cadillac CT6. We are the first to market with this breakthrough technology. We also won our 18th Automotive News PACE Award after once again, leading the industry with 3 nominations. The Dual Role Hub is a custom USB application that enables Apple CarPlay, allowing the radio in an iPhone to be recognized simultaneously as a host device. It's the only solution on the market with this versatile functionality.
Leading in innovation is the foundation of our strategy for growth, and these industry awards are strong validation that we're solving our customers' most challenging problems with industry-leading technologies. 
Moving to Slide 12. Before I hand things over to Joe, I want to underscore a commitment to driving consistent, sustainable and importantly, profitable growth. Since our IPO, we've completed several transactions that enhance our technology portfolio and better positioned us for the future. Our advanced technologies are aligned to the mega trends of safe, green and connected, positioning us for accelerated revenue growth.
Our lean cost structure and global footprint allows us to further leverage both our scale and regional capabilities to drive revenue growth and margin expansion. And lastly, we will continue to execute a very balanced and very disciplined capital allocation strategy to drive increased shareholder returns. Our track record conveys our execution capabilities, and we are very confident we will deliver continued outperformance for years to come.
I now want to turn the call over to Joe."
59502420,331536973,974104,"Delphi Automotive PLC, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Aptiv PLC","Executives","Great. Thanks, Kevin, good morning, everyone. I'll start by covering our first quarter performance and then discuss our second quarter and full year 2016 guidance.Let's start on Slide 14 with a snapshot of our first quarter financial performance. As Kev",1076,"Great. Thanks, Kevin, good morning, everyone. I'll start by covering our first quarter performance and then discuss our second quarter and full year 2016 guidance.
Let's start on Slide 14 with a snapshot of our first quarter financial performance. As Kevin mentioned, we were pleased with our results, which reflected both strong revenue and earnings growth. Revenue was up 7% or 6% adjusted for currency, commodity, acquisitions and divestitures. Our operating margins expanded 20 basis points. Earnings per share grew 12%, largely the result of increased net income. And in the quarter, we purchased 5.6 million shares totaling $370 million. The adjusted tax rate was 18% for the quarter.
Slide 15 provides greater detail of revenue for the quarter. Starting on the left, you can see we had strong sales growth, including the impact of M&A, primarily HellermannTyton, which had organic growth of 13% in the first quarter. 
Foreign exchange and commodities were a slightly bigger headwind, primarily driven by dollar strengthening against the Chinese RMB and the price of copper. 
Moving to the right. North America, Europe and Asia saw strong growth in both -- on both the reported as well as on adjusted basis. And as you can see, the South American market remains very weak, and we are not planning on a near-term recovery.
Accordingly, we have taken significant steps in the past year to reduce our South American footprint and cost structure, including exiting our business in Argentina and reducing the number of Brazilian manufacturing facilities from 9 to 4. And while we remain able to serve our global customers in South America, we have significantly reduced the impact of the market downturn on Delphi.
Turning to operating income. Slide 16 walks the year-over-year change for the first quarter. Our operating results are consistent with our expectations. Strong flow-through from volume growth contributed to margin expansion in the quarter, helping to offset the impacts of launching growth-related activities on our net performance. The impact of the China volume ramp and the added cost to support new program launches in E&S and EEA totaled approximately $35 million in the quarter. The China inefficiencies discussed previously represented approximately $5 million in Q1 and will not have an impact going forward. The remaining launch costs will further moderate over the course of the year and continue to be factored into our full year 2016 guidance.
Slide 17 takes us through the performance by segment. Electrical Architecture had adjusted growth of 5%, and HellermannTyton contributed approximately $200 million of revenue in the quarter. EEA margins expanded 70 basis points year-over-year. 
Powertrain also delivered 5% organic growth driven by gas systems, partially offset by lower commercial vehicle volumes. And Powertrain continues to deliver strong margins despite nearly 40 basis points of FX headwinds, primarily driven by the Chinese RMB. Electronics and Safety organic growth accelerated to 13% on new program launches, particularly in active safety and infotainment programs in Europe and China, partially offset by lower mechatronic sales, which represented a 3% negative impact on E&S growth in the quarter.
Active safety and infotainment continued to see strong growth of approximately 70% and 10%, respectively. Our E&S margins of 10.3% were as expected and reflect the launch related activities I just discussed.
As it relates to the remainder of 2016, we expect continued strong growth from new launches and from margins to expand over the course of the year as we ramp production volumes and improve performance.
Turning now to Slide 18. We saw total EPS growth of $0.15 or 12% for the quarter, including $0.11 from increased earnings. Share repurchases contributed $0.07, more than offsetting the impact of a higher tax rate. As you know, the tax rate can vary from quarter-to-quarter, however, there is no change to our 17% full-year estimate. 
Now turning to the outlook on Page 19. As Kevin mentioned, given the puts and takes, there are no changes to the 2016 guidance. Revenue is driven by accelerating organic growth throughout the year and the full year effect of the HellermannTyton acquisition. We expect to expand margins by roughly 50 basis points, and 2016 EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.80 to $6.10, reflecting year-over-year growth of 14%. 
Second quarter revenue was forecast in the range of $4.125 billion to $4.225 billion. This includes the impact of the supply disruptions from the Japanese earthquakes, estimated to be $75 million of revenue and $20 million of operating income at the midpoint of our guidance. While we continue to monitor and assess the potential impacts, conversations with our customers indicate that any near-term production disruptions will be made up over the balance of the year.
We expect second quarter EPS in the range of $1.50 to $1.60, up 16% of the midpoint, which includes the impact from the earthquake supply disruptions. Our strong balance sheet and capital allocation strategy outlined on Slide 20 remains an important leverage to enhance shareholder value. 
On the left, we expect cash flow from operations to grow approximately $2 billion, up almost 20% from 2015. And the deployment priorities on the right are consistent with our strategy, maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade rating.
We're investing in our business to increase capital expenditures, supporting new program launches, information systems that increase efficiency and productivity and ongoing footprint rotation to best-cost countries. We are committed to paying a competitive dividend, and to the extent we have excess cash, we have a track record of returning it to shareholders via share repurchases, as evidenced by the $370 million of repurchases we did in the first quarter.
As we sit here today, we do not expect repurchases to continue with the first quarter pace. However, we intend to be opportunistic while remaining committed to executing a balanced and disciplined capital allocation framework.
Now before I hand things back to Kevin, turning to Slide 21. We are focused on executing value enhancing portfolio modifications. As such, in the quarter, we completed the final step of the divestiture of the thermal business, with the sale of our stake in the Chinese joint venture. And we've acquired PureDepth, the leading provider of patented 3D multi-layer display technology. You can expect us to continue to pursue investments that enhance our existing technology portfolio, strengthen our competitive position and drive increased value for our shareholders.
I'll now turn it over to Kevin for some closing remarks before we open up the call to questions."

Now summarizing on Slide 21. We delivered another strong quarter, executing on the relevant advanced technologies that enable us to outgrow the markets we serve.
We believe we're well positioned to deliver on our commitments in 2016, high single-digit organic growth, roughly 50 basis points of margin expansion, solid mid-teens EPS growth and $1.2 billion of free cash flow. 
We continue to optimize our cost structure, increase the flexibility of our workforce and execute flawlessly. We're investing in profitable growth where we see opportunities. We remain disciplined in our allocation of capital, investing in both organic and inorganic growth, and returning excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.
Through all of this, we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver on our commitments even against the backdrop of a dynamic environment.
So with that, we'll now open up the line for questions."

I can tell you, at the Consumer Electronic Show, and I know you visited our booth, the 3D graphics on the cluster we had got more attention from our customers than any other technology that we showed at CES including our automated drive capabilities. So it is a very interesting technology that we're integrating into our cluster business. Where we sit today, we sell clusters, we sell center stacks, as you know, with infotainment systems, you're going to see more display, you're going to see more glass in cars, we're convinced of that. You're going to see that happen over the next 2, 3, 4, 5 years. And from our perspective, it's important that we're well situated, and we believe we are, and we can -- that's reflected in our strong infotainment wins.

What we've been told so far and what we're seeing, this is more a case of damage to in-process inventory than the facilities themselves, so that gives us some confidence that the delays will be both shorter term in nature and recovery should be quicker. At the midpoint, we've estimated $75 million of revenue. That includes both direct, and that's about 50-50, both direct impact as well as indirect. So direct would be where we don't have supply and can't ship to a customer. Indirect, and GM's a good example of that, would be a case where a customer has told us they were impacted by another supplier and won't be producing, so they're -- probably we're not going to ship to them either. At the high end, it could be $100 million of revenue and close to $30 million of OI. That's reflected in the low end of our guidance. So high end of Japanese risk, low end of our guidance.

And listen, I'd say there's maybe an opportunity that accelerates further. Clearly, there's more dialogue and more interest from our customers as they focus on solutions to reducing CO2 emissions and increasing fuel economy.

So we have the full portfolio that we can provide to our customer base in region, and we can meet their needs from a design standpoint as well as a cost standpoint. And I think that starts with Electrical Architecture. I think it's augmented with inverters and converters, battery packs, things like that, that we can bring to bear. And those products that we don't manufacture today, like electric motors, there are partners that we're using strategically to sell the whole system solution. When you look at the market, if there's a market that is right for electrification, where it should be easier to implement, it's the China market. Based on discussions with both the globals as well as the local OEs, everyone is convinced that the government is focused on enforcing regulations and reducing CO2 emissions and addressing the pollution problem.

I think the challenge for both customers as well as folks like ourselves are kind of twofold: near term, it's cost and how do we sell a commercially effective solution. And then second, it's the regulatory/legal environment, and how you cross those bridges. I mean, as we said in the past, the biggest challenge to get to fully automated is not going to be the technology or the cost, it's really going to be regulation and legal liability. I think the important thing from our perspective, as we said, we look at automated driving as, quite frankly, the far end of the spectrum on active safety. And what excites us most is getting to level 2 automated driving, which is fully commercializable today. You can get to 80% of the active safety benefits, so really at a fraction of the cost. And that is really why we're seeing the tremendous demand for active safety solutions. As Joe mentioned in his comments, our active safety revenues grew 70% in the quarter. And we expect, from a compounded growth rate standpoint, over the next few years, to grow up roughly 50%. And it's that sort of cost benefit analysis that's driving that growth."

So there is some transactional FX that impact that business. That's really what's driving that 40 basis points. That's going to be very RMB-dependent. I would say apart from that, we are seeing the margin progression in Powertrain that we would expect to, just given the volume increases and our typical levels of expected performance.

It's why we have the 40 engineers in Silicon Valley. It's why I'm headed to Israel next week to meet with technology partners there. So it's certainly something that we need to be ready for.

Beginning with the second quarter highlights",1278,"So thank you, Elena. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Before Joe gets into our financial results, I'd like to provide some context around second quarter as well as our outlook for the full year. 
Beginning with the second quarter highlights on Slide 5. To summarize, we had a solid quarter, delivering accelerated revenue and earnings growth. Revenues increased 7%, driven by strong double-digit growth in our Electronics and Safety segment, which had over 40% growth in active safety revenue and high single-digit growth in Electrical Architecture. Powertrain revenues, however, were weaker than expected, principally due to lower heavy-duty and light-duty diesel lines. And we also experienced increased demand volatility with certain key local customers across our segment, impacting our growth in the China market, which we currently believe will continue into the second half of the year. 
Operating income increased to $577 million, and margins expanded to 13.7%, driven by both volume growth and continued cost structure optimization. These increases were partially offset by our continued investment in engineering and information systems to fund growth initiatives as well as some recent manufacturing inefficiencies in our Electrical Architecture segment that we're working through. Joe's going to provide more color on these in a few minutes. 
Earnings per share increased 19% to $1.59 a share. And despite some macro headwinds, we're raising the midpoint of our full year EPS outlook, $0.05 to between $5.95 and $6.05 per share. 
As Joe will discuss in detail later, we're reflecting the changing macro environment in updated customer schedules in our revised outlook for sales and operating income in the back half of the year. We remain disciplined in our allocation of capital, investing in both organic and inorganic growth. And at the same time, we returned $144 million of cash shareholders during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to roughly $600 million. 
We also posted strong second quarter bookings of $6.5 billion for a total of $13 billion year-to-date, reflecting awards from both our traditional OEMs as well as newer nontraditional customers. 
In summary, we continue to leverage our business model and remain very focused on execution. 
Slide 6 highlights a few of the assumptions impacting our current outlook starting with the positives on the left. Regulatory trends and consumer demands continue to influence fuel economy, CO2 emissions and vehicle safety standards, driving content per vehicle growth. We continue to experience very strong demand for active safety, infotainment, Gas Direct Injection, Valve Train and power electronic product lines, and increased demand for active safety product has translated into increased interest in our automated driving solution. And several cities such as Singapore, Austin, Columbus and others are investing in automated driving pilots, all in support of the future mobility on-demand, presenting us with even more opportunities for future profitable growth. 
The right side of the chart reflects our current view on the macros, including further currency and commodity headwinds, primarily from the recent devaluation of the sterling and Chinese RMB; increased weakness in the global commercial vehicle market, driven by double-digit declines in North America, more than offsetting growth in the European and Asia markets; and slowing global vehicle production in the second half of the year, particularly in China as well as weaker light-duty diesel volumes in both Europe and the emerging markets. 
In summary, although the macro environment appears to be increasingly challenged, we're confident in our updated outlook for the balance of the year.
Continued strong business bookings are reflected on Slide 7, which, as I mentioned, totaled approximately $13 billion in the second quarter. We did a number of important customer bookings as well as several new platform wins in the quarter, including large contract wins for electrical architecture with GM in North America and with Daimler in Europe; powertrain wins, including [indiscernible] train programs of both Hyundai and General Motors; and engine control [indiscernible] win with VW; and a GDi win with Changhong in China. And the key power electronics win for Electronics and Safety was [indiscernible] in China as well as an active safety win with Audi. 
On the right side of the chart, you'll see a sampling of the customer diversity in our year-to-date bookings, ensuring that we're not dependent on any one customer or any one region or business segment for growth.
Turning to Slide 8. As we discussed previously, our customers are increasingly seeing the need for further electrification of powertrain to close regulatory gap on CO2 emissions and fuel economy. 48-mile hybrids delivered roughly a 70% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to full hybrids and about 30% of the costs. Given our strength in electrical architecture and power electronics, Delphi has a competitive advantage in the intelligent electrification of the vehicle. The increased interest from customers is further validated by the stronger volume projections from industry experts. We are now forecasting 48-volt mile hybrids making up 15% of vehicle production by 2025. That's up from just 10% 6 months ago. 
Now we've been awarded a third customer program since our last update, bringing total 48-volt bookings to roughly $200 million, with the first 2 programs launching with European OEMs in late 2017. In addition, we're presently engaged in discussions with 4 additional major OEMs of potential development programs in this exciting space. 
On Slide 9 are just a few examples of some of our 2016 major program launches. Electronics and Safety revenues are benefiting from infotainment launches on the VWM QB platforms, the Cadillac XC5 and the Chrysler Pacifica and Active Safety launches on the result Phoenix and BMW 5 series as well as power electronics lodges on a number of these platforms, including the Volvo S90. 
Revenue growth on our Electrical Architecture segment is partially driven by program launches in the Daimler E Class, Chrysler Pacifica and the mobile S90. And Powertrain revenues are benefiting from the launch of the small engine on Chevrolets Malibu and Volkswagen 1.4 and 1.6-liter engine platforms. 
Turning to Slide 10. Over the last few years, there's been a lot of focus on active safety and the technologies that support it. As you've heard us say previously, active safety technologies are the building blocks that will ultimately support, saving thousands of lives each year. So that's why active safety is the fastest-growing sector in automotive certainly for Delphi. Customers want it and regulators see the benefit of it. 
During the first half of 2016, we booked $700 million active safety awards, which wins across each geographic region and one [indiscernible] well over $1 billion in active safety bookings for the fourth straight year in a row. 
Now with almost 80% of the safety benefit of Level 4 automation coming from just 20% of the costs at Level 2 automation, we see the near term for demand -- near-term demand, rather, for active safety technologies only growing. As a result, we expect our Active Safety revenues to increase roughly 50% annually over the next few years.
And on Slide 11 is a result of our industry-leading portfolio of active safety and automated driving solutions. We were recently selected by Singapore to develop and implement an end-to-end ecosystem for urban, point-to-point, on-demand, autonomous vehicle service. Delphi will provide a fleet of fully autonomous vehicles, leveraging our proven automated driving platform, including advanced sensors, software and electrical distribution. And we will develop a cloud-based mobility on-demand software suite, opening up new potential autonomous markets for Delphi customers and enabling faster commercialization opportunities. 
Other pilots are planned for cities in North America and Europe, and we expect to make those announcements later this year. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Joe to cover the financials in more detail. Joe?"
59502420,373719346,1022895,"Delphi Automotive PLC, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Aptiv PLC","Executives","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. And we'll start by covering our second quarter performance and then discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Let's begin on Slide 13 with a snapshot of our second quarter financial performance. As Kevin m",1386,"Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. And we'll start by covering our second quarter performance and then discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2016. 
Let's begin on Slide 13 with a snapshot of our second quarter financial performance. As Kevin mentioned, we delivered solid revenue and earnings growth in the quarter. Revenue was up 9% or 7% adjusted for currency, commodity, acquisitions and divestitures. Our operating margins expanded 10 basis points to 13.7%, and earnings per share grew 19%. Operating cash flow increased to $575 million, driven by higher earnings levels and improved working capital performance, partially offset by higher restructuring outflows. 
Slide 14 provides greater detail of revenue for the quarter. Starting on the left, we had strong sales growth, including the impact of M&A, driven by HellermannTyton, which contributed approximately $200 million of revenue. The impact from the Japan earthquake was within the range we provided in April. The strengthening U.S. dollar principally against the Chinese RMB and pound and lower copper prices were a drag on revenue in the quarter. 
Moving to the right. South America continues to be very weak. Growth in North America and Europe was strong, driven primarily by our Electrical Architecture and DNS segments. Our adjusted growth in China slowed in the quarter to approximately 5%, reflecting volatility in schedules with certain customers, including SGM and Great Wall. While our overall view of full year China vehicle production growth remains unchanged at approximately 4%, we expect fluctuations in quarterly growth over market rates to continue in the second half of the year.
Turning to operating income. Slide 15 walks the year-over-year change for second quarter. Overall, our operating results were in line with our expectations. Flow-through from volume growth contributed to the margin expansion. HellermannTyton was accretive to earnings, and our integration activities and synergy realizations continue on pace. 
Although we did experience some regional performance challenges in the quarter within North American manufacturing Electrical Architecture, which I'll speak to in a moment, launched costs and ENS moderated in the quarter as expected. 
Also, as Kevin referenced, we see significant opportunities in areas such as active safety, automated driving, infotainment and vehicle electrification and continue to increase investment in these areas.
As always, we continue our relentless focus on optimizing our cost structure, leveraging best cost locations and driving increased efficiencies throughout our organization to fund continued investment innovation and to help offset the impact of the discrete performance challenges that I just noted.
Slide 16 takes us through performance by segment. Electrical Architecture, consistent with our expectations, grew 8% on an adjusted basis. HellermannTyton growth was 10%. As I mentioned, operating margin flow-through in electrical architecture was negatively impacted by manufacturing performance challenges in North America, totaling approximately $20 million. During the quarter, we experienced lower efficiency and higher labor costs associated with the previously planned consolidation of facilities. We expect some level of inefficiency to continue into the second half and have included an additional $30 million in our full year guidance. 
Powertrain revenues were flat year-over-year and short of our expectations. As solid growth in our gas business, GDi grew 50% in the quarter, was offset by lower commercial vehicle volumes in North America, a decline in light-duty diesel schedules in Europe and lower China volumes. 
With respect to light-duty diesel, towards the end of the second quarter, our Powertrain segment experienced a decrease in order levels, impacting both the second quarter and the back half of 2016 across multiple customers. We believe the reduced order levels are primarily related to customers managing down overall diesel inventories in Europe and Asia Pacific. The Powertrain margin decline of approximately 50 basis points was driven by the decline in volumes as well as the foreign exchange transaction impact primarily associated with the devaluation of the RMB and pound. 
As expected, Electronics and Safety organic growth accelerated to 14%, reflecting revenues from program launches completed in late 2015 and earlier this year. 
Growth for the quarter includes a drag of approximately 2% for the mechatronic business. Growth was strong across several product lines, including active safety and infotainment, which grew over 40% and 10% in the quarter, respectively, as well as power electronics, which, although currently a small revenue base, grew significantly in the quarter.
E&S margins expanded 10 basis points to 12.4% on strong volume growth and positive net performance, as launch inefficiencies continued to wane. As noted, we continue to increase investments in key technologies to drive growth in E&S, particularly in active safety, automated driving and infotainment. 
Turning to Slide 17. Earnings came in -- at the high end of our range despite a slightly higher tax rate of 17.4% versus a 17% forecast. EPS growth was driven by increased operating earnings and a favorable impact of a lower share count. We exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04 per share, including $0.03 from operations and $0.01 improvement from below-the-line items. 
Turning to Slide 18 and the outlook for the remainder of the year. I'd like to walk through the changes to our full year revenue and operating income guidance. 
Starting with revenue on the left. Full year revenues are expected to be $16.25 billion to $16.45 billion, with operating income between $2.15 billion and $2.2 billion. The updated revenue guidance reflects a reduction of $450 million from our previous midpoint, including a $200 million reduction related to FX translation and commodities,  primarily resulting, again, from the weakening Chinese RMB, British pound and lower copper prices. 
Reduced global vehicle production accounts for the remainder of the decrease of $250 million. The lower production volumes reflect our views regarding continued weakness in the CB market, the estimated impact of Brexit and lower light-duty diesel volumes. In addition, include an estimate of lower volumes in China related to certain OEs primarily impacting the Powertrain segment. As a result, at a segment level, we now expect Electrical Architecture adjusted growth of 6%, Powertrain growth of 3% and E&S growth of 14%. E&S and Electrical Architecture will continue to provide strong growth throughout the year for Delphi. Accordingly, we expect our full year adjusted growth rate to be approximately 7% for, reflecting over -- growth over market of roughly 5%. 
The earnings impact of the foreign exchange headwinds and the flow-through on lower volumes, including the lower-performance Electrical Architecture, will be partially offset by continued optimization of our cost structure. In addition to accelerating previously planned restructuring actions, we continue to identify additional opportunities to reduce costs in the second half of the year. 
We expect full year operating margin of 13.3%, a 30 basis points expansion over last year. We have tightened and raised the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance to $5.95 to $6.05, reflecting year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint.
Moving to the third quarter. We expect to generate revenues of $3.9 billion to $4 billion. The midpoint reflects further organic growth acceleration to 8%, with continued strong growth in Electronics and Safety and Electrical Architecture. 
We expect operating income in the range of $505 million to $525 million and third quarter earnings per share of $1.38 to $1.44, up approximately 10% at the midpoint. 
Turning to Slide 19. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged and is an important lever to enhance shareholder value. On the left, we expect cash flow from operations to grow approximately $1.9 billion, in line with earnings. And the deployment priorities on the right are consistent with our strategy, maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade rating.
We are investing in our business through capital expenditures supporting new program launches, ongoing cost alignment and footprint rotation to best cost countries. We are committed to paying a competitive dividend, and when we have excess cash, we have a track record of returning it to shareholders via share repurchases, as evidenced by the $435 million of repurchases we've already done this year. 
Our full year guidance assumes repurchases for the year of $600 million. And we continue to pursue inorganic growth opportunities that meet our investment criteria and strategic growth objectives, particularly on expansion of our Electrical Architecture platform, active safety and automated driving technologies as well as infotainment and power electronics. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin for some closing remarks before we open it up to questions."

We delivered solid performance in the second quarter despite a few challenges. Our financial performance continues to be driven by the relevant safe, green and connected technologies that solved some of our customers' biggest challenges. While we're confident in our second half outlook, which includes 7% organic growth, roughly 60 basis points of margin expansion and mid-teens EPS growth. We continue to optimize our cost structure while investing in technologies that will drive our future growth. Our year-to-date bookings and commercial developments position us well for continued strong revenue and earnings growth. And as Joe just said, we remain disciplined in our allocation of capital, investing in both organic as well as inorganic growth and returning excess cash shareholders through both share repurchases as well as dividends. Through all of this, we remain focused on executing in a more dynamic macro environment during the back half of this year. 
And with that, we'll now turn it over to the operator to open up the line for questions. Thank you."

What, for example, specifically is happening in China? What are some of the specific drivers of that acceleration? If you can just comment on programs that are launching and how meaningful those would be. And lastly, I know it's a long question, but we always get questions about how confident we should be about the growth guidance longer term. You guys have been talking about 8% to 10% as you look out to 2017 and beyond. Is there any reason -- just given some of these variances that we're seeing, is there any reason to reassess that longer-term excess growth assumption?"

I'll start at a high level, and you can [indiscernible] length with the details. I think, listen, as you look at our adjusted outlook for the back half of the year from a growth standpoint, as Joe referenced, there's really 3 key companies. One is FX and commodity rates and the translation effect, and Joe quantified that as probably $200 million. Then there's 2 separate pieces on volume. Piece one is effectively lower outlook or lower forecast from IHS and customers for vehicle production across the back half of the year, one. And then specific growth relative to market for us, principally in our Powertrain segment. So I think if you look at growth over market in our E&S segment, I think if you look at growth over market in the architectural segment, quite frankly, the outlook remains unchanged. Where it has it changed somewhat, at least in the near term, is on the Powertrain side. And it's principally being driven by a couple of things: one, light-duty diesel growth, and again, I'll Joe comment on that; much lower commercial vehicle growth; and then when we look at the mix of customers we're on in China, an incremental effect related to growth over market there. 
As we look at the back half of the year and risks related to revenue, I'd tell you, we feel very good about where we stand from a revenue outlook, very good where we stand. And as we head into the back half of the year, we'll reassess each of our businesses in each of the markets and take another view about longer-term outlook for growth. Having said that, I would tell you, if you look at our growth over market for calendar year 2016, even on a revised basis, it's very strong relative to overall vehicle production at 5 points over market. So Joe, I'll let you get to the specifics."

That's based on updated production information that we have, includes some insight into what folks are thinking from a Brexit perspective and impact on Europe. The remaining $150 million, which will be more of the growth over market impact, the diesel, which is both commercial vehicle and light-duty, is $100 million of that $150 million. And then China, we've adjusted down $50 million. As I mentioned in my script, as Kevin touched on, we have seen customer-specific adjustments to schedules. I would almost refer to them as model-specific adjustments. Some inventory balancing, we think, in the back half of the year. Certainly and primarily in powertrains. Certainly, nowhere at the level of schedule call-down that we saw last year, so this is very different.

Obviously, there's some cyclical headwinds there. There's also other issues, of course, with real-world driving emissions and the cost of complying with the new diesel standards.

Based on our discussions with those OEs, it appears to be inventory rebalancing at this point in time. It's something we're watching closely. But one thing I want to underscore and get back to, as we all know, governments are focused on whether it's the U.S. or Europe. OEs hitting the revised standards. And to the extent there's less light-duty diesel, there needs to be more Powertrain electrification. And I think over although there may be slide these locations in the near term, over the medium- to long-term, when you look at where we sit from a power electronics standpoint, we cited these facts before, the average CVB on a standard internal combustion engine for Delphi is $300. When you look at 48 full, it's 4x that CVP. On a hybrid, it's 5. On a full EV, it's 7x. And given our product portfolio, we're certainly well positioned. And I think that overall trend is why we're seeing such a significant ramp-up in growth in power electronics, just off of low number is a very high growth rate. But when you look at what the we're seeing from a bookings standpoint, just to give you a data point, the first half of last year, we booked roughly $400 million on power electronics vehicle electrification. In the first half of this year, we're over $1.2 billion. So what we're seeing, stepping back and taking a look at the big picture, is significant ramp-up of demand for powertrain electronics or electrification of the Powertrain, which is good for us."

Restructuring, I would say, we are moving a little bit quicker on restructuring and powertrains. Some of that's opportunistic. I would say, at this point, it still consistent with a footprint rotation from west to east, particularly in Europe, although, as you may recall, that is diesel-focused.

I think the [indiscernible], to some extent, has obviously settled after the activity at the end of June. To your point, it is going to take a long time. So there are already a couple of things that we're watching and will be mindful of from a, what I'll call, from a tax structure perspective. Those are primarily around how the European Union and the U.K. interacts or contracts effectively post Brexit. At this point, we don't see anything that materially changes our tax rate. So if, from a tax policy perspective, there aren't any single major drivers that if we were to change now, we would have a material impact of 17% tax rate. Obviously, if new treaties and such are struck, new agreements are reached, particularly if it's punitive to U.K.-based companies, we'll obviously have to evaluate how to either structure around those or look at other alternatives. I would caveat, I think, the one thing that's -- our tax structure is a little bit unique in Europe because even if we are U.K.-based, we have a significant presence in Europe. So it's not necessarily one of the tax structures that's built on, what I'll call, just planning initiatives. We have large physical presence in the U.K. We have large physical presence in Luxembourg. And our structure tends to be built around how we do business in Europe, how we do business in the U.K. versus just one-off planning actions. So that tends to be more substantive and tends to hold up better to tax law changes, i.e. things get [indiscernible] far as such. Right now, we see no risk that answers the question, but kind of at this point, we see no risk at this point for the 17% is now out there that we're looking at same we need to go change it now.

Before Joe gets into our financial results, I'd like to provide some context around the second quarter as well as our outlook for the full year. 
Beginning with the second quarter highlights on Slide 5. To summarize, we had a solid quarter, delivering accelerated revenue and earnings growth. Our revenues increased 7%, driven by strong double-digit growth in our Electronics and Safety segment, which had over 40% growth in active safety revenue and high single-digit growth in Electrical Architecture. Powertrain revenues, however, were weaker than expected, principally due to lower heavy-duty and light-duty diesel lines. And we also experienced increased demand volatility with certain key local customers across our segment, impacting our growth in the China market, which we currently believe will continue into the second half of the year. 
Operating income increased to $577 million, and margins expanded to 13.7%, driven by both volume growth and continued cost structure optimization. These increases were partially offset by our continued investment in engineering and information systems to fund growth initiatives as well as some recent manufacturing inefficiencies in our Electrical Architecture segment that we're working through. Joe's going to provide more color on these in a few minutes. 
Earnings per share increased 19% to $1.59 a share. And despite some macro headwinds, we're raising the midpoint of our full year EPS outlook of $0.05 to between $5.95 and $6.05 per share. 
As Joe will discuss in detail later, we're reflecting the changing macro environment in updated customer schedules in our revised outlook for sales and operating income in the back half of the year. We remain disciplined in our allocation of capital, investing in both organic and inorganic growth and at the same time, we returned $144 million of cash to shareholders during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to roughly $600 million. 
We also posted strong second quarter bookings of $6.5 billion for a total of $13 billion year-to-date, reflecting awards from both our traditional OEMs as well as newer nontraditional customers. 
In summary, we continue to leverage our business model and remain very focused on execution. 
Slide 6 highlights a few of the assumptions impacting our current outlook starting with the positives on the left. Regulatory trends and consumer demands continue to influence fuel economy, CO2 emissions and vehicle safety standards, driving content per vehicle growth. We continue to experience very strong demand for active safety, infotainment, Gas Direct Injection, variable Valve train and power electronic product lines, and increased demand for active safety product has translated into increased interest in our automated driving solution. And several cities such as Singapore, Boston, Columbus and others are investing in automated driving pilots, all in support of the future mobility on-demand, presenting us with even more opportunities for future profitable growth. 
The right side of the chart reflects our current view on the macros, including further currency and commodity headwinds, primarily from the recent devaluation of the sterling and Chinese RMB; increased weakness in the global commercial vehicle market, driven by double-digit declines in North America, more than offsetting growth in the European and Asia markets; and slowing global vehicle production in the second half of the year, particularly in China as well as weaker light-duty diesel volumes in both Europe and the emerging markets. 
In summary, although the macro environment appears to be increasingly challenged, we're confident in our updated outlook for the balance of the year.
Continued strong business bookings are reflected on Slide 7, which, as I mentioned, totaled approximately $13 billion to the second quarter. We had a number of important customer bookings as well as several new platform wins in the quarter, including large conquest wins for Electrical Architecture with GM in North America and with Daimler in Europe; powertrain wins, including Valve Train programs at both Hyundai and General Motors; and engine control module conquest win with VW; and a GDi win with Changan in China. And the key power electronics win for Electronics and Safety with Geely in China as well as an active safety win with Audi. 
On the right side of the chart, you'll see a sampling of the customer diversity in our year-to-date bookings, ensuring that we're not dependent on any one customer or any one region or business segment for growth.
Turning to Slide 8. As we discussed previously, our customers are increasingly seeing the need for further electrification of powertrain to close regulatory gap on CO2 emissions and fuel economy. 48-volt mild hybrids delivered roughly a 70% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to full hybrids and about 30% of the cost. Given our strength in Electrical Architecture and power electronics, Delphi has a competitive advantage in the intelligent electrification of the vehicle. The increased interest from customers is further validated by the stronger volume projections from industry experts. We are now forecasting 48-volt mild hybrids making up 15% of vehicle production by 2025, that's up from just 10% 6 months ago. 
Now we've been awarded a third customer program since our last update, bringing total 48-volt bookings to roughly $200 million, with the first 2 programs launching with European OEMs in late 2017. In addition, we're presently engaged in discussions with 4 additional major OEMs of potential development programs in this exciting space. 
On Slide 9 are just a few examples of some of our 2016 major program launches. Electronics and Safety revenues are benefiting from infotainment launches on the VW MQB platform, the Cadillac XT5 and the Chrysler Pacifica, and active safety launches on the Renault Scenic and BMW 5-Series as well as power electronics launches on a number of these platforms, including the Volvo S90. 
Revenue growth on our Electrical Architecture segment is partially driven by program launches on the Daimler E-Class, Chrysler Pacifica and the Volvo S90. And Powertrain revenues are benefiting from the launch of the Ecotec small engine on Chevrolet's Malibu and Volkswagen's 1.4 and 1.6-liter engine platforms. 
Turning to Slide 10. Over the last few years, there's been a lot of focus on active safety and the technologies that support it. As you've heard us say previously, active safety technologies are the building blocks that will ultimately support autonomous vehicles, saving thousands of lives each year. So that's why active safety is the fastest-growing sector in automotive and certainly for Delphi. Customers want it and regulators see the benefit of it. During the first half of 2016, we booked $700 million in active safety awards, with wins across each geographic region and well on track to achieve well over $1 billion in active safety bookings for the fourth straight year in a row. 
Now with almost 80% of the safety benefits of Level 4 automation coming for just 20% of the cost at Level 2 automation, we see the near term for demand -- near-term demand, rather, for active safety technologies only growing. As a result, we expect our active safety revenues to increase roughly 50% annually over the next few years.
And on Slide 11 is a result of our industry-leading portfolio of active safety and automated driving solutions. We were recently selected by Singapore to develop and implement an end-to-end ecosystem for an urban, point-to-point, on-demand, autonomous vehicle service. Delphi will provide a fleet of fully autonomous vehicles, leveraging our proven automated driving platform, including advanced sensors, software and electrical distribution. And we will develop a cloud-based mobility on-demand software suite, opening up new potential autonomous markets for Delphi customers and enabling faster commercialization opportunities. 
Other pilots are planned for cities in North America and Europe, and we expect to make those announcements later this year. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Joe to cover the financials in more detail. Joe?"
59502420,373719346,1023408,"Delphi Automotive PLC, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Aptiv PLC","Executives","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will start by covering our second quarter performance and then discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Let's begin on Slide 13 with a snapshot of our second quarter financial performance. As Kevin ment",1388,"Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will start by covering our second quarter performance and then discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2016. 
Let's begin on Slide 13 with a snapshot of our second quarter financial performance. As Kevin mentioned, we delivered solid revenue and earnings growth in the quarter. Revenue was up 9% or 7% adjusted for currency, commodity, acquisitions and divestitures. Our operating margins expanded 10 basis points to 13.7%, and earnings per share grew 19%. Operating cash flow increased to $575 million, driven by higher earnings levels and improved working capital performance, partially offset by higher restructuring outflows. 
Slide 14 provides greater detail of revenue for the quarter. Starting on the left, we had strong sales growth, including the impact of M&A, driven by HellermannTyton, which contributed approximately $200 million of revenue. The impact from the Japan earthquake was within the range we provided in April. The strengthening U.S. dollar principally against the Chinese RMB and pound and lower copper prices were a drag on revenue in the quarter. 
Moving to the right. South America continues to be very weak. Growth in North America and Europe was strong, driven primarily by our Electrical Architecture and E&S segments. Our adjusted growth in China slowed in the quarter to approximately 5%, reflecting volatility in schedules with certain customers, including SGM and Great Wall. While our overall view of full year China vehicle production growth remains unchanged at approximately 4%, we expect fluctuations in quarterly growth over market rates to continue in the second half of the year.
Turning to operating income. Slide 15 walks the year-over-year change for second quarter. Overall, our operating results were in line with our expectations. Flow-through from volume growth contributed to the margin expansion. HellermannTyton was accretive to earnings, and our integration activities and synergy realization continue on pace. Although we did experience some regional performance challenges in the quarter within North American manufacturing in Electrical Architecture, which I'll speak to in a moment, launch costs in E&S moderated in the quarter as expected. Also as Kevin referenced, we see significant opportunities in areas such as active safety, automated driving, infotainment and vehicle electrification and continue to increase investment in these areas.
As always, we continue our relentless focus on optimizing our cost structure, leveraging best cost locations and driving increased efficiency throughout our organization to fund continued investment innovation and to help offset the impact of the discrete performance challenges that I just noted.
Slide 16 takes us through performance by segment. Electrical Architecture, consistent with our expectations, grew 8% on an adjusted basis. HellermannTyton growth was 10%. As I mentioned, operating margin flow-through in Electrical Architecture was negatively impacted by manufacturing performance challenges in North America, totaling approximately $20 million. During the quarter, we experienced lower efficiency and higher labor costs associated with the previously planned consolidation of facilities. We expect some level of inefficiency to continue into the second half and have included an additional $30 million in our full year guidance. 
Powertrain revenues were flat year-over-year and short of our expectations. As solid growth in our gas business, GDi grew 50% in the quarter, was offset by lower commercial vehicle volumes in North America, a decline in light-duty diesel schedules in Europe and lower China volumes. 
With respect to light-duty diesel, towards the end of the second quarter, our Powertrain segment experienced a decrease in order levels, impacting both the second quarter and the back half of 2016 across multiple customers. We believe the reduced order levels are primarily related to customers managing down overall diesel inventories in Europe and Asia Pacific. The Powertrain margin decline of approximately 50 basis points was driven by the decline in volumes as well as the foreign exchange transaction impact, primarily associated with the devaluation of the RMB and pound. 
As expected, Electronics and Safety organic growth accelerated to 14%, reflecting revenues from program launches completed in late 2015 and earlier this year. Growth for the quarter includes a drag of approximately 2% for the mechatronic business. Growth was strong across several product lines, including active safety and infotainment, which grew over 40% and 10% in the quarter, respectively, as well as power electronics, which, although currently a small revenue base, grew significantly in the quarter.
E&S margins expanded 10 basis points to 12.4% on strong volume growth and positive net performance, as launch inefficiencies continued to wane. As noted, we continue to increase investment in key technologies to drive growth in E&S, particularly in active safety, automated driving and infotainment. 
Turning to Slide 17. Earnings came in the high end of our range despite a slightly higher tax rate of 17.4% versus a 17% forecast. EPS growth was driven by increased operating earnings and a favorable impact of a lower share count. We exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04 per share, including $0.03 from operations and $0.01 improvement from below-the-line items. 
Turning to Slide 18 and the outlook for the remainder of the year. I'd like to walk through the changes to our full year revenue and operating income guidance. 
Starting with revenue on the left. Full year revenues are expected to be $16.25 billion to $16.45 billion, with operating income between $2.15 billion and $2.2 billion. The updated revenue guidance reflects a reduction of $450 million from our previous midpoint, including a $200 million reduction related to FX translation and commodities, primarily resulting, again, from the weakening Chinese RMB, British pound and lower copper prices. 
Reduced global vehicle production accounts for the remainder of the decrease of $250 million. The lower production volumes reflect our views regarding continued weakness in the CB market, the estimated impact of Brexit and lower light-duty diesel volumes. In addition, we have included an estimate of lower volumes in China related to certain OEs, primarily impacting the Powertrain segment. As a result, at a segment level, we now expect Electrical Architecture adjusted growth of 6%, Powertrain growth of 3% and E&S growth of 14%. 
E&S and Electrical Architecture will continue to provide strong growth throughout the year for Delphi. Accordingly, we expect our full year adjusted growth rate to be approximately 7% reflecting over -- growth over market of roughly 5%. 
The earnings impact of the foreign exchange headwinds and the flow-through on lower volumes, including the lower performance in Electrical Architecture, will be partially offset by continued optimization of our cost structure. In addition to accelerating previously planned restructuring actions, we continue to identify additional opportunities to reduce cost in the second half of the year. 
We expect full year operating margin of 13.3%, a 30 basis point expansion over last year. We have tightened and raised the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance to $5.95 to $6.05, reflecting year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint.
Moving to the third quarter. We expect to generate revenues of $3.9 billion to $4 billion. The midpoint reflects further organic growth acceleration to 8%, with continued strong growth in Electronics and Safety and Electrical Architecture. We expect operating income in the range of $505 million to $525 million, and third quarter earnings per share of $1.38 to $1.44, up approximately 10% at the midpoint. 
Turning to Slide 19. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged and is an important lever to enhance shareholder value. On the left, we expect cash flow from operations to grow approximately $1.9 billion, in line with earnings. And the deployment priorities on the right are consistent with our strategy, maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade rating.
We are investing on our business through capital expenditures supporting new program launches, ongoing cost alignment and footprint rotation to best cost countries. We are committed to paying a competitive dividend, and when we have excess cash, we have a track record of returning it to shareholders via share repurchases, as evidenced by the $435 million of repurchases we've already done this year. Our full year guidance assumes repurchases for the year of $600 million. 
And we continue to pursue inorganic growth opportunities that meet our investment criteria and strategic growth objectives, particularly around expansion of our Electrical Architecture platform, active safety and automated driving technologies as well as infotainment and power electronics. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin for some closing remarks before we open it up to questions."

We delivered solid performance in the second quarter despite a few challenges.

We continue to optimize our cost structure, while investing in technologies that will drive our future growth. Our year-to-date bookings and commercial developments position us well for continued strong revenue and earnings growth.

And now it's -- looks like around 600 basis points, which is up from the 300 to 400 in the first half. But can you talk a little bit about the bridge a little bit more, the bridge to that number? What, for example, specifically is happening in China? What are some of the specific drivers of that acceleration? If you can just comment on programs that are launching and how meaningful those would be. And lastly, I know it's a long question, but there -- we always get questions about how confident we should be about the growth guidance longer term. You guys have been talking about 8% to 10% as you look out to 2017 and beyond. Is there any reason -- just given some of these variances that we're seeing, is there any reason to reassess that longer-term excess growth assumption?"

I'll start at a higher level, and you can fill in the blanks with the details. I think -- listen, as you look at our adjusted outlook for the back half of the year from a growth standpoint, as Joe referenced, there's really 3 key components. One is FX and commodity rates and the translation effect, and Joe quantified that as roughly $200 million. Then there's 2 separate pieces on volume. Piece one is effectively lower outlook or lower forecast from IHS and customers for vehicle production across the back half of the year, one. And then specific growth relative to market for us, principally, in our Powertrain segment. So I think, Rod, if you look at growth over market in our E&S segment, I think if you look at growth over market in our Electrical Architectural segment, quite frankly, the outlook remains unchanged. Where it has changed somewhat, at least in the near term, is on the Powertrain side. And it's principally being driven by a couple of things: one, light-duty diesel growth, and again, I'll let Joe comment on that; much lower commercial vehicle growth; and then when we look at the mix of customers we're on in China, an incremental effect related to growth over market there. As we look at the back half of the year and risk related to revenue, I'd tell you, we feel very good about where we stand from a revenue outlook, very good where we stand. And as we head into the back half of the year, we'll reassess each of our businesses in each of the markets and take another view about longer-term outlook for growth. Having said that, I would tell you, if you look at our growth over market for calendar year 2016 even on a revised basis, it's very strong relative to overall vehicle production at 5 points over market. So Joe, I'll let you get on the specifics."

Again, FX translation effects, it is about 50-50. Commodities, primarily copper, is another $100 million. Of the $250 million, right now, we see industry volumes of about $100 million coming out. That's based on updated production information that we have, includes some insight into what folks are thinking from a Brexit perspective and impact on Europe. The remaining $150 million, which will be more of the growth over market impact, the diesel, which is both commercial vehicle and light-duty, is $100 million of that $150 million. And then China, we've adjusted down $50 million. As I mentioned in my script, as Kevin touched on, we have seen customer-specific adjustments to schedules. I would almost refer to them as model-specific adjustments, some inventory balancing, we think, in the back half of the year, certainly and primarily in Powertrain. Certainly, nowhere at the level of schedule call-down that we saw last year, so this is very different. It's model-specific, it's customer-specific, really concentrated in 2 or 3 customers on a couple of platforms. But we did see this -- sorry, go ahead."

Obviously, there is some cyclical headwinds there. There's also other issues, of course, with real-world driving emissions and the cost of complying with the new diesel standards. Are there any changes, longer term, that you think are affecting the market dynamics there in terms of either growth or the competitiveness and -- that would affect Powertrain?"

Based on our discussions with those OEs, it appears to be inventory rebalancing at this point in time. It's something we're watching closely. But one thing I want to underscore and get back to, as you -- as we all know, governments are focused on whether it's U.S. or Europe always hitting the revised standards. And to the extent there's less light-duty diesel, there needs to be more Powertrain electrification. And I think over -- although there may be slight dislocations in the near term, over the medium to long term, when you look at where we sit from a power electronics standpoint, we cited these facts before, the average CPV on a standard internal combustion engine for Delphi is $300. When you look at 48-volt, it's 4x that CPV. On a hybrid, it's 5. On a full EV, it's 7x. And given our product portfolio, we're certainly well positioned. And I think that overall trend is why we're seeing such a significant ramp-up in growth in power electronics, just set off of low number is a very high growth rate. But when you look at what we're seeing from a bookings standpoint, just to give you a data point, the first half of last year, we booked roughly $400 million on power electronics vehicle electrification.

But there's going to be somewhat of a timing just as diesel comes down. It's obviously a much larger business. But we have seen very strong growth in the second quarter and, quite honestly, expect full year growth in GDi to be a little bit over 50%. So we are seeing that. Restructuring, I would say, we are moving a little bit quicker on restructuring and Powertrain. Some of that's opportunistic. I would say, at this point, it's still consistent with a footprint rotation from West to East, particularly in Europe, although, as you may recall, that is diesel-focused. Those are diesel facilities that we are consolidating into taking out of Western Europe. There was one last year in France. There's another one this year in Spain, and there's going into Romania.

I think that does, to some extent, has obviously settled, following -- after all of the activity at the end of June. To your point, it is going to take a long time. So there are a couple of things that we're watching and will be mindful of from a, what I'll call, from a tax structure perspective. Those are primarily around how the European Union and the U.K. interacts or contract effectively post Brexit. At this point, we don't see anything that materially changes our tax rate. So if -- from a tax policy perspective, there aren't any single major drivers that if we were to -- if they were to change now, we would have a material impact of 17% tax rate. Obviously, if new treaties and such are struck, new agreements are reached, particularly if it's punitive to U.K.-based companies, we'd obviously have to evaluate how to either structure around those or look at other alternatives. I would caveat, I think, the one thing that's -- our tax structure is a little bit unique in Europe because even though we're U.K.-based, we have a significant presence in Europe. So it's not necessarily one of the tax structures that's built on, what I'll call, just planning initiatives. We have large physical presence in the U.K. We have large physical presence in Luxembourg. And our structure tends to be built around how we do business in Europe, how we do business in the U.K. versus just one-off planning actions. So that tends to be more substantive and tends to hold up better to tax law changes, i.e. things get grand farther than such. So right now, we see no risk. Hope that answers the question, but kind of at this point, we see no risk at this point for the 17%. There's nothing out there that we're looking at, at the same point, we need to go change it now. But obviously, something, we will continue to watch diligently as we go forward."

But they're launching on vehicles that tend to have a significant amount of volume. So I wouldn't -- I'd call it beyond a test, but it certainly is not high-volume in this case. And when you go through the economics and the discussions that we're having with -- when you go -- based on the discussions we're having with the other OEs at this point in time, and you talk about the technology, the cost of the technology and benefit of the technology, we think this is something that is going to gain significant traction, as do those OEs."

And is that still -- in terms of getting that to sort of reasonable margin, is that still consistent with it?"

But again, we're comfortable with that range, don't see things significantly changing. And as I mentioned, one benefit that we do see the margin over time and expect to continue to see, as these newer product lines grow in volume, material savings also becomes more available to us. So as we buy more, we're able to leverage that spend better. A product line at $100 million, there's only so much leverage you can do. As these get to $0.5 billion and beyond, there's obviously more leverage over the supply base."

If it's level 1, where it's just a camera or just a radar, right, that, as you know, that -- we're an industry that commoditize itself very, very quickly. And to Joe's point, we're really good at getting cost out when we get volume and leveraging the manufacturing plant as well as getting material savings. As you get into integrated solution, where you're fusing sensors, that's a much different scenario. And there are only a few players that can actually do that, we, being one of them. And I think in those sorts of scenarios -- and that's where the space is headed. In those sort of scenarios, the pricing pressure is actually very reasonable. It's there.

Before Joe gets into our financial results, I'd like to provide some context around the second quarter as well as our outlook for the full year. 
Beginning with the second quarter highlights on Slide 5. To summarize, we had a solid quarter, delivering accelerated revenue and earnings growth. Our revenues increased 7%, driven by strong double-digit growth in our Electronics and Safety segment, which had over 40% growth in active safety revenue and high single-digit growth in Electrical Architecture. Powertrain revenues, however, were weaker than expected, principally due to lower heavy-duty and light-duty diesel lines. And we also experienced increased demand volatility with certain key local customers across our segments impacting our growth in the China market, which we currently believe will continue into the second half of the year. 
Operating income increased to $577 million, and margins expanded to 13.7%, driven by both volume growth and continued cost structure optimization. These increases were partially offset by our continued investment in engineering and information systems to fund growth initiatives as well as some recent manufacturing inefficiencies in our Electrical Architecture segment that we're working through. Joe's going to provide more color on these in a few minutes. 
Earnings per share increased 19% to $1.59 a share. And despite some macro headwinds, we're raising the midpoint of our full year EPS outlook $0.05 to between $5.95 and $6.05 per share. 
As Joe will discuss in detail later, we're reflecting the changing macro environment in updated customer schedules and our revised outlook for sales and operating income in the back half of the year. We remain disciplined in our allocation of capital, investing in both organic and inorganic growth and at the same time, we returned $144 million of cash to shareholders during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to roughly $600 million. 
We also posted strong second quarter bookings of $6.5 billion for a total of $13 billion year-to-date, reflecting awards from both our traditional OEMs as well as newer, nontraditional customers. 
In summary, we continue to leverage our business model and remain very focused on execution. 
Slide 6 highlights a few of the assumptions impacting our current outlook starting with the positives on the left. Regulatory trends and consumer demands continue to influence fuel economy, CO2 emissions and vehicle safety standards, driving content per vehicle growth. We continue to experience very strong demand for our active safety, infotainment, Gas Direct Injection, variable valve train and power electronic product lines, and increased demand for our active safety product has translated into increased interest in our automated driving solutions as several cities such as Singapore, Boston, Columbus and others are investing in automated driving pilots, all in support of the future mobility on-demand, presenting us with even more opportunities for future profitable growth. 
The right side of the chart reflects our current view on the macros, including further currency and commodity headwinds, primarily from the recent devaluation of the sterling and Chinese RMB; increased weakness in the global commercial vehicle market, driven by double-digit declines in North America more than offsetting growth in the European and Asia markets; and slowing global vehicle production in the second half of the year, particularly in China, as well as weaker light-duty diesel volumes in both Europe and the emerging markets. 
In summary, although the macro environment appears to be increasingly challenged, we're confident in our updated outlook for the balance of the year.
Continued strong business bookings are reflected on Slide 7, which, as I mentioned, totaled approximately $13 billion through the second quarter. We had a number of important customer bookings as well as 7 new platform wins in the quarter, including large conquest wins for Electrical Architecture with GM in North America and with Daimler in Europe; powertrain wins, including valve train programs at both Hyundai and General Motors; an engine control module conquest win with VW; and a GDi win with Changan in China. And the key power electronics win for Electronics and Safety with Geely in China as well as an active safety win with Audi. 
On the right side of the chart, you'll see a sampling of the customer diversity in our year-to-date bookings, ensuring that we're not dependent on any one customer or any one region or business segment for growth.
Turning to Slide 8. As we've discussed previously, our customers are increasingly seeing the need for further electrification of the powertrain to close regulatory gaps on CO2 emissions and fuel economy. 48-volt mild hybrids deliver roughly a 70% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to full hybrids and about 30% of the cost. Given our strength in Electrical Architecture and power electronics, Delphi has a competitive advantage in the intelligent electrification of the vehicle. The increased interest from customers is further validated by the stronger volume projections from industry experts, who are now forecasting 48-volt mild hybrids making up 15% of vehicle production by 2025, that's up from just 10% 6 months ago. 
Now we've been awarded a third customer program since our last update, bringing total 48-volt bookings to roughly $200 million, with the first 2 programs launching with European OEMs in late 2017. In addition, we're presently engaged in discussions with 4 additional major OEMs on potential development programs in this exciting space. 
On Slide 9 are just a few examples of some of our 2016 major program launches. Electronics and Safety revenues are benefiting from infotainment launches on the VW MQB platform, the Cadillac XT5 and the Chrysler Pacifica, and active safety launches on the Renault Scenic and BMW 5-Series as well as power electronics launches on a number of these platforms, including the Volvo S90. 
Revenue growth in our Electrical Architecture segment is partially driven by program launches on the Daimler E-Class, Chrysler Pacifica and the Volvo S90. And Powertrain revenues are benefiting from the launch of the Ecotec small engine on Chevrolet's Malibu and Volkswagen's 1.4 and 1.6-liter engine platforms. 
Turning to Slide 10. Over the last few years, there's been a lot of focus on active safety and the technologies that support it. As you've heard us say previously, active safety technologies are the building blocks that will ultimately support autonomous vehicles, saving thousands of lives each year. So that's why active safety is the fastest-growing sector in automotive and certainly for Delphi. Customers want it and regulators see the benefit of it. During the first half of 2016, we booked $700 million in active safety awards, with wins across each geographic region, and we're on track to achieve well over $1 billion in active safety bookings for the fourth straight year in a row. 
Now with almost 80% of the safety benefits of Level 4 automation coming for just 20% of the cost at Level 2 automation, we see the near term for demand -- near-term demand, rather, for active safety technologies only growing. As a result, we expect our active safety revenues to increase roughly 50% annually over the next few years.
And on Slide 11, as a result of our industry-leading portfolio of active safety and automated driving solutions. We were recently selected by Singapore to develop and implement an end-to-end ecosystem for an urban, point-to-point, on-demand, autonomous vehicle service. Delphi will provide a fleet of fully autonomous vehicles, leveraging our proven automated driving platform, including advanced sensors, software and electrical distribution. And we will develop a cloud-based mobility on-demand software suite, opening up new potential autonomous markets for Delphi customers and enabling faster commercialization opportunities. 
Other pilots are planned for cities in North America and Europe, and we expect to make those announcements later this year. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Joe to cover the financials in more detail. Joe?"
59502420,373719346,1023735,"Delphi Automotive PLC, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Aptiv PLC","Executives","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will start by covering our second quarter performance and then discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Let's begin on Slide 13 with a snapshot of our second quarter financial performance. As Kevin ment",1391,"Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will start by covering our second quarter performance and then discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2016. 
Let's begin on Slide 13 with a snapshot of our second quarter financial performance. As Kevin mentioned, we delivered solid revenue and earnings growth in the quarter. Revenue was up 9% or 7% adjusted for currency, commodity, acquisitions and divestitures. Our operating margins expanded 10 basis points to 13.7%, and earnings per share grew 19%. Operating cash flow increased to $575 million, driven by higher earnings levels and improved working capital performance, partially offset by higher restructuring outflows. 
Slide 14 provides greater detail of revenue for the quarter. Starting on the left, we had strong sales growth, including the impact of M&A, driven by HellermannTyton, which contributed approximately $200 million of revenue. The impact from the Japan earthquake was within the range we provided in April. The strengthening U.S. dollar, principally against the Chinese RMB and pound, and lower copper prices were a drag on revenue in the quarter. 
Moving to the right. South America continues to be very weak. Growth in North America and Europe was strong, driven primarily by our Electrical Architecture and E&S segments. Our adjusted growth in China slowed in the quarter to approximately 5%, reflecting volatility in schedules at certain customers, including SGM and Great Wall. While our overall view of full year China vehicle production growth remains unchanged at approximately 4%, we expect fluctuations in quarterly growth over market rates to continue in the second half of the year.
Turning to operating income. Slide 15 walks the year-over-year change for the second quarter. Overall, our operating results were in line with our expectations. Flow-through from volume growth contributed to the margin expansion. HellermannTyton was accretive to earnings, and our integration activities and synergy realization continue on pace. Although we did experience some regional performance challenges in the quarter within North American manufacturing and Electrical Architecture, which I'll speak to in a moment, launch costs in E&S moderated in the quarter as expected. Also as Kevin referenced, we see significant opportunities in areas such as active safety, automated driving, infotainment and vehicle electrification and continue to increase investment in these areas.
As always, we continue our relentless focus on optimizing our cost structure, leveraging best cost locations and driving increased efficiency throughout our organization to fund continued investment in innovation and to help offset the impact of the discrete performance challenges that I just noted.
Slide 16 takes us through performance by segment. Electrical Architecture, consistent with our expectations, grew 8% on an adjusted basis. HellermannTyton growth was 10%. As I mentioned, operating margin flow-through in Electrical Architecture was negatively impacted by manufacturing performance challenges in North America totaling approximately $20 million. During the quarter, we experienced lower efficiency and higher labor costs associated with the previously planned consolidation of facilities. We expect some level of inefficiency to continue into the second half and have included an additional $30 million in our full year guidance. 
Powertrain revenues were flat year-over-year and short of our expectations. As solid growth in our gas business, GDi grew 50% in the quarter, was offset by lower commercial vehicle volumes in North America, a decline in light-duty diesel schedules in Europe and lower China volumes. 
With respect to light-duty diesel, towards the end of the second quarter, our Powertrain segment experienced a decrease in order levels, impacting both the second quarter and the back half of 2016 across multiple customers. We believe the reduced order levels are primarily related to customers managing down overall diesel inventories in Europe and Asia Pacific. The Powertrain margin decline of approximately 50 basis points was driven by the decline in volumes as well as the foreign exchange transaction impact, primarily associated with the devaluation of the RMB and pound. 
As expected, Electronics and Safety organic growth accelerated to 14%, reflecting revenues from program launches completed in late 2015 and earlier this year. Growth for the quarter includes a drag of approximately 2% for the mechatronics business. Growth was strong across several product lines, including active safety and infotainment, which grew over 40% and 10% in the quarter, respectively, as well as power electronics, which, although currently a small revenue base, grew significantly in the quarter.
E&S margins expanded 10 basis points to 12.4% on strong volume growth and positive net performance, as launch inefficiencies continued to wane. As noted, we continue to increase investment in key technologies that drive growth in E&S, particularly in active safety, automated driving and infotainment. 
Turning to Slide 17. Earnings came in, in the high end of our range despite a slightly higher tax rate of 17.4% versus a 17% forecast. EPS growth was driven by increased operating earnings and the favorable impact of a lower share count. We exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04 per share, including $0.03 from operations and $0.01 improvement from below-the-line items. 
Turning to Slide 18 and the outlook for the remainder of the year. I'd like to walk through the changes to our full year revenue and operating income guidance. 
Starting with revenue on the left. Full year revenues are expected to be $16.25 billion to $16.45 billion, with operating income between $2.15 billion and $2.2 billion. The updated revenue guidance reflects a reduction of $450 million from our previous midpoint, including a $200 million reduction related to FX translation and commodities, primarily resulting, again, from the weakening Chinese RMB, British pound and lower copper prices. 
Reduced global vehicle production accounts for the remainder of the decrease of $250 million. The lower production volumes reflect our views regarding continued weakness in the CB market, the estimated impact of Brexit and lower light-duty diesel volumes. In addition, we have included an estimate of lower volumes in China related to certain OEs, primarily impacting the Powertrain segment. As a result, at a segment level, we now expect Electrical Architecture adjusted growth of 6%, Powertrain growth of 3% and E&S growth of 14%. 
E&S and Electrical Architecture will continue to provide strong growth throughout the year for Delphi. Accordingly, we expect our full year adjusted growth rate to be approximately 7% reflecting over -- growth over market of roughly 5%. 
The earnings impact of the foreign exchange headwinds and the flow-through on lower volumes, including the lower performance in Electrical Architecture, will be partially offset by continued optimization of our cost structure. In addition to accelerating previously planned restructuring actions, we continue to identify additional opportunities to reduce costs in the second half of the year. 
We expect full year operating margin of 13.3%, a 30 basis point expansion over last year. We have tightened and raised the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance to $5.95 to $6.05, reflecting year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint.
Moving to the third quarter. We expect to generate revenues of $3.9 billion to $4 billion. The midpoint reflects further organic growth acceleration to 8%, with continued strong growth in Electronics and Safety and Electrical Architecture. We expect operating income in the range of $505 million to $525 million, and third quarter earnings per share of $1.38 to $1.44, up approximately 10% at the midpoint. 
Turning to Slide 19. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged and is an important lever to enhance shareholder value. On the left, we expect cash flow from operations to grow approximately $1.9 billion, in line with earnings. And the deployment priorities on the right are consistent with our strategy, maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade rating.
We are investing on our business through capital expenditures supporting new program launches, ongoing cost alignment and footprint rotation to best cost countries. We are committed to paying a competitive dividend, and when we have excess cash, we have a track record of returning it to shareholders via share repurchases, as evidenced by the $435 million of repurchases we've already done this year. Our full year guidance assumes repurchases for the year of $600 million. 
And we continue to pursue inorganic growth opportunities that meet our investment criteria and strategic growth objectives, particularly around expansion of our Electrical Architecture platform, active safety and automated driving technologies as well as infotainment and power electronics. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin for some closing remarks before we open it up to questions."

We delivered solid performance in the second quarter despite a few challenges. Our financial performance continues to be driven by the relevant safe, green and connected technologies that solve some of our customers' biggest challenges, while we're confident in our second half outlook, which includes 7% organic growth, roughly 60 basis points of margin expansion and mid-teens EPS growth. 
We continue to optimize our cost structure, while investing in technologies that will drive our future growth. Our year-to-date bookings and commercial developments position us well for continued strong revenue and earnings growth. And as Joe just said, we remain disciplined in our allocation of capital, investing in both organic as well as inorganic growth and returning excess cash to shareholders through both share repurchases as well as dividends. 
Through all of this, we remain focused on executing in a more dynamic macro environment during the back half of this year. 
And with that, we'll now turn it over to the operator to open up the line for questions. Thank you."

And now it's -- looks like around 600 basis points, which is up from the 300 to 400 in the first half. But can you talk a little bit about the bridge a little bit more, the bridge to that number? What, for example, specifically is happening in China? What are some of the specific drivers of that acceleration? If you can just comment on programs that are launching and how meaningful those would be. And lastly, I know it's a long question, but there -- we always get questions about how confident we should be about the growth guidance longer term. You guys have been talking about 8% to 10% as you look out to 2017 and beyond. Is there any reason, just given some of these variances that we're seeing, is there any reason to reassess that longer-term excess growth assumption?"

I'll start at a higher level, and you can fill in the blanks with the details. I think -- listen, as you look at our adjusted outlook for the back half of the year from a growth standpoint, as Joe referenced, there's really 3 key components. One is FX and commodity rates and the translation effect, and Joe quantified that as roughly $200 million. Then there's 2 separate pieces on volume. Piece one is effectively lower outlook or lower forecast from IHS and customers for vehicle production across the back half of the year, one. And then specific growth relative to market for us, principally, in our Powertrain segment. So I think, Rod, if you look at growth over market in our E&S segment, I think if you look at growth over market in our Electrical Architectural segment, quite frankly, the outlook remains unchanged. Where it has changed somewhat, at least in the near term, is on the Powertrain side. And it's principally being driven by a couple of things: one, light-duty diesel growth, and again, I'll let Joe comment on that; much lower commercial vehicle growth; and then when we look at the mix of customers we're on in China, an incremental effect related to growth over market there. As we look at the back half of the year and risk related to revenue, I'd tell you, we feel very good about where we stand from a revenue outlook, very good where we stand. And as we head into the back half of the year, we'll reassess each of our businesses in each of the markets and take another view about longer-term outlook for growth. Having said that, I would tell you, if you look at our growth over market for calendar year 2016 even on a revised basis, it's very strong relative to overall vehicle production at 5 points over market. So Joe, I'll let you add on the specifics."

That's based on updated production information that we have, includes some insight into what folks are thinking from a Brexit perspective and impact on Europe. The remaining $150 million, which would be more of the growth over market impact, the diesel, which is both commercial vehicle and light-duty, is $100 million of that $150 million. And then China, we've adjusted down $50 million. As I mentioned in my script, as Kevin touched on, we have seen customer-specific adjustments to schedules. I would almost refer to them as model-specific adjustments, some inventory balancing, we think, in the back half of the year, certainly -- and primarily in Powertrain. Certainly, nowhere at the level of schedule call-downs that we saw last year, so this is very different. It's model-specific, it's customer-specific, really concentrated at 2 or 3 customers on a couple of platforms. But we did see those -- sorry, go ahead."

Based on our discussions with those OEs, it appears to be inventory rebalancing at this point in time. It's something we're watching closely. But one thing I want to underscore and get back to, as you -- as we all know, governments are focused on, whether it's the U.S. or Europe, always hitting the revised standards. And to the extent there's less light-duty diesel, there needs to be more Powertrain electrification. And I think over -- although there may be slight dislocations in the near term, over the medium to long term, when you look at where we sit from a power electronics standpoint, we've cited these facts before, the average CPV on a standard internal combustion engine for Delphi is $300. When you look at 48-volt, it's 4x that CPV. On a hybrid, it's 5. On a full EV, it's 7x. And given our product portfolio, we're certainly well positioned. And I think that overall trend is why we're seeing such a significant ramp-up in growth in power electronics, and Joe said, off of a low number it's a very high growth rate. But when you look at what we're seeing from a bookings standpoint, just to give you a data point, the first half of last year, we booked roughly $400 million on power electronics, vehicle electrification. In the first half of this year, we're over $1.2 billion. So what we're seeing, stepping back and taking a look at a big picture, is significant ramp-up in demand for Powertrain electronics or electrification of the Powertrain, which is good for us."

But we have seen very strong growth in the second quarter and, quite honestly, expect full year growth in GDi to be a little bit over 50%. So we are seeing that. Restructuring, I would say, we are moving a little bit quicker on restructuring in Powertrain. Some of that's opportunistic. I would say, at this point, it's still consistent with a footprint rotation from West to East, particularly in Europe, although, as you may recall, that is diesel-focused. Those are diesel facilities that we are consolidating into taking out of Western Europe. There was one last year in France. There's another one this year in Spain, and there's going into Romania.

I think the dust, to some extent, has, obviously, settled following -- after all of the activity at the end of June. To your point, it is going to take a long time. So there are a couple of things that we're watching and will be mindful of from a, what I'll call, from a tax structure perspective. Those are primarily around how the European Union and the U.K. interacts or contract, effectively, post Brexit. At this point, we don't see anything that materially changes our tax rate. So if -- from a tax policy perspective, there aren't any single major drivers that if we were to -- if they were to change now, we would have a material impact to the 17% tax rate. Obviously, if new treaties and such are struck, new agreements are reached, particularly if it's punitive to U.K.-based companies, we'd obviously have to evaluate how to either structure around those or look at other alternatives. I would caveat, I think, the one thing that's -- our tax structure is a little bit unique in Europe because, even though we're U.K.-based, we have a significant presence in Europe. So it's not necessarily one of these tax structures that's built on, what I'll call, just planning initiatives. We have a large physical presence in the U.K. We have a large physical presence in Luxembourg. And our structure tends to be built around how we do business in Europe, how we do business in the U.K. versus just one-off planning actions. So that tends to be more substantive and tends to hold up better to tax law changes, i.e. things get grandfathered and such. So right now, we see no risk. Hope that answers the question. But kind of at this point, we see no risk at this point to the 17%. There's nothing out there that we're looking at saying, boy, we need to go change it now. But obviously, something, we will continue to watch diligently as we go forward."

Fourth quarter is usually strong for us. Fourth quarter is usually strong for us as well, remember, as we have NRE, and we have nonrecurring engineering. We get a lot of our reimbursements in the fourth quarter, particularly in the E&S and Powertrain business.

Before Joe gets into our financial results, I'd like to provide some context around the second quarter as well as our outlook for the full year. 
Beginning with the second quarter highlights on Slide 5. To summarize, we had a solid quarter, delivering accelerated revenue and earnings growth. Our revenues increased 7%, driven by strong double-digit growth in our Electronics and Safety segment, which had over 40% growth in active safety revenue and high single-digit growth in Electrical Architecture. Powertrain revenues, however, were weaker than expected, principally due to lower heavy-duty and light-duty diesel lines. And we also experienced increased demand volatility with certain key local customers across our segments impacting our growth in the China market, which we currently believe will continue into the second half of the year. 
Operating income increased to $577 million, and margins expanded to 13.7%, driven by both volume growth and continued cost structure optimization. These increases were partially offset by our continued investment in engineering and information systems to fund growth initiatives as well as some recent manufacturing inefficiencies in our Electrical Architecture segment that we're working through. Joe's going to provide more color on these in a few minutes. 
Earnings per share increased 19% to $1.59 a share. And despite some macro headwinds, we're raising the midpoint of our full year EPS outlook $0.05 to between $5.95 and $6.05 per share. 
As Joe will discuss in detail later, we're reflecting the changing macro environment in updated customer schedules and our revised outlook for sales and operating income in the back half of the year. We remain disciplined in our allocation of capital, investing in both organic and inorganic growth and at the same time, we returned $144 million of cash to shareholders during the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to roughly $600 million. 
We also posted strong second quarter bookings of $6.5 billion for a total of $13 billion year-to-date, reflecting awards from both our traditional OEMs as well as newer, nontraditional customers. 
In summary, we continue to leverage our business model and remain very focused on execution. 
Slide 6 highlights a few of the assumptions impacting our current outlook starting with the positives on the left. Regulatory trends and consumer demands continue to influence fuel economy, CO2 emissions and vehicle safety standards, driving content per vehicle growth. We continue to experience very strong demand for our active safety, infotainment, Gas Direct Injection, variable valve train and power electronic product lines, and increased demand for our active safety product has translated into increased interest in our automated driving solutions as several cities such as Singapore, Boston, Columbus and others are investing in automated driving pilots, all in support of the future mobility on-demand, presenting us with even more opportunities for future profitable growth. 
The right side of the chart reflects our current view on the macros, including further currency and commodity headwinds, primarily from the recent devaluation of the sterling and Chinese RMB; increased weakness in the global commercial vehicle market, driven by double-digit declines in North America more than offsetting growth in the European and Asia markets; and slowing global vehicle production in the second half of the year, particularly in China, as well as weaker light-duty diesel volumes in both Europe and the emerging markets. 
In summary, although the macro environment appears to be increasingly challenged, we're confident in our updated outlook for the balance of the year.
Continued strong business bookings are reflected on Slide 7, which, as I mentioned, totaled approximately $13 billion through the second quarter. We had a number of important customer bookings as well as 7 new platform wins in the quarter, including large conquest wins for Electrical Architecture with GM in North America and with Daimler in Europe; powertrain wins, including valve train programs at both Hyundai and General Motors; an engine control module conquest win with VW; and a GDi win with Changan in China. And the key power electronics win for Electronics and Safety with Geely in China as well as an active safety win with Audi. 
On the right side of the chart, you'll see a sampling of the customer diversity in our year-to-date bookings, ensuring that we're not dependent on any one customer or any one region or business segment for growth.
Turning to Slide 8. As we've discussed previously, our customers are increasingly seeing the need for further electrification of the powertrain to close regulatory gaps on CO2 emissions and fuel economy. 48-volt mild hybrids deliver roughly a 70% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to full hybrids and about 30% of the cost. Given our strength in Electrical Architecture and power electronics, Delphi has a competitive advantage in the intelligent electrification of the vehicle. The increased interest from customers is further validated by the stronger volume projections from industry experts, who are now forecasting 48-volt mild hybrids making up 15% of vehicle production by 2025, that's up from just 10% 6 months ago. 
Now we've been awarded a third customer program since our last update, bringing total 48-volt bookings to roughly $200 million, with the first 2 programs launching with European OEMs in late 2017. In addition, we're presently engaged in discussions with 4 additional major OEMs on potential development programs in this exciting space. 
On Slide 9 are just a few examples of some of our 2016 major program launches. Electronics and Safety revenues are benefiting from infotainment launches on the VW MQB platform, the Cadillac XT5 and the Chrysler Pacifica, and active safety launches on the Renault Scenic and BMW 5-Series as well as power electronics launches on a number of these platforms, including the Volvo S90. 
Revenue growth in our Electrical Architecture segment is partially driven by program launches on the Daimler E-Class, Chrysler Pacifica and the Volvo S90. And Powertrain revenues are benefiting from the launch of the Ecotec small engine on Chevrolet's Malibu and Volkswagen's 1.4 and 1.6-liter engine platforms. 
Turning to Slide 10. Over the last few years, there's been a lot of focus on active safety and the technologies that support it. As you've heard us say previously, active safety technologies are the building blocks that will ultimately support autonomous vehicles, saving thousands of lives each year. So that's why active safety is the fastest-growing sector in automotive and certainly for Delphi. Customers want it and regulators see the benefit of it. During the first half of 2016, we booked $700 million in active safety awards, with wins across each geographic region, and we're on track to achieve well over $1 billion in active safety bookings for the fourth straight year in a row. 
Now with almost 80% of the safety benefits of Level 4 automation coming for just 20% of the cost at Level 2 automation, we see the near term for demand -- near-term demand, rather, for active safety technologies only growing. As a result, we expect our active safety revenues to increase roughly 50% annually over the next few years.
And on Slide 11, as a result of our industry-leading portfolio of active safety and automated driving solutions. We were recently selected by Singapore to develop and implement an end-to-end ecosystem for an urban, point-to-point, on-demand, autonomous vehicle service. Delphi will provide a fleet of fully autonomous vehicles, leveraging our proven automated driving platform, including advanced sensors, software and electrical distribution. And we will develop a cloud-based mobility on-demand software suite, opening up new potential autonomous markets for Delphi customers and enabling faster commercialization opportunities. 
Other pilots are planned for cities in North America and Europe, and we expect to make those announcements later this year. 
With that, I'll hand it over to Joe to cover the financials in more detail. Joe?"

I will start by covering our second quarter performance and then discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2016. Let's begin on Slide 13 with a snapshot of our second quarter financial performance. As Kevin ment",1391,"Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will start by covering our second quarter performance and then discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2016. 
Let's begin on Slide 13 with a snapshot of our second quarter financial performance. As Kevin mentioned, we delivered solid revenue and earnings growth in the quarter. Revenue was up 9% or 7% adjusted for currency, commodity, acquisitions and divestitures. Our operating margins expanded 10 basis points to 13.7%, and earnings per share grew 19%. Operating cash flow increased to $575 million, driven by higher earnings levels and improved working capital performance, partially offset by higher restructuring outflows. 
Slide 14 provides greater detail of revenue for the quarter. Starting on the left, we had strong sales growth, including the impact of M&A, driven by HellermannTyton, which contributed approximately $200 million of revenue. The impact from the Japan earthquake was within the range we provided in April. The strengthening U.S. dollar, principally against the Chinese RMB and pound, and lower copper prices were a drag on revenue in the quarter. 
Moving to the right. South America continues to be very weak. Growth in North America and Europe was strong, driven primarily by our Electrical Architecture and E&S segments. Our adjusted growth in China slowed in the quarter to approximately 5%, reflecting volatility in schedules at certain customers, including SGM and Great Wall. While our overall view of full year China vehicle production growth remains unchanged at approximately 4%, we expect fluctuations in quarterly growth over market rates to continue in the second half of the year.
Turning to operating income. Slide 15 walks the year-over-year change for the second quarter. Overall, our operating results were in line with our expectations. Flow-through from volume growth contributed to the margin expansion. HellermannTyton was accretive to earnings, and our integration activities and synergy realization continue on pace. Although we did experience some regional performance challenges in the quarter within North American manufacturing and Electrical Architecture, which I'll speak to in a moment, launch costs in E&S moderated in the quarter as expected. Also as Kevin referenced, we see significant opportunities in areas such as active safety, automated driving, infotainment and vehicle electrification and continue to increase investment in these areas.
As always, we continue our relentless focus on optimizing our cost structure, leveraging best cost locations and driving increased efficiency throughout our organization to fund continued investment in innovation and to help offset the impact of the discrete performance challenges that I just noted.
Slide 16 takes us through performance by segment. Electrical Architecture, consistent with our expectations, grew 8% on an adjusted basis. HellermannTyton growth was 10%. As I mentioned, operating margin flow-through in Electrical Architecture was negatively impacted by manufacturing performance challenges in North America totaling approximately $20 million. During the quarter, we experienced lower efficiency and higher labor costs associated with the previously planned consolidation of facilities. We expect some level of inefficiency to continue into the second half and have included an additional $30 million in our full year guidance. 
Powertrain revenues were flat year-over-year and short of our expectations. As solid growth in our gas business, GDi grew 50% in the quarter, was offset by lower commercial vehicle volumes in North America, a decline in light-duty diesel schedules in Europe and lower China volumes. 
With respect to light-duty diesel, towards the end of the second quarter, our Powertrain segment experienced a decrease in order levels, impacting both the second quarter and the back half of 2016 across multiple customers. We believe the reduced order levels are primarily related to customers managing down overall diesel inventories in Europe and Asia Pacific. The Powertrain margin decline of approximately 50 basis points was driven by the decline in volumes as well as the foreign exchange transaction impact, primarily associated with the devaluation of the RMB and pound. 
As expected, Electronics and Safety organic growth accelerated to 14%, reflecting revenues from program launches completed in late 2015 and earlier this year. Growth for the quarter includes a drag of approximately 2% for the mechatronics business. Growth was strong across several product lines, including active safety and infotainment, which grew over 40% and 10% in the quarter, respectively, as well as power electronics, which, although currently a small revenue base, grew significantly in the quarter.
E&S margins expanded 10 basis points to 12.4% on strong volume growth and positive net performance, as launch inefficiencies continued to wane. As noted, we continue to increase investment in key technologies that drive growth in E&S, particularly in active safety, automated driving and infotainment. 
Turning to Slide 17. Earnings came in, in the high end of our range despite a slightly higher tax rate of 17.4% versus a 17% forecast. EPS growth was driven by increased operating earnings and the favorable impact of a lower share count. We exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $0.04 per share, including $0.03 from operations and $0.01 improvement from below-the-line items. 
Turning to Slide 18 and the outlook for the remainder of the year. I'd like to walk through the changes to our full year revenue and operating income guidance. 
Starting with revenue on the left. Full year revenues are expected to be $16.25 billion to $16.45 billion, with operating income between $2.15 billion and $2.2 billion. The updated revenue guidance reflects a reduction of $450 million from our previous midpoint, including a $200 million reduction related to FX translation and commodities, primarily resulting, again, from the weakening Chinese RMB, British pound and lower copper prices. 
Reduced global vehicle production accounts for the remainder of the decrease of $250 million. The lower production volumes reflect our views regarding continued weakness in the CB market, the estimated impact of Brexit and lower light-duty diesel volumes. In addition, we have included an estimate of lower volumes in China related to certain OEs, primarily impacting the Powertrain segment. As a result, at a segment level, we now expect Electrical Architecture adjusted growth of 6%, Powertrain growth of 3% and E&S growth of 14%. 
E&S and Electrical Architecture will continue to provide strong growth throughout the year for Delphi. Accordingly, we expect our full year adjusted growth rate to be approximately 7% reflecting over -- growth over market of roughly 5%. 
The earnings impact of the foreign exchange headwinds and the flow-through on lower volumes, including the lower performance in Electrical Architecture, will be partially offset by continued optimization of our cost structure. In addition to accelerating previously planned restructuring actions, we continue to identify additional opportunities to reduce costs in the second half of the year. 
We expect full year operating margin of 13.3%, a 30 basis point expansion over last year. We have tightened and raised the midpoint of our full year EPS guidance to $5.95 to $6.05, reflecting year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint.
Moving to the third quarter. We expect to generate revenues of $3.9 billion to $4 billion. The midpoint reflects further organic growth acceleration to 8%, with continued strong growth in Electronics and Safety and Electrical Architecture. We expect operating income in the range of $505 million to $525 million, and third quarter earnings per share of $1.38 to $1.44, up approximately 10% at the midpoint. 
Turning to Slide 19. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged and is an important lever to enhance shareholder value. On the left, we expect cash flow from operations to grow approximately $1.9 billion, in line with earnings. And the deployment priorities on the right are consistent with our strategy, maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment-grade rating.
We are investing on our business through capital expenditures supporting new program launches, ongoing cost alignment and footprint rotation to best cost countries. We are committed to paying a competitive dividend, and when we have excess cash, we have a track record of returning it to shareholders via share repurchases, as evidenced by the $435 million of repurchases we've already done this year. Our full year guidance assumes repurchases for the year of $600 million. 
And we continue to pursue inorganic growth opportunities that meet our investment criteria and strategic growth objectives, particularly around expansion of our Electrical Architecture platform, active safety and automated driving technologies as well as infotainment and power electronics. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin for some closing remarks before we open it up to questions."

We delivered solid performance in the second quarter despite a few challenges.

We continue to optimize our cost structure, while investing in technologies that will drive our future growth. Our year-to-date bookings and commercial developments position us well for continued strong revenue and earnings growth.

What, for example, specifically is happening in China? What are some of the specific drivers of that acceleration? If you can just comment on programs that are launching and how meaningful those would be. And lastly, I know it's a long question, but there -- we always get questions about how confident we should be about the growth guidance longer term. You guys have been talking about 8% to 10% as you look out to 2017 and beyond. Is there any reason, just given some of these variances that we're seeing, is there any reason to reassess that longer-term excess growth assumption?"

I'll start at a higher level, and you can fill in the blanks with the details. I think -- listen, as you look at our adjusted outlook for the back half of the year from a growth standpoint, as Joe referenced, there's really 3 key components. One is FX and commodity rates and the translation effect, and Joe quantified that as roughly $200 million. Then there's 2 separate pieces on volume. Piece one is effectively lower outlook or lower forecast from IHS and customers for vehicle production across the back half of the year, one. And then specific growth relative to market for us, principally, in our Powertrain segment. So I think, Rod, if you look at growth over market in our E&S segment, I think if you look at growth over market in our Electrical Architectural segment, quite frankly, the outlook remains unchanged. Where it has changed somewhat, at least in the near term, is on the Powertrain side. And it's principally being driven by a couple of things: one, light-duty diesel growth, and again, I'll let Joe comment on that; much lower commercial vehicle growth; and then when we look at the mix of customers we're on in China, an incremental effect related to growth over market there. As we look at the back half of the year and risk related to revenue, I'd tell you, we feel very good about where we stand from a revenue outlook, very good where we stand. And as we head into the back half of the year, we'll reassess each of our businesses in each of the markets and take another view about longer-term outlook for growth. Having said that, I would tell you, if you look at our growth over market for calendar year 2016 even on a revised basis, it's very strong relative to overall vehicle production at 5 points over market. So Joe, I'll let you add on the specifics."

That's based on updated production information that we have, includes some insight into what folks are thinking from a Brexit perspective and impact on Europe. The remaining $150 million, which would be more of the growth over market impact, the diesel, which is both commercial vehicle and light-duty, is $100 million of that $150 million. And then China, we've adjusted down $50 million. As I mentioned in my script, as Kevin touched on, we have seen customer-specific adjustments to schedules. I would almost refer to them as model-specific adjustments, some inventory balancing, we think, in the back half of the year, certainly -- and primarily in Powertrain. Certainly, nowhere at the level of schedule call-downs that we saw last year, so this is very different. It's model-specific, it's customer-specific, really concentrated at 2 or 3 customers on a couple of platforms. But we did see those -- sorry, go ahead."

Obviously, there is some cyclical headwinds there. There's also other issues, of course, with real-world driving emissions and the costs of complying with the new diesel standards.

Based on our discussions with those OEs, it appears to be inventory rebalancing at this point in time. It's something we're watching closely. But one thing I want to underscore and get back to, as you -- as we all know, governments are focused on, whether it's the U.S. or Europe, always hitting the revised standards. And to the extent there's less light-duty diesel, there needs to be more Powertrain electrification. And I think over -- although there may be slight dislocations in the near term, over the medium to long term, when you look at where we sit from a power electronics standpoint, we've cited these facts before, the average CPV on a standard internal combustion engine for Delphi is $300. When you look at 48-volt, it's 4x that CPV. On a hybrid, it's 5. On a full EV, it's 7x. And given our product portfolio, we're certainly well positioned. And I think that overall trend is why we're seeing such a significant ramp-up in growth in power electronics, and Joe said, off of a low number it's a very high growth rate. But when you look at what we're seeing from a bookings standpoint, just to give you a data point, the first half of last year, we booked roughly $400 million on power electronics, vehicle electrification. In the first half of this year, we're over $1.2 billion. So what we're seeing, stepping back and taking a look at a big picture, is significant ramp-up in demand for Powertrain electronics or electrification of the Powertrain, which is good for us."

And when you look at the restructuring you're doing on -- in Powertrain, is that directly, expressly addressing this issue? Or is that sort of a more ongoing Western to Eastern European restructuring?"

Relatively speaking, that's about a $300 million business, so there's a little bit of it. It's growing fast, and we're very excited about it and it will fill that hole. But there is going to be somewhat of a timing, just as diesel comes down. It's obviously a much larger business. But we have seen very strong growth in the second quarter and, quite honestly, expect full year growth in GDi to be a little bit over 50%. So we are seeing that. Restructuring, I would say, we are moving a little bit quicker on restructuring in Powertrain. Some of that's opportunistic. I would say, at this point, it's still consistent with a footprint rotation from West to East, particularly in Europe, although, as you may recall, that is diesel-focused. Those are diesel facilities that we are consolidating into taking out of Western Europe. There was one last year in France. There's another one this year in Spain, and there's going into Romania. So it is diesel-focused, but still consistent with the overall plan."

I think the dust, to some extent, has, obviously, settled following -- after all of the activity at the end of June. To your point, it is going to take a long time. So there are a couple of things that we're watching and will be mindful of from a, what I'll call, from a tax structure perspective. Those are primarily around how the European Union and the U.K. interacts or contract, effectively, post Brexit. At this point, we don't see anything that materially changes our tax rate. So if -- from a tax policy perspective, there aren't any single major drivers that if we were to -- if they were to change now, we would have a material impact to the 17% tax rate. Obviously, if new treaties and such are struck, new agreements are reached, particularly if it's punitive to U.K.-based companies, we'd obviously have to evaluate how to either structure around those or look at other alternatives. I would caveat, I think, the one thing that's -- our tax structure is a little bit unique in Europe because, even though we're U.K.-based, we have a significant presence in Europe. So it's not necessarily one of these tax structures that's built on, what I'll call, just planning initiatives. We have a large physical presence in the U.K. We have a large physical presence in Luxembourg. And our structure tends to be built around how we do business in Europe, how we do business in the U.K. versus just one-off planning actions. So that tends to be more substantive and tends to hold up better to tax law changes, i.e. things get grandfathered and such. So right now, we see no risk. Hope that answers the question. But kind of at this point, we see no risk at this point to the 17%. There's nothing out there that we're looking at saying, boy, we need to go change it now. But obviously, something, we will continue to watch diligently as we go forward."

And when you go through the economics and the discussions that we're having with -- when you go -- based on the discussions we're having with the other OEs at this point in time, and you talk about the technology, the cost of the technology and benefit of the technology, we think this is something that is going to gain significant traction, as do those OEs."

And as I mentioned, one benefit that we do see to margin over time, and expect to continue to see, as these newer product lines grow in volume, material savings also becomes more available to us. So as we buy more, we're able to leverage that spend better. A product line at $100 million, there's only so much leverage you can do. As these get to $0.5 billion and beyond, there's obviously more leverage over a supply base."

And to Joe's point, we're really good at getting cost out when we get volume and leveraging the manufacturing plant as well as getting material savings. As you get into integrated solution, where you're fusing sensors, that's a much different scenario. And there are only a few players that can actually do that, we, being one of them.

Combining those capabilities is significant. We're looking at similar opportunities from a technology standpoint as it relates to infotainment and clusters. So having that capability and the ability to take out cost and take out complexity based on our experience in that segment is huge."

59502420,403868869,1069738,"Delphi Automotive PLC, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Aptiv PLC","Executives","Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone.

Before Joe gets into our financial results, let me provide some context on the third quarter.
Beginning with the highlights on Slide 5. We had a solid quarter delivering strong revenue and earnings growth. Revenue increased 10%, driven by double-digit growth in both our Electronics and Safety and Electrical Architecture segments and mid-single-digit growth in our Powertrain business. 
Operating income increased to $531 million and operating margins expanded to 13%, driven by flow-through on volume growth and continued cost structure optimization, partially offset by some strategic investments. Earnings per share increased 17% to $1.50. And we generated strong cash flow, a portion of which we used to return $175 million of cash to shareholders, bringing the year-to-date total for share repurchases and dividends to roughly $770 million.
As Joe will cover later, we also took actions during the quarter to strengthen our capital structure and divest our mechatronics business, continuing the rotation of our product portfolio into high-growth sectors. Lastly, we delivered another strong bookings quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $18 billion. The leadership team are being focused on executing flawlessly and delivering on our commitments. 
Turning to Slide 6. The automotive industry's transformation has been the theme at each of this year's major auto shows with the highlights being the megatrends of safe, green and connected, which are at the heart of our strategy. The theme of the recent Commercial Vehicles Show in Hanover was around new mobility. I met with a number of customers who are looking to Delphi to help solve some of their toughest challenges resulting from these megatrends. In addition to the usual discussions regarding new powertrain technologies and their impact on increased fuel efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions, much of the dialogue was around vehicle connectivity, active safety, automated driving as a means of increasing driver productivity, enhancing vehicle safety and improving fuel economy, each of which translates into real cost savings for fleet managers.
And turning to Slide 7. At the Paris Auto Show, vehicle electrification was front and center as customers looked to close regulatory gaps on CO2 emissions and improve fuel economy. Industry experts and even some of our customers are now forecasting 25% to 30% of vehicles to be electrified by 2025. And given our strength in powertrain technology, electrical architecture and power electronics, Delphi has unique competitive solutions in the intelligent electrification of passenger vehicles that cost-effectively help our customers meet increasingly stringent regulatory standards. 
These solutions are shown in greater detail on Slide 8. We're well positioned regardless of the trend in vehicle electrification. And our content per vehicle grows with increased electrification. From 2 to 4x the content of a gas internal combustion engine on a 48-volt vehicle, depending on whether we're doing components or a full system integration, all the way up to 7 to 8x the content on a full electric car. So the trend towards increased electrification is very good for Delphi.
Slide 9 highlights our $18 billion of bookings year-to-date, which includes large complex wins for Electrical Architecture in Asia and additional content wins in North America; awards for gas fuel injection systems with OEMs in both North America and Europe; and major infotainment wins, including a program for a large European OEM; and an active safety win with Changan in China. On the right side of the chart are the cumulative bookings for some of our faster-growing technologies underpinning the safe, green and connected megatrends. 
Let's turn to Slide 10 for another example. The road to increased vehicle connectivity and automation requires faster speeds for data processing and more high-speed computing power. High-speed vehicle computers, such as the multi-domain controller we launch with Audi in 2017 and the integrated cockpit controller we launch with Volvo in 2018, make decisions 34,000x faster than humans. Through the fusion of sensors and the integration of advanced software algorithms, these technologies reduce architectural complexity while increasing computer processing power and enabling vehicle connectivity.
This serves as a nice bridge to Slide 11, which provides an overview of our recently announced partnership with Mobileye. We've experienced significant interest from customers in the U.S., Europe, Korea, China and Japan for a Central Sensing Localization and Planning automated driving platform. When you combine Mobileye's vision in road experience management systems with Delphi's sensor suite, automated driving software from Ottomatika and our multi-domain controller, no other entity comes close to matching the quality or the capability of this automated driving system. Our collaboration is off to a fast start and is making significant headway. In fact, you're going to be able to see and ride in the first demonstration vehicles, along with several other important technologies, at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. 
Finally, on Slide 12, I'm proud to say Delphi's received 2 nominations for the Automotive News PACE Awards, one of the industry recognition forms for innovation. Delphi's being recognized for its gesture recognition technology, which recently launched on the all-new BMW 7 Series, and for 360-degree short-range radar for ADAS systems that provides superior radar performance while enabling many new sensing capabilities that recently launched on a new Hyundai vehicle with several other OEs launching next year. This is really a great testament to the capabilities and dedication of our teams, which have received over 60 nominations and won 18 PACE Awards over the past 2 decades. 
So with that, I'm going to hand the call over to Joe."
59502420,403868869,1069738,"Delphi Automotive PLC, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Aptiv PLC","Executives","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will review our third quarter financial performance before discussing our guidance for the remainder of the year. Beginning on Slide 14 with a summary of our third quarter financial performance. We are very p",1326,"Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will review our third quarter financial performance before discussing our guidance for the remainder of the year. 
Beginning on Slide 14 with a summary of our third quarter financial performance. We are very pleased with the third quarter results, as Kevin mentioned. Adjusted revenue grew double digits, up 10%. Our EBITDA margins expanded 60 basis points to 17.2%. And operating margins expanded 10 basis points to 13%. Earnings per share grew 17%, driven by solid share -- by solid sales growth. And in the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $415 million and purchased 1.5 million shares, totaling approximately $100 million. With our 7874 issue behind us, our low tax rate, 17% for the quarter, continues to allow us to deploy capital more effectively.
Slide 15 provides greater detail on revenue in the quarter. Sales growth outpaced expectations with strong performance around the world, particularly in Europe and China. Beginning with the walk in the left, sales volume more than offset price, foreign exchange and commodity headwinds. FX headwinds were largely driven by the weakening British pound and Chinese RMB, as we had previously guided. And the HellermannTyton acquisition contributed approximately $200 million of revenue, up 10% year-over-year, partially offset by the Reception Systems divestiture. Moving to the right, with the exception of South America, all regions benefited from strong growth. Again, in particular, China was up 27% for the quarter, benefiting in part from a weak Q3 2015 while Europe benefited from strong growth in Electrical Architecture and E&S, driven by robust new program launches. 
Turning to operating income. Slide 16 walks the year-over-year change for the third quarter. Overall, operating margins were in line at 13%. Strong sales growth, combined with accretive M&A and net performance, contributed to margin expansion in the quarter, partially offset by price and FX headwinds. Net performance was favorable despite higher levels of engineering spend, primarily related to our automated driving initiatives in E&S and the operational inefficiencies in Electrical Architecture we highlighted last quarter.
On Slide 17, you can see a breakdown of performance by segment. Electrical Architecture had adjusted growth of 11% with new launches benefiting Europe and higher volumes in China. Margins expanded 30 basis points year-over-year on higher volumes. As previously discussed, we continue to experience operational inefficiencies in the business, which negatively impacted our performance in the quarter by approximately $15 million, in line with our previous expectations.
Powertrain also delivered above-market adjusted growth of 4% with strong double-digit gains in Gas Direct Injection and variable valve train, more than offsetting mid- to high single-digit declines in commercial and light-duty diesel volumes. Powertrain margins expanded 30 basis points on strong manufacturing performance, partially offset by the FX impact from the weakening GBP and Chinese RMB, primarily related to the FX transaction impact in our Powertrain U.K. and China operations.
Electronics and Safety adjusted growth accelerated to a record 17% in the quarter. New program launches, particularly in active safety and infotainment, continued to drive double-digit growth. As Kevin mentioned, we are investing alongside this growth to position the company for the acceleration in automated driving opportunities with higher engineering investments in the quarter negatively impacting E&S margins by approximately 40 basis points. 
It is important to note that the segment numbers for both 2015 and 2016 reflect the realignment of our power electronics business from E&S to Powertrain. This move better aligns our propulsion technologies with the changing needs of our customers. The impact is relatively small with break-even sales of approximately $30 million in the quarter.
Turning to Slide 18. EPS grew 17% versus the prior year, representing our third quarter of double-digit EPS growth this year. We exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.09, driven primarily by the flow-through of higher-than-expected sales. And below-the-line items contributed approximately $0.03, including the results from our nonconsolidated joint ventures.
Turning to Slide 19. The third quarter also proved to be active on the capital structure front. We completed the refinancing of our 2023 senior notes that resulted in a less expensive, longer-tenor capital structure. As you can see, by using new long-term debt denominated in both U.S. dollars and euros, including $300 million of 30-year senior notes at 4.4%, we were able to extend the time to maturity by almost 3 years and optimize the cost of funds, decreasing our interest expense by approximately $20 million annually. And we are generating more free cash flow, driven by higher operating earnings and lower cash taxes, providing more cash for key investments and capital redeployment. 
Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. As Kevin mentioned, we signed a definitive agreement to divest our mechatronics business. With annual sales of approximately $250 million, we expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter. We continue to be very active in the market for acquisitions and investments, focused on companies with leading technologies, strong management teams and operating capabilities that give us the confidence on our ability to integrate and drive synergies. We are committed to paying a competitive dividend and returning excess capital to shareholders. As you can see from our recent track record, since 2014, we've returned over $3.5 billion in the form of share repurchases and dividends. And for the full year, we are on pace to complete $600 million of buybacks, consistent with our prior outlook.
Turning to Slide 20 and starting with the outlook for the fourth quarter on the left. Revenue is expected to be $4.1 billion at the midpoint, reflecting approximately 4% adjusted growth on flat vehicle production, lapping a tough comparable from Q4 2015. Margins, however, are expected to expand 60 basis points year-over-year with strong net performance helped in part by the lapping of the inefficiencies we experienced last year in China. Earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.65, reflecting year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint. 
Moving to the right of the slide. You can see our updated full year outlook. We are reflecting the strength of the third quarter performance in our updated full year guidance for sales and earnings. We now expect sales of approximately $16.45 billion at the midpoint, up approximately 7%, and EPS in the range of $6 to $6.10 per share, up 16% over last year.
Now before I hand it back to Kevin for some closing remarks, given the time of the year, we begin to get questions on next year. And I thought it would be helpful to spend a minute on our initial considerations for 2017. As we sit here today, we believe global vehicle production for next year will be flat to 2016 levels. However, with our strong portfolio of relevant technologies, we would expect Delphi to grow mid-single-digit organic, driven by our faster-growing product lines, active safety, infotainment, GDi and vehicle electrification, all of which are expected to grow strong double digits again in 2017.
As always, our team remains focused on optimizing our cost structure and driving increased efficiencies throughout the organization. This relentless focus will allow us to continue to expand operating margins and invest in key technologies, including our CSLP automated driving partnership with Mobileye. Although we experienced significant FX and commodity headwinds in 2016, if spot rates held where they are today, we would only expect $150 million headwind to revenue in 2017.
Lastly, as we noted, the divestiture of mechatronics is expected to close late in the fourth quarter and will be accretive to our 2017 adjusted growth rate, although the sale will be a headwind to reported revenue and operating income. So as we reflect on the future, we have a more competitive technology portfolio, a more flexible business model and a less expensive capital structure that will drive revenue, earnings and cash flow growth through the cycle. 
And with that, I'll now turn it over to Kevin for some closing remarks before we open it up to questions."

Clearly, there is a headwind as it relates to light-duty diesel penetration in the market. Now offsetting that is significant growth in Gas Direct Injection and variable valve train technologies. So to put it in perspective, GDi for us this year will grow close to 50%, variable valve train close to 40%. So we're working very hard to close the gap in terms of revenue headwind on light-duty diesel with replacement technologies on the gas side of the engine. And in addition to that, the rationale for our movement of the power electronics out of E&S into Powertrain is, given the trend in light-duty diesel, we're seeing more of that customer interaction quite frankly take place within the powertrain functions of our customers than where it's been historically as they work to improve fuel economy and reduce CO2 emissions. So that was the rationale for why we've moved that product line there. And that's another product line where we're seeing, I think, close to 100% growth this year in revenue, albeit off of a very small number today."

So I guess, with that, if that's historic, what we've seen this time and time again, if that trend holds, what are your expectations for increased pricing pressure? I know it's always hard, and we know the communication on that, but could you not bake in a bit more aggressive price-downs than we've seen over the last cyclical period of low to mid-double-digit global production growth into next year?"

I think one thing as you look at let me go production where we sit today versus where we sit historically, I think there are 2 factors that you need to consider. And I can't quantify it for you, but I think they're qualitative and they translate to quantitative. One is our OEs from a cost structure standpoint are in a better position than they've been historically. And I think that certainly is an incremental benefit. Two, I think when you look at vehicle mix, they're in a position where vehicle mix is better than what it's historical been. So there's some element of offering. Listen, I think as the market gets more challenged, will OEs potentially get more challenging from a pricing standpoint? Yes, possible. That's why Joe made the comments, and I've made the comments, in addition to our discussion about product portfolio and growth, we're always focused on the cost structure so that to the extent, if price-downs do go up and we need to respond to that, we have the ability to absorb that and still deliver strong margins."

And I think this is -- it's really important. When you talk to our OE customers, especially on the European side with respect to light-duty diesel, to the extent there's a decline in light-duty diesel penetration rates and there's an increase in Gas Direct Injection, the reality is without more light-duty diesel, they can't meet standards that are out there. So they're going to need to overlay increased vehicle electrification to achieve that. So as we give you the trade-off between light-duty diesel and GDi, just spot on, it's kind of $0.60 on the dollar trade-off, you do really need to overlay some element of increased electrification, whether that's 48-volt, whether it's full hybrid or plug-in hybrid, whatever the case may be. So I don't think the calculus is simple as saying less light-duty penetration replaced with lower content Gas Direct Injection. There has to be an electrification quantification that you need to roll into your assumption to fully assess the impact."

Before Joe gets into our financial results, let me provide some context on the third quarter.
Beginning with the highlights on Slide 5. We had a solid quarter delivering strong revenue and earnings growth. Revenue increased 10%, driven by double-digit growth in both our Electronics and Safety and Electrical Architecture segments and mid-single-digit growth in our Powertrain business. 
Operating income increased to $531 million and operating margins expanded to 13%, driven by flow-through on volume growth and continued cost structure optimization, partially offset by some strategic investments. Earnings per share increased 17% to $1.50. And we generated strong cash flow, a portion of which we used to return $175 million of cash to shareholders, bringing the year-to-date total for share repurchases and dividends to roughly $770 million.
As Joe will cover later, we also took actions during the quarter to strengthen our capital structure and divest our mechatronics business, continuing the rotation of our product portfolio into high-growth sectors. Lastly, we delivered another strong bookings quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $18 billion. The leadership team are being focused on executing flawlessly and delivering on our commitments. 
Turning to Slide 6. The automotive industry's transformation has been the theme at each of this year's major auto shows with the highlights being the megatrends of safe, green and connected, which are at the heart of our strategy. The theme of the recent Commercial Vehicles Show in Hanover was around new mobility. I met with a number of customers who are looking to Delphi to help solve some of their toughest challenges resulting from these megatrends. In addition to the usual discussions regarding new powertrain technologies and their impact on increased fuel efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions, much of the dialogue was around vehicle connectivity, active safety, automated driving as a means of increasing driver productivity, enhancing vehicle safety and improving fuel economy, each of which translates into real cost savings for fleet managers.
And turning to Slide 7. At the Paris Auto Show, vehicle electrification was front and center as customers looked to close regulatory gaps on CO2 emissions and improve fuel economy. Industry experts and even some of our customers are now forecasting 25% to 30% of vehicles to be electrified by 2025. And given our strength in powertrain technology, electrical architecture and power electronics, Delphi has unique competitive solutions in the intelligent electrification of passenger vehicles that cost-effectively help our customers meet increasingly stringent regulatory standards. 
These solutions are shown in greater detail on Slide 8. We're well positioned regardless of the trend in vehicle electrification. And our content per vehicle grows with increased electrification. From 2 to 4x the content of a gas internal combustion engine on a 48-volt vehicle, depending on whether we're doing components or a full system integration, all the way up to 7 to 8x the content on a full electric car. So the trend towards increased electrification is very good for Delphi.
Slide 9 highlights our $18 billion of bookings year-to-date, which includes large complex wins for Electrical Architecture in Asia and additional content wins in North America; awards for gas fuel injection systems with OEMs in both North America and Europe; and major infotainment wins, including a program for a large European OEM; and an active safety win with Changan in China. On the right side of the chart are the cumulative bookings for some of our faster-growing technologies underpinning the safe, green and connected megatrends. 
Let's turn to Slide 10 for another example. The road to increased vehicle connectivity and automation requires faster speeds for data processing and more high-speed computing power. High-speed vehicle computers, such as the multi-domain controller we launch with Audi in 2017 and the integrated cockpit controller we launch with Volvo in 2018, make decisions 34,000x faster than humans. Through the fusion of sensors and the integration of advanced software algorithms, these technologies reduce architectural complexity while increasing computer processing power and enabling vehicle connectivity.
This serves as a nice bridge to Slide 11, which provides an overview of our recently announced partnership with Mobileye. We've experienced significant interest from customers in the U.S., Europe, Korea, China and Japan for a Central Sensing Localization and Planning automated driving platform. When you combine Mobileye's vision in road experience management systems with Delphi's sensor suite, automated driving software from Ottomatika and our multi-domain controller, no other entity comes close to matching the quality or the capability of this automated driving system. Our collaboration is off to a fast start and is making significant headway. In fact, you're going to be able to see and ride in the first demonstration vehicles, along with several other important technologies, at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. 
Finally, on Slide 12, I'm proud to say Delphi's received 2 nominations for the Automotive News PACE Awards, one of the industry recognition forms for innovation. Delphi's being recognized for its gesture recognition technology, which recently launched on the all-new BMW 7 Series, and for 360-degree short-range radar for ADAS systems that provides superior radar performance while enabling many new sensing capabilities that recently launched on a new Hyundai vehicle with several other OEs launching next year. This is really a great testament to the capabilities and dedication of our teams, which have received over 60 nominations and won 18 PACE Awards over the past 2 decades. 
So with that, I'm going to hand the call over to Joe."

Beginning on Slide 14 with a summary of our third quarter financial performance. We are very pleased with the third quarter results, as Kevin mentioned. Adjusted revenue grew double digits, up 10%. Our EBITDA margins expanded 60 basis points to 17.2%. And operating margins expanded 10 basis points to 13%. Earnings per share grew 17%, driven by solid share -- by solid sales growth. And in the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $415 million and purchased 1.5 million shares, totaling approximately $100 million. With our 7874 issue behind us, our low tax rate, 17% for the quarter, continues to allow us to deploy capital more effectively.
Slide 15 provides greater detail on revenue in the quarter. Sales growth outpaced expectations with strong performance around the world, particularly in Europe and China. Beginning with the walk in the left, sales volume more than offset price, foreign exchange and commodity headwinds. FX headwinds were largely driven by the weakening British pound and Chinese RMB, as we had previously guided. And the HellermannTyton acquisition contributed approximately $200 million of revenue, up 10% year-over-year, partially offset by the Reception Systems divestiture. Moving to the right, with the exception of South America, all regions benefited from strong growth. Again, in particular, China was up 27% for the quarter, benefiting in part from a weak Q3 2015 while Europe benefited from strong growth in Electrical Architecture and E&S, driven by robust new program launches. 
Turning to operating income. Slide 16 walks the year-over-year change for the third quarter. Overall, operating margins were in line at 13%. Strong sales growth, combined with accretive M&A and net performance, contributed to margin expansion in the quarter, partially offset by price and FX headwinds. Net performance was favorable despite higher levels of engineering spend, primarily related to our automated driving initiatives in E&S and the operational inefficiencies in Electrical Architecture we highlighted last quarter.
On Slide 17, you can see a breakdown of performance by segment. Electrical Architecture had adjusted growth of 11% with new launches benefiting Europe and higher volumes in China. Margins expanded 30 basis points year-over-year on higher volumes. As previously discussed, we continue to experience operational inefficiencies in the business, which negatively impacted our performance in the quarter by approximately $15 million, in line with our previous expectations.
Powertrain also delivered above-market adjusted growth of 4% with strong double-digit gains in Gas Direct Injection and variable valve train, more than offsetting mid- to high single-digit declines in commercial and light-duty diesel volumes. Powertrain margins expanded 30 basis points on strong manufacturing performance, partially offset by the FX impact from the weakening GBP and Chinese RMB, primarily related to the FX transaction impact in our Powertrain U.K. and China operations.
Electronics and Safety adjusted growth accelerated to a record 17% in the quarter. New program launches, particularly in active safety and infotainment, continued to drive double-digit growth. As Kevin mentioned, we are investing alongside this growth to position the company for the acceleration in automated driving opportunities with higher engineering investments in the quarter negatively impacting E&S margins by approximately 40 basis points. 
It is important to note that the segment numbers for both 2015 and 2016 reflect the realignment of our power electronics business from E&S to Powertrain. This move better aligns our propulsion technologies with the changing needs of our customers. The impact is relatively small with break-even sales of approximately $30 million in the quarter.
Turning to Slide 18. EPS grew 17% versus the prior year, representing our third quarter of double-digit EPS growth this year. We exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.09, driven primarily by the flow-through of higher-than-expected sales. And below-the-line items contributed approximately $0.03, including the results from our nonconsolidated joint ventures.
Turning to Slide 19. The third quarter also proved to be active on the capital structure front. We completed the refinancing of our 2023 senior notes that resulted in a less expensive, longer-tenor capital structure. As you can see, by using new long-term debt denominated in both U.S. dollars and euros, including $300 million of 30-year senior notes at 4.4%, we were able to extend the time to maturity by almost 3 years and optimize the cost of funds, decreasing our interest expense by approximately $20 million annually. And we are generating more free cash flow, driven by higher operating earnings and lower cash taxes, providing more cash for key investments and capital redeployment. 
Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. As Kevin mentioned, we signed a definitive agreement to divest our mechatronics business. With annual sales of approximately $250 million, we expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter. We continue to be very active in the market for acquisitions and investments, focused on companies with leading technologies, strong management teams and operating capabilities that give us the confidence on our ability to integrate and drive synergies. We are committed to paying a competitive dividend and returning excess capital to shareholders. As you can see from our recent track record, since 2014, we've returned over $3.5 billion in the form of share repurchases and dividends. And for the full year, we are on pace to complete $600 million of buybacks, consistent with our prior outlook.
Turning to Slide 20 and starting with the outlook for the fourth quarter on the left. Revenue is expected to be $4.1 billion at the midpoint, reflecting approximately 4% adjusted growth on flat vehicle production, lapping a tough comparable from Q4 2015. Margins, however, are expected to expand 60 basis points year-over-year with strong net performance helped in part by the lapping of the inefficiencies we experienced last year in China. Earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.65, reflecting year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint. 
Moving to the right of the slide. You can see our updated full year outlook. We are reflecting the strength of the third quarter performance in our updated full year guidance for sales and earnings. We now expect sales of approximately $16.45 billion at the midpoint, up approximately 7%, and EPS in the range of $6 to $6.10 per share, up 16% over last year.
Now before I hand it back to Kevin for some closing remarks, given the time of the year, we begin to get questions on next year. And I thought it would be helpful to spend a minute on our initial considerations for 2017. As we sit here today, we believe global vehicle production for next year will be flat to 2016 levels. However, with our strong portfolio of relevant technologies, we would expect Delphi to grow mid-single-digit organic, driven by our faster-growing product lines, active safety, infotainment, GDi and vehicle electrification, all of which are expected to grow strong double digits again in 2017.
As always, our team remains focused on optimizing our cost structure and driving increased efficiencies throughout the organization. This relentless focus will allow us to continue to expand operating margins and invest in key technologies, including our CSLP automated driving partnership with Mobileye. Although we experienced significant FX and commodity headwinds in 2016, if spot rates held where they are today, we would only expect $150 million headwind to revenue in 2017.
Lastly, as we noted, the divestiture of mechatronics is expected to close late in the fourth quarter and will be accretive to our 2017 adjusted growth rate, although the sale will be a headwind to reported revenue and operating income. So as we reflect on the future, we have a more competitive technology portfolio, a more flexible business model and a less expensive capital structure that will drive revenue, earnings and cash flow growth through the cycle. 
And with that, I'll now turn it over to Kevin for some closing remarks before we open it up to questions."

Clearly, there is a headwind as it relates to light-duty diesel penetration in the market. Now offsetting that is significant growth in Gas Direct Injection and variable valve train technologies. So to put it in perspective, GDi for us this year will grow close to 50%, variable valve train close to 40%. So we're working very hard to close the gap in terms of revenue headwind on light-duty diesel with replacement technologies on the gas side of the engine. And in addition to that, the rationale for our movement of the power electronics out of E&S into Powertrain is, given the trend in light-duty diesel, we're seeing more of that customer interaction quite frankly take place within the powertrain functions of our customers than where it's been historically as they work to improve fuel economy and reduce CO2 emissions. So that was the rationale for why we've moved that product line there. And that's another product line where we're seeing, I think, close to 100% growth this year in revenue, albeit off of a very small number today."

And as these systems kind of -- I mean, you can't watch any sporting event or frankly any, let's say, 10-minute stretch of television without seeing another advertisement of a car stopping before hurting somebody or killing somebody. But I mean, it seems to me that you should be -- you're in a great position to start getting some of the real-world data at a kind of geometric rate to analyze how much safer these technologies are, given the level of cost in your systems that you're providing your OEM customers. So I guess the high-level question is putting the fully autonomous cars that could be, and theoretically, thousands of times safer than human driving aside just for a moment, how much per unit roughly do you think the content is per unit to kind of have a dramatic -- like a 30% or 40% or 40% or 50% reduction of vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-pedestrian type collisions based on the data and the technology and you as a member of the scientific community you're observing?

One is our OEs from a cost structure standpoint are in a better position than they've been historically. And I think that, that certainly is an incremental benefit. Two, I think when you look at vehicle mix, they're in a position where vehicle mix is better than what it's historical been. So there's some element of offering. Listen, I think as the market gets more challenged, will OEs potentially get more challenging from a pricing standpoint? Yes, it's possible. That's why Joe made the comments and I've made the comments.

When you talk to our OE customers, especially on the European side with respect to light-duty diesel, to the extent there's a decline in light-duty diesel penetration rates and there's an increase in Gas Direct Injection, the reality is without more light-duty diesel, they can't meet the standards that are out there. So they're going to need to overlay increased vehicle electrification to achieve that. So as we give you the tradeoff between light-duty diesel and GDi, and Joe was spot on, it's kind of 50 cents on the dollar tradeoff, you do really need to overlay some element of increased electrification, whether that's 48-volt, whether it's full hybrid or plug-in hybrid, whatever the case may be.

Before Joe gets into our financial results, let me provide some context on the third quarter.
Beginning with the highlights on Slide 5. We had a solid quarter delivering strong revenue and earnings growth. Revenue increased 10%, driven by double-digit growth in both our Electronics and Safety and Electrical Architecture segments and mid-single-digit growth in our Powertrain business. 
Operating income increased to $531 million and operating margins expanded to 13%, driven by flow-through on volume growth and continued cost structure optimization, partially offset by some strategic investments. Earnings per share increased 17% to $1.50. And we generated strong cash flow, a portion of which we used to return $175 million of cash to shareholders, bringing the year-to-date total for share repurchases and dividends to roughly $770 million.
As Joe will cover later, we also took actions during the quarter to strengthen our capital structure and divest our mechatronics business, continuing the rotation of our product portfolio into high-growth sectors. Lastly, we delivered another strong bookings quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $18 billion. The leadership team are being focused on executing flawlessly and delivering on our commitments. 
Turning to Slide 6. The automotive industry's transformation has been the theme at each of this year's major auto shows with the highlights being the megatrends of safe, green and connected, which are at the heart of our strategy. The theme of the recent Commercial Vehicles Show in Hanover was around new mobility. I met with a number of customers who are looking to Delphi to help solve some of their toughest challenges resulting from these megatrends. In addition to the usual discussions regarding new powertrain technologies and their impact on increased fuel efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions, much of the dialogue was around vehicle connectivity, active safety, automated driving as a means of increasing driver productivity, enhancing vehicle safety and improving fuel economy, each of which translates into real cost savings for fleet managers.
And turning to Slide 7. At the Paris Auto Show, vehicle electrification was front and center as customers looked to close regulatory gaps on CO2 emissions and improve fuel economy. Industry experts and even some of our customers are now forecasting 25% to 30% of vehicles to be electrified by 2025. And given our strength in powertrain technology, electrical architecture and power electronics, Delphi has unique competitive solutions in the intelligent electrification of passenger vehicles that cost-effectively help our customers meet increasingly stringent regulatory standards. 
These solutions are shown in greater detail on Slide 8. We're well positioned regardless of the trend in vehicle electrification. And our content per vehicle grows with increased electrification. From 2x to 4x the content of a gas internal combustion engine on a 48-volt vehicle, depending on whether we're doing components or a full system integration, all the way up to 7x to 8x the content on a full electric car. So the trend towards increased electrification is very good for Delphi.
Slide 9 highlights our $18 billion of bookings year-to-date, which includes large complex wins for Electrical Architecture in Asia and additional content wins in North America; awards for gas fuel injection systems with OEMs in both North America and Europe; and major infotainment wins, including a program for a large European OEM; and an active safety win with Changan in China. On the right side of the chart are the cumulative bookings for some of our faster-growing technologies underpinning the safe, green and connected megatrends. 
Let's turn to Slide 10 for another example. The road to increased vehicle connectivity and automation requires faster speeds for data processing and more high-speed computing power. High-speed vehicle computers, such as the multi-domain controller we launch with Audi in 2017 and the integrated cockpit controller we launch with Volvo in 2018, make decisions 34,000x faster than humans. Through the fusion of sensors and the integration of advanced software algorithms, these technologies reduce architectural complexity while increasing computer processing power and enabling vehicle connectivity.
This serves as a nice bridge to Slide 11, which provides an overview of our recently announced partnership with Mobileye. We've experienced significant interest from customers in the U.S., Europe, Korea, China and Japan for a Central Sensing Localization and Planning automated driving platform. When you combine Mobileye's vision in road experience management systems with Delphi's sensor suite, automated driving software from Ottomatika and our multi-domain controller, no other entity comes close to matching the quality or the capability of this automated driving system. Our collaboration is off to a fast start and is making significant headway. In fact, you're going to be able to see and ride in the first demonstration vehicles, along with several other important technologies, at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. 
Finally, on Slide 12, I'm proud to say Delphi's received 2 nominations for the Automotive News PACE Awards, one of the industry recognition forms for innovation. Delphi's being recognized for its gesture recognition technology, which recently launched on the all-new BMW 7 Series, and for our 360-degree short-range radar for ADAS systems that provides superior radar performance while enabling many new sensing capabilities that recently launched on a new Hyundai vehicle with several other OEs launching next year. This is really a great testament to the capabilities and dedication of our teams, which have received over 60 nominations and won 18 PACE Awards over the past 2 decades. 
So with that, I'm going to hand the call over to Joe."
59502420,403868869,1070456,"Delphi Automotive PLC, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Aptiv PLC","Executives","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will review our third quarter financial performance before discussing our guidance for the remainder of the year. Beginning on Slide 14 with a summary of our third quarter financial performance. We are very p",1326,"Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will review our third quarter financial performance before discussing our guidance for the remainder of the year. 
Beginning on Slide 14 with a summary of our third quarter financial performance. We are very pleased with the third quarter results, as Kevin mentioned. Adjusted revenue grew double digits, up 10%. Our EBITDA margins expanded 60 basis points to 17.2%. And operating margins expanded 10 basis points to 13%. Earnings per share grew 17%, driven by solid share -- by solid sales growth. And in the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $415 million and purchased 1.5 million shares, totaling approximately $100 million. With our 7874 issue behind us, our low tax rate, 17% for the quarter, continues to allow us to deploy capital more effectively.
Slide 15 provides greater detail on revenue in the quarter. Sales growth outpaced expectations with strong performance around the world, particularly in Europe and China. Beginning with the walk in the left, sales volume more than offset price, foreign exchange and commodity headwinds. FX headwinds were largely driven by the weakening British pound and Chinese RMB, as we had previously guided. And the HellermannTyton acquisition contributed approximately $200 million of revenue, up 10% year-over-year, partially offset by the Reception Systems divestiture. Moving to the right, with the exception of South America, all regions benefited from strong growth. Again, in particular, China was up 27% for the quarter, benefiting in part from a weak Q3 2015 while Europe benefited from strong growth in Electrical Architecture and E&S, driven by robust new program launches. 
Turning to operating income. Slide 16 walks the year-over-year change for the third quarter. Overall, operating margins were in line at 13%. Strong sales growth, combined with accretive M&A and net performance, contributed to margin expansion in the quarter, partially offset by price and FX headwinds. Net performance was favorable despite higher levels of engineering spend, primarily related to our automated driving initiatives in E&S and the operational inefficiencies in Electrical Architecture we highlighted last quarter.
On Slide 17, you can see a breakdown of performance by segment. Electrical Architecture had adjusted growth of 11% with new launches benefiting Europe and higher volumes in China. Margins expanded 30 basis points year-over-year on higher volumes. As previously discussed, we continue to experience operational inefficiencies in the business, which negatively impacted our performance in the quarter by approximately $15 million, in line with our previous expectations.
Powertrain also delivered above-market adjusted growth of 4% with strong double-digit gains in Gas Direct Injection and variable valve train, more than offsetting mid- to high single-digit declines in commercial and light-duty diesel volumes. Powertrain margins expanded 30 basis points on strong manufacturing performance, partially offset by the FX impact from the weakening GBP and Chinese RMB, primarily related to the FX transaction impact in our Powertrain U.K. and China operations.
Electronics and Safety adjusted growth accelerated to a record 17% in the quarter. New program launches, particularly in active safety and infotainment, continued to drive double-digit growth. As Kevin mentioned, we are investing alongside this growth to position the company for the acceleration in automated driving opportunities with higher engineering investments in the quarter negatively impacting E&S margins by approximately 40 basis points. 
It is important to note that the segment numbers for both 2015 and 2016 reflect the realignment of our power electronics business from E&S to Powertrain. This move better aligns our propulsion technologies with the changing needs of our customers. The impact is relatively small with break-even sales of approximately $30 million in the quarter.
Turning to Slide 18. EPS grew 17% versus the prior year, representing our third quarter of double-digit EPS growth this year. We exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.09, driven primarily by the flow-through of higher-than-expected sales. And below-the-line items contributed approximately $0.03, including the results from our nonconsolidated joint ventures.
Turning to Slide 19. The third quarter also proved to be active on the capital structure front. We completed the refinancing of our 2023 senior notes that resulted in a less expensive, longer-tenor capital structure. As you can see, by using new long-term debt denominated in both U.S. dollars and euros, including $300 million of 30-year senior notes at 4.4%, we were able to extend the time to maturity by almost 3 years and optimize the cost of funds, decreasing our interest expense by approximately $20 million annually. And we are generating more free cash flow, driven by higher operating earnings and lower cash taxes, providing more cash for key investments and capital redeployment. 
Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. As Kevin mentioned, we signed a definitive agreement to divest our mechatronics business. With annual sales of approximately $250 million, we expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter. We continue to be very active in the market for acquisitions and investments, focused on companies with leading technologies, strong management teams and operating capabilities that give us the confidence on our ability to integrate and drive synergies. We are committed to paying a competitive dividend and returning excess capital to shareholders. As you can see from our recent track record, since 2014, we've returned over $3.5 billion in the form of share repurchases and dividends. And for the full year, we are on pace to complete $600 million of buybacks, consistent with our prior outlook.
Turning to Slide 20 and starting with the outlook for the fourth quarter on the left. Revenue is expected to be $4.1 billion at the midpoint, reflecting approximately 4% adjusted growth on flat vehicle production, lapping a tough comparable from Q4 2015. Margins, however, are expected to expand 60 basis points year-over-year with strong net performance helped in part by the lapping of the inefficiencies we experienced last year in China. Earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.65, reflecting year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint. 
Moving to the right of the slide. You can see our updated full year outlook. We are reflecting the strength of the third quarter performance in our updated full year guidance for sales and earnings. We now expect sales of approximately $16.45 billion at the midpoint, up approximately 7%, and EPS in the range of $6 to $6.10 per share, up 16% over last year.
Now before I hand it back to Kevin for some closing remarks, given the time of the year, we begin to get questions on next year. And I thought it would be helpful to spend a minute on our initial considerations for 2017. As we sit here today, we believe global vehicle production for next year will be flat to 2016 levels. However, with our strong portfolio of relevant technologies, we would expect Delphi to grow mid-single-digit organic, driven by our faster-growing product lines, active safety, infotainment, GDi and vehicle electrification, all of which are expected to grow strong double digits again in 2017.
As always, our team remains focused on optimizing our cost structure and driving increased efficiencies throughout the organization. This relentless focus will allow us to continue to expand operating margins and invest in key technologies, including our CSLP automated driving partnership with Mobileye. Although we experienced significant FX and commodity headwinds in 2016, if spot rates held where they are today, we would only expect $150 million headwind to revenue in 2017.
Lastly, as we noted, the divestiture of mechatronics is expected to close late in the fourth quarter and will be accretive to our 2017 adjusted growth rate, although the sale will be a headwind to reported revenue and operating income. So as we reflect on the future, we have a more competitive technology portfolio, a more flexible business model and a less expensive capital structure that will drive revenue, earnings and cash flow growth through the cycle. 
And with that, I'll now turn it over to Kevin for some closing remarks before we open it up to questions."

Clearly, there is a headwind as it relates to light-duty diesel penetration in the market. Now offsetting that is significant growth in Gas Direct Injection and variable valve train technologies. So to put it in perspective, GDi for us this year will grow close to 50%, variable valve train close to 40%. So we're working very hard to close the gap in terms of revenue headwind on light-duty diesel with replacement technologies on the gas side of the engine. And in addition to that, the rationale for our movement of the power electronics out of E&S into Powertrain is, given the trend in light-duty diesel, we're seeing more of that customer interaction quite frankly take place within the powertrain functions of our customers than where it's been historically as they work to improve fuel economy and reduce CO2 emissions. So that was the rationale for why we've moved that product line there. And that's another product line where we're seeing, I think, close to 100% growth this year in revenue, albeit off of a very small number today."

And once you have standardization, suppliers and automotive OEs can work on technology as well as commercializing the costs and coming down the curve, which allows faster and more rapid adoption. So that's something that is very positive. As we talked about our partnership with Mobileye, one of the big, compelling reasons there to do that was how do we develop quickly a standardized system that can be leveraged across OEs or across vehicle platforms, can be done quickly and can be done at a very competitive cost because, as you know, our OEs are very, very focused on cost as it relates to technology."

When you talk to our OE customers, especially on the European side with respect to light-duty diesel, to the extent there's a decline in light-duty diesel penetration rates and there's an increase in Gas Direct Injection, the reality is without more light-duty diesel, they can't meet the standards that are out there. So they're going to need to overlay increased vehicle electrification to achieve that. So as we give you the tradeoff between light-duty diesel and GDi, and Joe's spot on, it's kind of 60 cents on the dollar tradeoff, you do really need to overlay some element of increased electrification, whether that's 48-volt, whether it's full hybrid or plug-in hybrid, whatever the case may be.

59502420,403868869,1071444,"Delphi Automotive PLC, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Aptiv PLC","Executives","Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone.

Before Joe gets into our financial results, let me provide some context on the third quarter.
Beginning with the highlights on Slide 5. We had a solid quarter delivering strong revenue and earnings growth. Revenue increased 10%, driven by double-digit growth in both our Electronics and Safety and Electrical Architecture segments and mid-single-digit growth in our Powertrain business. 
Operating income increased to $531 million and operating margins expanded to 13%, driven by flow-through on volume growth and continued cost structure optimization, partially offset by some strategic investments. Earnings per share increased 17% to $1.50. And we generated strong cash flow, a portion of which we used to return $175 million of cash to shareholders, bringing the year-to-date total for share repurchases and dividends to roughly $770 million.
As Joe will cover later, we also took actions during the quarter to strengthen our capital structure and divest our mechatronics business, continuing the rotation of our product portfolio into high-growth sectors. Lastly, we delivered another strong bookings quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $18 billion. The leadership team are being focused on executing flawlessly and delivering on our commitments. 
Turning to Slide 6. The automotive industry's transformation has been the theme at each of this year's major auto shows with the highlights being the megatrends of safe, green and connected, which are at the heart of our strategy. The theme of the recent Commercial Vehicles Show in Hanover was around new mobility. I met with a number of customers who are looking to Delphi to help solve some of their toughest challenges resulting from these megatrends. In addition to the usual discussions regarding new powertrain technologies and their impact on increased fuel efficiency and reduced CO2 emissions, much of the dialogue was around vehicle connectivity, active safety, automated driving as a means of increasing driver productivity, enhancing vehicle safety and improving fuel economy, each of which translates into real cost savings for fleet managers.
And turning to Slide 7. At the Paris Auto Show, vehicle electrification was front and center as customers looked to close regulatory gaps on CO2 emissions and improve fuel economy. Industry experts and even some of our customers are now forecasting 25% to 30% of vehicles to be electrified by 2025. And given our strength in powertrain technology, electrical architecture and power electronics, Delphi has unique competitive solutions in the intelligent electrification of passenger vehicles that cost-effectively help our customers meet increasingly stringent regulatory standards. 
These solutions are shown in greater detail on Slide 8. We're well positioned regardless of the trend in vehicle electrification. And our content per vehicle grows with increased electrification. From 2x to 4x the content of a gas internal combustion engine on a 48-volt vehicle, depending on whether we're doing components or a full system integration, all the way up to 7x to 8x the content on a full electric car. So the trend towards increased electrification is very good for Delphi.
Slide 9 highlights our $18 billion of bookings year-to-date, which includes large complex wins for Electrical Architecture in Asia and additional content wins in North America; awards for gas fuel injection systems with OEMs in both North America and Europe; and major infotainment wins, including a program for a large European OEM; and an active safety win with Changan in China. On the right side of the chart are the cumulative bookings for some of our faster-growing technologies underpinning the safe, green and connected megatrends. 
Let's turn to Slide 10 for another example. The road to increased vehicle connectivity and automation requires faster speeds for data processing and more high-speed computing power. High-speed vehicle computers, such as the multi-domain controller we launch with Audi in 2017 and the integrated cockpit controller we launch with Volvo in 2018, make decisions 34,000x faster than humans. Through the fusion of sensors and the integration of advanced software algorithms, these technologies reduce architectural complexity while increasing computer processing power and enabling vehicle connectivity.
This serves as a nice bridge to Slide 11, which provides an overview of our recently announced partnership with Mobileye. We've experienced significant interest from customers in the U.S., Europe, Korea, China and Japan for a Central Sensing Localization and Planning automated driving platform. When you combine Mobileye's vision in road experience management systems with Delphi's sensor suite, automated driving software from Ottomatika and our multi-domain controller, no other entity comes close to matching the quality or the capability of this automated driving system. Our collaboration is off to a fast start and is making significant headway. In fact, you're going to be able to see and ride in the first demonstration vehicles, along with several other important technologies, at the Consumer Electronics Show in January. 
Finally, on Slide 12, I'm proud to say Delphi's received 2 nominations for the Automotive News PACE Awards, one of the industry recognition forms for innovation. Delphi's being recognized for its gesture recognition technology, which recently launched on the all-new BMW 7 Series, and for our 360-degree short-range radar for ADAS systems that provides superior radar performance while enabling many new sensing capabilities that recently launched on a new Hyundai vehicle with several other OEs launching next year. This is really a great testament to the capabilities and dedication of our teams, which have received over 60 nominations and won 18 PACE Awards over the past 2 decades. 
So with that, I'm going to hand the call over to Joe."
59502420,403868869,1071444,"Delphi Automotive PLC, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Aptiv PLC","Executives","Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will review our third quarter financial performance before discussing our guidance for the remainder of the year. Beginning on Slide 14 with a summary of our third quarter financial performance. We are very p",1326,"Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I will review our third quarter financial performance before discussing our guidance for the remainder of the year. 
Beginning on Slide 14 with a summary of our third quarter financial performance. We are very pleased with the third quarter results, as Kevin mentioned. Adjusted revenue grew double digits, up 10%. Our EBITDA margins expanded 60 basis points to 17.2%. And operating margins expanded 10 basis points to 13%. Earnings per share grew 17%, driven by solid share -- by solid sales growth. And in the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $415 million and purchased 1.5 million shares, totaling approximately $100 million. With our 7874 issue behind us, our low tax rate, 17% for the quarter, continues to allow us to deploy capital more effectively.
Slide 15 provides greater detail on revenue in the quarter. Sales growth outpaced expectations with strong performance around the world, particularly in Europe and China. Beginning with the walk in the left, sales volume more than offset price, foreign exchange and commodity headwinds. FX headwinds were largely driven by the weakening British pound and Chinese RMB, as we had previously guided. And the HellermannTyton acquisition contributed approximately $200 million of revenue, up 10% year-over-year, partially offset by the Reception Systems divestiture. Moving to the right, with the exception of South America, all regions benefited from strong growth. Again, in particular, China was up 27% for the quarter, benefiting in part from a weak Q3 2015 while Europe benefited from strong growth in Electrical Architecture and E&S, driven by robust new program launches. 
Turning to operating income. Slide 16 walks the year-over-year change for the third quarter. Overall, operating margins were in line at 13%. Strong sales growth, combined with accretive M&A and net performance, contributed to margin expansion in the quarter, partially offset by price and FX headwinds. Net performance was favorable despite higher levels of engineering spend, primarily related to our automated driving initiatives in E&S and the operational inefficiencies in Electrical Architecture we highlighted last quarter.
On Slide 17, you can see a breakdown of performance by segment. Electrical Architecture had adjusted growth of 11% with new launches benefiting Europe and higher volumes in China. Margins expanded 30 basis points year-over-year on higher volumes. As previously discussed, we continue to experience operational inefficiencies in the business, which negatively impacted our performance in the quarter by approximately $15 million, in line with our previous expectations.
Powertrain also delivered above-market adjusted growth of 4% with strong double-digit gains in Gas Direct Injection and variable valve train, more than offsetting mid- to high single-digit declines in commercial and light-duty diesel volumes. Powertrain margins expanded 30 basis points on strong manufacturing performance, partially offset by the FX impact from the weakening GBP and Chinese RMB, primarily related to the FX transaction impact in our Powertrain U.K. and China operations.
Electronics and Safety adjusted growth accelerated to a record 17% in the quarter. New program launches, particularly in active safety and infotainment, continued to drive double-digit growth. As Kevin mentioned, we are investing alongside this growth to position the company for the acceleration in automated driving opportunities with higher engineering investments in the quarter negatively impacting E&S margins by approximately 40 basis points. 
It is important to note that the segment numbers for both 2015 and 2016 reflect the realignment of our power electronics business from E&S to Powertrain. This move better aligns our propulsion technologies with the changing needs of our customers. The impact is relatively small with break-even sales of approximately $30 million in the quarter.
Turning to Slide 18. EPS grew 17% versus the prior year, representing our third quarter of double-digit EPS growth this year. We exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.09, driven primarily by the flow-through of higher-than-expected sales. And below-the-line items contributed approximately $0.03, including the results from our nonconsolidated joint ventures.
Turning to Slide 19. The third quarter also proved to be active on the capital structure front. We completed the refinancing of our 2023 senior notes that resulted in a less expensive, longer-tenor capital structure. As you can see, by using new long-term debt denominated in both U.S. dollars and euros, including $300 million of 30-year senior notes at 4.4%, we were able to extend the time to maturity by almost 3 years and optimize the cost of funds, decreasing our interest expense by approximately $20 million annually. And we are generating more free cash flow, driven by higher operating earnings and lower cash taxes, providing more cash for key investments and capital redeployment. 
Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. As Kevin mentioned, we signed a definitive agreement to divest our mechatronics business. With annual sales of approximately $250 million, we expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter. We continue to be very active in the market for acquisitions and investments, focused on companies with leading technologies, strong management teams and operating capabilities that give us the confidence on our ability to integrate and drive synergies. We are committed to paying a competitive dividend and returning excess capital to shareholders. As you can see from our recent track record, since 2014, we've returned over $3.5 billion in the form of share repurchases and dividends. And for the full year, we are on pace to complete $600 million of buybacks, consistent with our prior outlook.
Turning to Slide 20 and starting with the outlook for the fourth quarter on the left. Revenue is expected to be $4.1 billion at the midpoint, reflecting approximately 4% adjusted growth on flat vehicle production, lapping a tough comparable from Q4 2015. Margins, however, are expected to expand 60 basis points year-over-year with strong net performance helped in part by the lapping of the inefficiencies we experienced last year in China. Earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.65, reflecting year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint. 
Moving to the right of the slide. You can see our updated full year outlook. We are reflecting the strength of the third quarter performance in our updated full year guidance for sales and earnings. We now expect sales of approximately $16.45 billion at the midpoint, up approximately 7%, and EPS in the range of $6 to $6.10 per share, up 16% over last year.
Now before I hand it back to Kevin for some closing remarks, given the time of the year, we begin to get questions on next year. And I thought it would be helpful to spend a minute on our initial considerations for 2017. As we sit here today, we believe global vehicle production for next year will be flat to 2016 levels. However, with our strong portfolio of relevant technologies, we would expect Delphi to grow mid-single-digit organic, driven by our faster-growing product lines, active safety, infotainment, GDi and vehicle electrification, all of which are expected to grow strong double digits again in 2017.
As always, our team remains focused on optimizing our cost structure and driving increased efficiencies throughout the organization. This relentless focus will allow us to continue to expand operating margins and invest in key technologies, including our CSLP automated driving partnership with Mobileye. Although we experienced significant FX and commodity headwinds in 2016, if spot rates held where they are today, we would only expect $150 million headwind to revenue in 2017.
Lastly, as we noted, the divestiture of mechatronics is expected to close late in the fourth quarter and will be accretive to our 2017 adjusted growth rate, although the sale will be a headwind to reported revenue and operating income. So as we reflect on the future, we have a more competitive technology portfolio, a more flexible business model and a less expensive capital structure that will drive revenue, earnings and cash flow growth through the cycle. 
And with that, I'll now turn it over to Kevin for some closing remarks before we open it up to questions."

So we're working very hard to close the gap in terms of revenue headwind on light-duty diesel with replacement technologies on the gas side of the engine. And in addition to that, the rationale for our movement of the power electronics out of E&S into Powertrain is, given the trend in light-duty diesel, we're seeing more of that customer interaction quite frankly take place within the powertrain functions of our customers than where it's been historically as they work to improve fuel economy and reduce CO2 emissions. So that was the rationale for why we've moved that product line there. And that's another product line where we're seeing, I think, close to 100% growth this year in revenue, albeit off of a very small number today."

When you talk to our OE customers, especially on the European side with respect to light-duty diesel, to the extent there's a decline in light-duty diesel penetration rates and there's an increase in Gas Direct Injection, the reality is without more light-duty diesel, they can't meet the standards that are out there. So they're going to need to overlay increased vehicle electrification to achieve that. So as we give you the tradeoff between light-duty diesel and GDi, and Joe's spot on, it's kind of 60 cents on the dollar tradeoff, you do really need to overlay some element of increased electrification, whether that's 48-volt, whether it's full hybrid or plug-in hybrid, whatever the case may be.

That's probably -- and then you think some of the things with GM and Ford, that's about 2 to 3 points of that. And then there's about 1 point of sort of positive offset there.
