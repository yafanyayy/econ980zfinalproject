And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 
2015 was a terrific year for Comcast NBCUniversal, and I couldn't be more pleased with the strong operational performance and financial results that we delivered both through the fourth quarter and for the full year. Honestly, 2015 was not without its challenges, but instead of letting those challenges become real distractions, our company pivoted and executed extremely well, particularly in the second half of the year. I am so proud of our resilience and leadership team for creating the momentum that is now driving us forward in 2016. Neil Schmidt, and Dave Watson and everyone at Comcast Cable is heroic in my mind for not only staying focused, but generating the best yearly video subscriber results that we've had in 9 years and the best broadband subscriber results that we've had in 8 years. We ended on a high note, as our fourth quarter video net additions were our strongest quarterly results since the first quarter of 2007. At the same time, we expertly balanced these great customer metrics with solid financial performance.
At NBCUniversal, Steve and his team exceeded expectations once again. We set new box office records, achieved #1 ratings in broadcast from morning to prime time to late-night, continued the outstanding progress in our Theme Parks and sustained healthy profit at Cable Networks. Altogether, Comcast NBCUniversal made incredible strategic, operational and financial progress in 2015 and did this through a collaborative culture where our businesses are focused on strengthening themselves and each other.
Overall, we grew revenue 8.3% in 2015 and operating cash flow by 7.7%. We generated close to $9 billion in free cash flow and increased cash returned to shareholders by over 40%. After reviewing our performance and outlook with our board, we are announcing today our decision to raise our dividend by 10%, marking the eighth consecutive annual increase. We've also increased our stock repurchase authorization to $10 billion, and we expect to repurchase $5 billion of stock in 2016.
Comcast NBCUniversal is indeed a special company. This is a time of exciting change in media and technology, and we are uniquely positioned. We have a diversified portfolio of businesses working well together, and the best suite of products, content and experiences that we've ever had.
So with that, let me talk about some of our specific achievements in 2015 and a few of the things that we're looking forward to in 2016 and beyond.
Starting with NBCUniversal. 
We've now fully doubled the operating cash flow since we announced the acquisition in 2009. In our TV business, we maintained our #1 ranking in broadcast primetime and saw a continued success in the voice and Blacklists, paired nicely with some new breakout hits including Blind Spot. In addition, we built on the strength of our Chicago franchise with our new show, Chicago Med. Sunday Night Football remained TV's #1 primetime show for the 5th year, grew viewership by 6% and completed the highest-rated season in its history. And as I mentioned, we exit 2015 with strength across all parts of the day, with the Today Show, Nightly News and Late-night all #one in their respective categories. NBC Sports Network had its most watched year ever, driven by NASCAR's debut and the continued growth of English Premier League and NHL. USA's Mr. Robot just won the Golden Globe and the Critics Choice Award for the Best Drama On television, a terrific accomplishment. Congratulations to Bonnie Hammer and her team.
Film had the best year in its history. Jurassic World, Furious 7, Minions and Fifty Shades of Grey, along with other titles, were hugely successful. With $6 billion in worldwide box office receipts, 2/3 of which was international and a strong and growing list of franchises, Universal Pictures is in a great position for ongoing success. 
And finally, Theme Parks had another outstanding year. We again grew revenues and operating cash flow double-digits through our proven formula of new attractions, complemented by additional hotel room capacity. From Harry Potter to Transformers and Fast and Furious, our team at Universal Parks and Resorts has been on a fantastic run, and there's plenty of growth on the horizon with our recent acquisition of a 51% stake in the park in a Osaka, Japan, a new-Harry Potter attraction opening in Hollywood, a new part being built in Orlando, a brand new park being designed for Beijing and our focus on increasing hotel room capacity.
At Cable, I feel we stand out in the industry, delivering a healthy balance between solid improvements in subscriber metrics, coupled with very strong financial performance. In 2015, we added 666,000 customer relationship, and that's an 86% improvement versus last year. And at the same time, we increased revenue per customer relationship a healthy 4.2% and grew operating cash flow 5.6%.
In 2015, we made improving customer service our main focus. I am really pleased that as we sit here today, we are seeing great progress. In fact, we achieved significant improvement across of the key metrics we use to track customer satisfaction, with some of our best customer metrics in years. We are going after each of the areas that have the most impact on the customers experience.
In 2015, we also continued to take our new products to scale. Our Voice Remote is the latest example, with 4 million activated since our launch just 8 months ago. The result of these investments are showing up in our subscriber trends, where we are seeing notable improvements, particularly in reduced churn across all product categories.
Business Services under Bill Stemper has now exceeded a $5 billion revenue run rate, while maintaining a growth of 20%, which is remarkable. We recently launched into the Enterprise segment and have some good early traction in this market to go along with the robust share gains to small and medium-sized businesses.
Overall, our progress during 2015 sets up incredibly well to be successful in 2016 and beyond.
In Cable, we are aligned around a few critical top priorities. The first is to continue our progress in transforming the customer experience. And as we've seen, our customers are responding to our efforts in a resounding way, and we will keep pushing hard. Second, we will focus on driving share growth through even better products, faster speeds and additional customer segmentation. And finally, technology leadership will remain at the forefront as we enhance excellence and drive it deeper into our customer base, rollout DOCSIS 3.1 to deliver gigabit speeds at scale and continue to develop solutions for more targeted advertising. 
At NBCUniversal, we feel great about our position and the range of opportunities ahead of us. We are proud to bring the 2016 Olympics in Rio to the American people, delivering the most comprehensive and technologically advanced Olympics in history. We are also excited to open a new Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood. Add the Secret Life of Pets to Illumination's growing list of animated films. And this week's exciting announcement that NBC will now be the home to 5 Thursday night NFL games.
We continued to be entrepreneurial and look for ways to invest and grow, make our investments in Vox and BuzzFeed and our partnership with Michael Angelakis new venture, which recently launched with a talented team who are scouring the globe for smart investments. 
So on a final note, I am excited about all the opportunities that lie ahead and believe we will approach them with the same level of operational excellence and financial discipline that has served us so well for more than 5 decades.
Mike, over to you."

Since Brian covered the terrific full year results, let's go straight to the fourth quarter on Slide 5.Adjusted revenue for the fourth quarter increased 7.6% and operating cash flow increased 4%. As a reminde",2233,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning everybody. 
Since Brian covered the terrific full year results, let's go straight to the fourth quarter on Slide 5.
Adjusted revenue for the fourth quarter increased 7.6% and operating cash flow increased 4%. As a reminder, the adjustments this quarter primarily reflect the exclusion of the partial quarter results of our acquisition of Universal Studios Japan. The overall growth in operating cash flow was primarily driven by high-speed data, video and business services at Cable and Film and Parks at NBCUniversal, which we'll go into in greater detail in the slides to come.
Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.81, a 5.2% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. And free cash flow during the quarter decreased 6.3% to $1.6 billion, and free cash flow per share of $0.64 declined 1.5%, reflecting growth in operating cash flow and lower cash taxes, offset by higher capital expenditures and increased working capital.
For the full year, we generated $8.9 billion of free cash flow, a 9.4% increase over last year's results, and free cash flow per share of $3.55, a 13.8% increase.
Now let's review the results of our businesses in more detail, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 6.
Cable Communications delivered a solid fourth quarter. Revenues increased 5.9% to $12 billion, as we added 281,000 customer relationships, a 58% improvement compared to last year's fourth quarter, driven by growth in our 2 product and 3 product customers, and reduction in churn across all products, with video and high-speed data each improving churn for 23 consecutive months.
Total revenue per customer relationship reached $145 per month, a 3.5% increase that reflects the successful execution of our strategy that is focused on retaining customers, growing customer relationships and driving our value-added bundling strategy.
Taking a closer look at our video business. Fourth quarter revenue increased 4.4%, reflecting rate adjustments and higher take rates of advanced services. We ended the year with very strong video customer growth, adding 89,000 customers in the fourth quarter. This is our best quarterly result in 8 years, driven primarily by another quarter of improved churn. Our churn results reflect improved customer support, better market segmentation and customer recognition of what we believe is the best video product on the market. We continued to make great progress rolling out X1 to new and existing customers, adding 1.1 million customers in the quarter, a 73% increase compared to last year. X1 customers now represent about 30% of our total video customer base. In addition, we continued to expand our TV Everywhere and On Demand choices. We now have 75,000 shows On Demand, 700 full season Stack series, which is up 50% from a year ago, and 98 live streaming channels available outside the home. Lastly, we are doing a better job segmenting the market, providing offers with more choice and appeal to new audiences that address multiple segments of the market. For example, we have increased our penetration of Hispanic households with targeted bicultural products and offers.
The strong momentum in our high-speed data business continued. Revenue increased 9.8% during the quarter, making it again the leading contributor to overall Cable revenue growth, driven by an impressive increase in our customer base, as well as rate adjustments and an increasing number of customers taking higher speed services. We added 460,000 data customers during the quarter and 1.4 million during the full year, with 77% of our customers receiving speeds of 50 megabits per second or greater. We have now added over 1 million high-speed data customers for 10 years in a row, and we see significant room for growth ahead. About 74% of our residential high-speed data customers now have one of our wireless gateways, which are also fueling our impressive growth in Wi-Fi hotspots that now number more than 13 million.
Voice revenues declined by 1.7% in the fourth quarter, as customer additions were offset by a modest decline in ARPU. In the fourth quarter, we increased net customer additions by 139,000, a 13% increase versus a year ago. 
Business Services was once again a large contributor to Cable revenue growth, with revenue increasing 18.9% to $1.3 billion. We have 3 engines of growth in Business Services, each had a different stage of development. Small business, which has healthy market penetration and generates the majority of our revenue; midsized business, where our market penetration is still less than 10%, but is growing at a higher rate; and our recently announced Enterprise division that targets Fortune 1000 companies and is gaining traction, with more than 20 large enterprise customers and multiple 8-figure deals already signed. Business Services has strong positive momentum and continues to represent a large and attractive growth opportunity for the company.
Finally, Cable advertising revenue declined 9.3% due to lower political revenue. Excluding political, our core Cable advertising revenue increased 2.8% during the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 7. 
Fourth quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 4.6% to $4.9 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.9% compared to 41.4% in the fourth quarter of 2014, driven by higher expenses, primarily related to the investments we are making to improve the customer experience and higher programming costs.
Fourth quarter programming expense growth slowed to 4.7%, reflecting the timing of programming renewals, while the full year increased 7.1%. As I said at a recent conference, the rate of program expense growth will increase in 2016. We expect approximately 10% growth in programming costs for the year, driven by several contact renewals beginning in the first quarter, as well as increases in retransmission consent fees and higher sports programming costs.
In negotiating programming deals, we continued to value expanded content rights for our On Demand and TV Everywhere platforms. We are adding more content, out of home rights, stacking rights and back seasons, ensuring we have the most compelling and competitive video product on the market. 
Non-programming expenses increased 8.1% for the quarter and 6.4% for the year. This growth reflects increased spending to improve the customer experience, as we have added technicians and service personnel, strengthened our dispatch teams and operations, and invested in training tools and technology. Metrics including on-time appointments, call pickup time and new customer onboarding success rates are all trending in the right direction.
Finally, our outlook for 2016 Cable operating margin is that it will be flat to down 50 basis points compared to 40.8% in 2015. We expect programming and other expense growth will be offset through modest rate adjustments, growth in high-margin businesses like high-speed data and business services, and cost efficiency improvements resulting from our X1 and customer experience initiatives, as well as general cost control efforts.
Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. 
On Slide 8, you can see NBCUniversal delivered solid results in the fourth quarter, as adjusted revenue increased 10.5% and operating cash flow increased 4.7%, driven by strong results at Film and Theme Parks. 
Cable Networks revenue increased 3.4%, and operating cash flow declined 1.9% to $894 million. Distribution revenue increased 6.8% and was positively impacted by higher affiliate fees associated with NASCAR on our NBC Sports Network during the quarter.
Advertising revenue declined a modest 0.3%, as the positive contribution from NASCAR advertising and increased pricing from a strong scatter market were more than offset by ratings declines at some of our networks. The decline in operating cash flow reflects the inclusion of NASCAR rights fees in the quarter that weren't present in last year's fourth quarter.
Broadcast revenue increased 7%, and operating cash flow declined 5.6% to $217 million. Advertising revenue increased 7%, driven by solid ratings in primetime and strong ratings growth at NFL Sports and Telemundo, as well as a strong scatter market. This higher demand in the scatter market has continued into the first quarter. 
Content licensing increased 35%, primarily driven by straight to spot series produced by our studios like Masters of None and Unbreakable Chain Smith, as well as an increase in production at our international studio. 
Last, retransmission revenue increased nearly 40% to $136 million and totaled $535 million for the full year. We expect retransmission revenue to increase to $800 million in 2016. Total expenses increased 8%, driven by the launch of midseason shows.
Film revenue increased 25.8%, and operating cash flow increased 84.6% to $143 million. Home entertainment revenue increased 75%, driven by the strong performances of Minions and Jurassic World, partially offset by a 37.5% decline in theatrical revenue and higher operating costs during the quarter. 
This was the most profitable year in Universal's history, with full year operating cash flow increasing 74% to $1.2 billion. While our 2016 slate is not as large and will be a difficult comparison to 2015, we are excited about our strategic slate of core franchises, sequels and animated films.
Theme Parks adjusted revenue increased 15.5% and operating cash flow increased 12.3%. Both our Orlando and Hollywood parks delivered higher attendance and healthy per capita spending growth, partially fueled by a record Halloween Horror Nights at both parks. Even more promising, despite having lapped the opening of Harry Potter Diagon Alley 2 quarters ago, Orlando continued to deliver healthy growth. In 2016, we look forward to the opening of Harry Potter in Hollywood and delivering on our plans to integrate Universal Studios Japan into our already strong Parks portfolio.
Now let's move to Slide 9 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. 
Consolidated capital expenditures increased 18.6% to $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter and 14.5% to $8.5 billion for the full year. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 10.2% to $2.1 billion for the fourth quarter and 14.3% to $7 billion for the year. This growth reflects higher spending on our customer premises equipment, including X1 and wireless gateways, increased investment in network infrastructure to increase network capacity, as well as the continued investment to expand Business Services. 
In 2016, we will continue to invest in each of these areas as they are driving positive results in our business. As a result, Cable CapEx as a percent of Cable revenue is expected to remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%. 
At NBCUniversal, fourth quarter CapEx increased 65.2% to $557 million and full year increased 13.5% to $1.4 billion. The increased investment at Theme Parks was the primary driver of the quarterly and yearly increases. And in the fourth quarter, we acquired land adjacent to one of our Theme Parks for $130 million.
In 2016, NBCUniversal's capital investment plan is expected to increase approximately 10%, reflecting the consolidation of Universal Studios Japan and continued investment in Theme Parks. The investments in our Theme Parks are clearly generating strong returns as they drive increased attendance and per capita spending.
I'll now finish on Slide 10 with capital returns.
In 2015, we returned $9.2 billion to shareholders, composed of $2.4 billion in dividends and $6.75 billion in share repurchases. As you can see on the left side of the slide, Comcast has a great track record of consistently returning capital to shareholders. The compound annual growth rate on our dividend from 2009 to 2015 was 24.4% versus 10% for the S&P 500.
Looking ahead, it is a high priority for us to continue this record of great total capital returns. This will be achieved by balancing 3 elements. First, the healthy annual return of capital to shareholders, which, for 2016, is an eighth consecutive annual increase in the dividend to do $1.10 per share, together with the plan to buy back $5 billion of stock over the course of the year. The second element to balance is investment in our business to profitably grow the long-term earnings capacity of the company. This includes a significant CapEx investment that I covered on the last slide. It also includes the deployment of capital to enhance our existing businesses through a relatively modest business development efforts, such as the box and BuzzFeed digital investments and the Japan Park deal that we did in 2015. And lastly, it includes exploring contiguous growth opportunities as we were doing in a variety of ways, including through Michael Angelakis new fund.
As we set our capital return plan for the year, we earmarked some capital for the whole basket of these types of situations, but we consider each situation on its own financial merits. And since I know it's on many of your minds, we will be filing to participate in the upcoming forward spectrum option, but I also want to be clear that the $5 billion in planned 2016 buybacks will not be reduced in the event that we acquire some spectrum in the auction.
The third and final element of our balanced capital plan is the very important maintenance of a strong balance sheet to protect the company in times of economic and market stress and position us to potentially capitalize on opportunities to create value in such times, such as we did with the NBCU transaction. As we begin what a thus far have been a very volatile 2016, we are well-positioned with our leverage at around 2x.
With that, I'm done with the slides. I hope everyone has a good sense for how pleased we are with the fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, as well as our momentum as we head into 2016. 
Now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A."

I think that concerning, it's an integral part of delivering the dynamic ad insertion, and I think we're -- one of the other things we are working on is what's the right ad load in VOD and can we improve the ad targeting and delivery of that system. Steve, you want to add anything?"

And if anything, I think the pendulum is swinging a little bit back towards traditional television advertising, putting a 30-second spot on television. Obviously, the nirvana is to have nationwide addressability, I think that's years away and difficult to couple together for all the obvious reasons. But in the interim, we have a whole variety of products that we have right now in the market to take advantage of set-top box data and other information, overlay it on top of our shows and existing ratings data so that we can go to advertisers and say, we have more eyeballs than anybody else in America than any other company in America and we can inform your purchases of those eyeballs, we think, as well or better than anyone else. ""So it's not like we're waiting for addressability but obviously addressability is a final and state, which I think is going to make television advertising that much more valuable."

So as I sum up, I think about the fact that, 2015, amazing year. I think these numbers are across the board. I thank all our colleagues who stand out in the industry because it's not just great subscriber numbers, but it's also strong financial, cash flow and growth. Doubling the cash flow at NBC since the acquisition is a real milestone that we're pleased with. And I think we're better together. And that both sides of the company are more informed. We have a collaborative culture, not only strengthening each other, but strengthening ourselves, and together, I think that makes Comcast NBCUniversal very unique. And as we thought about return of shareholder capital, we increased it 40% in 2015. We're reinvesting in the business, first and foremost, things like Japan and Fox and BuzzFeed. Our dividend has increased since 2009 on an almost 25% compounded growth rate, 10% for the S&P 500. So we think we continued to return capital, but we also want to use the growth that we've got to play offense with things like X1 and the kind of things we can talk about ethical. And I think we're doing that well and mostly giving customers what they want and that cultural shift, which really, Neil, you started in the second half of the year, is paying dividends. So thank you for your support. We look forward to a great 2016."

2015 was a terrific year for Comcast NBCUniversal, and I couldn't be more pleased with the strong operational performance and financial results that we delivered both for the fourth quarter and for the full year. Honestly, 2015 was not without its challenges, but instead of letting those challenges become real distractions, our company pivoted and executed extremely well, particularly in the second half of the year. I am so proud of our resilience and leadership team for creating the momentum that is now driving us forward in 2016. Neil Smit and Dave Watson and everyone at Comcast Cable is heroic in my mind for not only staying focused, but generating the best yearly video subscriber results that we've had in 9 years and the best broadband subscriber results that we've had in 8 years. We ended on a high note, as our fourth quarter video net additions were our strongest quarterly results since the first quarter of 2007. At the same time, we expertly balanced these great customer metrics with solid financial performance.
At NBCUniversal, Steve and his team exceeded expectations once again. We set new box office records, achieved #1 ratings in broadcast from morning to prime time to late-night, continued the outstanding progress in our Theme Parks and sustained healthy profits at Cable Networks. Altogether, Comcast NBCUniversal made incredible strategic, operational and financial progress in 2015 and did this through a collaborative culture, where our businesses are focused on strengthening themselves and each other.
Overall, we grew revenue 8.3% in 2015 and operating cash flow by 7.7%. We generated close to $9 billion in free cash flow and increased cash returned to shareholders by over 40%. After reviewing our performance and outlook with our board, we are announcing today our decision to raise our dividend by 10%, marking the 8th consecutive annual increase. We've also increased our stock repurchase authorization to $10 billion, and we expect to repurchase $5 billion of stock in 2016.
Comcast NBCUniversal is indeed a special company. This is a time of exciting change in media and technology, and we are uniquely positioned. We have a diversified portfolio of businesses working well together, and the best suite of products, content and experiences that we've ever had.
So with that, let me talk about some of our specific achievements in 2015 and a few of the things that we're looking forward to in 2016 and beyond.
Starting with NBCUniversal, we've now fully doubled the operating cash flow since we announced the acquisition in 2009. In our TV business, we maintained our #1 ranking in broadcast prime time and saw a continued success in the voice and Blacklists, paired nicely with some new breakout hits including Blindspot. In addition, we built on the strength of our Chicago franchise with our new show, Chicago Med. Sunday Night Football remained TV's #1 prime time show for the 5th year, grew viewership by 6% and completed the highest-rated season in its history. And as I mentioned, we exit 2015 with strength across all parts of the day, with the Today Show, Nightly News and Late Night, all #1 in their respective categories. NBC's Sports Network had its most watched year ever, driven by NASCAR's debut and the continued growth of English Premier League and NHL. USA's Mr. Robot just won the Golden Globe and the Critics Choice Award for the best drama on television, a terrific accomplishment. Congratulations to Bonnie Hammer and her team.
Film had the best year in its history. Jurassic World, Furious 7, Minions and Fifty Shades of Grey, along with other titles, were hugely successful. With $6 billion in worldwide box office receipts, 2/3 of which was international and a strong and growing list of franchises, Universal Pictures is in a great position for ongoing success. 
And finally, Theme Parks had another outstanding year. We again grew revenues and operating cash flow double-digits through our proven formula of new attractions, complemented by additional hotel room capacity. From Harry Potter to Transformers and Fast and Furious, our team at Universal Parks and Resorts has been on a fantastic run. And there's plenty of growth on the horizon with our recent acquisition of a 51% stake in the park in Osaka, Japan, a new Harry Potter attraction opening in Hollywood, a new water park being built in Orlando, a brand new park being designed for Beijing and our focus on increasing hotel room capacity.
At Cable, I feel we stand out in the industry, delivering a healthy balance between solid improvements in subscriber metrics, coupled with very strong financial performance. In 2015, we added 666,000 customer relationship, and that's an 86% improvement versus last year. And at the same time, we increased revenue per customer relationship a healthy 4.2% and grew operating cash flow 5.6%.
In 2015, we made improving customer service our main focus. I'm really pleased that as we sit here today, we are seeing great progress. In fact, we achieved significant improvements across the key metrics we use to track customer satisfaction, with some of our best customer metrics in years. We are going after each of the areas that have the most impact on the customers' experience.
In 2015, we also continued to take our new products to scale. Our Voice Remote is the latest example, with 4 million activated since our launch just 8 months ago. The result of these investments are showing up in our subscriber trends, where we are seeing notable improvements, particularly in reduced churn across all product categories.
Business Services under Bill Stemper has now exceeded a $5 billion revenue run rate, while maintaining a growth of 20%, which is remarkable. We recently launched into the Enterprise segment and have some good early traction in this market to go along with the robust share gains to small and medium-sized businesses.
Overall, our progress during 2015 sets up incredibly well to be successful in 2016 and beyond.
In Cable, we are aligned around a few critical top priorities. The first is to continue our progress in transforming the customer experience. And as we've seen, our customers are responding to our efforts in a resounding way, and we will keep pushing hard. Second, we will focus on driving share growth through even better products, faster speeds and additional customer segmentation. And finally, technology leadership will remain at the forefront as we enhance excellence and drive it deeper into our customer base, roll out DOCSIS 3.1 to deliver gigabit speeds at scale and continue to develop solutions for more targeted advertising. 
At NBCUniversal, we feel great about our position and the range of opportunities ahead of us. We are proud to bring the 2016 Olympics in Rio to the American people, delivering the most comprehensive and technologically advanced Olympics in history. We are also excited to open a new Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood. Add the Secret Life of Pets to Illumination's growing list of animated films. And this week's exciting announcement that NBC will now be the home to 5 Thursday night NFL games.
We continued to be entrepreneurial and look for ways to invest and grow. Like our investments in Vox and BuzzFeed and our partnership with [indiscernible] Michael Angelakis new venture, which recently launched with a talented team who are scouring the globe for smart investments. 
So on a final note, I am excited about all the opportunities that lie ahead and believe we will approach them with the same level of operational excellence and financial discipline that has served us so well for more than 5 decades.
Mike, over to you."

Since Brian covered the terrific full year results, let's go straight to the fourth quarter on Slide 5.Adjusted revenue for the fourth quarter increased 7.6% and operating cash flow increased 4%. As a remind",2232,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody. 
Since Brian covered the terrific full year results, let's go straight to the fourth quarter on Slide 5.
Adjusted revenue for the fourth quarter increased 7.6% and operating cash flow increased 4%. As a reminder, the adjustments this quarter primarily reflect the exclusion of the partial quarter results of our acquisition of Universal Studios Japan. The overall growth in operating cash flow was primarily driven by high-speed data, video and business services at Cable and Film and Parks at NBCUniversal, which we'll go into in greater detail in the slides to come.
Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.81, a 5.2% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. And free cash flow during the quarter decreased 6.3% to $1.6 billion, and free cash flow per share of $0.64 declined 1.5%, reflecting growth in operating cash flow and lower cash taxes, offset by higher capital expenditures and increased working capital.
For the full year, we generated $8.9 billion of free cash flow, a 9.4% increase over the last year's results, and free cash flow per share of $3.55, a 13.8% increase.
Now let's review the results of our businesses in more detail, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 6.
Cable Communications delivered a solid fourth quarter. Revenues increased 5.9% to $12 billion, as we added 281,000 customer relationships, a 58% improvement compared to last year's fourth quarter, driven by growth in our 2 product and 3 product customers, and reduction in churn across all products, with video and high-speed data, each improving churn for 23 consecutive months.
Total revenue per customer relationship reached $145 per month, a 3.5% increase that reflects the successful execution of our strategy that is focused on retaining customers, growing customer relationships and driving our value-added bundling strategy.
Taking a closer look at our video business. Fourth quarter revenue increased 4.4%, reflecting rate adjustments and higher take rates of advanced services. We ended the year with very strong video customer growth, adding 89,000 customers in the fourth quarter. This is our best quarterly result in 8 years, driven primarily by another quarter of improved churn. Our churn results reflect improved customer support, better market segmentation and customer recognition of what we believe is the best video product on the market. We continued to make great progress rolling out X1 to new and existing customers, adding 1.1 million customers in the quarter, a 73% increase compared to last year. X1 customers now represent about 30% of our total video customer base. In addition, we continued to expand our TV Everywhere and On Demand choices. We now have 75,000 shows On Demand, 700 full season Stack series, which is up 50% from a year ago, and 98 live streaming channels available outside the home. Lastly, we are doing a better job segmenting the market, providing offers with more choice and appeal to new audiences that address multiple segments of the market. For example, we have increased our penetration of Hispanic households with targeted bicultural products and offers.
The strong momentum in our high-speed data business continued. Revenue increased 9.8% during the quarter, making it again the leading contributor to overall Cable revenue growth, driven by an impressive increase in our customer base, as well as rate adjustments and an increasing number of customers taking higher-speed services. We added 460,000 data customers during the quarter and 1.4 million during the full year, with 77% of our customers receiving speeds of 50 megabits per second or greater. We have now added over 1 million high-speed data customers for 10 years in a row, and we see significant room for growth ahead. About 74% of our residential high-speed data customers now have one of our wireless gateways, which are also fueling our impressive growth in Wi-Fi hotspots that now number more than 13 million.
Voice revenues declined by 1.7% in the fourth quarter, as customer additions were offset by a modest decline in ARPU. In the fourth quarter, we increased net customer additions by 139,000, a 13% increase versus a year ago. 
Business Services was once again a large contributor to Cable revenue growth, with revenue increasing 18.9% to $1.3 billion. We have 3 engines of growth in Business Services, each had a different stage of development. Small business, which has healthy market penetration and generates the majority of our revenue; midsized business, where our market penetration is still less than 10%, but is growing at a higher rate; and our recently announced Enterprise division that targets Fortune 1000 companies and is gaining traction, with more than 20 large enterprise customers and multiple 8-figure deals already signed. Business Services has strong positive momentum and continue to represent a large and attractive growth opportunity for the company.
Finally, Cable advertising revenue declined 9.3% due to lower political revenue. Excluding political, our core Cable advertising revenue increased 2.8% during the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 7. 
Fourth quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 4.6% to $4.9 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.9%, compared to 41.4% in the fourth quarter of 2014, driven by higher expenses, primarily related to the investments we are making to improve the customer experience and higher programming costs.
Fourth quarter programming expense growth slowed to 4.7%, reflecting the timing of programming renewals, while the full year increased 7.1%. As I said at a recent conference, the rate of program expense growth will increase in 2016. We expect approximately 10% growth in programming costs for the year, driven by several contract renewals beginning in the first quarter, as well as increases in retransmission consent fees and higher sports programming costs.
In negotiating programming deals, we continued to value expanded content rights for our On Demand and TV Everywhere platforms. We are adding more content, out of home rights, stacking rights and back seasons, ensuring we have the most compelling and competitive video product on the market. 
Non-programming expenses increased 8.1% for the quarter and 6.4% for the year. This growth reflects increased spending to improve the customer experience, as we've added technicians and service personnel, strengthened our dispatch teams and operations, and invested in training tools and technology. Metrics including on-time appointments, call pickup time and new customer onboarding success rates are all trending in the right direction.
Finally, our outlook for 2016 Cable operating margin is that it will be flat to down 50 basis points compared to 40.8% in 2015. We expect programming and other expense growth will be offset through modest rate adjustments, growth in high-margin businesses like high-speed data and business services, and cost efficiency improvements resulting from our X1 and customer experience initiatives, as well as general cost control efforts.
Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. 
On Slide 8, you can see NBCUniversal delivered solid results in the fourth quarter, as adjusted revenue increased 10.5% and operating cash flow increased 4.7%, driven by strong results at Film and Theme Parks. 
Cable Networks revenue increased 3.4%, and operating cash flow declined 1.9% to $894 million. Distribution revenue increased 6.8% and was positively impacted by higher affiliate fees associated with NASCAR on our NBC Sports Network during the quarter.
Advertising revenue declined a modest 0.3%, as the positive contribution from NASCAR advertising and increased pricing from a strong scatter market were more than offset by ratings declines at some of our networks. The decline in operating cash flow reflects the inclusion of NASCAR rights fees in the quarter that weren't present in last year's fourth quarter.
Broadcast revenue increased 7%, and operating cash flow declined 5.6% to $217 million. Advertising revenue increased 7%, driven by solid ratings in prime time and strong ratings growth at NFL Sports and Telemundo, as well as a strong scatter market. This higher demand in the scatter market has continued into the first quarter. 
Content licensing increased 35%, primarily driven by straight to spot series produced by our studios, like Masters of None and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, as well as an increase in production at our international studio. 
Last, retransmission revenue increased nearly 40% to $136 million and totaled $535 million for the full year. We expect retransmission revenue to increase to $800 million in 2016. Total expenses increased 8%, driven by the launch of mid-season shows.
Film revenue increased 25.8%, and operating cash flow increased 84.6% to $143 million. Home entertainment revenue increased 75%, driven by the strong performances of Minions and Jurassic World, partially offset by a 37.5% decline in theatrical revenue and higher operating costs during the quarter. 
This was the most profitable year in Universal's history, with full year operating cash flow increasing 74% to $1.2 billion. While our 2016 slate is not as large and will be a difficult comparison to 2015, we are excited about our strategic slate of core franchises, sequels and animated films.
Theme Parks adjusted revenue increased 15.5% and operating cash flow increased 12.3%. Both our Orlando and Hollywood parks delivered higher attendance and healthy per capita spending growth, partially fueled by a record Halloween Horror Nights at both parks. Even more promising, despite having lapped the opening of Harry Potter Diagon Alley 2 quarters ago, Orlando continued to deliver healthy growth. In 2016, we look forward to the opening of Harry Potter in Hollywood and delivering on our plans to integrate Universal Studios Japan into our already strong Parks portfolio.
Now let's move to Slide 9 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. 
Consolidated capital expenditures increased 18.6% to $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter and 14.5% to $8.5 billion for the full year. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 10.2% to $2.1 billion for the fourth quarter and 14.3% to $7 billion for the year. This growth reflects higher spending on our customer premises equipment, including X1 and wireless gateways, increased investment in network infrastructure to increase network capacity, as well as the continued investment to expand Business Services. 
In 2016, we will continue to invest in each of these areas as they are driving positive results in our business. As a result, Cable CapEx as a percent of Cable revenue is expected to remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%. 
At NBCUniversal, fourth quarter CapEx increased 65.2% to $557 million and full year increased 13.5% to $1.4 billion. The increased investment at Theme Parks was the primary driver of the quarterly and yearly increases. And in the fourth quarter, we acquired land adjacent to one of our Theme Parks for $130 million.
In 2016, NBCUniversal's capital investment plan is expected to increase approximately 10%, reflecting the consolidation of Universal Studios Japan and continued investment in Theme Parks. The investments in our Theme Parks are clearly generating strong returns as they drive increased attendance and per capita spending.
I'll now finish on Slide 10 with capital returns.
In 2015, we returned $9.2 billion to shareholders, composed of $2.4 billion in dividends and $6.75 billion in share repurchases. As you can see on the left side of the slide, Comcast has a great track record of consistently returning capital to shareholders. The compound annual growth rate on our dividend from 2009 to 2015 was 24.4% versus 10% for the S&P 500.
Looking ahead, it is a high priority for us to continue this record of great total capital returns. This will be achieved by balancing 3 elements. First, the healthy annual return of capital to shareholders, which, for 2016, is an 8th consecutive annual increase in the dividend to do $1.10 per share, together with a plan to buy back $5 billion of stock over the course of the year. The second element to balance is investments in our business to profitably grow the long-term earnings capacity of the company. This includes a significant CapEx investment that I covered on the last slide. It also includes the deployment of capital to enhance our existing businesses through relatively modest business development efforts, such as the Vox and BuzzFeed digital investments and the Japan Park deal that we did in 2015. And lastly, it includes exploring contiguous growth opportunities as we were doing in a variety of ways, including through Michael Angelakis' new fund.
As we set our capital return plan for the year, we earmarked some capital for the whole basket of these types of situations, but we consider each situation on its own financial merits. And since I know it's on many of your minds, we will be filing to participate in the upcoming forward spectrum option, but I also want to be clear that the $5 billion in planned 2016 buybacks will not be reduced in the event that we acquire some spectrum in the auction.
The third and final element of our balanced capital plan is the very important maintenance of a strong balance sheet to protect the company in times of economic and market stress and position us to potentially capitalize on opportunities to create value in such times, such as we did with the NBCU transaction. As we begin what thus far had been a very volatile 2016, we are well positioned with our leverage at around 2x.

On the NFL, the #1 show on television is Sunday Night Football, and is a very, very important part of our business. Football is profitable for us now and will be profitable for us after the Thursday Night deal. And the ability to have these 24 football games, which will be 24 of the highest-rated nights of the year, is very, very valuable for a marketer that wants to reach a broad audience. In fact, getting more valuable all the time as the world continues to fragment. So we're very happy that we were selected, the NFL has put their faith in our team and our broadcast, and we're delighted about it. It's really the best programming, most powerful programming on television, and we got it at a very fair rate."

But in the interim, we have a whole variety of products that we have right now in the market to take advantage of set-top box data and other information, overlay it on top of our shows and existing ratings data, so that we can go to advertisers and say, we have more eyeballs than anybody else in America -- than any other company in America, and we can inform your purchases of those eyeballs, we think, as well are better than anyone else.

I thank all our colleagues who stand out in the industry because it's not just great subscriber numbers, but it's also strong financial, cash flow and growth. Doubling the cash flow at NBC since the acquisition is a real milestone that we're pleased with. And I think we're better together. And that both sides of the company are more informed. We have a collaborative culture, not only strengthening each other, but strengthening ourselves, and together, I think that makes Comcast NBCUniversal very unique. And as we thought about return of shareholder capital, we increased it 40% in 2015. We're reinvesting in the business, first and foremost, things like Japan and Fox and BuzzFeed. Our dividend has increased since 2009 on an almost 25% compounded growth rate, 10% for the S&P 500. So we think we continued to return capital, but we also want to use the growth that we've got to play offense with things like X1 and the kind of things we've been talking about in the call. And I think we're doing that well and mostly giving customers what they want and that cultural shift, which really, Neil, you started in the second half of the year, is paying dividends.

2015 was a terrific year for Comcast NBCUniversal. I couldn't be more pleased with the strong operational performance and financial results that we delivered both for the fourth quarter and for the full year. Honestly, 2015 was not without its challenges, but instead of letting those challenges become real distractions, our company pivoted and executed extremely well, particularly in the second half of the year. I am so proud of our resilience and leadership team for creating the momentum that is now driving us forward in 2016. Neil Smit and Dave Watson and everyone at Comcast Cable is heroic in my mind for not only staying focused, but generating the best yearly video subscriber results that we've had in 9 years and the best broadband subscriber results that we've had in 8 years. We ended on a high note, as our fourth quarter video net additions were our strongest quarterly results since the first quarter of 2007. At the same time, we expertly balanced these great customer metrics with solid financial performance.
At NBCUniversal, Steve and his team exceeded expectations once again. We set new box office records, achieved #1 ratings in broadcast from morning to prime time to late-night, continued the outstanding progress in our Theme Parks and sustained healthy profits at Cable Networks. Altogether, Comcast NBCUniversal made incredible strategic, operational and financial progress in 2015 and did this through a collaborative culture, where our businesses are focused on strengthening themselves and each other.
Overall, we grew revenue 8.3% in 2015 and operating cash flow by 7.7%. We generated close to $9 billion in free cash flow and increased cash returned to shareholders by over 40%. After reviewing our performance and outlook with our board, we are announcing today our decision to raise our dividend by 10%, marking the 8th consecutive annual increase. We've also increased our stock repurchase authorization to $10 billion, and we expect to repurchase $5 billion of stock in 2016. Comcast NBCUniversal is indeed a special company. This is a time of exciting change in media and technology, and we are uniquely positioned. We have a diversified portfolio of businesses working well together, and the best suite of products, content and experiences that we've ever had.
So with that, let me talk about some of our specific achievements in 2015 and a few of the things that we're looking forward to in 2016 and beyond. Starting with NBCUniversal, we've now fully doubled the operating cash flow since we announced the acquisition in 2009. In our TV business, we maintained our #1 ranking in broadcast primetime and saw a continued success in The Voice and Blacklist, paired nicely with some new breakout hits including Blindspot. In addition, we built on the strength of our Chicago franchise with our new show, Chicago Med. Sunday Night Football remained TV's #1 prime time show for the 5th year, grew viewership by 6% and completed the highest-rated season in its history. And as I mentioned, we exit 2015 with strength across all parts of the day, with the Today Show, Nightly News and Late Night, all #1 in their respective categories. NBC Sports Network had its most watched year ever, driven by NASCAR's debut and the continued growth of English Premier League and NHL. USA's Mr. Robot just won the Golden Globe and the Critics' Choice Award for the best drama on television, a terrific accomplishment. Congratulations to Bonnie Hammer and her team.
Film had the best year in its history. Jurassic World, Furious 7, Minions and Fifty Shades of Grey, along with other titles, were hugely successful. With $6 billion in worldwide box office receipts, 2/3 of which was international and a strong and growing list of franchises, Universal Pictures is in a great position for ongoing success. 
And finally, Theme Parks had another outstanding year. We again grew revenues and operating cash flow double-digits through our proven formula of new attractions, complemented by additional hotel room capacity. From Harry Potter to Transformers and Fast and Furious, our team at Universal Parks and Resorts has been on a fantastic run. And there's plenty of growth on the horizon with our recent acquisition of a 51% stake in the park in Osaka, Japan, a new Harry Potter attraction opening in Hollywood, a new water park being built in Orlando, a brand new park being designed for Beijing and our focus on increasing hotel room capacity.
At Cable, I feel we stand out in the industry, delivering a healthy balance between solid improvements in subscriber metrics, coupled with very strong financial performance. In 2015, we added 666,000 customer relationship, and that's an 86% improvement versus last year. And at the same time, we increased revenue per customer relationship a healthy 4.2% and grew operating cash flow 5.6%. In 2015, we made improving customer service our main focus. I'm really pleased that as we sit here today, we are seeing great progress. In fact, we achieved significant improvements across the key metrics we use to track customer satisfaction, with some of our best customer metrics in years. We are going after each of the areas that have the most impact on the customers' experience.
In 2015, we also continued to take our new products to scale. Our Voice Remote is the latest example, with 4 million activated since our launch just 8 months ago. The result of these investments are showing up in our subscriber trends, where we are seeing notable improvements, particularly in reduced churn across all product categories. Business Services under Bill Stemper has now exceeded a $5 billion revenue run rate, while maintaining a growth of 20%, which is remarkable. We recently launched into the Enterprise segment and have some good early traction in this market to go along with the robust share gains to small and medium-sized businesses. Overall, our progress during 2015 sets up incredibly well to be successful in 2016 and beyond.
In Cable, we are aligned around a few critical top priorities. The first is to continue our progress in transforming the customer experience. And as we've seen, our customers are responding to our efforts in a resounding way, and we will keep pushing hard. Second, we will focus on driving share growth through even better products, faster speeds and additional customer segmentation. And finally, technology leadership will remain at the forefront as we enhance excellence and drive it deeper into our customer base, roll out DOCSIS 3.1 to deliver gigabit speeds at scale and continue to develop solutions for more targeted advertising. 
At NBCUniversal, we feel great about our position and the range of opportunities ahead of us. We are proud to bring the 2016 Olympics in Rio to the American people, delivering the most comprehensive and technologically advanced Olympics in history. We are also excited to open a new Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood, add the Secret Life of Pets to Illumination's growing list of animated films, and this week's exciting announcement that NBC will now be the home to 5 Thursday night NFL games.
We continued to be entrepreneurial and look for ways to invest and grow. Like our investments in Vox and BuzzFeed and our partnership with [indiscernible] Michael Angelakis new venture, which recently launched with a talented team who are scouring the globe for smart investments. So on a final note, I am excited about all the opportunities that lie ahead and believe we will approach them with the same level of operational excellence and financial discipline that has served us so well for more than 5 decades.
Mike, over to you."
173341,319847264,925723,"Comcast Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody. Since Brian covered the terrific full year results, let's go straight to the fourth quarter on Slide 5. Adjusted revenue for the fourth quarter increased 7.6% and operating cash flow increased 4%. As a reminde",2236,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody. 
Since Brian covered the terrific full year results, let's go straight to the fourth quarter on Slide 5. Adjusted revenue for the fourth quarter increased 7.6% and operating cash flow increased 4%. As a reminder, the adjustments this quarter primarily reflect the exclusion of the partial quarter results of our acquisition of Universal Studios Japan. The overall growth in operating cash flow was primarily driven by high-speed data, video and business services at Cable and Film and Parks at NBCUniversal, which we'll go into in greater detail in the slides to come.
Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.81, a 5.2% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. And free cash flow during the quarter decreased 6.3% to $1.6 billion, and free cash flow per share of $0.64 declined 1.5%, reflecting growth in operating cash flow and lower cash taxes, offset by higher capital expenditures and increased working capital. For the full year, we generated $8.9 billion of free cash flow, a 9.4% increase over the last year's results, and free cash flow per share of $3.55, a 13.8% increase.
Now let's review the results of our businesses in more detail, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 6. Cable Communications delivered a solid fourth quarter. Revenues increased 5.9% to $12 billion, as we added 281,000 customer relationships, a 58% improvement compared to last year's fourth quarter, driven by growth in our 2 product and 3 product customers, and reduction in churn across all products, with video and high-speed data, each improving churn for 23 consecutive months. Total revenue per customer relationship reached $145 per month, a 3.5% increase that reflects the successful execution of our strategy that is focused on retaining customers, growing customer relationships and driving our value-added bundling strategy.
Taking a closer look at our video business. Fourth quarter revenue increased 4.4%, reflecting rate adjustments and higher take rates of advanced services. We ended the year with very strong video customer growth, adding 89,000 customers in the fourth quarter. This is our best quarterly result in 8 years, driven primarily by another quarter of improved churn. Our churn results reflect improved customer support, better market segmentation and customer recognition of what we believe is the best video product on the market. We continued to make great progress rolling out X1 to new and existing customers, adding 1.1 million customers in the quarter, a 73% increase compared to last year. X1 customers now represent about 30% of our total video customer base. In addition, we continued to expand our TV Everywhere and On Demand choices. We now have 75,000 shows On Demand, 700 full season Stack series, which is up 50% from a year ago, and 98 live streaming channels available outside the home. Lastly, we are doing a better job segmenting the market, providing offers with more choice and appeal to new audiences that address multiple segments of the market. For example, we have increased our penetration of Hispanic households with targeted bicultural products and offers.
The strong momentum in our high-speed data business continued. Revenue increased 9.8% during the quarter, making it again the leading contributor to overall Cable revenue growth, driven by an impressive increase in our customer base, as well as rate adjustments and an increasing number of customers taking higher-speed services. We added 460,000 data customers during the quarter and 1.4 million during the full year, with 77% of our customers receiving speeds of 50 megabits per second or greater. We have now added over 1 million high-speed data customers for 10 years in a row, and we see significant room for growth ahead. About 74% of our residential high-speed data customers now have one of our wireless gateways, which are also fueling our impressive growth in Wi-Fi hotspots that now number more than 13 million. Voice revenues declined by 1.7% in the fourth quarter, as customer additions were offset by a modest decline in ARPU. In the fourth quarter, we increased net customer additions by 139,000, a 13% increase versus a year ago. 
Business Services was once again a large contributor to Cable revenue growth, with revenue increasing 18.9% to $1.3 billion. We have 3 engines of growth in Business Services, each at a different stage of development. Small business, which has healthy market penetration and generates the majority of our revenue; midsized business, where our market penetration is still less than 10%, but is growing at a higher rate; and our recently announced Enterprise division that targets Fortune 1000 companies and is gaining traction, with more than 20 large enterprise customers and multiple 8-figure deals already signed. Business Services has strong positive momentum and continue to represent a large and attractive growth opportunity for the company. Finally, Cable advertising revenue declined 9.3% due to lower political revenue. Excluding political, our core Cable advertising revenue increased 2.8% during the fourth quarter.
Turning to Slide 7.  Fourth quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 4.6% to $4.9 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.9%, compared to 41.4% in the fourth quarter of 2014, driven by higher expenses, primarily related to the investments we are making to improve the customer experience and higher programming costs. Fourth quarter programming expense growth slowed to 4.7%, reflecting the timing of programming renewals, while the full year increased 7.1%. As I said at a recent conference, the rate of program expense growth will increase in 2016. We expect approximately 10% growth in programming costs for the year, driven by several contract renewals beginning in the first quarter, as well as increases in retransmission consent fees and higher sports programming costs.
In negotiating programming deals, we continue to value expanded content rights for our On Demand and TV Everywhere platforms. We are adding more content, out of home rights, stacking rights and back seasons, ensuring we have the most compelling and competitive video product on the market. Non-programming expenses increased 8.1% for the quarter and 6.4% for the year. This growth reflects increased spending to improve the customer experience, as we've added technicians and service personnel, strengthened our dispatch teams and operations, and invested in training tools and technology. Metrics including on-time appointments, call pickup time and new customer onboarding success rates are all trending in the right direction.
Finally, our outlook for 2016 Cable operating margin is that it will be flat to down 50 basis points compared to 40.8% in 2015. We expect programming and other expense growth will be offset through modest rate adjustments, growth in high-margin businesses like high-speed data and business services, and cost efficiency improvements resulting from our X1 and customer experience initiatives, as well as general cost control efforts.
Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results.  On Slide 8, you can see NBCUniversal delivered solid results in the fourth quarter, as adjusted revenue increased 10.5% and operating cash flow increased 4.7%, driven by strong results at Film and Theme Parks.  Cable Networks revenue increased 3.4%, and operating cash flow declined 1.9% to $894 million. Distribution revenue increased 6.8% and was positively impacted by higher affiliate fees associated with NASCAR on our NBC Sports Network during the quarter. Advertising revenue declined a modest 0.3%, as the positive contribution from NASCAR advertising and increased pricing from a strong scatter market were more than offset by ratings declines at some of our networks. The decline in operating cash flow reflects the inclusion of NASCAR rights fees in the quarter that weren't present in last year's fourth quarter.
Broadcast revenue increased 7%, and operating cash flow declined 5.6% to $217 million. Advertising revenue increased 7%, driven by solid ratings in prime time and strong ratings growth at NFL Sports and Telemundo, as well as a strong scatter market. This higher demand in the scatter market has continued into the first quarter.  Content licensing increased 35%, primarily driven by straight to [indiscernible] series produced by our studios, like Masters of None (sic) [Master of None] and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, as well as an increase in production at our international studio.  Last, retransmission revenue increased nearly 40% to $136 million and totaled $535 million for the full year. We expect retransmission revenue to increase to $800 million in 2016. Total expenses increased 8%, driven by the launch of mid-season shows.
Film revenue increased 25.8%, and operating cash flow increased 84.6% to $143 million. Home entertainment revenue increased 75%, driven by the strong performances of Minions and Jurassic World, partially offset by a 37.5% decline in theatrical revenue and higher operating costs during the quarter.  This was the most profitable year in Universal's history, with full year operating cash flow increasing 74% to $1.2 billion. While our 2016 slate is not as large and will be a difficult comparison to 2015, we are excited about our strategic slate of core franchises, sequels and animated films.
Theme Parks adjusted revenue increased 15.5% and operating cash flow increased 12.3%. Both our Orlando and Hollywood parks delivered higher attendance and healthy per capita spending growth, partially fueled by a record Halloween Horror Nights at both parks. Even more promising, despite having lapped the opening of Harry Potter Diagon Alley 2 quarters ago, Orlando continued to deliver healthy growth. In 2016, we look forward to the opening of Harry Potter in Hollywood and delivering on our plans to integrate Universal Studios Japan into our already strong Parks portfolio.
Now let's move to Slide 9 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures.  Consolidated capital expenditures increased 18.6% to $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter and 14.5% to $8.5 billion for the full year. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 10.2% to $2.1 billion for the fourth quarter and 14.3% to $7 billion for the year. This growth reflects higher spending on our customer premises equipment, including X1 and wireless gateways, increased investment in network infrastructure to increase network capacity, as well as the continued investment to expand Business Services.  In 2016, we will continue to invest in each of these areas as they are driving positive results in our business. As a result, Cable CapEx as a percent of Cable revenue is expected to remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%. 
At NBCUniversal, fourth quarter CapEx increased 65.2% to $557 million and full year increased 13.5% to $1.4 billion. The increased investment at Theme Parks was the primary driver of the quarterly and yearly increases. And in the fourth quarter, we acquired land adjacent to one of our Theme Parks for $130 million. In 2016, NBCUniversal's capital investment plan is expected to increase approximately 10%, reflecting the consolidation of Universal Studios Japan and continued investment in Theme Parks. The investments in our Theme Parks are clearly generating strong returns as they drive increased attendance and per capita spending.
I'll now finish on Slide 10 with capital returns. In 2015, we returned $9.2 billion to shareholders, composed of $2.4 billion in dividends and $6.75 billion in share repurchases. As you can see on the left side of the slide, Comcast has a great track record of consistently returning capital to shareholders. The compound annual growth rate on our dividend from 2009 to 2015 was 24.4% versus 10% for the S&P 500.
Looking ahead, it is a high priority for us to continue this record of great total capital returns. This will be achieved by balancing 3 elements. First, the healthy annual return of capital to shareholders, which, for 2016, is an 8th consecutive annual increase in the dividend to do $1.10 per share, together with a plan to buy back $5 billion of stock over the course of the year. The second element to balance is investments in our business to profitably grow the long-term earnings capacity of the company. This includes a significant CapEx investment that I covered on the last slide. It also includes the deployment of capital to enhance our existing businesses through relatively modest business development efforts, such as the Vox and BuzzFeed digital investments and the Japan Park deal that we did in 2015. And lastly, it includes exploring contiguous growth opportunities as we were doing in a variety of ways, including through Michael Angelakis' new fund.
As we set our capital return plan for the year, we earmarked some capital for the whole basket of these types of situations, but we consider each situation on its own financial merits. And since I know it's on many of your minds, we will be filing to participate in the upcoming forward spectrum auction, but I also want to be clear that the $5 billion in planned 2016 buybacks will not be reduced in the event that we acquire some spectrum in the auction.
The third and final element of our balanced capital plan is the very important maintenance of a strong balance sheet to protect the company in times of economic and market stress and position us to potentially capitalize on opportunities to create value in such times, such as we did with the NBCU transaction. As we begin what thus far had been a very volatile 2016, we are well positioned with our leverage at around 2x.
With that, I'm done with the slides. I hope everyone has a good sense for how pleased we are with the fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, as well as our momentum as we head into 2016. 
Now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A."

It's always amazing to us, sometimes almost humorous, but none of this is ever humorous, where we read about ourselves in every possible M&A scenario that gets invented. And in many cases, it's literally that, just invented. And we're always trying to remain focused on some core principles. First of all, really like the company we have right now, and I think we've said that consistently and nothing has changed in our view of anything. I think we feel better about our mix of assets, NBCUniversal doubling the cash flow in the 5 years since we bought it. I think we bought it right, but we've operated it even better. And so I sit there and look at those scenarios and many others that have been suggested, and there's nothing we feel we have to do. At the same time, Mike Cavanagh and the team that he's building are always looking to see if there's way we can grow shareholder value and look for new opportunities as the markets evolve. But sitting here today, our plan of record in 2016 is to execute on a business plan, stay focused, and I don't feel the need that we need to go and change the face of our company.

The first is, does your expanded rights package in some of these new agreements allow you more flexibility to put together different channel programs, meaning, you're paying a bit more?

And then in general, how close are you to kind of getting the expanded rights across all of your programming agreements?

Our dividend has increased since 2009 on an almost 25% compounded growth rate, 10% for the S&P 500. So we think we continue to return capital, but we also want to use the growth that we've got to play offense with things like X1 and the kind of things we've been talking about in the call.

We're off to a great start in 2016. We increased revenue and operating cash flow in the first quarter while continuing to prudently invest in the businesses to further strengthen our competitive position and drive growth. 
I believe our Cable business is really differentiating itself, offering real innovation that is translating into the strong momentum you see in these results. We're demonstrating notable improvements in customer Service, investing to put the industry's fastest Wi-Fi in homes and to be the first to bring customers widespread access to gigabit speeds through DOCSIS 3.1 technology; and with X1, delivering a platform and a breadth of content that's unrivaled. As this quarter once again shows, our customers are responding to all of this. We increased our customer relationship growth by 36% from the first quarter of 2015 and now have achieved 50% penetration of our homes passed. We added 53,000 video customers in the quarter, making us video net add positive over the past 12 months. This important milestone has eluded us for nearly a decade, and we have now accomplished it within the context of an unprecedented pace of change in this industry, including the steady drumbeat of new competitors and new offers. 
Our voice remotes are the latest example of how we are differentiating ourselves in the market. In the short period of time, we deployed 6 million of these new remotes. Thanks to Tony Warner and his technology team's great customer experience, we're getting wonderful feedback from our customers already. We added another 438,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, the best first quarter we've had in 4 years. Much like our improvement in video, the progress we are making is largely a result of improvements in churn. We're upping speeds, delivering best-in-class Wi-Fi access and investing in more ways to add value to our customers. As a result, they're staying with us longer. 
Business Services delivered another excellent quarter with revenue growth of nearly 18%. This growth comes with very attractive margins for us, as you know. We continue to take share in small business and bring new competition and choice for midsized businesses as well as enterprise customers. Just as important as our strong service and subscriber metrics, Neil and the team are demonstrating terrific balance, driving revenue per customer relationship forward at a healthy clip, along with solid operating cash flow growth. 
Over at NBCUniversal, Steve and his team delivered another strong quarter. Operating cash flow increased by 10%, benefiting from particularly strong performance in Broadcast and our recent acquisition of Universal Studios Japan. Our GB business has performed well and have had some good momentum. The advertising environment remains robust, which we believe sets up Linda and her team for a strong upfront. This year, we are unifying the upfront for NBC Broadcast Telemundo and Cable Networks, reflecting the way we go to market as a strong and comprehensive portfolio. We feel great about our position, which will be strengthened as we now add Thursday Night Football to go along with an already strong list of sports properties. 
Speaking of strong sports properties, we recently surpassed $1 billion in national advertising sales for the real Olympics, achieving this milestone far earlier than the London Olympics. This is a very promising result, which reinforces our view of the attractiveness of this event. 
Meanwhile, MSNBC continues its impressive performance with its best ratings in 3 years in prime time up over 100%. Andy and the news team are doing a wonderful job with the news organization, particularly through the early stages of this election cycle. 
In our Theme Parks, we're delighted about our trajectory, the momentum that we've created and our road map with new investments and new attractions and additional hotel room capacity. Universal Studios Japan set attendance records in the just ended fiscal year and performed well in our first full quarter of ownership. Additionally, we just launched Harry Potter at Universal Hollywood, and we expected to follow the strong success we've seen with our other Potter attractions. 
We've got a unique and wonderful set of assets, which provides Comcast NBCUniversal with many opportunities. All of this will be on display this summer when we put the full wave of the company behind the Olympics. I'm amazed of what we've accomplished in a short period of time as a combined company just 5 years in, and I think we're not only 5 years wiser and stronger, but really better together. We're confident we remain on the right path to creating value for our customers and shareholders, and I couldn't be more excited about our future. 
Mike, over to you."

At Cable, the primary drivers o",1784,"Good morning, everybody. Let's go right to the first quarter on Slide 4 and cover the key financials. 
Overall, we delivered consolidated revenue growth of 5.3% and operating cash flow growth of 6.9% for the first quarter. At Cable, the primary drivers of growth were High-Speed Data, Video and Business Services, while NBCUniversal's results were driven by Broadcast, Cable Networks and Theme Parks, which was positively impacted by the inclusion of Universal Studios Japan. 
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.84 a share, a 6.3% increase compared to a year ago. Free cash flow was $2.8 billion in the first quarter, a decline of 11.9% while free cash flow per share declined 8.8% to $1.14. We'll go into greater detail on these results on slides to come. Now let's review the results of our businesses in more detail starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. 
Cable Communications delivered a solid first quarter. Revenue increased 6.7% to $12.2 billion dollars as we increased customer relationships and grew total revenue per customer relationship by 4% to $146 per month. We added 269,000 customer relationships, a 36% improvement in net adds compared to last year's first quarter, driven by growth in 2-product and 3-product customers and a reduction in churn across all products. In fact, Video and High-Speed Data have each improved churn for 26 consecutive months. 
High-Speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall Cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 7.6% to $3.3 billion in the quarter, reflecting strong customer growth, customers subscribing to higher levels of service and more modest rate adjustments compared to the prior year. Customer growth was strong as we added a combined 438,000 net data customers in the quarter, which includes residential and business customers. We continue to differentiate and improve our product by increasing our speeds on existing tiers as well as offering the fastest in-home Wi-Fi with our Advance Wireless Gateways. At the end of the quarter, 77% of our residential customers received speeds of 50 megabits per second or greater and have one of our Wireless Gateways, both up significantly from the prior year. 
Video revenue remained healthy, increasing 3.9% to $5.5 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services, including premium channels, HD DVRs and additional outlets. We added a combined 53,000 net video customers, our best first quarter result in 9 years, driven primarily by another quarter of improved churn. 
We continue to make great progress rolling out X1 to new and existing customers, adding 1.1 million customers in the quarter, a 53% increase in net adds compared to last year. Nearly 35% of our total video customers have X1, which we believe is a real competitive differentiator. Coupled with the X1 technology is the breadth of content we offer customers both on-demand and with the compelling TV Everywhere offering. On X1, 86% of subscribers are using XFINITY on-demand monthly, viewing 25 hours a month on average. And 42% of subscribers are using our mobile TV Everywhere platforms monthly, up 32% from last year, viewing 7 hours a month on average. We think this adds great utility to our video service. 
Rounding up our residential products. Voice revenue declined by 1.1% to $896 million in the first quarter as customer additions were offset by a modest decline in ARPU. In the first quarter, we added a combined 102,000 net Voice customers, up 33% versus a year ago. 
Now let's turn to Business Services, which continues to deliver excellent results. Revenue increased 17.5% to $1.3 billion with the small business segment accounting for about 75% of our revenues and 60% of our growth. Revenue for the mid-sized business segment is growing at a faster rate than in small business segment, increasing its contribution as a percentage of total business revenue. Overall, Business Services has strong positive momentum and continues to represent a large and attractive growth opportunity for the company. 
Finally, Cable Advertising revenue increased 12.1% to $559 million. Excluding political revenue, our Cable Advertising revenue increased 7.6% in the first quarter. 
Turning to Slide 6. First quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 5% to $4.9 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.1% compared to 40.7% in the first quarter of 2015, driven by higher expenses, primarily related to increase in programming cost and the investments we are making to improve the customer experience. 
Programming expenses grew 9.4%, reflecting programming contract renewals as well as higher retrans and consent fees and sports programming costs. As we've noted before, when we negotiate programming deals, we continue to value expanded content rights for our on-demand and TV Everywhere platforms. We continue to add more content out-of-home rights, backing rights and back seasons, which helps ensure we have the most compelling and competitive video product on the market. 
Nonprogramming expenses increased 6.9%, reflecting our planned investment to improve the customer experience and to continue the rollout of X1. We've added technicians and service personnel, strengthened our dispatch teams and operations and invested in training, tools and technology. As a result, technical and product support cost grew 6.3%, and customer service expenses increased 8%. We continue to expect our 2016 Cable operating margin to be flat to down 50 basis points compared to 40.6% in 2015 as programming and other expense growth should be offset by modest rate adjustments, growth in high-margin businesses like High-Speed Data and Business Services and continued overall cost discipline. Keep in mind, for the second quarter, we faced tough comparisons to last year's usually successful Pacquiao versus Mayweather on Pay-Per-View. However, growth in high-margin Political Advertising revenue should provide more significant support for margin in the back half of the year. 
Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. On Slide 7, you can see NBCUniversal delivered solid results in the first quarter as revenue increased 3.9% and operating cash flow increased 10%. Adjusting to included the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan in last year's results, pro forma revenue was relatively flat, and operating cash flow increased 1.8%, more than offsetting the difficult comparison to a profitable Super Bowl and our strong Film results last year. This quarter's growth was driven by strong TV results fueled by higher retransmission and affiliate revenues and the underlying strength of the advertising market. 
Cable Networks revenue increased 4%, and operating cash flow increased 6.4% to $956 million, reflecting higher distribution revenue; strong ad revenue, given the best advertising market we've seen in some time; and a modest increase in programming and production costs. Distribution revenue increased 5.9%, driven by contractual rate increases and contract renewals, partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers at our Cable Networks. 
Advertising revenue was flat compared to the first quarter of 2015, which included a benefit from a reduction in deferred Advertising revenue. If we exclude this benefit, Advertising growth would have been about 4%, driven by strong pricing, partially offset by audience rating declines at our cable networks. 
At Broadcast Television, while revenue declined 7.3%, we delivered outstanding operating cash flow growth of 56.5% even with the profitable Super Bowl included in last year's results. This growth was driven by a few factors. First, the underlying strength of the advertising market. Excluding the Super Bowl, Advertising revenue increased 9.6%, reflecting strong scatter pricing as well as one additional NFL game compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the extra NFL game, Advertising growth was still up high single digits. Second, strong retransmission revenue growth was driven by recent step-ups. And last, Programming and production costs were lower compared to last year, which included not only the Super Bowl but also more expensive prime time programming due to series finales. 
Film revenue declined 4.3%, and operating cash flow declined 43.1% to $167 million, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year's strong Film performance. Most notably, theatrical revenue declined 36.4% compared to last year's first quarter, which included the very successful Fifty Shades of Grey. In addition, home entertainment revenue declined 24.4% due to the strong performance of several releases last year, including Lucy. Partially offsetting this lower revenue was higher content licensing revenue and strong consumer products growth due to the Minions and Jurassic franchises. 
Theme Parks revenue increased 57.5% to $1 billion, and operating cash flow increased 53.6% to $375 million in the first quarter of 2016. On a pro forma basis, revenue increased 9.6%, and operating cash flow increased 3.3%. These results reflect the timing of spring break this year, cable guest attendance and higher per capita spending, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, including free opening cost to support Harry Potter in Hollywood and the Flying Dinosaur in Japan. 
Now let's move to Slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures increased 9.2% to $1.9 billion in the first quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 9% to $1.6 billion [ph] for the quarter, equal to 12.9% of Cable revenue versus 12.6% in the first quarter of 2015. The increase reflects a higher level of investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity and an increased investment in line extensions as well as higher spending on customer premise equipment related to the deployment of the X1 platform and Wireless Gateways. Also included in each of these growth rates is the continued expansion of Business Services. In 2016, we will continue to invest in each of these areas as they are driving positive results in our business. For the full year, we continue to expect capital intensity to remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%. 
At NBCUniversal, first quarter capital expenditures increased 10% to $295 million, driven by the inclusion of the Universal Studios Japan. We continue to expect NBCUniversal's CapEx to increase approximately 10% this year. 
I'll now finish up on Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, consolidated free cash flow declined 11.9% to $2.8 billion [ph] in the first quarter, reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow, offset by increased working capital as well as higher capital expenditures and cash paid for capitalized software and other intangible assets. We are successfully executing our plans for returning capital to shareholders, including dividend payments during the quarter, totaling $611 million, up 6.9% and share repurchases of $1.25 billion in the quarter, which are tracking to our of $5 billion annual target. We ended the quarter right at 2x net leverage, in line with our stated target. 
That concludes our summary of the quarter. I hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our results as well as our momentum. 
Now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A."

Is there anything you're thinking about to drive connects up as you think about segment into the market and maybe you guys aren't doing today? And then Mike, on the nonprogramming cost growth which you called out at 7%, is that the kind of investment you need to sustain this top line?

The customer experience, we've spent a lot of time on, and I think that's helping churn. X1 is helping churn. And I think, also, we've developed new sales channels like Amazon, we announced earlier this quarter. So I think it's a combination of driving connects and reducing churn.

I also think that putting the 2 together, we feel we're better together. I said that in the upfront remarks. Almost every Senior Executive company sees a benefit from some other part of the company in their part of the company. That is part of symphony. When I think about the Olympics, I just touched on briefly in my opening remarks, you will see XFINITY's [indiscernible] television on the X1 experience, which ever been presented to a consumer for live sporting event. And NBC coverage itself will be unprecedented if you just go back a few years to see how much this landscape has changed. And the companies that are leaning in toward that are well positioned. I can't think of a better company than ourselves. As to the relative value, these things evolve and go up and down and relationship between the 2 in terms of tariff disputes and other things. They're both great businesses, and that was our fundamental premise all along. I think I first learned that being on Ted Turner's board when Comcast was really a cable company. It's a worldwide business. It grows all in different ways, but they're in the same sort of system where together the value tends to had in the same direction. And at any one time, one part of the ecosystem could be doing better than the other part of the ecosystem. But in the end, we're bringing great expenses to consumers in either content, in innovative distribution technologies, and that's how we're running our company. I hope that's a response to your question."

We've spent a lot of time and have discussed on previous calls, trying to get going on building a theme park in Beijing, and that's going according to plan. So China represents a big, big opportunity for the company. It already is a significant profit generator. Fast and Furious, for example, we did over $400 million in China. But as that market grows, I think it's very important that we be there, and I think you're doing all the things that you would expect us to do and have a lot of big movies coming out in China in the next year and want to make sure that we're doing everything we can to grow that market as aggressively as possible."

A year ago, a lot of advertisers pulled back and didn't spend as much in the upfront. I think part of the thinking was we can always spend later and there's plenty of places to spend their money on digital. I think the emotion of the market has swung pretty dramatically over the last year. I think people are -- have come to the realization that broad television reach is really important in a campaign that digital has a place, but television has a big place. And a lot of people I think -- we did not come out to the upfront market this year and significantly more in what has been one of the strongest scatter markets I've ever seen. So in terms of market dynamics, we're going into the upfront season. I think with a lot of wind in our back, my prediction is that it's going to be a strong upfront. We think we're in the pole position for that strong upfront. We represent about 20% of the eyeballs in television if you add up broadcast and cable. NBC is on its way to its third annual 18 to 49 victory where we're doing very well in sports and news at NBCU. And then our cable channels are strong. I'm glad you pointed out Telemundo. Telemundo used to be a weak second. We're beating Univision most nights at 10:00 and have closed to the gap with Univision. And I think in an number of our channels, we're still underpriced relative to people that were feeding or close to or at least competitive to. So I think we're going in the upfront in a very strong position. As you said, we sell all of our channels and all of our digital properties together under the unified direction of Lindy our head of sales, which is an advantage for advertisers. But also, given our position, we tend to talk to people first, and that's exactly where we want to be. And I think we're going into this upfront with a better upfront, a better more unified approach and more strength than we've ever had, and we'll see how it all plays out."

I put in NBC obviously right at the top of that list. Retransmission consent has been a tremendous benefit to our Broadcast business, both retransmission we get from our own stations and the share we get from our affiliates. If you have those 2 numbers together, that was a number around 0, 5 years ago, and it's a number around $800 million today, something like that. And also, on the Advertising side, I think particularly that the live events, if you've got the Olympics coming up for 17 days, our ratings will be higher than all 3 all -- if you add the other 3 broadcasters together, it will be a multiple of anyone else's ratings for 17 days. Imagine how valuable that is to someone who's trying to build a brand or introduce a new car, do something major in terms of changing the opinion of people in America. So broad case, it's interesting. I would not have predicted this 10 or 20 years ago, but it feels like Broadcast is getting stronger and stronger in this period. We have to keep putting shows on, and it's tougher and tougher in a fragmented world to get a rating. But when you do, you get rewarded for it significantly."

We're off to a great start in 2016. We increased revenue and operating cash flow in the first quarter while continuing to prudently invest in the businesses to further strengthen our competitive position and drive growth. 
I believe our Cable business is really differentiating itself, offering real innovation that is translating into the strong momentum you see in these results. We're demonstrating notable improvements in customer Service, investing to put the industry's fastest Wi-Fi in homes and to be the first to bring customers widespread access to gigabit speeds through DOCSIS 3.1 technology; and with X1, delivering a platform and a breadth of content that's unrivaled. As this quarter once again shows, our customers are responding to all of this. We increased our customer relationship growth by 36% from the first quarter of 2015 and now have achieved 50% penetration of our homes passed. We added 53,000 video customers in the quarter, making us video net add positive over the past 12 months. This important milestone has eluded us for nearly a decade, and we have now accomplished it within the context of an unprecedented pace of change in this industry, including the steady drumbeat of new competitors and new offers. 
Our voice remotes are the latest example of how we are differentiating ourselves in the market. In the short period of time, we deployed 6 million of these new remotes. Thanks to Tony Warner and his technology team's great customer experience, we're getting wonderful feedback from our customers already. We added another 438,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, the best first quarter we've had in 4 years. Much like our improvement in video, the progress we are making is largely a result of improvements in churn. We're upping speeds, delivering best-in-class Wi-Fi access and investing in more ways to add value to our customers. As a result, they're staying with us longer. 
Business Services delivered another excellent quarter with revenue growth of nearly 18%. This growth comes with very attractive margins for us, as you know. We continue to take share in small business and bring new competition and choice for midsized businesses as well as enterprise customers. Just as important as our strong service and subscriber metrics, Neil and the team are demonstrating terrific balance, driving revenue per customer relationship forward at a healthy clip, along with solid operating cash flow growth. 
Over at NBCUniversal, Steve and his team delivered another strong quarter. Operating cash flow increased by 10%, benefiting from particularly strong performance in Broadcast and our recent acquisition of Universal Studios Japan. Our GB business has performed well and have had some good momentum. The advertising environment remains robust, which we believe sets up Linda and her team for a strong upfront. This year, we are unifying the upfront for NBC Broadcast Telemundo and Cable Networks, reflecting the way we go to market as a strong and comprehensive portfolio. We feel great about our position, which will be strengthened as we now add Thursday Night Football to go along with an already strong list of sports properties. 
Speaking of strong sports properties, we recently surpassed $1 billion in national advertising sales for the real Olympics, achieving this milestone far earlier than the London Olympics. This is a very promising result, which reinforces our view of the attractiveness of this event. 
Meanwhile, MSNBC continues its impressive performance with its best ratings in 3 years in prime time up over 100%. Andy and the news team are doing a wonderful job with the news organization, particularly through the early stages of this election cycle. 
In our Theme Parks, we're delighted about our trajectory, the momentum that we've created and our road map with new investments and new attractions and additional hotel room capacity. Universal Studios Japan set attendance records in the just ended fiscal year and performed well in our first full quarter of ownership. Additionally, we just launched Harry Potter at Universal Hollywood, and we expected to follow the strong success we've seen with our other Potter attractions. 
We've got a unique and wonderful set of assets, which provides Comcast NBCUniversal with many opportunities. All of this will be on display this summer when we put the full wave of the company behind the Olympics. I'm amazed of what we've accomplished in a short period of time as a combined company just 5 years in, and I think we're not only 5 years wiser and stronger, but really better together. We're confident we remain on the right path to creating value for our customers and shareholders, and I couldn't be more excited about our future. 
Mike, over to you."

Overall, we delivered consolidated revenue growth of 5.3% and operating cash flow growth of 6.9% for the first quarter. At Cable, the primary drivers of growth were High-Speed Data, Video and Business Services, while NBCUniversal's results were driven by Broadcast, Cable Networks and Theme Parks, which was positively impacted by the inclusion of Universal Studios Japan. 
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.84 a share, a 6.3% increase compared to a year ago. Free cash flow was $2.8 billion in the first quarter, a decline of 11.9% while free cash flow per share declined 8.8% to $1.14. We'll go into greater detail on these results on slides to come. Now let's review the results of our businesses in more detail starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. 
Cable Communications delivered a solid first quarter. Revenue increased 6.7% to $12.2 billion dollars as we increased customer relationships and grew total revenue per customer relationship by 4% to $146 per month. We added 269,000 customer relationships, a 36% improvement in net adds compared to last year's first quarter, driven by growth in 2-product and 3-product customers and a reduction in churn across all products. In fact, Video and High-Speed Data have each improved churn for 26 consecutive months. 
High-Speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall Cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 7.6% to $3.3 billion in the quarter, reflecting strong customer growth, customers subscribing to higher levels of service and more modest rate adjustments compared to the prior year. Customer growth was strong as we added a combined 438,000 net data customers in the quarter, which includes residential and business customers. We continue to differentiate and improve our product by increasing our speeds on existing tiers as well as offering the fastest in-home Wi-Fi with our Advance Wireless Gateways. At the end of the quarter, 77% of our residential customers received speeds of 50 megabits per second or greater and have one of our Wireless Gateways, both up significantly from the prior year. 
Video revenue remained healthy, increasing 3.9% to $5.5 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services, including premium channels, HD DVRs and additional outlets. We added a combined 53,000 net video customers, our best first quarter result in 9 years, driven primarily by another quarter of improved churn. 
We continue to make great progress rolling out X1 to new and existing customers, adding 1.1 million customers in the quarter, a 53% increase in net adds compared to last year. Nearly 35% of our total video customers have X1, which we believe is a real competitive differentiator. Coupled with the X1 technology is the breadth of content we offer customers both on-demand and with the compelling TV Everywhere offering. On X1, 86% of subscribers are using XFINITY on-demand monthly, viewing 25 hours a month on average. And 42% of subscribers are using our mobile TV Everywhere platforms monthly, up 32% from last year, viewing 7 hours a month on average. We think this adds great utility to our video service. 
Rounding up our residential products. Voice revenue declined by 1.1% to $896 million in the first quarter as customer additions were offset by a modest decline in ARPU. In the first quarter, we added a combined 102,000 net Voice customers, up 33% versus a year ago. 
Now let's turn to Business Services, which continues to deliver excellent results. Revenue increased 17.5% to $1.3 billion with the small business segment accounting for about 75% of our revenues and 60% of our growth. Revenue for the mid-sized business segment is growing at a faster rate than in small business segment, increasing its contribution as a percentage of total business revenue. Overall, Business Services has strong positive momentum and continues to represent a large and attractive growth opportunity for the company. 
Finally, Cable Advertising revenue increased 12.1% to $559 million. Excluding political revenue, our Cable Advertising revenue increased 7.6% in the first quarter. 
Turning to Slide 6. First quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 5% to $4.9 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.1% compared to 40.7% in the first quarter of 2015, driven by higher expenses, primarily related to increase in programming cost and the investments we are making to improve the customer experience. 
Programming expenses grew 9.4%, reflecting programming contract renewals as well as higher retrans and consent fees and sports programming costs. As we've noted before, when we negotiate programming deals, we continue to value expanded content rights for our on-demand and TV Everywhere platforms. We continue to add more content out-of-home rights, backing rights and back seasons, which helps ensure we have the most compelling and competitive video product on the market. 
Nonprogramming expenses increased 6.9%, reflecting our planned investment to improve the customer experience and to continue the rollout of X1. We've added technicians and service personnel, strengthened our dispatch teams and operations and invested in training, tools and technology. As a result, technical and product support cost grew 6.3%, and customer service expenses increased 8%. We continue to expect our 2016 Cable operating margin to be flat to down 50 basis points compared to 40.6% in 2015 as programming and other expense growth should be offset by modest rate adjustments, growth in high-margin businesses like High-Speed Data and Business Services and continued overall cost discipline. Keep in mind, for the second quarter, we faced tough comparisons to last year's usually successful Pacquiao versus Mayweather on Pay-Per-View. However, growth in high-margin Political Advertising revenue should provide more significant support for margin in the back half of the year. 
Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. On Slide 7, you can see NBCUniversal delivered solid results in the first quarter as revenue increased 3.9% and operating cash flow increased 10%. Adjusting to included the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan in last year's results, pro forma revenue was relatively flat, and operating cash flow increased 1.8%, more than offsetting the difficult comparison to a profitable Super Bowl and our strong Film results last year. This quarter's growth was driven by strong TV results fueled by higher retransmission and affiliate revenues and the underlying strength of the advertising market. 
Cable Networks revenue increased 4%, and operating cash flow increased 6.4% to $956 million, reflecting higher distribution revenue; strong ad revenue, given the best advertising market we've seen in some time; and a modest increase in programming and production costs. Distribution revenue increased 5.9%, driven by contractual rate increases and contract renewals, partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers at our Cable Networks. 
Advertising revenue was flat compared to the first quarter of 2015, which included a benefit from a reduction in deferred Advertising revenue. If we exclude this benefit, Advertising growth would have been about 4%, driven by strong pricing, partially offset by audience rating declines at our cable networks. 
At Broadcast Television, while revenue declined 7.3%, we delivered outstanding operating cash flow growth of 56.5% even with the profitable Super Bowl included in last year's results. This growth was driven by a few factors. First, the underlying strength of the advertising market. Excluding the Super Bowl, Advertising revenue increased 9.6%, reflecting strong scatter pricing as well as one additional NFL game compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the extra NFL game, Advertising growth was still up high single digits. Second, strong retransmission revenue growth was driven by recent step-ups. And last, Programming and production costs were lower compared to last year, which included not only the Super Bowl but also more expensive prime time programming due to series finales. 
Film revenue declined 4.3%, and operating cash flow declined 43.1% to $167 million, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year's strong Film performance. Most notably, theatrical revenue declined 36.4% compared to last year's first quarter, which included the very successful Fifty Shades of Grey. In addition, home entertainment revenue declined 24.4% due to the strong performance of several releases last year, including Lucy. Partially offsetting this lower revenue was higher content licensing revenue and strong consumer products growth due to the Minions and Jurassic franchises. 
Theme Parks revenue increased 57.5% to $1 billion, and operating cash flow increased 53.6% to $375 million in the first quarter of 2016. On a pro forma basis, revenue increased 9.6%, and operating cash flow increased 3.3%. These results reflect the timing of spring break this year, cable guest attendance and higher per capita spending, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, including free opening cost to support Harry Potter in Hollywood and the Flying Dinosaur in Japan. 
Now let's move to Slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures increased 9.2% to $1.9 billion in the first quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 9% to $1.6 billion [ph] for the quarter, equal to 12.9% of Cable revenue versus 12.6% in the first quarter of 2015. The increase reflects a higher level of investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity and an increased investment in line extensions as well as higher spending on customer premise equipment related to the deployment of the X1 platform and Wireless Gateways. Also included in each of these growth rates is the continued expansion of Business Services. In 2016, we will continue to invest in each of these areas as they are driving positive results in our business. For the full year, we continue to expect capital intensity to remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%. 
At NBCUniversal, first quarter capital expenditures increased 10% to $295 million, driven by the inclusion of the Universal Studios Japan. We continue to expect NBCUniversal's CapEx to increase approximately 10% this year. 
I'll now finish up on Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, consolidated free cash flow declined 11.9% to $2.8 billion [ph] in the first quarter, reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow, offset by increased working capital as well as higher capital expenditures and cash paid for capitalized software and other intangible assets. We are successfully executing our plans for returning capital to shareholders, including dividend payments during the quarter, totaling $611 million, up 6.9% and share repurchases of $1.25 billion in the quarter, which are tracking to our of $5 billion annual target. We ended the quarter right at 2x net leverage, in line with our stated target. 
That concludes our summary of the quarter. I hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our results as well as our momentum. 
Now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A."

The customer experience, we've spent a lot of time on, and I think that's helping churn. X1 is helping churn.

I also think that putting the 2 together, we feel we're better together. I said that in the upfront remarks. Almost every Senior Executive company sees a benefit from some other part of the company in their part of the company. That is part of symphony. When I think about the Olympics, I just touched on briefly in my opening remarks, you will see XFINITY's [indiscernible] television on the X1 experience, which ever been presented to a consumer for live sporting event. And NBC coverage itself will be unprecedented if you just go back a few years to see how much this landscape has changed. And the companies that are leaning in toward that are well positioned. I can't think of a better company than ourselves. As to the relative value, these things evolve and go up and down and relationship between the 2 in terms of tariff disputes and other things. They're both great businesses, and that was our fundamental premise all along. I think I first learned that being on Ted Turner's board when Comcast was really a cable company. It's a worldwide business. It grows all in different ways, but they're in the same sort of system where together the value tends to had in the same direction. And at any one time, one part of the ecosystem could be doing better than the other part of the ecosystem. But in the end, we're bringing great expenses to consumers in either content, in innovative distribution technologies, and that's how we're running our company. I hope that's a response to your question."

A year ago, a lot of advertisers pulled back and didn't spend as much in the upfront. I think part of the thinking was we can always spend later and there's plenty of places to spend their money on digital. I think the emotion of the market has swung pretty dramatically over the last year. I think people are -- have come to the realization that broad television reach is really important in a campaign that digital has a place, but television has a big place. And a lot of people I think -- we did not come out to the upfront market this year and significantly more in what has been one of the strongest scatter markets I've ever seen. So in terms of market dynamics, we're going into the upfront season. I think with a lot of wind in our back, my prediction is that it's going to be a strong upfront. We think we're in the pole position for that strong upfront. We represent about 20% of the eyeballs in television if you add up broadcast and cable. NBC is on its way to its third annual 18 to 49 victory where we're doing very well in sports and news at NBCU. And then our cable channels are strong. I'm glad you pointed out Telemundo. Telemundo used to be a weak second. We're beating Univision most nights at 10:00 and have closed to the gap with Univision. And I think in an number of our channels, we're still underpriced relative to people that were feeding or close to or at least competitive to. So I think we're going in the upfront in a very strong position. As you said, we sell all of our channels and all of our digital properties together under the unified direction of Lindy our head of sales, which is an advantage for advertisers. But also, given our position, we tend to talk to people first, and that's exactly where we want to be. And I think we're going into this upfront with a better upfront, a better more unified approach and more strength than we've ever had, and we'll see how it all plays out."

I put in NBC obviously right at the top of that list. Retransmission consent has been a tremendous benefit to our Broadcast business, both retransmission we get from our own stations and the share we get from our affiliates. If you have those 2 numbers together, that was a number around 0, 5 years ago, and it's a number around $800 million today, something like that. And also, on the Advertising side, I think particularly that the live events, if you've got the Olympics coming up for 17 days, our ratings will be higher than all 3 all -- if you add the other 3 broadcasters together, it will be a multiple of anyone else's ratings for 17 days. Imagine how valuable that is to someone who's trying to build a brand or introduce a new car, do something major in terms of changing the opinion of people in America. So broad case, it's interesting. I would not have predicted this 10 or 20 years ago, but it feels like Broadcast is getting stronger and stronger in this period. We have to keep putting shows on, and it's tougher and tougher in a fragmented world to get a rating. But when you do, you get rewarded for it significantly."

We're off to a great start in 2016. We increased revenue and operating cash flow in the first quarter while continuing to prudently invest in the businesses to further strengthen our competitive position and drive growth.
I believe our Cable business is really differentiating itself, fostering real innovation that is translating into the strong momentum you see in these results. We're demonstrating notable improvements in customer service, investing to put the industry's fastest WiFi in homes and to be the first to bring customers widespread access to gigabit speeds through DOCSIS 3.1 technology; and with X1, delivering a platform and a breadth of content that's unrivaled.
As this quarter once again shows, our customers are responding to all of this. We increased our customer relationship growth by 36% from the first quarter of 2015 and now have achieved 50% penetration of our homes passed. [ph] We added 53,000 video customers in the quarter, making us video net add positive over the past 12 months. This important milestone has eluded us for nearly a decade, and we have now accomplished it within the context of an unprecedented pace of change in this industry, including the steady drumbeat of new competitors and new offers.
Our voice remotes are the latest example of how we are differentiating ourselves in the market. In a short period of time, we have deployed 6 million of these new remotes. Thanks to Tony Werner and his technology team's great customer experience, we're getting wonderful feedback from our customers already.
We added another 438,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, the best first quarter we've had in 4 years. Much like our improvement in video, the progress we are making is largely a result of improvements in churn. We're upping speeds, delivering best-in-class WiFi access and investing in more ways to add value to our customers. As a result, they're staying with us longer.
Business services delivered another excellent quarter with revenue growth of nearly 18%. This growth comes with very attractive margins for us as you know. We continue to take share in small business and bring new competition and choice for midsized businesses as well as enterprise customers. Just as important as our strong service and subscriber metrics, Neil and the team are demonstrating terrific balance, driving revenue per customer relationship forward at a healthy clip, along with solid operating cash flow growth.
Over at NBCUniversal, Steve and his team delivered another strong quarter. Operating cash flow increased by 10%, benefiting from particularly strong performance in Broadcast and our recent acquisition of Universal Studios Japan. Our TV business has performed well and have had some good momentum. The advertising environment remains robust, which we believe sets up Linda Yaccarino and her team for a strong upfront. This year, we are unifying the upfront for NBC Broadcast Telemundo and Cable Networks, reflecting the way we go to market as a strong and comprehensive portfolio. We feel great about our position, which will be strengthened as we now add Thursday Night Football to go along with an already strong list of sports properties.
Speaking of strong sports properties, we recently surpassed $1 billion in national advertising sales for the Rio Olympics, achieving this milestone far earlier than the London Olympics. This is a very promising result, which reinforces our view of the attractiveness of this event.
Meanwhile, MSNBC continues its impressive performance with its best ratings in 3 years in prime time, up over 100%. Andy Lack and the news team are doing a wonderful job with the news organization, particularly through the early stages of this election cycle.
In our theme parks, we're delighted about our trajectory, the momentum that we've created and our road map with new investments and new attractions and additional hotel room capacity. Universal Studios Japan set attendance records in its just ended fiscal year and performed well in our first full quarter of ownership. Additionally, we just launched Harry Potter at Universal Hollywood, and we expected to follow the strong success we have seen with our other Potter attractions.
We've got a unique and wonderful set of assets which provides Comcast NBCUniversal with many opportunities. All of this will be on display this summer when we put the full weight of the company behind the Olympics. I'm amazed of what we've accomplished in a short period of time as a combined company just 5 years in, and I think we're not only 5 years wiser and stronger but really better together. We're confident we remain on the right path to creating value for our customers and shareholders, and I couldn't be more excited about our future.
Mike, over to you."

At Cable, the primary drivers of",1781,"Good morning, everybody. Let's go right to the first quarter on Slide 4 and cover the key financials.
Overall, we delivered consolidated revenue growth of 5.3% and operating cash flow growth of 6.9% for the first quarter. At Cable, the primary drivers of growth were high-speed data, video and business services, while NBCUniversal's results were driven by Broadcast, Cable Networks and theme parks, which was positively impacted by the inclusion of Universal Studios Japan.
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.84 a share, a 6.3% increase compared to a year ago. Free cash flow was $2.8 billion in the first quarter, a decline of 11.9%, while free cash flow per share declined 8.8% to $1.14. We'll go into greater detail on these results on slides to come.
Now let's review the results for our businesses in more detail, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable Communications delivered a solid first quarter. Revenue increased 6.7% to $12.2 billion dollars as we increased customer relationships and grew total revenue per customer relationship by 4% to $146 per month. We added 269,000 customer relationships, a 36% improvement in net adds compared to last year's first quarter, driven by growth in 2-product and 3-product customers and a reduction in churn across all products. In fact, video and high-speed data have each improved churn for 26 consecutive months.
High-speed internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall Cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 7.6% to $3.3 billion in the quarter, reflecting strong customer growth, customers subscribing to higher levels of service and more modest rate adjustments compared to the prior year. Customer growth was strong as we added a combined 438,000 net data customers in the quarter, which includes residential and business customers.
We continue to differentiate and improve our product by increasing our speeds on existing tiers as well as offering the fastest in-home WiFi with our advanced wireless gateways. At the end of the quarter, 77% of our residential customers received speeds of 50 megabits per second or greater and have one of our wireless gateways, both up significantly from the prior year.
Video revenue remained healthy, increasing 3.9% to $5.5 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services, including premium channels, HD DVRs and additional outlets. We added a combined 53,000 net video customers, our best first quarter result in 9 years, driven primarily by another quarter of improved churn.
We continue to make great progress rolling out X1 to new and existing customers, adding 1.1 million customers in the quarter, a 53% increase in net adds compared to last year. Nearly 35% of our total video customers have X1, which we believe is a real competitive differentiator. Coupled with the X1 technology is the breadth of content we offer customers both on-demand and with the compelling TV Everywhere offering.
On X1, 86% of subscribers are using XFINITY on-demand monthly, viewing 25 hours a month on average. And 42% of subscribers are using our mobile TV Everywhere platforms monthly, up 32% from last year, viewing 7 hours a month on average. We think this adds great utility to our video service.
Rounding out our residential products. Voice revenue declined by 1.1% to $896 million in the first quarter as customer additions were offset by a modest decline in ARPU. In the first quarter, we added a combined 102,000 net Voice customers, up 33% versus a year ago.
Now let's turn to business services, which continues to deliver excellent results. Revenue increased 17.5% to $1.3 billion with the small business segment accounting for about 75% of our revenues and 60% of our growth. Revenue for the midsized business segment is growing at a faster rate than the small business segment, increasing its contribution as a percentage of total business revenue. Overall, business services has strong positive momentum and continues to represent a large and attractive growth opportunity for the company. Finally, cable advertising revenue increased 12.1% to $559 million. Excluding political revenue, our cable advertising revenue increased 7.6% in the first quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. First quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 5% to $4.9 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.1% compared to 40.7% in the first quarter of 2015, driven by higher expenses primarily related to increase in programming cost and the investments we are making to improve the customer experience.
Programming expenses grew 9.4%, reflecting programming contract renewals as well as higher retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs. As we've noted before, when we negotiate programming deals, we continue to value expanded content rights for our on-demand and TV Everywhere platforms. We continue to add more content out-of-home rights, stacking rights and back seasons, which helps ensure we have the most compelling and competitive video product on the market.
Nonprogramming expenses increased 6.9%, reflecting our planned investment to improve the customer experience and to continue the rollout of X1. We've added technicians and service personnel, strengthened our dispatch teams and operations and invested in training, tools and technology. As a result, technical and product support cost grew 6.3% and customer service expenses increased 8%.
We continue to expect our 2016 Cable operating margin to be flat to down 50 basis points compared to 40.6% in 2015 as programming and other expense growth should be offset by modest rate adjustments, growth in high-margin businesses like high-speed data and Business Services and continued overall cost discipline.
Keep in mind, for the second quarter, we faced tough comparisons to last year's hugely successful Pacquiao versus Mayweather fight on Pay-Per-View. However, growth in high-margin political advertising revenue should provide more significant support for margin in the back half of the year.
Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. On Slide 7, you can see NBCUniversal delivered solid results in the first quarter as revenue increased 3.9% and operating cash flow increased 10%. Adjusting to include the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan in last year's results, pro forma revenue was relatively flat, and operating cash flow increased 1.8%, more than offsetting the difficult comparison to a profitable Super Bowl and our strong film results last year. This quarter's growth was driven by strong TV results fueled by higher retransmission and affiliate revenues and the underlying strength of the advertising market.
Cable Networks revenue increased 4% and operating cash flow increased 6.4% to $956 million, reflecting higher distribution revenue, strong ad revenue given the best advertising market we've seen in some time and a modest increase in programming and production costs. Distribution revenue increased 5.9%, driven by contractual rate increases and contract renewals, partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers at our Cable Networks.
Advertising revenue was flat compared to the first quarter of 2015, which included a benefit from a reduction in deferred advertising revenue. If we exclude this benefit, advertising growth would have been about 4%, driven by strong pricing, partially offset by audience rating declines at our cable networks.
At Broadcast Television, while revenue declined 7.3%, we delivered outstanding operating cash flow growth of 56.5% even with the profitable Super Bowl included in last year's results. This growth was driven by a few factors. First, the underlying strength of the advertising market. Excluding the Super Bowl, Advertising revenue increased 9.6%, reflecting strong scatter pricing as well as one additional NFL game compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the extra NFL game, advertising growth was still up high single digits. Second, strong retransmission revenue growth was driven by recent step-ups. And last, programming and production costs were lower compared to last year, which included not only the Super Bowl but also more expensive prime time programming due to series finales.
Film revenue declined 4.3%, and operating cash flow declined 43.1% to $167 million, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year's strong film performance. Most notably, theatrical revenue declined 36.4% compared to last year's first quarter, which included the very successful Fifty Shades of Grey. In addition, home entertainment revenue declined 24.4% due to the strong performance of several releases last year, including Lucy. Partially offsetting this lower revenue was higher content licensing revenue and strong consumer products growth due to the Minions and Jurassic franchises.
Theme parks revenue increased 57.5% to $1 billion, and operating cash flow increased 53.6% to $375 million in the first quarter of 2016. On a pro forma basis, revenue increased 9.6%, and operating cash flow increased 3.3%. These results reflect the timing of spring break this year, cable [ph] guest attendance and higher per capita spending, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, including free opening cost to support Harry Potter in Hollywood and the Flying Dinosaur in Japan.
Now let's move to Slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures increased 9.2% to $1.9 billion in the first quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 9% to $1.6 billion for the quarter, equal to 12.9% of Cable revenue versus 12.6% in the first quarter of 2015. The increase reflects a higher level of investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity and an increased investment in line extensions as well as higher spending on customer premise equipments related to the deployment of the X1 platform and wireless gateways. Also included in each of these growth rates is the continued expansion of Business Services. In 2016, we will continue to invest in each of these areas as they are driving positive results in our business. For the full year, we continue to expect capital intensity to remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%.
At NBCUniversal, first quarter capital expenditures increased 10% to $295 million, driven by the inclusion of Universal Studios Japan. We continue to expect NBCUniversal's CapEx to increase approximately 10% this year.
I'll now finish up on Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, consolidated free cash flow declined 11.9% to $2.8 billion in the first quarter, reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow, offset by increased working capital as well as higher capital expenditures and cash paid for capitalized software and other intangible assets. We are successfully executing our plans for returning capital to shareholders, including dividend payments during the quarter totaling $611 million, up 6.9%, and share repurchases of $1.25 billion in the quarter, which are tracking to our $5 billion annual target. We ended the quarter right at 2x net leverage, in line with our stated target.
That concludes our summary of the quarter. I hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our results as well as our momentum.
Now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A."

I also think that putting the 2 together, we feel we're better together. I said that in the upfront remarks. I think almost every senior executive in the company sees a benefit from some other part of the company, in their part of the company. That is part of a symphony. When I think about the Olympics, I just touched on briefly in my opening remarks, you will see XFINITY's coverage of the Olympics will be unlike any television on the X1 experience that's ever been presented to a consumer for a live sporting event. And NBC coverage itself will be unprecedented if you just go back a few years to see how much this landscape has changed. And the companies that are leaning in toward that are well positioned. I can't think of a better company than ourselves. As to the relative value, these things evolve and go up and down in the relationship between the 2 in terms of carriage disputes and other things. They're both great businesses, and that was our fundamental premise all along. I think I first learned that being on Ted Turner's board when Comcast was truly a cable company. It's a worldwide business. It grows all in different ways, but they're in the same sort of system where together, the value tends to head in the same direction. And at any one time, one part of the ecosystem could be doing better than the other part of the ecosystem. But in the end, we're bringing great expenses to consumers who need the content, who need innovative distribution technologies, and that's how we're running our company. I hope that's responsive to your question. Thanks very much."

A year ago, a lot of advertisers pulled back and didn't spend as much in the upfront. I think part of the thinking was we can always spend later and there's plenty of places to spend their money on digital. I think the emotion of the market has swung pretty dramatically over the last year. I think people are -- have come to the realization that broad television reach is really important in a campaign that digital has a place, but television has a big place. And a lot of people, I think, who did not come into the upfront market last year, paid significantly more in what has been one of the strongest scatter markets I've ever seen. So in terms of market dynamics, we're going into the upfront season, I think, with a lot of wind at our back. And my prediction is that it's going to be a strong upfront. We think we're in the pull [ph] position for that strong upfront. We represent about 20% of the eyeballs in television if you add up broadcast and cable. NBC is on its way to its third annual 18 to 49 victory where we're doing very well in sports and news at NBC. And then our cable channels are strong. I'm glad you pointed out Telemundo. Telemundo used to be a weak second. We're beating Univision most nights at 10:00 and have closed the gap with Univision. And I think in a number of our channels, we're still underpriced relative to people that we're beating or close to or at least competitive to. So I think we're going to the upfront in a very strong position. And as you said, we sell all of our channels and all of our digital properties together under the unified direction of Linda Yaccarino, our Head of Ad Sales, which is an advantage for advertisers. But also, given our position, we tend to talk to people first, and that's exactly where we want to be. And so I think we're going into this upfront with a better upfront, a better, more unified approach and more strength than we've ever had, and we'll see how it all plays out."

Imagine how valuable that is to someone who's trying to build a brand or introduce a new car, do something major in terms of changing the opinion of people in America. So broad case, it's interesting. I would not have predicted this 10 or 20 years ago, but it feels like Broadcast is getting stronger and stronger in this period.

We're off to a great start in 2016. We increased revenue and operating cash flow in the first quarter while continuing to prudently invest in the businesses to further strengthen our competitive position and drive growth.
I believe our Cable business is really differentiating itself, fostering real innovation that is translating into the strong momentum you see in these results. We're demonstrating notable improvements in customer service, investing to put the industry's fastest WiFi in homes and to be the first to bring customers widespread access to gigabit speeds through DOCSIS 3.1 technology; and with X1, delivering a platform and a breadth of content that's unrivaled.
As this quarter once again shows, our customers are responding to all of this. We increased our customer relationship growth by 36% from the first quarter of 2015 and now have achieved 50% penetration of our homes passed. We added 53,000 video customers in the quarter, making us video net add positive over the past 12 months. This important milestone has eluded us for nearly a decade, and we have now accomplished it within the context of an unprecedented pace of change in this industry, including the steady drumbeat of new competitors and new offers.
Our voice remotes are the latest example of how we are differentiating ourselves in the market. In a short period of time, we have deployed 6 million of these new remotes. Thanks to Tony Werner and his technology team's great customer experience, we're getting wonderful feedback from our customers already.
We added another 438,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, the best first quarter we've had in 4 years. Much like our improvement in video, the progress we are making is largely a result of improvements in churn. We're upping speeds, delivering best-in-class WiFi access and investing in more ways to add value to our customers. As a result, they're staying with us longer.
Business services delivered another excellent quarter with revenue growth of nearly 18%. This growth comes with very attractive margins for us as you know. We continue to take share in small business and bring new competition and choice for midsized businesses as well as enterprise customers. Just as important as our strong service and subscriber metrics, Neil and the team are demonstrating terrific balance, driving revenue per customer relationship forward at a healthy clip, along with solid operating cash flow growth.
Over at NBCUniversal, Steve and his team delivered another strong quarter. Operating cash flow increased by 10%, benefiting from particularly strong performance in Broadcast and our recent acquisition of Universal Studios Japan. Our TV business has performed well and has had some good momentum. The advertising environment remains robust, which we believe sets up Linda Yaccarino and her team for a strong upfront. This year, we are unifying the upfront for NBC Broadcast Telemundo and Cable Networks, reflecting the way we go to market as a strong and comprehensive portfolio. We feel great about our position, which will be strengthened as we now add Thursday Night Football to go along with an already strong list of sports properties.
Speaking of strong sports properties, we recently surpassed $1 billion in national advertising sales for the Rio Olympics, achieving this milestone far earlier than the London Olympics. This is a very promising result, which reinforces our view of the attractiveness of this event.
Meanwhile, MSNBC continues its impressive performance with its best ratings in 3 years in prime time, up over 100%. Andy Lack and the news team are doing a wonderful job with the news organization, particularly through the early stages of this election cycle.
In our theme parks, we're delighted about our trajectory, the momentum that we've created and our road map with new investments and new attractions and additional hotel room capacity. Universal Studios Japan set attendance records in its just-ended fiscal year and performed well in our first full quarter of ownership. Additionally, we just launched Harry Potter at Universal Hollywood, and we expect it to follow the strong success we have seen with our other Potter attractions.
We've got a unique and wonderful set of assets which provides Comcast NBCUniversal with many opportunities. All of this will be on display this summer when we put the full weight of the company behind the Olympics. I'm amazed at what we've accomplished in a short period of time as a combined company just 5 years in, and I think we're not only 5 years wiser and stronger but really better together. We're confident we remain on the right path to creating value for our customers and shareholders, and I couldn't be more excited about our future.
Mike, over to you."

Let's go right to the first quarter on Slide 4 and cover the key financials.Overall, we delivered consolidated revenue growth of 5.3% and operating cash flow growth of 6.9% for the first quarter. At Cable, the primary drivers of",1779,"Good morning, everybody. Let's go right to the first quarter on Slide 4 and cover the key financials.
Overall, we delivered consolidated revenue growth of 5.3% and operating cash flow growth of 6.9% for the first quarter. At Cable, the primary drivers of growth were high-speed data, video and business services, while NBCUniversal's results were driven by Broadcast, Cable Networks and theme parks, which was positively impacted by the inclusion of Universal Studios Japan.
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.84 a share, a 6.3% increase compared to a year ago. Free cash flow was $2.8 billion in the first quarter, a decline of 11.9%, while free cash flow per share declined 8.8% to $1.14. We'll go into greater detail on these results on slides to come.
Now let's review the results of our businesses in more detail, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable Communications delivered a solid first quarter. Revenue increased 6.7% to $12.2 billion dollars as we increased customer relationships and grew total revenue per customer relationship by 4% to $146 per month. We added 269,000 customer relationships, a 36% improvement in net adds compared to last year's first quarter, driven by growth in 2-product and 3-product customers and a reduction in churn across all products. In fact, video and high-speed data have each improved churn for 26 consecutive months.
High-speed internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall Cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 7.6% to $3.3 billion in the quarter, reflecting strong customer growth, customers subscribing to higher levels of service and more modest rate adjustments compared to the prior year. Customer growth was strong as we added a combined 438,000 net data customers in the quarter, which includes residential and business customers.
We continue to differentiate and improve our product by increasing our speeds on existing tiers as well as offering the fastest in-home WiFi with our advanced wireless gateways. At the end of the quarter, 77% of our residential customers received speeds of 50 megabits per second or greater and have one of our wireless gateways, both up significantly from the prior year.
Video revenue remained healthy, increasing 3.9% to $5.5 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services, including premium channels, HD DVRs and additional outlets. We added a combined 53,000 net video customers, our best first quarter result in 9 years, driven primarily by another quarter of improved churn.
We continue to make great progress rolling out X1 to new and existing customers, adding 1.1 million customers in the quarter, a 53% increase in net adds compared to last year. Nearly 35% of our total video customers have X1, which we believe is a real competitive differentiator. Coupled with the X1 technology is the breadth of content we offer customers both on-demand and with the compelling TV Everywhere offering.
On X1, 86% of subscribers are using XFINITY on-demand monthly, viewing 25 hours a month on average. And 42% of subscribers are using our mobile TV Everywhere platforms monthly, up 32% from last year, viewing 7 hours a month on average. We think this adds great utility to our video service.
Rounding out our residential products, voice revenue declined by 1.1% to $896 million in the first quarter as customer additions were offset by a modest decline in ARPU. In the first quarter, we added a combined 102,000 net Voice customers, up 33% versus a year ago.
Now let's turn to business services, which continues to deliver excellent results. Revenue increased 17.5% to $1.3 billion with the small business segment accounting for about 75% of our revenues and 60% of our growth. Revenue for the midsized business segment is growing at a faster rate than the small business segment, increasing its contribution as a percentage of total business revenue. Overall, business services has strong positive momentum and continues to represent a large and attractive growth opportunity for the company. Finally, cable advertising revenue increased 12.1% to $559 million. Excluding political revenue, our cable advertising revenue increased 7.6% in the first quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. First quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 5% to $4.9 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.1% compared to 40.7% in the first quarter of 2015, driven by higher expenses primarily related to increase in programming cost and the investments we are making to improve the customer experience.
Programming expenses grew 9.4%, reflecting programming contract renewals as well as higher retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs. As we've noted before, when we negotiate programming deals, we continue to value expanded content rights for our on-demand and TV Everywhere platforms. We continue to add more content, out-of-home rights, stacking rights and back seasons, which helps ensure we have the most compelling and competitive video product on the market.
Nonprogramming expenses increased 6.9%, reflecting our planned investment to improve the customer experience and to continue the rollout of X1. We've added technicians and service personnel, strengthened our dispatch teams and operations and invested in training, tools and technology. As a result, technical and product support costs grew 6.3% and customer service expenses increased 8%.
We continue to expect our 2016 Cable operating margin to be flat to down 50 basis points compared to 40.6% in 2015 as programming and other expense growth should be offset by modest rate adjustments, growth in high-margin businesses like high-speed data and Business Services and continued overall cost discipline.
Keep in mind, for the second quarter, we face tough comparisons to last year's hugely-successful Pacquiao versus Mayweather fight on Pay-Per-View. However, growth in high-margin political advertising revenue should provide more significant support for margin in the back half of the year.
Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. On Slide 7, you can see NBCUniversal delivered solid results in the first quarter as revenue increased 3.9% and operating cash flow increased 10%. Adjusting to include the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan in last year's results, pro forma revenue was relatively flat, and operating cash flow increased 1.8%, more than offsetting the difficult comparison to a profitable Super Bowl and our strong film results last year. This quarter's growth was driven by strong TV results fueled by higher retransmission and affiliate revenues and the underlying strength of the advertising market.
Cable Networks revenue increased 4% and operating cash flow increased 6.4% to $956 million, reflecting higher distribution revenue, strong ad revenue given the best advertising market we've seen in some time and a modest increase in programming and production costs. Distribution revenue increased 5.9%, driven by contractual rate increases and contract renewals, partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers at our Cable Networks.
Advertising revenue was flat compared to the first quarter of 2015, which included a benefit from a reduction in deferred advertising revenue. If we exclude this benefit, advertising growth would have been about 4%, driven by strong pricing, partially offset by audience rating declines at our cable networks.
At Broadcast Television, while revenue declined 7.3%, we delivered outstanding operating cash flow growth of 56.5% even with the profitable Super Bowl included in last year's results. This growth was driven by a few factors. First, the underlying strength of the advertising market. Excluding the Super Bowl, Advertising revenue increased 9.6%, reflecting strong scatter pricing as well as one additional NFL game compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the extra NFL game, advertising growth was still up high single digits. Second, strong retransmission revenue growth was driven by recent step-ups. And last, programming and production costs were lower compared to last year, which included not only the Super Bowl but also more expensive prime time programming due to series finales.
Film revenue declined 4.3%, and operating cash flow declined 43.1% to $167 million, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year's strong film performance. Most notably, theatrical revenue declined 36.4% compared to last year's first quarter, which included the very successful Fifty Shades of Grey. In addition, home entertainment revenue declined 24.4% due to the strong performance of several releases last year, including Lucy. Partially offsetting this lower revenue was higher content licensing revenue and strong consumer products growth due to the Minions and Jurassic franchises.
Theme parks revenue increased 57.5% to $1 billion, and operating cash flow increased 53.6% to $375 million in the first quarter of 2016. On a pro forma basis, revenue increased 9.6%, and operating cash flow increased 3.3%. These results reflect the timing of spring break this year, stable guest attendance and higher per capita spending, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, including free opening costs to support Harry Potter in Hollywood and the Flying Dinosaur in Japan.
Now let's move to Slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures increased 9.2% to $1.9 billion in the first quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 9% to $1.6 billion for the quarter, equal to 12.9% of Cable revenue versus 12.6% in the first quarter of 2015. The increase reflects a higher level of investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity and an increased investment in line extensions as well as higher spending on customer premise equipment related to the deployment of the X1 platform and wireless gateways. Also included in each of these growth rates is the continued expansion of Business Services. In 2016, we will continue to invest in each of these areas as they are driving positive results in our business. For the full year, we continue to expect capital intensity to remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%.
At NBCUniversal, first quarter capital expenditures increased 10% to $295 million, driven by the inclusion of Universal Studios Japan. We continue to expect NBCUniversal's CapEx to increase approximately 10% this year.
I'll now finish up on Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, consolidated free cash flow declined 11.9% to $2.8 billion in the first quarter, reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow, offset by increased working capital as well as higher capital expenditures and cash paid for capitalized software and other intangible assets. We are successfully executing our plans for returning capital to shareholders, including dividend payments during the quarter totaling $611 million, up 6.9%, and share repurchases of $1.25 billion in the quarter, which are tracking to our $5 billion annual target. We ended the quarter right at 2x net leverage, in line with our stated target.
That concludes our summary of the quarter. I hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our results as well as our momentum.
Now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A."

I also think that putting the 2 together, we feel we're better together. I said that in the upfront remarks. I think almost every senior executive in the company sees a benefit from some other part of the company, in their part of the company. That is part of symphony. When I think about the Olympics, I just touched on briefly in my opening remarks, you will see XFINITY's coverage of the Olympics will be unlike any television on the X1 experience that's ever been presented to a consumer for a live sporting event. And NBC coverage itself will be unprecedented if you just go back a few years to see how much this landscape has changed. And the companies that are leaning in toward that and are well positioned, I can't think of a better company than ourselves. As to the relative value, these things evolve and go up and down in the relationship between the 2 in terms of carriage disputes and other things. They're both great businesses, and that was our fundamental premise all along. I think I first learned that being on Ted Turner's board when Comcast was purely a cable company. It's a worldwide business. It grows all in different ways, but they're in the same sort of system where together, the value tends to head in the same direction. And at any one time, one part of the ecosystem could be doing better than the other part of the ecosystem. But in the end, we're bringing great experiences to consumers. You need that content, you need innovative distribution technologies, and that's how we're running our company. I hope that's responsive to your question. Thanks for asking."

A year ago, a lot of advertisers pulled back and didn't spend as much in the upfront. I think part of the thinking was we can always spend later and there's plenty of places to spend their money on digital. I think the emotion of the market has swung pretty dramatically over the last year. I think people are -- have come to the realization that broad television reach is really important in a campaign; that digital has a place, but television has a big place. And a lot of people, I think, who did not come into the upfront market last year, paid significantly more in what has been one of the strongest scatter markets I've ever seen. So in terms of market dynamics, we're going into the upfront season, I think, with a lot of wind at our back. And my prediction is that it's going to be a strong upfront. We think we're in the pole position for that strong upfront. We represent about 20% of the eyeballs in television if you add up Broadcast and Cable. NBC is on its way to its third annual 18 to 49 victory where we're doing very well in sports and news at NBC. And then our cable channels are strong. I'm glad you pointed out Telemundo. Telemundo used to be a weak second. We're beating Univision most nights at 10:00 and have closed the gap with Univision. And I think in a number of our channels, we're still underpriced relative to people that we're beating or are close to or at least competitive to. So I think we're going to the upfront in a very strong position. And as you said, we sell all of our channels and all of our digital properties together under the unified direction of Linda Yaccarino, our Head of Ad Sales, which is an advantage for advertisers. But also, given our position, we tend to talk to people first, and that's exactly where we want to be. And so I think we're going into this upfront with a better upfront, a better, more unified approach and more strength than we've ever had, and we'll see how it all plays out."

If you look at where the company was 5 years ago and where it is today, the most highly rated channels, I think, are going to be staying in the most bundles and are going to be watched by the most people, continue to be watched by the most people. And I'd put NBC obviously right at the top of that list. Retransmission consent has been a tremendous benefit to our Broadcast business, both the retransmission we get from our own stations and the share we get from our affiliates. If you add those 2 numbers together, that was a number around 0 5 years ago, and it's a number around $800 million today, something like that. And also, on the advertising side, I think particularly that the live events, if you've got Olympics coming up for 17 days, our ratings will be higher than all 3, all -- if you add the other 3 broadcasters together, we will be a multiple of anyone else's ratings for 17 days. Imagine how valuable that is to someone who's trying to build a brand or introduce a new car, do something major in terms of changing the opinion of people in America. So broad case, it's interesting. I would not have predicted this 10 or 20 years ago, but it feels like Broadcast is getting stronger and stronger in this period. We have to keep putting good shows on, and it's tougher and tougher in a fragmented world to get a rating. But when you do, you get rewarded for it significantly."

We're off to a great start in 2016. We increased revenue and operating cash flow in the first quarter while continuing to prudently invest in the businesses to further strengthen our competitive position and drive growth.
I believe our Cable business is really differentiating itself, fostering real innovation that is translating into the strong momentum you see in these results. We're demonstrating notable improvements in customer service, investing to put the industry's fastest WiFi in homes and to be the first to bring customers widespread access to gigabit speeds through DOCSIS 3.1 technology; and with X1, delivering a platform and a breadth of content that's unrivaled.
As this quarter once again shows, our customers are responding to all of this. We increased our customer relationship growth by 36% from the first quarter of 2015 and now have achieved 50% penetration of our homes passed. We added 53,000 video customers in the quarter, making us video net add positive over the past 12 months. This important milestone has eluded us for nearly a decade, and we have now accomplished it within the context of an unprecedented pace of change in this industry, including the steady drumbeat of new competitors and new offers.
Our voice remotes are the latest example of how we are differentiating ourselves in the market. In a short period of time, we have deployed 6 million of these new remotes. Thanks to Tony Werner and his technology team's great customer experience, we're getting wonderful feedback from our customers already.
We added another 438,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, the best first quarter we've had in 4 years. Much like our improvement in video, the progress we are making is largely a result of improvements in churn. We're upping speeds, delivering best-in-class WiFi access and investing in more ways to add value to our customers. As a result, they're staying with us longer.
Business services delivered another excellent quarter with revenue growth of nearly 18%. This growth comes with very attractive margins for us as you know. We continue to take share in small business and bring new competition and choice for midsized businesses as well as enterprise customers. Just as important as our strong service and subscriber metrics, Neil and the team are demonstrating terrific balance, driving revenue per customer relationship forward at a healthy clip, along with solid operating cash flow growth.
Over at NBCUniversal, Steve and his team delivered another strong quarter. Operating cash flow increased by 10%, benefiting from particularly strong performance in Broadcast and our recent acquisition of Universal Studios Japan. Our TV business has performed well and has had some good momentum. The advertising environment remains robust, which we believe sets up Linda Yaccarino and her team for a strong upfront. This year, we are unifying the upfront for NBC Broadcast Telemundo and Cable Networks, reflecting the way we go to market as a strong and comprehensive portfolio. We feel great about our position, which will be strengthened as we now add Thursday Night Football to go along with an already strong list of sports properties.
Speaking of strong sports properties, we recently surpassed $1 billion in national advertising sales for the Rio Olympics, achieving this milestone far earlier than the London Olympics. This is a very promising result, which reinforces our view of the attractiveness of this event.
Meanwhile, MSNBC continues its impressive performance with its best ratings in 3 years in prime time, up over 100%. Andy Lack and the news team are doing a wonderful job with the news organization, particularly through the early stages of this election cycle.
In our theme parks, we're delighted about our trajectory, the momentum that we've created and our road map with new investments and new attractions and additional hotel room capacity. Universal Studios Japan set attendance records in its just-ended fiscal year and performed well in our first full quarter of ownership. Additionally, we just launched Harry Potter at Universal Hollywood, and we expect it to follow the strong success we have seen with our other Potter attractions.
We've got a unique and wonderful set of assets which provides Comcast NBCUniversal with many opportunities. All of this will be on display this summer when we put the full weight of the company behind the Olympics. I'm amazed at what we've accomplished in a short period of time as a combined company just 5 years in, and I think we're not only 5 years wiser and stronger but really better together. We're confident we remain on the right path to creating value for our customers and shareholders, and I couldn't be more excited about our future.
Mike, over to you."

Let's go right to the first quarter on Slide 4 and cover the key financials.Overall, we delivered consolidated revenue growth of 5.3% and operating cash flow growth of 6.9% for the first quarter. At Cable, the primary drivers of",1779,"Good morning, everybody. Let's go right to the first quarter on Slide 4 and cover the key financials.
Overall, we delivered consolidated revenue growth of 5.3% and operating cash flow growth of 6.9% for the first quarter. At Cable, the primary drivers of growth were high-speed data, video and business services, while NBCUniversal's results were driven by Broadcast, Cable Networks and theme parks, which was positively impacted by the inclusion of Universal Studios Japan.
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.84 a share, a 6.3% increase compared to a year ago. Free cash flow was $2.8 billion in the first quarter, a decline of 11.9%, while free cash flow per share declined 8.8% to $1.14. We'll go into greater detail on these results on slides to come.
Now let's review the results of our businesses in more detail, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable Communications delivered a solid first quarter. Revenue increased 6.7% to $12.2 billion dollars as we increased customer relationships and grew total revenue per customer relationship by 4% to $146 per month. We added 269,000 customer relationships, a 36% improvement in net adds compared to last year's first quarter, driven by growth in 2-product and 3-product customers and a reduction in churn across all products. In fact, video and high-speed data have each improved churn for 26 consecutive months.
High-speed internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall Cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 7.6% to $3.3 billion in the quarter, reflecting strong customer growth, customers subscribing to higher levels of service and more modest rate adjustments compared to the prior year. Customer growth was strong as we added a combined 438,000 net data customers in the quarter, which includes residential and business customers.
We continue to differentiate and improve our product by increasing our speeds on existing tiers as well as offering the fastest in-home WiFi with our advanced wireless gateways. At the end of the quarter, 77% of our residential customers received speeds of 50 megabits per second or greater and have one of our wireless gateways, both up significantly from the prior year.
Video revenue remained healthy, increasing 3.9% to $5.5 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services, including premium channels, HD DVRs and additional outlets. We added a combined 53,000 net video customers, our best first quarter result in 9 years, driven primarily by another quarter of improved churn.
We continue to make great progress rolling out X1 to new and existing customers, adding 1.1 million customers in the quarter, a 53% increase in net adds compared to last year. Nearly 35% of our total video customers have X1, which we believe is a real competitive differentiator. Coupled with the X1 technology is the breadth of content we offer customers both on-demand and with the compelling TV Everywhere offering.
On X1, 86% of subscribers are using XFINITY on-demand monthly, viewing 25 hours a month on average. And 42% of subscribers are using our mobile TV Everywhere platforms monthly, up 32% from last year, viewing 7 hours a month on average. We think this adds great utility to our video service.
Rounding out our residential products, voice revenue declined by 1.1% to $896 million in the first quarter as customer additions were offset by a modest decline in ARPU. In the first quarter, we added a combined 102,000 net Voice customers, up 33% versus a year ago.
Now let's turn to business services, which continues to deliver excellent results. Revenue increased 17.5% to $1.3 billion with the small business segment accounting for about 75% of our revenues and 60% of our growth. Revenue for the midsized business segment is growing at a faster rate than the small business segment, increasing its contribution as a percentage of total business revenue. Overall, business services has strong positive momentum and continues to represent a large and attractive growth opportunity for the company. Finally, cable advertising revenue increased 12.1% to $559 million. Excluding political revenue, our cable advertising revenue increased 7.6% in the first quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. First quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 5% to $4.9 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.1% compared to 40.7% in the first quarter of 2015, driven by higher expenses primarily related to increase in programming cost and the investments we are making to improve the customer experience.
Programming expenses grew 9.4%, reflecting programming contract renewals as well as higher retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs. As we've noted before, when we negotiate programming deals, we continue to value expanded content rights for our on-demand and TV Everywhere platforms. We continue to add more content, out-of-home rights, stacking rights and back seasons, which helps ensure we have the most compelling and competitive video product on the market.
Nonprogramming expenses increased 6.9%, reflecting our planned investment to improve the customer experience and to continue the rollout of X1. We've added technicians and service personnel, strengthened our dispatch teams and operations and invested in training, tools and technology. As a result, technical and product support costs grew 6.3% and customer service expenses increased 8%.
We continue to expect our 2016 Cable operating margin to be flat to down 50 basis points compared to 40.6% in 2015 as programming and other expense growth should be offset by modest rate adjustments, growth in high-margin businesses like high-speed data and Business Services and continued overall cost discipline.
Keep in mind, for the second quarter, we face tough comparisons to last year's hugely-successful Pacquiao versus Mayweather fight on Pay-Per-View. However, growth in high-margin political advertising revenue should provide more significant support for margin in the back half of the year.
Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. On Slide 7, you can see NBCUniversal delivered solid results in the first quarter as revenue increased 3.9% and operating cash flow increased 10%. Adjusting to include the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan in last year's results, pro forma revenue was relatively flat, and operating cash flow increased 1.8%, more than offsetting the difficult comparison to a profitable Super Bowl and our strong film results last year. This quarter's growth was driven by strong TV results fueled by higher retransmission and affiliate revenues and the underlying strength of the advertising market.
Cable Networks revenue increased 4% and operating cash flow increased 6.4% to $956 million, reflecting higher distribution revenue, strong ad revenue given the best advertising market we've seen in some time and a modest increase in programming and production costs. Distribution revenue increased 5.9%, driven by contractual rate increases and contract renewals, partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers at our Cable Networks.
Advertising revenue was flat compared to the first quarter of 2015, which included a benefit from a reduction in deferred advertising revenue. If we exclude this benefit, advertising growth would have been about 4%, driven by strong pricing, partially offset by audience rating declines at our cable networks.
At Broadcast Television, while revenue declined 7.3%, we delivered outstanding operating cash flow growth of 56.5% even with the profitable Super Bowl included in last year's results. This growth was driven by a few factors. First, the underlying strength of the advertising market. Excluding the Super Bowl, Advertising revenue increased 9.6%, reflecting strong scatter pricing as well as one additional NFL game compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the extra NFL game, advertising growth was still up high single digits. Second, strong retransmission revenue growth was driven by recent step-ups. And last, programming and production costs were lower compared to last year, which included not only the Super Bowl but also more expensive prime time programming due to series finales.
Film revenue declined 4.3%, and operating cash flow declined 43.1% to $167 million, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year's strong film performance. Most notably, theatrical revenue declined 36.4% compared to last year's first quarter, which included the very successful Fifty Shades of Grey. In addition, home entertainment revenue declined 24.4% due to the strong performance of several releases last year, including Lucy. Partially offsetting this lower revenue was higher content licensing revenue and strong consumer products growth due to the Minions and Jurassic franchises.
Theme parks revenue increased 57.5% to $1 billion, and operating cash flow increased 53.6% to $375 million in the first quarter of 2016. On a pro forma basis, revenue increased 9.6%, and operating cash flow increased 3.3%. These results reflect the timing of spring break this year, stable guest attendance and higher per capita spending, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, including free opening costs to support Harry Potter in Hollywood and the Flying Dinosaur in Japan.
Now let's move to Slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures increased 9.2% to $1.9 billion in the first quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 9% to $1.6 billion for the quarter, equal to 12.9% of Cable revenue versus 12.6% in the first quarter of 2015. The increase reflects a higher level of investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity and an increased investment in line extensions as well as higher spending on customer premise equipment related to the deployment of the X1 platform and wireless gateways. Also included in each of these growth rates is the continued expansion of Business Services. In 2016, we will continue to invest in each of these areas as they are driving positive results in our business. For the full year, we continue to expect capital intensity to remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%.
At NBCUniversal, first quarter capital expenditures increased 10% to $295 million, driven by the inclusion of Universal Studios Japan. We continue to expect NBCUniversal's CapEx to increase approximately 10% this year.
I'll now finish up on Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, consolidated free cash flow declined 11.9% to $2.8 billion in the first quarter, reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow, offset by increased working capital as well as higher capital expenditures and cash paid for capitalized software and other intangible assets. We are successfully executing our plans for returning capital to shareholders, including dividend payments during the quarter totaling $611 million, up 6.9%, and share repurchases of $1.25 billion in the quarter, which are tracking to our $5 billion annual target. We ended the quarter right at 2x net leverage, in line with our stated target.
That concludes our summary of the quarter. I hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our results as well as our momentum.
Now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A."

I also think that putting the 2 together, we feel we're better together. I said that in the upfront remarks. I think almost every senior executive in the company sees a benefit from some other part of the company, in their part of the company. That is part of symphony. When I think about the Olympics, I just touched on briefly in my opening remarks, you will see XFINITY's coverage of the Olympics will be unlike any television on the X1 experience that's ever been presented to a consumer for a live sporting event. And NBC coverage itself will be unprecedented if you just go back a few years to see how much this landscape has changed. And the companies that are leaning in toward that and are well positioned, I can't think of a better company than ourselves. As to the relative value, these things evolve and go up and down in the relationship between the 2 in terms of carriage disputes and other things. They're both great businesses, and that was our fundamental premise all along. I think I first learned that being on Ted Turner's board when Comcast was purely a cable company. It's a worldwide business. It grows all in different ways, but they're in the same sort of system where together, the value tends to head in the same direction. And at any one time, one part of the ecosystem could be doing better than the other part of the ecosystem. But in the end, we're bringing great experiences to consumers. You need that content, you need innovative distribution technologies, and that's how we're running our company. I hope that's responsive to your question. Thanks for asking."

A year ago, a lot of advertisers pulled back and didn't spend as much in the upfront. I think part of the thinking was we can always spend later and there's plenty of places to spend their money on digital. I think the emotion of the market has swung pretty dramatically over the last year. I think people are -- have come to the realization that broad television reach is really important in a campaign; that digital has a place, but television has a big place. And a lot of people, I think, who did not come into the upfront market last year, paid significantly more in what has been one of the strongest scatter markets I've ever seen. So in terms of market dynamics, we're going into the upfront season, I think, with a lot of wind at our back. And my prediction is that it's going to be a strong upfront. We think we're in the pole position for that strong upfront. We represent about 20% of the eyeballs in television if you add up Broadcast and Cable. NBC is on its way to its third annual 18 to 49 victory where we're doing very well in sports and news at NBC. And then our cable channels are strong. I'm glad you pointed out Telemundo. Telemundo used to be a weak second. We're beating Univision most nights at 10:00 and have closed the gap with Univision. And I think in a number of our channels, we're still underpriced relative to people that we're beating or are close to or at least competitive to. So I think we're going to the upfront in a very strong position. And as you said, we sell all of our channels and all of our digital properties together under the unified direction of Linda Yaccarino, our Head of Ad Sales, which is an advantage for advertisers. But also, given our position, we tend to talk to people first, and that's exactly where we want to be. And so I think we're going into this upfront with a better upfront, a better, more unified approach and more strength than we've ever had, and we'll see how it all plays out."

Retransmission consent has been a tremendous benefit to our Broadcast business, both the retransmission we get from our own stations and the share we get from our affiliates. If you add those 2 numbers together, that was a number around 0 5 years ago, and it's a number around $800 million today, something like that. And also, on the advertising side, I think particularly that the live events, if you've got Olympics coming up for 17 days, our ratings will be higher than all 3, all -- if you add the other 3 broadcasters together, we will be a multiple of anyone else's ratings for 17 days. Imagine how valuable that is to someone who's trying to build a brand or introduce a new car, do something major in terms of changing the opinion of people in America. So broad case, it's interesting. I would not have predicted this 10 or 20 years ago, but it feels like Broadcast is getting stronger and stronger in this period. We have to keep putting good shows on, and it's tougher and tougher in a fragmented world to get a rating. But when you do, you get rewarded for it significantly."

We're off to a great start in 2016. We increased revenue and operating cash flow in the first quarter while continuing to prudently invest in the businesses to further strengthen our competitive position and drive growth.
I believe our Cable business is really differentiating itself, fostering real innovation that is translating into the strong momentum you see in these results. We're demonstrating notable improvements in customer service, investing to put the industry's fastest WiFi in homes and to be the first to bring customers widespread access to gigabit speeds through DOCSIS 3.1 technology; and with X1, delivering a platform and a breadth of content that's unrivaled.
As this quarter once again shows, our customers are responding to all of this. We increased our customer relationship growth by 36% from the first quarter of 2015 and now have achieved 50% penetration of our homes passed. We added 53,000 video customers in the quarter, making us video net add positive over the past 12 months. This important milestone has eluded us for nearly a decade, and we have now accomplished it within the context of an unprecedented pace of change in this industry, including the steady drumbeat of new competitors and new offers.
Our voice remotes are the latest example of how we are differentiating ourselves in the market. In a short period of time, we have deployed 6 million of these new remotes. Thanks to Tony Werner and his technology team's great customer experience, we're getting wonderful feedback from our customers already.
We added another 438,000 broadband subscribers in the quarter, the best first quarter we've had in 4 years. Much like our improvement in video, the progress we are making is largely a result of improvements in churn. We're upping speeds, delivering best-in-class WiFi access and investing in more ways to add value to our customers. As a result, they're staying with us longer.
Business services delivered another excellent quarter with revenue growth of nearly 18%. This growth comes with very attractive margins for us as you know. We continue to take share in small business and bring new competition and choice for midsized businesses as well as enterprise customers. Just as important as our strong service and subscriber metrics, Neil and the team are demonstrating terrific balance, driving revenue per customer relationship forward at a healthy clip, along with solid operating cash flow growth.
Over at NBCUniversal, Steve and his team delivered another strong quarter. Operating cash flow increased by 10%, benefiting from particularly strong performance in Broadcast and our recent acquisition of Universal Studios Japan. Our TV business has performed well and has had some good momentum. The advertising environment remains robust, which we believe sets up Linda Yaccarino and her team for a strong upfront. This year, we are unifying the upfront for NBC Broadcast Telemundo and Cable Networks, reflecting the way we go to market as a strong and comprehensive portfolio. We feel great about our position, which will be strengthened as we now add Thursday Night Football to go along with an already strong list of sports properties.
Speaking of strong sports properties, we recently surpassed $1 billion in national advertising sales for the Rio Olympics, achieving this milestone far earlier than the London Olympics. This is a very promising result, which reinforces our view of the attractiveness of this event.
Meanwhile, MSNBC continues its impressive performance with its best ratings in 3 years in prime time, up over 100%. Andy Lack and the news team are doing a wonderful job with the news organization, particularly through the early stages of this election cycle.
In our theme parks, we're delighted about our trajectory, the momentum that we've created and our road map with new investments and new attractions and additional hotel room capacity. Universal Studios Japan set attendance records in its just-ended fiscal year and performed well in our first full quarter of ownership. Additionally, we just launched Harry Potter at Universal Hollywood, and we expect it to follow the strong success we have seen with our other Potter attractions.
We've got a unique and wonderful set of assets which provides Comcast NBCUniversal with many opportunities. All of this will be on display this summer when we put the full weight of the company behind the Olympics. I'm amazed at what we've accomplished in a short period of time as a combined company just 5 years in, and I think we're not only 5 years wiser and stronger but really better together. We're confident we remain on the right path to creating value for our customers and shareholders, and I couldn't be more excited about our future.
Mike, over to you."

Let's go right to the first quarter on Slide 4 and cover the key financials.Overall, we delivered consolidated revenue growth of 5.3% and operating cash flow growth of 6.9% for the first quarter. At Cable, the primary drivers of",1779,"Good morning, everybody. Let's go right to the first quarter on Slide 4 and cover the key financials.
Overall, we delivered consolidated revenue growth of 5.3% and operating cash flow growth of 6.9% for the first quarter. At Cable, the primary drivers of growth were high-speed data, video and business services, while NBCUniversal's results were driven by Broadcast, Cable Networks and theme parks, which was positively impacted by the inclusion of Universal Studios Japan.
Moving down the income statement. Adjusted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.84 a share, a 6.3% increase compared to a year ago. Free cash flow was $2.8 billion in the first quarter, a decline of 11.9%, while free cash flow per share declined 8.8% to $1.14. We'll go into greater detail on these results on slides to come.
Now let's review the results of our businesses in more detail, starting with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable Communications delivered a solid first quarter. Revenue increased 6.7% to $12.2 billion dollars as we increased customer relationships and grew total revenue per customer relationship by 4% to $146 per month. We added 269,000 customer relationships, a 36% improvement in net adds compared to last year's first quarter, driven by growth in 2-product and 3-product customers and a reduction in churn across all products. In fact, video and high-speed data have each improved churn for 26 consecutive months.
High-speed internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall Cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 7.6% to $3.3 billion in the quarter, reflecting strong customer growth, customers subscribing to higher levels of service and more modest rate adjustments compared to the prior year. Customer growth was strong as we added a combined 438,000 net data customers in the quarter, which includes residential and business customers.
We continue to differentiate and improve our product by increasing our speeds on existing tiers as well as offering the fastest in-home WiFi with our advanced wireless gateways. At the end of the quarter, 77% of our residential customers received speeds of 50 megabits per second or greater and have one of our wireless gateways, both up significantly from the prior year.
Video revenue remained healthy, increasing 3.9% to $5.5 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services, including premium channels, HD DVRs and additional outlets. We added a combined 53,000 net video customers, our best first quarter result in 9 years, driven primarily by another quarter of improved churn.
We continue to make great progress rolling out X1 to new and existing customers, adding 1.1 million customers in the quarter, a 53% increase in net adds compared to last year. Nearly 35% of our total video customers have X1, which we believe is a real competitive differentiator. Coupled with the X1 technology is the breadth of content we offer customers both on-demand and with the compelling TV Everywhere offering.
On X1, 86% of subscribers are using XFINITY on-demand monthly, viewing 25 hours a month on average. And 42% of subscribers are using our mobile TV Everywhere platforms monthly, up 32% from last year, viewing 7 hours a month on average. We think this adds great utility to our video service.
Rounding out our residential products, voice revenue declined by 1.1% to $896 million in the first quarter as customer additions were offset by a modest decline in ARPU. In the first quarter, we added a combined 102,000 net Voice customers, up 33% versus a year ago.
Now let's turn to business services, which continues to deliver excellent results. Revenue increased 17.5% to $1.3 billion with the small business segment accounting for about 75% of our revenues and 60% of our growth. Revenue for the midsized business segment is growing at a faster rate than the small business segment, increasing its contribution as a percentage of total business revenue. Overall, business services has strong positive momentum and continues to represent a large and attractive growth opportunity for the company. Finally, cable advertising revenue increased 12.1% to $559 million. Excluding political revenue, our cable advertising revenue increased 7.6% in the first quarter.
Turning to Slide 6. First quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 5% to $4.9 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.1% compared to 40.7% in the first quarter of 2015, driven by higher expenses primarily related to increase in programming cost and the investments we are making to improve the customer experience.
Programming expenses grew 9.4%, reflecting programming contract renewals as well as higher retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs. As we've noted before, when we negotiate programming deals, we continue to value expanded content rights for our on-demand and TV Everywhere platforms. We continue to add more content, out-of-home rights, stacking rights and back seasons, which helps ensure we have the most compelling and competitive video product on the market.
Nonprogramming expenses increased 6.9%, reflecting our planned investment to improve the customer experience and to continue the rollout of X1. We've added technicians and service personnel, strengthened our dispatch teams and operations and invested in training, tools and technology. As a result, technical and product support costs grew 6.3% and customer service expenses increased 8%.
We continue to expect our 2016 Cable operating margin to be flat to down 50 basis points compared to 40.6% in 2015 as programming and other expense growth should be offset by modest rate adjustments, growth in high-margin businesses like high-speed data and Business Services and continued overall cost discipline.
Keep in mind, for the second quarter, we face tough comparisons to last year's hugely-successful Pacquiao versus Mayweather fight on Pay-Per-View. However, growth in high-margin political advertising revenue should provide more significant support for margin in the back half of the year.
Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. On Slide 7, you can see NBCUniversal delivered solid results in the first quarter as revenue increased 3.9% and operating cash flow increased 10%. Adjusting to include the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan in last year's results, pro forma revenue was relatively flat, and operating cash flow increased 1.8%, more than offsetting the difficult comparison to a profitable Super Bowl and our strong film results last year. This quarter's growth was driven by strong TV results fueled by higher retransmission and affiliate revenues and the underlying strength of the advertising market.
Cable Networks revenue increased 4% and operating cash flow increased 6.4% to $956 million, reflecting higher distribution revenue, strong ad revenue given the best advertising market we've seen in some time and a modest increase in programming and production costs. Distribution revenue increased 5.9%, driven by contractual rate increases and contract renewals, partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers at our Cable Networks.
Advertising revenue was flat compared to the first quarter of 2015, which included a benefit from a reduction in deferred advertising revenue. If we exclude this benefit, advertising growth would have been about 4%, driven by strong pricing, partially offset by audience rating declines at our cable networks.
At Broadcast Television, while revenue declined 7.3%, we delivered outstanding operating cash flow growth of 56.5% even with the profitable Super Bowl included in last year's results. This growth was driven by a few factors. First, the underlying strength of the advertising market. Excluding the Super Bowl, Advertising revenue increased 9.6%, reflecting strong scatter pricing as well as one additional NFL game compared to last year's first quarter. Excluding the extra NFL game, advertising growth was still up high single digits. Second, strong retransmission revenue growth was driven by recent step-ups. And last, programming and production costs were lower compared to last year, which included not only the Super Bowl but also more expensive prime time programming due to series finales.
Film revenue declined 4.3%, and operating cash flow declined 43.1% to $167 million, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year's strong film performance. Most notably, theatrical revenue declined 36.4% compared to last year's first quarter, which included the very successful Fifty Shades of Grey. In addition, home entertainment revenue declined 24.4% due to the strong performance of several releases last year, including Lucy. Partially offsetting this lower revenue was higher content licensing revenue and strong consumer products growth due to the Minions and Jurassic franchises.
Theme parks revenue increased 57.5% to $1 billion, and operating cash flow increased 53.6% to $375 million in the first quarter of 2016. On a pro forma basis, revenue increased 9.6%, and operating cash flow increased 3.3%. These results reflect the timing of spring break this year, stable guest attendance and higher per capita spending, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses, including free opening costs to support Harry Potter in Hollywood and the Flying Dinosaur in Japan.
Now let's move to Slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures increased 9.2% to $1.9 billion in the first quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 9% to $1.6 billion for the quarter, equal to 12.9% of Cable revenue versus 12.6% in the first quarter of 2015. The increase reflects a higher level of investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity and an increased investment in line extensions as well as higher spending on customer premise equipment related to the deployment of the X1 platform and wireless gateways. Also included in each of these growth rates is the continued expansion of Business Services. In 2016, we will continue to invest in each of these areas as they are driving positive results in our business. For the full year, we continue to expect capital intensity to remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%.
At NBCUniversal, first quarter capital expenditures increased 10% to $295 million, driven by the inclusion of Universal Studios Japan. We continue to expect NBCUniversal's CapEx to increase approximately 10% this year.
I'll now finish up on Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, consolidated free cash flow declined 11.9% to $2.8 billion in the first quarter, reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow, offset by increased working capital as well as higher capital expenditures and cash paid for capitalized software and other intangible assets. We are successfully executing our plans for returning capital to shareholders, including dividend payments during the quarter totaling $611 million, up 6.9%, and share repurchases of $1.25 billion in the quarter, which are tracking to our $5 billion annual target. We ended the quarter right at 2x net leverage, in line with our stated target.
That concludes our summary of the quarter. I hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our results as well as our momentum.
Now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A."

Is there anything you're thinking about to drive connects up as you think about segment in the market that maybe you guys aren't doing today?

I also think that putting the 2 together, we feel we're better together. I said that in the upfront remarks. I think almost every senior executive in the company sees a benefit from some other part of the company, in their part of the company. That is part of symphony. When I think about the Olympics, I just touched on briefly in my opening remarks, you will see XFINITY's coverage of the Olympics will be unlike any television on the X1 experience that's ever been presented to a consumer for a live sporting event. And NBC coverage itself will be unprecedented if you just go back a few years to see how much this landscape has changed. And the companies that are leaning in toward that and are well positioned, I can't think of a better company than ourselves. As to the relative value, these things evolve and go up and down in the relationship between the 2 in terms of carriage disputes and other things. They're both great businesses, and that was our fundamental premise all along. I think I first learned that being on Ted Turner's board when Comcast was purely a cable company. It's a worldwide business. It grows all in different ways, but they're in the same sort of system where together, the value tends to head in the same direction. And at any one time, one part of the ecosystem could be doing better than the other part of the ecosystem. But in the end, we're bringing great experiences to consumers. You need that content, you need innovative distribution technologies, and that's how we're running our company. I hope that's responsive to your question. Thanks for asking."

Is there a case to be made to ease off on marketing to offset the cost growth in other parts of the business if this continues and to support margins a little bit? And then second, on the opening up of the China market for film next year, how are you working toward that? Is there a real opportunity on the Universal side?"

We have a data department who -- that Ed Brassel runs that -- it's very detailed in how its segment -- the customer base audience and which segments we're going after, and we're very specific about that and go after the high-value, long CLV customers. So I think where we see the opportunity, we're going to spend the marketing dollars, and we'll continue to provide great service and manage the churn as appropriate. I think the churn is an accumulation of a lot of different things we're doing in the business -- customer experience, better product and just overall better service."

A year ago, a lot of advertisers pulled back and didn't spend as much in the upfront. I think part of the thinking was we can always spend later and there's plenty of places to spend their money on digital. I think the emotion of the market has swung pretty dramatically over the last year. I think people are -- have come to the realization that broad television reach is really important in a campaign; that digital has a place, but television has a big place. And a lot of people, I think, who did not come into the upfront market last year, paid significantly more in what has been one of the strongest scatter markets I've ever seen. So in terms of market dynamics, we're going into the upfront season, I think, with a lot of wind at our back. And my prediction is that it's going to be a strong upfront. We think we're in the pole position for that strong upfront. We represent about 20% of the eyeballs in television if you add up Broadcast and Cable. NBC is on its way to its third annual 18 to 49 victory where we're doing very well in sports and news at NBC. And then our cable channels are strong. I'm glad you pointed out Telemundo. Telemundo used to be a weak second. We're beating Univision most nights at 10:00 and have closed the gap with Univision. And I think in a number of our channels, we're still underpriced relative to people that we're beating or are close to or at least competitive to. So I think we're going to the upfront in a very strong position. And as you said, we sell all of our channels and all of our digital properties together under the unified direction of Linda Yaccarino, our Head of Ad Sales, which is an advantage for advertisers. But also, given our position, we tend to talk to people first, and that's exactly where we want to be. And so I think we're going into this upfront with a better upfront, a better, more unified approach and more strength than we've ever had, and we'll see how it all plays out."

Any color there would be great. And then for Neil, I understand there's a big cost element on the operating cost side for set-top box layered cost as truck rolls or customer care. So in a longer-term environment where set-top box possibly goes away, if that's the case, how much cost can go out from that land of vie [ph] ? That would be great to understand."

If you look at where the company was 5 years ago and where it is today, the most highly rated channels, I think, are going to be staying in the most bundles and are going to be watched by the most people, continue to be watched by the most people. And I'd put NBC obviously right at the top of that list. Retransmission consent has been a tremendous benefit to our Broadcast business, both the retransmission we get from our own stations and the share we get from our affiliates. If you add those 2 numbers together, that was a number around 0 5 years ago, and it's a number around $800 million today, something like that. And also, on the advertising side, I think particularly that the live events, if you've got Olympics coming up for 17 days, our ratings will be higher than all 3, all -- if you add the other 3 broadcasters together, we will be a multiple of anyone else's ratings for 17 days. Imagine how valuable that is to someone who's trying to build a brand or introduce a new car, do something major in terms of changing the opinion of people in America. So broad case, it's interesting. I would not have predicted this 10 or 20 years ago, but it feels like Broadcast is getting stronger and stronger in this period. We have to keep putting good shows on, and it's tougher and tougher in a fragmented world to get a rating. But when you do, you get rewarded for it significantly."

We are really pleased with the second quarter results as we continue our terrific momentum this year. We increased revenue and operating cash flow, thanks to broad-based strength across our businesses. As you",981,"Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. We are really pleased with the second quarter results as we continue our terrific momentum this year. We increased revenue and operating cash flow, thanks to broad-based strength across our businesses. As you will hear, we have many positive trends in each part of the company. 
At Cable, we achieved some of the best customer metrics in nearly a decade while posting strong operating cash flow growth. Our results this quarter provide further evidence that customers are responding favorably to many of our new initiatives. We added 115,000 customer relationships, which is more than triple the number we added in the second quarter of 2015. In what is normally a negative seasonal quarter, we lost only 4,000 video customers, the best second quarter result we have had in over 10 years. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have now added about 90,000 video customers, a remarkable improvement in the face of significant competitive and technological change and a testament to the investments we've made in our platform and breadth of content. 
X1 is now about 40% penetrated, and we have deployed the total of 8 million voice remotes. We're rolling out 800,000 new voice remotes each month, and customers love it. It's generating over 200 million commands per month. Overall, the feedback on X1 continues to be terrific, and the voice remote is driving customer satisfaction with the platform even higher. 
Next at High-Speed Internet, we added 220,000 customers, the best second quarter result in 8 years. Similar to Video, the improvement was driven by better customer retention. We started our rollout of DOCSIS 3.1 and expect this to continue to enhance the quality of our offering and, ultimately, our competitive advantage. We've been investing in improving the customer experience at every touch point, and we're very encouraged by our progress. Many of the key indicators around customer service are showing real improvement. First call resolution is at a multiyear high. Our billing and on-boarding contract rates are down significantly. Our customer satisfaction scores are up, and external indicators are pointing in the right direction as well. So all in all, another very strong quarter at Cable. 
At NBCUniversal, as expected, we had a challenging comparison in Film, but we delivered very strong performance at Broadcast and solid growth in our Theme Parks and Cable Networks. I'm pleased to report that we've now completed our most successful upfront since owning the company with a 12.5% CPM increase at NBC primetime. Overall, demand is strong across our entire portfolio. 
We've got a differentiated story versus our peers. Part of our success in leadership comes from a unified approach. We go to market as one company. Also, our big night strategy is compelling. If you aggregate big nights on TV in 2016, defined as a 10 household rating and a 5 in the 18 to 49 demo. We projected NBC will own 70% of those nights. 
We're also continuing our leading position in news. NBC Nightly News won vote total viewers and the demo for the fourth consecutive quarter. The Today Show remains #1 in demo. And Meet the Press has risen from #3 to #1 in the key demo in the past year alone. We're on track to finish #1 in Broadcast for the full year, and Cable Networks continue to benefit from a great portfolio in entertainment, sports and news. For example, we saw particular strength at MSNBC during the quarter and are proud of the 6 recent Emmy nominations for USA's Mr. Robot, including for outstanding drama series. 
At Theme Parks, the highlight during the quarter was our launch of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Hollywood, which has been a tremendous early success. Both attendance and per capita spending at the park saw significant lift, and guest satisfaction is at record levels. 
In Film, we announced our acquisition of DreamWorks in the second quarter. We look forward to welcoming the team and their wonderful creative talent to Universal and the broader Comcast family. 
Speaking of animation, the Secret Life of Pets is a huge success and another great example of what happens when we put the entire weight of the company behind an initiative. We featured pets on many different platforms across all Comcast NBCUniversal, including integration with our X1 experience. The movie opened to a record-breaking $104 million, the highest-ever opening in the U.S. for an original animated film. And importantly, we created another franchise for Chris Meledandri and elimination. 
Finally, let me just say a word about the Olympics. It's an honor to be the company that brings the Olympic Games to America. It's one of our greatest moments of pride, and the entire organization is ready to deliver the most comprehensive and technologically advanced Olympics in history. Starting next week in Rio, NBC's coverage will be unprecedented. Everything live streamed. 306 events, 11 networks, host a 1,600 [ph] hours of content. And our Emmy winning team will bring to life the stories of these remarkable athletes in a way that nobody else can. What excites me is the opportunity to marry the unique storytelling capabilities of NBC's with Comcast's world-class technology. The best way to experience Rio will be on the X1 platform. For the first time, we have built a destination that will combine live television, online streaming and on-demand content, athlete profiles and up-to-the-minute stats in one integrated NBC Olympics dashboard. It's all searchable with our X1 voice remote. We think that our viewers and customers are going to be amazed. Those 17 nights will showcase the strength of NBC, all of our cable networks and Comcast Cable working together, and we couldn't be more excited. So we've had a great first half of the year on so many fronts, and we're very excited to build on this in the second half. 
Mike, over to you."
173341,365299775,1013197,"Comcast Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody. I'm starting on Slide 4 for those following the presentation.

I'm starting on Slide 4 for those following the presentation. Our second quarter results reflect broad-based strength across our businesses, partially offset by a challenging comparison in Film where revenue declined by $915 million, and operating cash flow declined by $366 million as a result of tough comparisons to a record-breaking performance in the second quarter of 2015. Recall, last year's second quarter was driven by the tremendous success of both Furious 7 and Jurassic World. 
So including Film, you can see on Slide 4, consolidated revenue increased 2.8%, and operating cash flow grew 3% for the second quarter. Earnings per share was $0.83, a 1.2% decrease compared to a year ago, and free cash flow was $1.4 billion in the quarter, a decline of 5.4%. We will go into greater detail on these results on the slides to come. 
Now let's start with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable Communications delivered strong second quarter results. Revenue increased 6% to $12.4 billion as we increased customer relationships and grew total revenue per customer relationship by 3% to $148 per month. We added 115,000 customer relationships, an increase of 83,000 compared to last year's second quarter, with broad-based improvement and strength across our entire footprint. Growth in 2-product and 3-product customers and a reduction in churn across all products drove the improvement. In fact, we have improved churn in Video and High-Speed Data for 29 consecutive months as customers increasingly recognize the value of our X1 platform and superior High-Speed Data product, and we make meaningful strides in improving customer service. 
High-Speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall Cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 8.6% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, reflecting strong customer growth, customers subscribing to higher levels of service and rate adjustments, which were more modest compared to the prior year. Our customer momentum continued as we added a combined 220,000 residential and business customers in the quarter, up 22% over last year's net adds and added 1.4 million combined customers over the past 12 months. We continued to gain market share and benefit from growth in the overall market as customers respond to our product differentiation. At the end of the quarter, 79% of our residential customers received speeds of 50 megabits per second or greater compared to 69% in the prior year. 
Video revenue increased 2.8% to $5.6 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services, including premium channels, HD DVR and additional outlets. Our rate of growth was impacted by the challenging comparison to the hugely successful Pacquiao versus Mayweather fight on Pay-Per-View in last year second quarter. Our rate adjustments are primarily from Broadcast TV and our RSN fees, which, as we will as discuss in Programming expenses, are the most significant sources of our cost pressure. 
In terms of volume, our total video customer base has grown modestly year-over-year as we have consistently improved our video customer metrics for several quarters. In a quarter that's typically seasonally weak, we lost a combined 4,000 net video customers, an improvement of 64,000 versus the year-ago quarter, and as Brian noted, making it our best second quarter result in over 10 years. The improvement continues to be driven primarily by improved churn. 
Our X1 platform is proving to be a real competitive differentiator, and we continue to make good progress, growing it out to up 855,000 net new and existing customers this quarter with nearly 40% of our total video customers now having X1. In addition to great technology, we coupled this with a breadth of content available On Demand and with a compelling TV Everywhere offering. Our customers are responding to these choices. On X1, 85% of our subscribers are using XFINITY On Demand monthly, viewing 29 hours a month on average. And 42% of our subscribers are using our TV Everywhere platforms monthly, up 17% from last year, viewing 10 hours a month on average. We think this adds great utility to our video service. 
Rounding out our Residential products. Voice revenue declined by 1.1% to $893 million in the second quarter as customers combine the net additions of 64,000 were offset by a modest decline in ARPU, reflecting our usual revenue allocations within our multiproduct packages. 
Let's now turn to Business Services, which continues to deliver excellent results. Revenue increased 17% to $1.4 billion, with the small business segment accounting for about 75% of our revenue and 60% of our growth. Revenue for the midsized business segment continues to grow at an attractive rate, and its contribution as a percentage of total business revenue is increasing. Overall, Business Services had strong positive momentum and continues to represent a large and attractive growth opportunity for the company. 
Cable Advertising revenue increased to 3.5% to $597 million, reflecting higher political revenue as we continue to benefit from advertising for the upcoming elections. Excluding the political contribution, our Cable Advertising revenue increased 1.1%, reflecting slower growth across core categories and the timing of media spending. Despite the slowdown in core local advertising, we expect Advertising revenue growth to ramp in the second half of this year, again driven by political revenue from the upcoming elections. 
Turning to Slide 6. Second quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased to 5.7% to $5 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.6%, relatively consistent with the second quarter of 2015. Programming expenses grew 7.4%. However, excluding the impact of the Pay-Per-View fees associated with the fight in last year second quarter, Programming expense growth would have been 9.4%. This growth reflects programming contract renewals, higher retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs. We continue to expect approximately 10% growth in programming costs for 2016 as growth ramps in the second half of the year, driven by upcoming contract renewals. 
Nonprogramming expenses increased 5.5%, reflecting our planned investment to improve the customer experience and to continue the rollout of X1. We've added technicians and service personnel, strengthened our dispatch teams and operations and invested in training, tools and technology. As a result, technical and product support and customer service cost each increased 6%. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow increased 5.3% to $9.9 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.3%, down 40 basis points compared to the same period in 2015. As a reminder, earlier this year, we provided full year guidance for our 2016 Cable operating margin to be flat to down 50 basis points compared to 40.6% in 2015, and that guidance is unchanged. 
Now let's move onto NBCUniversal's results. On Slide 7, you can see NBCUniversal delivered strong results in our TV and Theme Park businesses, offset by the challenging Film comparison. Revenue declined 1.8%, and operating cash flow remained stable at $1.7 billion. Adjusting to include the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan in last year's results, pro forma revenue decreased 5.1%, and operating cash flow decreased 6.4%. Cable Networks revenue increased 4.7%, and operating cash flow increased 8.3% to $944 million, reflecting higher distribution and content licensing and other revenue as well as lower advertising, marketing and promotion expenses, partially offset by an increase in programming and production costs. Distribution revenue increased 6.9%, driven by contractual rate increases and contract renewals, partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers at our Cable Networks. Advertising revenue was flat compared to the second quarter of 2015, reflecting strong pricing, offset by audience ratings decline at our Cable Networks. 
Broadcast Television had another strong quarter with revenue growth of 17.3% and operating cash flow growth of 70.5% to $394 million. This increase reflects higher content licensing, retransmission and advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming and production spending. Content licensing increased 59.9%, primarily due to the availability of content in our current SVOD deals. Distribution and other revenue growth of 35% was driven by 63% increase in retransmission revenue. Last, Advertising revenue increased a healthy 2.9%, reflecting a strong scatter market, partially offset by a challenging comparison in sports advertising due to less favorable NHL playoff matchups and the absence of a Triple Crown contender. 
Film revenue declined 40.4%, and operating cash flow declined 86.7% to $56 million, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year's Film performance. Most notably, theatrical revenue declined 78.8% compared to last year second quarter, which included the strong performances of Furious 7 and Jurassic World. In addition, home entertainment revenue declined 25.1% due to the strong performance of several releases last year, including Fifty Shades of Grey. Partially offsetting this lower revenue was higher content licensing revenue due to several of last year's theatrical releases like Minions and Jurassic World now in the pay-TV window. 
Theme Parks revenue increased 47% to $1.1 billion, and operating cash flow increased to 40.5% to $469 million in the second quarter of 2016. On a pro forma basis, revenue increased 10.6%, and operating cash flow increased 5.3%. These results were driven by higher per capita spending at the parks and the successful opening of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood. Partially offsetting these results with the timing of spring break, which was more concentrated in the first quarter this year and pre-opening cost ahead of the new King Kong attraction this summer in Orlando. 
Let's move on to Slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures increased to 15.2% to $2.3 billion in the second quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 12% to $1.9 billion for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis have increased 10.6% to $3.5 billion, representing capital intensity of 14% compared to 13.5% for the first half of 2015. The higher spending reflects increased investment in line extensions and the higher level of investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity. Our investment in our network helps enhance our competitive position in broadband while staying ahead of rapid growth and bandwidth consumption by our customers. We believe we have and will continue to monetize these investments effectively through subscriber growth and rate adjustments. In addition, our higher capital expenditures reflect spending on customer premise equipment related to the deployment of our Wireless Gateways and the X1 platform. We continue to expect that for the full year of 2016, our Cable capital intensity will remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%. 
At NBCUniversal, capital expenditures increased 32.4% to $360 million in the second quarter and increased 21.3% to $655 million on a year-to-date basis, driven by the inclusion of a full quarter of Universal Studios Japan. We continue to expect NBCUniversal's CapEx to increase approximately 10% this year. 
I'll now finish up my Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, consolidated free cash flow declined 5.4% to $1.4 billion in the second quarter, reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow, offset by higher capital expenditures. For the first half of the year, we generated $4.2 billion in free cash flow, a decrease of 9.8% over the first half of 2015. This decline reflects growth in consolidated operating cash flow, offset by increased working capital as well as higher capital expenditures and cash paid for capitalized software and other intangible assets. In addition to investing in the business, we are also successfully executing our plan for returning capital to shareholders. Dividend payments during the quarter were $670 million, up 6.6%, and share repurchases were $1.1 billion, consistent with our plan to repurchase $5 billion of our common stock during the full year.

Brian, the industry has a long history of collaboration that's been a big part of the success, think about cable adds, et cetera. Now wondering in the context of all the big changes in ownership outside of Comcast and when you look at how much more software driven the business is becoming, you look at how much more streaming is happening around the country and things of the OTT. Do you see either an opportunity or a need for greater collaboration throughout the cable industry going forward and something that you might think would actually impact your business and make what you offer the consumer even more powerful? And then I'll just ask my follow-up to Steve. Steve, you got a huge content licensing quarter this quarter. And I'm just wondering in that context, can you talk about your philosophy on SVOD licensing, particularly as we head towards this Hulu bundle, which we don't know what it looks like. There's a lot of talk about kind of cutting back on licensing to folks like Netflix and putting more products inside the bundle.

As it relates to the new OTT entrants, I think the key there is going to be making sure that we're in every bundle, and I think we're going to be. We have more channels and more eyeballs than anyone else, and we're pretty much essential to those bundles. And then as they go out, making sure that they're incremental, that they're not cannibalistic, wholly cannibalistic. I believe the vast majority of OTT subscribers will be incremental.

We also have had a monetization gap on the affiliate side, which is the gap between the retrans or the affiliate fees that we received and some of the situated channels. At the time we did the deal, the monetization gap was about 20% on ad sales. we closed the majority of that gap, and the biggest progress we made in any single upfront was a progress we just made. A few years ago, we put all our channels to get. We have previously sold Cable separately from Broadcast, and sports separately from prime time and news. We put everything together so now if you want to buy from any part of the company, we have a discussion about every part of the company, and that, because we're the largest provider of television advertising in the country, people come to us first. So for the last couple of fronts, we've really led the discussions and led the sort of negotiations and price setting of the entire market. Bryan mentioned it in his overview, but we've got 12.5% increases on and NBC Entertainment, but we also got 13% on U.S.A. We got 12% on Bravo -- on E!. We got 10% on Bravo. And overall, Cable was up double digits, and Broadcast was up double digits. So we had a wonderful upfront. I think in some instances, we might be a few percentage points ahead of similarly situated networks this year, but we think we deserve that and we still have the gap that we are trying to close. It's hard to make progress that's much more material than a few percentage points, but I think we certainly made it this year. And we're also taking advantage of the fact that it's a strong advertising market both in scatter and upfront pricing. And I think big advertisers realize that digital is an important part of the mix. But a few of the major product launch, you really, really have to look big events on Broadcast and Cable television that can provide the kind of reach and sort of depth that you get. Think of what someone gets when they advertise in the Olympics. We have 3x the combined ratings on any given night during the Olympics of ABC, CBS and FOX. So that kind of appeal if you're marketing an automobile or a beer or a car, I mean, it's just a tremendous value proposition, and we're happy to have it and we made real progress this year."

We have national advertising, which what I was just referring to. We have a lot of Advertising in our own stations. We get paid in affiliate fee by cable and satellite and telco operators, then we have a very big digital business. All of those businesses look terrific. And the way the Olympics work, you have a sufficient make good to cover any rating shortfall, which we hope and think there won't be. But even if there was a significant shortfall, we would just make good during the Olympics. So we're looking, I think, at a very profitable Olympics. We made $120 million or thereabouts in London, and we're going to make a lot more than that in Rio. so we're looking forward to that.

Last year, we made call it $170 million in China from movies and television. That number is going to grow substantially in the future. We have existing deals and new deals, and we're getting better and better at bringing our products to China. And then in 2020, we're projecting to open a theme park in Beijing, which we're very bullish about. We have not signed all the documents, but we've had countless meetings. By the way, our first meeting about Beijing happened something like 12 years ago, so this has been going on a long, long time.

173341,365299775,1013530,"Comcast Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. We are really pleased with the second quarter results as we continue our terrific momentum this year. We increased revenue and operating cash flow, thanks to broad-based strength across our businesses. As you",982,"Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. We are really pleased with the second quarter results as we continue our terrific momentum this year. We increased revenue and operating cash flow, thanks to broad-based strength across our businesses. As you will hear, we have many positive trends in each part of the company.
At Cable, we achieved some of the best customer metrics in nearly a decade while posting strong operating cash flow growth. Our results this quarter provide further evidence that customers are responding favorably to many of our new initiatives. We added 115,000 customer relationships, which is more than triple the number we added in the second quarter of 2015. In what is normally a negative seasonal quarter, we lost only 4,000 video customers, the best second quarter result we have had in over 10 years. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have now added about 90,000 video customers, a remarkable improvement in the face of significant competitive and technological change and a testament to the investments we've made in our platform and breadth of content.
X1 is now about 40% penetrated, and we have deployed a total of 8 million voice remotes. We're rolling out 800,000 new voice remotes each month, and customers love it. It's generating over 200 million commands per month. Overall, the feedback on X1 continues to be terrific, and the voice remote is driving customer satisfaction with the platform even higher.
Next at High-Speed Internet, we added 220,000 customers, the best second quarter result in 8 years. Similar to Video, the improvement was driven by better customer retention. We started our rollout of DOCSIS 3.1 and expect this to continue to enhance the quality of our offering and, ultimately, our competitive advantage.
We've been investing in improving the customer experience at every touch point, and we're very encouraged by our progress. Many of the key indicators around customer service are showing real improvement. First call resolution is at a multiyear high. Our billing and on-boarding contact rates are down significantly. Our customer satisfaction scores are up, and external indicators are pointing in the right direction as well. So all in all, another very strong quarter at Cable.
At NBCUniversal, as expected, we had a challenging comparison in Film, but we delivered very strong performance at Broadcast and solid growth in our Theme Parks and Cable Networks. I'm pleased to report that we've now completed our most successful upfront since owning the company with a 12.5% CPM increase at NBC prime time. Overall, demand is strong across our entire portfolio.
We've got a differentiated story versus our peers. Part of our success in leadership comes from a unified approach. We go to market as one company. Also, our big night strategy is compelling. If you aggregate big nights on TV in 2016, defined as a 10 household rating and a 5 in the 18 to 49 demo. We projected NBC will own 70% of those nights.
We're also continuing our leading position in news. NBC Nightly News won both, total viewers and the demo, for the fourth consecutive quarter. The Today Show remains #1 in demo. And Meet the Press has risen from #3 to #1 in the key demo in the past year alone. We're on track to finish #1 in Broadcast for the full year, and Cable Networks continue to benefit from a great portfolio in entertainment, sports and news. For example, we saw particular strength at MSNBC during the quarter and are proud of the 6 recent Emmy nominations for USA's Mr. Robot, including for outstanding drama series.
At Theme Parks, the highlight during the quarter was our launch of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Hollywood, which has been a tremendous early success. Both attendance and per capita spending at the park saw significant lift, and guest satisfaction is at record levels.
In Film, we announced our acquisition of DreamWorks in the second quarter. We look forward to welcoming the team and their wonderful creative talent to Universal and the broader Comcast family.
Speaking of animation, the Secret Life of Pets is a huge success and another great example of what happens when we put the entire weight of the company behind an initiative. We featured pets on many different platforms across all of Comcast NBCUniversal, including integration with our X1 experience. The movie opened to a record-breaking $104 million, the highest-ever opening in the U.S. for an original animated film. And importantly, we created another franchise for Chris Meledandri and Illumination.
Finally, let me just say a word about the Olympics. It's an honor to be the company that brings the Olympic Games to America. It's one of our greatest moments of pride, and the entire organization is ready to deliver the most comprehensive and technologically advanced Olympics in history. Starting next week in Rio, NBC's coverage will be unprecedented. Everything live streamed. 306 events, 11 networks, host a 6,800 hours of content. And our Emmy winning team will bring to life the stories of these remarkable athletes in a way that nobody else can. What excites me is the opportunity to marry the unique storytelling capabilities of NBC's with Comcast's world-class technology. The best way to experience Rio will be on the X1 platform. For the first time, we have built a destination that will combine live television, online streaming and on-demand content, athlete profiles and up-to-the-minute stats in one integrated NBC Olympics dashboard. It's all searchable with our X1 voice remote. We think that our viewers and customers are going to be amazed. Those 17 nights will showcase the strength of NBC, all of our cable networks and Comcast Cable working together, and we couldn't be more excited. So we've had a great first half of the year on so many fronts, and we're very excited to build on this in the second half.
Mike, over to you."
173341,365299775,1013530,"Comcast Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody. I'm starting on Slide 4 for those following the presentation.

I'm starting on Slide 4 for those following the presentation. Our second quarter results reflect broad-based strength across our businesses, partially offset by a challenging comparison in Film where revenue declined by $915 million, and operating cash flow declined by $366 million as a result of tough comparisons to a record-breaking performance in the second quarter of 2015. Recall, last year's second quarter was driven by the tremendous success of both Furious 7 and Jurassic World.
So including Film, you can see on Slide 4, consolidated revenue increased 2.8%, and operating cash flow grew 3% for the second quarter. Earnings per share was $0.83, a 1.2% decrease compared to a year ago, and free cash flow was $1.4 billion in the quarter, a decline of 5.4%. We will go into greater detail on these results on the slides to come.
Now let's start with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable Communications delivered strong second quarter results. Revenue increased 6% to $12.4 billion as we increased customer relationships and grew total revenue per customer relationship by 3% to $148 per month. We added 115,000 customer relationships, an increase of 83,000 compared to last year's second quarter, with broad-based improvement and strength across our entire footprint. Growth in 2-product and 3-product customers and a reduction in churn across all products drove the improvement. In fact, we have improved churn in Video and High-Speed Data for 29 consecutive months as customers increasingly recognize the value of our X1 platform and superior High-Speed Data product, and we make meaningful strides in improving customer service.
High-Speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall Cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 8.6% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, reflecting strong customer growth, customers subscribing to higher levels of service and rate adjustments, which were more modest compared to the prior year. Our customer momentum continued as we added a combined 220,000 residential and business customers in the quarter, up 22% over last year's net adds and added 1.4 million combined customers over the past 12 months. We continued to gain market share and benefit from growth in the overall market as customers respond to our product differentiation. At the end of the quarter, 79% of our residential customers received speeds of 50 megabits per second or greater compared to 69% in the prior year.
Video revenue increased 2.8% to $5.6 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services, including premium channels, HD DVR and additional outlets. Our rate of growth was impacted by the challenging comparison to the hugely successful Pacquiao versus Mayweather fight on Pay-Per-View in last year second quarter. Our rate adjustments are primarily from Broadcast TV and RSN fees, which, as we will as discuss in programming expenses, are the most significant sources of our cost pressure.
In terms of volume, our total video customer base has grown modestly year-over-year as we have consistently improved our video customer metrics for several quarters. In a quarter that's typically seasonally weak, we lost a combined 4,000 net video customers, an improvement of 64,000 versus the year-ago quarter. And as Brian noted, making this our best second quarter result in over 10 years. The improvement continues to be driven primarily by improved churn.
Our X1 platform is proving to be a real competitive differentiator, and we continue to make good progress, rolling it out to 855,000 net new and existing customers this quarter, with nearly 40% of our total video customers now having X1. In addition to great technology, we coupled this with a breadth of content available On Demand and with a compelling TV Everywhere offering. Our customers are responding to these choices. On X1, 85% of our subscribers are using XFINITY On Demand monthly, viewing 29 hours a month on average. And 42% of our subscribers are using our TV Everywhere platforms monthly, up 17% from last year, viewing 10 hours a month on average. We think this adds great utility to our video service.
Rounding out our Residential products. Voice revenue declined by 1.1% to $893 million in the second quarter as customer combined the net additions of 64,000 were offset by a modest decline in ARPU, reflecting our usual revenue allocations within our multiproduct packages.
Let's now turn to Business Services, which continues to deliver excellent results. Revenue increased 17% to $1.4 billion, with the small business segment accounting for about 75% of our revenue and 60% of our growth. Revenue for the midsized business segment continues to grow at an attractive rate, and its contribution as a percentage of total business revenue is increasing. Overall, Business Services had strong positive momentum and continues to represent a large and attractive growth opportunity for the company.
Cable Advertising revenue increased 3.5% to $597 million, reflecting higher political revenue as we continue to benefit from advertising for the upcoming elections. Excluding the political contribution, our Cable Advertising revenue increased 1.1%, reflecting slower growth across core categories and the timing of media spending. Despite the slowdown in core local advertising, we expect Advertising revenue growth to ramp in the second half of this year, again driven by political revenue from the upcoming elections.
Turning to Slide 6. Second quarter Cable Communications. The operating cash flow increased to 5.7% to $5 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.6%, relatively consistent with the second quarter of 2015. Programming expenses grew 7.4%. However, excluding the impact of the Pay-Per-View fees associated with the fight in last year second quarter, Programming expense growth would have been 9.4%. This growth reflects programming contract renewals, higher retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs. We continue to expect approximately 10% growth in programming costs for 2016 as growth ramps in the second half of the year, driven by upcoming contract renewals.
Nonprogramming expenses increased 5.5%, reflecting our planned investment to improve the customer experience and to continue the rollout of X1. We've added technicians and service personnel, strengthened our dispatch teams and operations and invested in training, tools and technology. As a result, technical and product support and customer service costs, each increased 6%. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow increased 5.3% to $9.9 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.3%, down 40 basis points compared to the same period in 2015. As a reminder, earlier this year, we provided full year guidance for our 2016 Cable operating margin to be flat to down 50 basis points compared to 40.6% in 2015, and that guidance is unchanged.
Now let's move onto NBCUniversal's results. On Slide 7, you can see NBCUniversal delivered strong results in our TV and Theme Park businesses, offset by the challenging Filmed comparison. Revenue declined 1.8%, and operating cash flow remained stable at $1.7 billion. Adjusting to include the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan in last year's results, pro forma revenue decreased 5.1%, and operating cash flow decreased 6.4%. Cable Networks revenue increased 4.7%, and operating cash flow increased 8.3% to $944 million, reflecting higher distribution and content licensing and other revenue as well as lower advertising, marketing and promotion expenses, partially offset by an increase in programming and production costs.
Distribution revenue increased 6.9%, driven by contractual rate increases and contract renewals, partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers at our Cable Networks. Advertising revenue was flat compared to the second quarter of 2015, reflecting strong pricing, offset by audience ratings decline at our Cable Networks.
Broadcast Television had another strong quarter with revenue growth of 17.3% and operating cash flow growth of 70.5% to $394 million. This increase reflects higher content licensing, retransmission and advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming and production spending. Content licensing increased 59.9%, primarily due to the availability of content in our current SVOD deals. Distribution and other revenue growth of 35% was driven by 63% increase in retransmission revenue. Last, Advertising revenue increased a healthy 2.9%, reflecting a strong scattered market, partially offset by a challenging comparison in sports advertising due to less favorable NHL playoff matchups and the absence of a Triple Crown contender.
Film revenue declined 40.4%, and operating cash flow declined 86.7% to $56 million, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year's Film performance. Most notably, theatrical revenue declined 78.8% compared to last year second quarter, which included the strong performances of Furious 7 and Jurassic World.
In addition, home entertainment revenue declined 25.1% due to the strong performance of several releases last year, including Fifty Shades of Grey. Partially offsetting this lower revenue was higher content licensing revenue due to several of last year's theatrical releases like Minions and Jurassic World now in the pay-TV window.
Theme Parks revenue increased 47% to $1.1 billion, and operating cash flow increased to 40.5% to $469 million in the second quarter of 2016. On a pro forma basis, revenue increased 10.6%, and operating cash flow increased 5.3%. These results were driven by higher per capita spending at the parks and the successful opening of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood. Partially offsetting these results was the timing of spring break, which was more concentrated in the first quarter this year and pre-opening cost ahead of the new King Kong attraction this summer in Orlando.
Let's move on to Slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures increased to 15.2% to $2.3 billion in the second quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 12% to $1.9 billion for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis have increased 10.6% to $3.5 billion, representing capital intensity of 14% compared to 13.5% for the first half of 2015. The higher spending reflects increased investment in line extensions and a higher level of investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity. Our investment in our network helps to enhance our competitive position in broadband while staying ahead of rapid growth and bandwidth consumption by our customers. We believe we have and will continue to monetize these investments effectively through subscriber growth and rate adjustments. In addition, our higher capital expenditures reflect spending on customer premise equipment related to the deployment of our Wireless Gateways and the X1 platform. We continue to expect that for the full year of 2016, our Cable capital intensity will remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%.
At NBCUniversal, capital expenditures increased 32.4% to $360 million in the second quarter and increased 21.3% to $655 million on a year-to-date basis, driven by the inclusion of a full quarter of Universal Studios Japan. We continue to expect NBCUniversal's CapEx to increase approximately 10% this year.
I'll now finish up on Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, consolidated free cash flow declined 5.4% to $1.4 billion in the second quarter, reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow, offset by higher capital expenditures. For the first half of the year, we generated $4.2 billion in free cash flow, a decrease of 9.8% over the first half of 2015. This decline reflects growth in consolidated operating cash flow, offset by increased working capital as well as higher capital expenditures and cash paid for capitalized software and other intangible assets. In addition to investing in the business, we are also successfully executing our plan for returning capital to shareholders. Dividend payments during the quarter were $670 million, up 6.6%, and share repurchases were $1.1 billion, consistent with our plan to repurchase $5 billion of our common stock during the full year. In addition, we ended the quarter right at 2.0x net leverage, in line with our stated target.
That concludes our summary of the quarter. I hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our results as well as our momentum going into the second half of the year.
Now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A."

Brian, the industry has a long history of collaboration that's been a big part of the success, if you think about cable labs, et cetera. Wondering in the context of all the big changes in ownership outside of Comcast, and when you look at how much more software driven the business is becoming, you look at how much more streaming is happening around the country and things from the OTT. Do you see either an opportunity or a need for greater collaboration throughout the cable industry going forward and you -- something that you think might actually impact your business or and make what you offer the consumer even more powerful? And then I'll just ask my follow-up to Steve. Steve, you got a huge content licensing quarter this quarter. And I'm just wondering in that context, can you talk about your philosophy on SVOD licensing, particularly as we head towards this Hulu bundle, which, well, we don't know what it looks like. There's a lot of talk about kind of cutting back on licensing to folks like Netflix and putting more products inside the bundle.

We've run the business being very careful about Windows and being very careful about the way -- various ways that we make money. And we've essentially licensed to everybody that you would expect us to license to. As it relates to the new OTT entrants, I think the key there is going to be making sure that we're in every bundle, and I think we're going to be. We have more channels and more eyeballs than anyone else, and we're pretty much essential to those bundles. And then as they go out, making sure that they're incremental, that they're not cannibalistic, wholly cannibalistic. I believe the vast majority of OTT subscribers will be incremental. We'll be going after people who currently are not part of the ecosystem and, therefore, will be additive to NBCUniversal and all of Comcast NBCUniversal as well."

As we look at things like Business Services and advanced advertising, one of the reasons we were happy to see some of the other consolidation that took place earlier in the year and has been happening is to enable that collaboration.

OTT economics are unproven to us and out of footprint, it's not clear that, that's the right strategy for us. So we're about a business model where we're able to grow the customer base, have customers that have multiple products, really high value and ever-reducing churn, and innovative new products that bolt on. And it's not clear how you do that where you don't have a network. But we're innovating all the time, and we're happy with the strategy we have."

We also have had a monetization gap on the affiliate side, which is the gap between the retrans or the affiliate fees that we received and similarly situated channels. At the time we did the deal, the monetization gap was about 20% on ad sales. We've closed the majority of that gap, and the biggest progress we made in any single upfront was a progress we just made. A few years ago, we put all our channels together. We have previously sold Cable separately from Broadcast, and sports separately from prime time and news. We put everything together so now if you want to buy from any part of the company, we have a discussion about every part of the company, and that, because we're the largest provider of television advertising in the country, people come to us first. So for the last couple of fronts, we've really led the discussions and led the sort of negotiations and price setting of the entire market. Bryan mentioned it in his overview, but we've got 12.5% increases on NBC Entertainment, but we also got 13% on U.S.A. We got 12% on Bravo -- on E!. We got 10% on Bravo. And overall, Cable was up double digits, and Broadcast was up double digits. So we had a wonderful upfront. I think in some instances, we might be a few percentage points ahead of similarly situated networks this year, but we think we deserve that and we still have the gap that we're trying to close. It's hard to make progress that's much more material than a few percentage points, but I think we certainly made it this year. And we're also taking advantage of the fact that it's a strong advertising market both in scatter and upfront pricing. And I think big advertisers realize that digital is an important part of the mix. But if you have a major product launch, you really, really have to look at big events on Broadcast and Cable television that can provide the kind of reach and sort of depth that you get. Think of what someone gets when they advertise in the Olympics. We have 3x the combined ratings on any given night during the Olympics of ABC, CBS and FOX. So that kind of appeal if you're marketing a automobile or a beer or a car, I mean, it's just a tremendous value proposition, and we're happy to have it. And we made real progress this year."

So for first time since we've been here, we hit our Advertising budget for the Olympics 3 weeks before the start of the Olympics. Normally, we would hit the budget right about the time the Olympic started or shortly thereafter. And our budget was about a 20% increase from London, so we're very, very happy with how we're doing in terms of Olympic sales. We might make money a lot of different ways in the Olympics. We have national advertising, which is what I was just referring to. We also have a lot of Advertising in our own stations. We get paid in affiliate fee by cable and satellite and telco operators, then we have a very big digital business. All of those businesses look terrific. And the way the Olympics work, you have a sufficient make good to cover any rating shortfall, which we hope and think there won't be. But even if there was a significant shortfall, we would just make good during the Olympics. So we're looking, I think, at a very profitable Olympics. We made $120 million or thereabouts in London, and we're going to make a lot more than that in Rio. So we're looking forward to that. China, Brian and I were in China 2 weeks ago, and we are very, very bullish on our business there as our most people doing business in China. Our -- NBCUniversal made essentially nothing in China 4 years ago, I'm talking movies, television, consumer products and theme parks. Last year, we made, call it, $170 million in China from movies and television. That number is going to grow substantially in the future. We have existing deals and new deals, and we're getting better and better at bringing our products to China. And then in 2020, we're projecting to open a theme park in Beijing, which we're very bullish about. We have not signed all the documents, but we've had countless meetings. By the way, our first meeting about Beijing happened something like 12 years ago, so this has been going on a long, long time. But we're essentially -- we're in schematic drawings we've had countless discussions on. We have all the attractions laid out. I mean, we're really in production mode. And I think when you look forward to 2020, combination of movies and television and theme parks, China is going to be a very, very substantial profit generator for our company."

Given the agreement for Netflix to be integrated with X1, the Comcast Cable is giving its customers better access tune, ad-free viewing option relative to an ad-supported VOD option on cable. Are you concerned that, that integration could have an impact on ratings and potentially ad revenue at NBCU and other cable TV programmers in the industry? And then second question for Neil. I just wanted to get your thoughts on the value of premium pay-TV networks to your video platform given that they're going direct-to-consumer increasingly. So for example, how does HBO GO into direct-to-consumer with HBO NOW, change your approach to marketing? Does it change the value of HBO to your video customers? Or do you look at it as an opportunity on the broadband side?"

And whatever Netflix is doing to viewing habits, I think a lot of that is already done and it's going to change the title come in and go out. But I think the fact that Neil is putting on a set-top box, it's a great idea. It's very customer-focused. It's going to make Comcast an easier place to view, particularly with X1, easier place to view all the options in video. And I think it's a very smart strategy for Comcast, and I think to the degree the MVPD ecosystem stay strong, that's good for NBCUniversal. Our relationship with Netflix has never been better. They're huge purchaser of our content. We talk to them all the time. So my prediction is, it'll be a quite a good thing for Comcast Cable, and it'll be a good thing for NBCUniversal."

But I think the Advertising market is very, very strong. And some of that is reflected in the upfront. In terms of volume in the upfront, I think we could have sold a lot more than we sold in the upfront. We sold about 10% more volume on the Broadcast side, about 5% overall. We turned away a lot of volume. We're working on mix on the Cable side to try to get higher, more profitable advertising into our mix in some of our cable channels.

We are really pleased with the second quarter results as we continue our terrific momentum this year. We increased revenue and operating cash flow, thanks to broad-based strength across our businesses. As you",982,"Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. We are really pleased with the second quarter results as we continue our terrific momentum this year. We increased revenue and operating cash flow, thanks to broad-based strength across our businesses. As you will hear, we have many positive trends in each part of the company.
At Cable, we achieved some of the best customer metrics in nearly a decade while posting strong operating cash flow growth. Our results this quarter provide further evidence that customers are responding favorably to many of our new initiatives. We added 115,000 customer relationships, which is more than triple the number we added in the second quarter of 2015. In what is normally a negative seasonal quarter, we lost only 4,000 video customers, the best second quarter result we have had in over 10 years. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have now added about 90,000 video customers, a remarkable improvement in the face of significant competitive and technological change and a testament to the investments we've made in our platform and breadth of content.
X1 is now about 40% penetrated, and we have deployed a total of 8 million voice remotes. We're rolling out 800,000 new voice remotes each month, and customers love it. It's generating over 200 million commands per month. Overall, the feedback on X1 continues to be terrific, and the voice remote is driving customer satisfaction with the platform even higher.
Next at High-Speed Internet, we added 220,000 customers, the best second quarter result in 8 years. Similar to Video, the improvement was driven by better customer retention. We started our rollout of DOCSIS 3.1 and expect this to continue to enhance the quality of our offering and, ultimately, our competitive advantage.
We've been investing in improving the customer experience at every touch point, and we're very encouraged by our progress. Many of the key indicators around customer service are showing real improvement. First call resolution is at a multiyear high. Our billing and on-boarding contact rates are down significantly. Our customer satisfaction scores are up, and external indicators are pointing in the right direction as well. So all in all, another very strong quarter at Cable.
At NBCUniversal, as expected, we had a challenging comparison in Film, but we delivered very strong performance at Broadcast and solid growth in our Theme Parks and Cable Networks. I'm pleased to report that we've now completed our most successful upfront since owning the company with a 12.5% CPM increase at NBC prime time. Overall, demand is strong across our entire portfolio.
We've got a differentiated story versus our peers. Part of our success in leadership comes from a unified approach. We go to market as one company. Also, our big night strategy is compelling. If you aggregate big nights on TV in 2016, defined as a 10 household rating and a 5 in the 18 to 49 demo. We projected NBC will own 70% of those nights.
We're also continuing our leading position in news. NBC Nightly News won both, total viewers and the demo, for the fourth consecutive quarter. The Today Show remains #1 in demo. And Meet the Press has risen from #3 to #1 in the key demo in the past year alone. We're on track to finish #1 in Broadcast for the full year, and Cable Networks continue to benefit from a great portfolio in entertainment, sports and news. For example, we saw particular strength at MSNBC during the quarter and are proud of the 6 recent Emmy nominations for USA's Mr. Robot, including for outstanding drama series.
At Theme Parks, the highlight during the quarter was our launch of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Hollywood, which has been a tremendous early success. Both attendance and per capita spending at the park saw significant lift, and guest satisfaction is at record levels.
In Film, we announced our acquisition of DreamWorks in the second quarter. We look forward to welcoming the team and their wonderful creative talent to Universal and the broader Comcast family.
Speaking of animation, the Secret Life of Pets is a huge success and another great example of what happens when we put the entire weight of the company behind an initiative. We featured pets on many different platforms across all of Comcast NBCUniversal, including integration with our X1 experience. The movie opened to a record-breaking $104 million, the highest-ever opening in the U.S. for an original animated film. And importantly, we created another franchise for Chris Meledandri and Illumination.
Finally, let me just say a word about the Olympics. It's an honor to be the company that brings the Olympic Games to America. It's one of our greatest moments of pride, and the entire organization is ready to deliver the most comprehensive and technologically advanced Olympics in history. Starting next week in Rio, NBC's coverage will be unprecedented. Everything live streamed. 306 events, 11 networks, host a 6,800 hours of content. And our Emmy winning team will bring to life the stories of these remarkable athletes in a way that nobody else can. What excites me is the opportunity to marry the unique storytelling capabilities of NBC's with Comcast's world-class technology. The best way to experience Rio will be on the X1 platform. For the first time, we have built a destination that will combine live television, online streaming and on-demand content, athlete profiles and up-to-the-minute stats in one integrated NBC Olympics dashboard. It's all searchable with our X1 voice remote. We think that our viewers and customers are going to be amazed. Those 17 nights will showcase the strength of NBC, all of our cable networks and Comcast Cable working together, and we couldn't be more excited. So we've had a great first half of the year on so many fronts, and we're very excited to build on this in the second half.
Mike, over to you."
173341,365299775,1013547,"Comcast Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody. I'm starting on Slide 4 for those following the presentation.

I'm starting on Slide 4 for those following the presentation. Our second quarter results reflect broad-based strength across our businesses, partially offset by a challenging comparison in Film where revenue declined by $915 million, and operating cash flow declined by $366 million as a result of tough comparisons to a record-breaking performance in the second quarter of 2015. Recall, last year's second quarter was driven by the tremendous success of both Furious 7 and Jurassic World.
So including Film, you can see on Slide 4, consolidated revenue increased 2.8%, and operating cash flow grew 3% for the second quarter. Earnings per share was $0.83, a 1.2% decrease compared to a year ago, and free cash flow was $1.4 billion in the quarter, a decline of 5.4%. We will go into greater detail on these results on the slides to come.
Now let's start with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable Communications delivered strong second quarter results. Revenue increased 6% to $12.4 billion as we increased customer relationships and grew total revenue per customer relationship by 3% to $148 per month. We added 115,000 customer relationships, an increase of 83,000 compared to last year's second quarter, with broad-based improvement and strength across our entire footprint. Growth in 2-product and 3-product customers and a reduction in churn across all products drove the improvement. In fact, we have improved churn in Video and High-Speed Data for 29 consecutive months as customers increasingly recognize the value of our X1 platform and superior High-Speed Data product, and we make meaningful strides in improving customer service.
High-Speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall Cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 8.6% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, reflecting strong customer growth, customers subscribing to higher levels of service and rate adjustments, which were more modest compared to the prior year. Our customer momentum continued as we added a combined 220,000 residential and business customers in the quarter, up 22% over last year's net adds and added 1.4 million combined customers over the past 12 months. We continued to gain market share and benefit from growth in the overall market as customers respond to our product differentiation. At the end of the quarter, 79% of our residential customers received speeds of 50 megabits per second or greater compared to 69% in the prior year.
Video revenue increased 2.8% to $5.6 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services, including premium channels, HD DVR and additional outlets. Our rate of growth was impacted by the challenging comparison to the hugely successful Pacquiao versus Mayweather fight on Pay-Per-View in last year second quarter. Our rate adjustments are primarily from Broadcast TV and RSN fees, which, as we will as discuss in programming expenses, are the most significant sources of our cost pressure.
In terms of volume, our total video customer base has grown modestly year-over-year as we have consistently improved our video customer metrics for several quarters. In a quarter that's typically seasonally weak, we lost a combined 4,000 net video customers, an improvement of 64,000 versus the year-ago quarter. And as Brian noted, making this our best second quarter result in over 10 years. The improvement continues to be driven primarily by improved churn.
Our X1 platform is proving to be a real competitive differentiator, and we continue to make good progress, rolling it out to 855,000 net new and existing customers this quarter, with nearly 40% of our total video customers now having X1. In addition to great technology, we coupled this with a breadth of content available On Demand and with a compelling TV Everywhere offering. Our customers are responding to these choices. On X1, 85% of our subscribers are using XFINITY On Demand monthly, viewing 29 hours a month on average. And 42% of our subscribers are using our TV Everywhere platforms monthly, up 17% from last year, viewing 10 hours a month on average. We think this adds great utility to our video service.
Rounding out our Residential products. Voice revenue declined by 1.1% to $893 million in the second quarter as customer combined the net additions of 64,000 were offset by a modest decline in ARPU, reflecting our usual revenue allocations within our multiproduct packages.
Let's now turn to Business Services, which continues to deliver excellent results. Revenue increased 17% to $1.4 billion, with the small business segment accounting for about 75% of our revenue and 60% of our growth. Revenue for the midsized business segment continues to grow at an attractive rate, and its contribution as a percentage of total business revenue is increasing. Overall, Business Services had strong positive momentum and continues to represent a large and attractive growth opportunity for the company.
Cable Advertising revenue increased 3.5% to $597 million, reflecting higher political revenue as we continue to benefit from advertising for the upcoming elections. Excluding the political contribution, our Cable Advertising revenue increased 1.1%, reflecting slower growth across core categories and the timing of media spending. Despite the slowdown in core local advertising, we expect Advertising revenue growth to ramp in the second half of this year, again driven by political revenue from the upcoming elections.
Turning to Slide 6. Second quarter Cable Communications. The operating cash flow increased to 5.7% to $5 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.6%, relatively consistent with the second quarter of 2015. Programming expenses grew 7.4%. However, excluding the impact of the Pay-Per-View fees associated with the fight in last year second quarter, Programming expense growth would have been 9.4%. This growth reflects programming contract renewals, higher retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs. We continue to expect approximately 10% growth in programming costs for 2016 as growth ramps in the second half of the year, driven by upcoming contract renewals.
Nonprogramming expenses increased 5.5%, reflecting our planned investment to improve the customer experience and to continue the rollout of X1. We've added technicians and service personnel, strengthened our dispatch teams and operations and invested in training, tools and technology. As a result, technical and product support and customer service costs, each increased 6%. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow increased 5.3% to $9.9 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.3%, down 40 basis points compared to the same period in 2015. As a reminder, earlier this year, we provided full year guidance for our 2016 Cable operating margin to be flat to down 50 basis points compared to 40.6% in 2015, and that guidance is unchanged.
Now let's move onto NBCUniversal's results. On Slide 7, you can see NBCUniversal delivered strong results in our TV and Theme Park businesses, offset by the challenging Filmed comparison. Revenue declined 1.8%, and operating cash flow remained stable at $1.7 billion. Adjusting to include the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan in last year's results, pro forma revenue decreased 5.1%, and operating cash flow decreased 6.4%. Cable Networks revenue increased 4.7%, and operating cash flow increased 8.3% to $944 million, reflecting higher distribution and content licensing and other revenue as well as lower advertising, marketing and promotion expenses, partially offset by an increase in programming and production costs.
Distribution revenue increased 6.9%, driven by contractual rate increases and contract renewals, partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers at our Cable Networks. Advertising revenue was flat compared to the second quarter of 2015, reflecting strong pricing, offset by audience ratings decline at our Cable Networks.
Broadcast Television had another strong quarter with revenue growth of 17.3% and operating cash flow growth of 70.5% to $394 million. This increase reflects higher content licensing, retransmission and advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming and production spending. Content licensing increased 59.9%, primarily due to the availability of content in our current SVOD deals. Distribution and other revenue growth of 35% was driven by 63% increase in retransmission revenue. Last, Advertising revenue increased a healthy 2.9%, reflecting a strong scattered market, partially offset by a challenging comparison in sports advertising due to less favorable NHL playoff matchups and the absence of a Triple Crown contender.
Film revenue declined 40.4%, and operating cash flow declined 86.7% to $56 million, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year's Film performance. Most notably, theatrical revenue declined 78.8% compared to last year second quarter, which included the strong performances of Furious 7 and Jurassic World.
In addition, home entertainment revenue declined 25.1% due to the strong performance of several releases last year, including Fifty Shades of Grey. Partially offsetting this lower revenue was higher content licensing revenue due to several of last year's theatrical releases like Minions and Jurassic World now in the pay-TV window.
Theme Parks revenue increased 47% to $1.1 billion, and operating cash flow increased to 40.5% to $469 million in the second quarter of 2016. On a pro forma basis, revenue increased 10.6%, and operating cash flow increased 5.3%. These results were driven by higher per capita spending at the parks and the successful opening of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood. Partially offsetting these results was the timing of spring break, which was more concentrated in the first quarter this year and pre-opening cost ahead of the new King Kong attraction this summer in Orlando.
Let's move on to Slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures increased to 15.2% to $2.3 billion in the second quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 12% to $1.9 billion for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis have increased 10.6% to $3.5 billion, representing capital intensity of 14% compared to 13.5% for the first half of 2015. The higher spending reflects increased investment in line extensions and a higher level of investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity. Our investment in our network helps to enhance our competitive position in broadband while staying ahead of rapid growth and bandwidth consumption by our customers. We believe we have and will continue to monetize these investments effectively through subscriber growth and rate adjustments. In addition, our higher capital expenditures reflect spending on customer premise equipment related to the deployment of our Wireless Gateways and the X1 platform. We continue to expect that for the full year of 2016, our Cable capital intensity will remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%.
At NBCUniversal, capital expenditures increased 32.4% to $360 million in the second quarter and increased 21.3% to $655 million on a year-to-date basis, driven by the inclusion of a full quarter of Universal Studios Japan. We continue to expect NBCUniversal's CapEx to increase approximately 10% this year.
I'll now finish up on Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, consolidated free cash flow declined 5.4% to $1.4 billion in the second quarter, reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow, offset by higher capital expenditures. For the first half of the year, we generated $4.2 billion in free cash flow, a decrease of 9.8% over the first half of 2015. This decline reflects growth in consolidated operating cash flow, offset by increased working capital as well as higher capital expenditures and cash paid for capitalized software and other intangible assets. In addition to investing in the business, we are also successfully executing our plan for returning capital to shareholders. Dividend payments during the quarter were $670 million, up 6.6%, and share repurchases were $1.1 billion, consistent with our plan to repurchase $5 billion of our common stock during the full year. In addition, we ended the quarter right at 2.0x net leverage, in line with our stated target.
That concludes our summary of the quarter. I hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our results as well as our momentum going into the second half of the year.
Now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A."

Brian, the industry has a long history of collaboration that's been a big part of the success, if you think about cable labs, et cetera. Wondering in the context of all the big changes in ownership outside of Comcast, and when you look at how much more software driven the business is becoming, you look at how much more streaming is happening around the country and things from the OTT. Do you see either an opportunity or a need for greater collaboration throughout the cable industry going forward and you -- something that you think might actually impact your business or and make what you offer the consumer even more powerful? And then I'll just ask my follow-up to Steve. Steve, you got a huge content licensing quarter this quarter. And I'm just wondering in that context, can you talk about your philosophy on SVOD licensing, particularly as we head towards this Hulu bundle, which, well, we don't know what it looks like.

We've run the business being very careful about Windows and being very careful about the way -- various ways that we make money. And we've essentially licensed to everybody that you would expect us to license to. As it relates to the new OTT entrants, I think the key there is going to be making sure that we're in every bundle, and I think we're going to be. We have more channels and more eyeballs than anyone else, and we're pretty much essential to those bundles. And then as they go out, making sure that they're incremental, that they're not cannibalistic, wholly cannibalistic. I believe the vast majority of OTT subscribers will be incremental. We'll be going after people who currently are not part of the ecosystem and, therefore, will be additive to NBCUniversal and all of Comcast NBCUniversal as well."

As we look at things like Business Services and advanced advertising, one of the reasons we were happy to see some of the other consolidation that took place earlier in the year and has been happening is to enable that collaboration. And I think it also extends to programmers and operators trying to find ways to use this new technology to give more value to the consumer.

We also have had a monetization gap on the affiliate side, which is the gap between the retrans or the affiliate fees that we received and similarly situated channels. At the time we did the deal, the monetization gap was about 20% on ad sales. We've closed the majority of that gap, and the biggest progress we made in any single upfront was a progress we just made. A few years ago, we put all our channels together. We have previously sold Cable separately from Broadcast, and sports separately from prime time and news. We put everything together so now if you want to buy from any part of the company, we have a discussion about every part of the company, and that, because we're the largest provider of television advertising in the country, people come to us first. So for the last couple of fronts, we've really led the discussions and led the sort of negotiations and price setting of the entire market.

I think in some instances, we might be a few percentage points ahead of similarly situated networks this year, but we think we deserve that and we still have the gap that we're trying to close. It's hard to make progress that's much more material than a few percentage points, but I think we certainly made it this year. And we're also taking advantage of the fact that it's a strong advertising market both in scatter and upfront pricing. And I think big advertisers realize that digital is an important part of the mix. But if you have a major product launch, you really, really have to look at big events on Broadcast and Cable television that can provide the kind of reach and sort of depth that you get. Think of what someone gets when they advertise in the Olympics. We have 3x the combined ratings on any given night during the Olympics of ABC, CBS and FOX. So that kind of appeal if you're marketing a automobile or a beer or a car, I mean, it's just a tremendous value proposition, and we're happy to have it. And we made real progress this year."

So for first time since we've been here, we hit our Advertising budget for the Olympics 3 weeks before the start of the Olympics. Normally, we would hit the budget right about the time the Olympic started or shortly thereafter. And our budget was about a 20% increase from London, so we're very, very happy with how we're doing in terms of Olympic sales. We might make money a lot of different ways in the Olympics. We have national advertising, which is what I was just referring to. We also have a lot of Advertising in our own stations. We get paid in affiliate fee by cable and satellite and telco operators, then we have a very big digital business. All of those businesses look terrific. And the way the Olympics work, you have a sufficient make good to cover any rating shortfall, which we hope and think there won't be. But even if there was a significant shortfall, we would just make good during the Olympics. So we're looking, I think, at a very profitable Olympics. We made $120 million or thereabouts in London, and we're going to make a lot more than that in Rio. So we're looking forward to that. China, Brian and I were in China 2 weeks ago, and we are very, very bullish on our business there as our most people doing business in China. Our -- NBCUniversal made essentially nothing in China 4 years ago, I'm talking movies, television, consumer products and theme parks. Last year, we made, call it, $170 million in China from movies and television. That number is going to grow substantially in the future. We have existing deals and new deals, and we're getting better and better at bringing our products to China. And then in 2020, we're projecting to open a theme park in Beijing, which we're very bullish about. We have not signed all the documents, but we've had countless meetings. By the way, our first meeting about Beijing happened something like 12 years ago, so this has been going on a long, long time. But we're essentially -- we're in schematic drawings we've had countless discussions on. We have all the attractions laid out. I mean, we're really in production mode. And I think when you look forward to 2020, combination of movies and television and theme parks, China is going to be a very, very substantial profit generator for our company."

We are really pleased with the second quarter results as we continue our terrific momentum this year. We increased revenue and operating cash flow, thanks to broad-based strength across our businesses. As you",983,"Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. We are really pleased with the second quarter results as we continue our terrific momentum this year. We increased revenue and operating cash flow, thanks to broad-based strength across our businesses. As you will hear, we have many positive trends in each part of the company.
At Cable, we achieved some of the best customer metrics in nearly a decade while posting strong operating cash flow growth. Our results this quarter provide further evidence that customers are responding favorably to many of our new initiatives. We added 115,000 customer relationships, which is more than triple the number we added in the second quarter of 2015. In what is normally a negative seasonal quarter, we lost only 4,000 video customers, the best second quarter result we have had in over 10 years. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have now added about 90,000 video customers, a remarkable improvement in the face of significant competitive and technological change and a testament to the investments we've made in our platform and breadth of content.
X1 is now about 40% penetrated, and we have deployed a total of 8 million voice remotes. We're rolling out 800,000 new voice remotes each month, and customers love it. It's generating over 200 million commands per month. Overall, the feedback on X1 continues to be terrific, and the voice remote is driving customer satisfaction with the platform even higher.
Next at High-Speed Internet, we added 220,000 customers, the best second quarter result in 8 years. Similar to Video, the improvement was driven by better customer retention. We started our rollout of DOCSIS 3.1 and expect this to continue to enhance the quality of our offering and, ultimately, our competitive advantage.
We've been investing in improving the customer experience at every touch point, and we're very encouraged by our progress. Many of the key indicators around customer service are showing real improvement. First call resolution is at a multiyear high. Our billing and on-boarding contact rates are down significantly. Our customer satisfaction scores are up, and external indicators are pointing in the right direction as well. So all in all, another very strong quarter at Cable.
At NBCUniversal, as expected, we had a challenging comparison in Film, but we delivered very strong performance at Broadcast and solid growth in our Theme Parks and Cable Networks. I'm pleased to report that we've now completed our most successful upfront since owning the company with a 12.5% CPM increase at NBC prime time. Overall, demand is strong across our entire portfolio.
We've got a differentiated story versus our peers. Part of our success in leadership comes from a unified approach. We go to market as one company. Also, our big night strategy is compelling. If you aggregate big nights on TV in 2016, defined as a 10 household rating and a 5 in the 18 to 49 demo. We project that NBC will own 70% of those nights.
We're also continuing our leading position in news. NBC Nightly News won both, total viewers and the demo, for the fourth consecutive quarter. The Today Show remains #1 in demo. And Meet the Press has risen from #3 to #1 in the key demo in the past year alone. We're on track to finish #1 in Broadcast for the full year, and Cable Networks continue to benefit from a great portfolio in entertainment, sports and news. For example, we saw particular strength at MSNBC during the quarter and are proud of the 6 recent Emmy nominations for USA's Mr. Robot, including for outstanding drama series.
At Theme Parks, the highlight during the quarter was our launch of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Hollywood, which has been a tremendous early success. Both attendance and per capita spending at the park saw significant lift, and guest satisfaction is at record levels.
In Film, we announced our acquisition of DreamWorks in the second quarter. We look forward to welcoming the team and their wonderful creative talent to Universal and the broader Comcast family.
Speaking of animation, the Secret Life of Pets is a huge success and another great example of what happens when we put the entire weight of the company behind an initiative. We featured Pets on many different platforms across all of Comcast NBCUniversal, including integration with our X1 experience. The movie opened to a record-breaking $104 million, the highest-ever opening in the U.S. for an original animated film. And importantly, we created another franchise for Chris Meledandri and Illumination.
Finally, let me just say a word about the Olympics. It's an honor to be the company that brings the Olympic Games to America. It's one of our greatest moments of pride, and the entire organization is ready to deliver the most comprehensive and technologically advanced Olympics in history. Starting next week in Rio, NBC's coverage will be unprecedented. Everything live streamed. 306 events, 11 networks, close to 6,800 hours of content. And our Emmy winning team will bring to life the stories of these remarkable athletes in a way that nobody else can. What excites me is the opportunity to marry the unique storytelling capabilities of NBC with Comcast's world-class technology. The best way to experience Rio will be on the X1 platform. For the first time, we have built a destination that will combine live television, online streaming and on-demand content, athlete profiles and up-to-the-minute stats in one integrated NBC Olympics dashboard that's all searchable with our X1 voice remote. We think that our viewers and customers are going to be amazed. Those 17 nights will showcase the strength of NBC, all of our cable networks and Comcast Cable working together, and we couldn't be more excited. So we've had a great first half of the year on so many fronts, and we're very excited to build on this in the second half.
Mike, over to you."
173341,365299775,1014001,"Comcast Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 27, 2016",2016-07-27,"Earnings Calls","Comcast Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody. I'm starting on Slide 4 for those following the presentation.

I'm starting on Slide 4 for those following the presentation. Our second quarter results reflect broad-based strength across our businesses, partially offset by a challenging comparison in Film where revenue declined by $915 million, and operating cash flow declined by $366 million as a result of tough comparisons to a record-breaking performance in the second quarter of 2015. Recall, last year's second quarter was driven by the tremendous success of both Furious 7 and Jurassic World.
So including Film, you can see on Slide 4, consolidated revenue increased 2.8%, and operating cash flow grew 3% for the second quarter. Earnings per share was $0.83, a 1.2% decrease compared to a year ago, and free cash flow was $1.4 billion in the quarter, a decline of 5.4%. We will go into greater detail on these results on the slides to come.
Now let's start with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable Communications delivered strong second quarter results. Revenue increased 6% to $12.4 billion as we increased customer relationships and grew total revenue per customer relationship by 3% to $148 per month. We added 115,000 customer relationships, an increase of 83,000 compared to last year's second quarter, with broad-based improvement and strength across our entire footprint. 
Growth in 2-product and 3-product customers and a reduction in churn across all products drove the improvement. In fact, we have improved churn in Video and High-Speed Data for 29 consecutive months as customers increasingly recognize the value of our X1 platform and superior High-Speed Data product, and we make meaningful strides in improving customer service.
High-Speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall Cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 8.6% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, reflecting strong customer growth, customers subscribing to higher levels of service and rate adjustments, which were more modest compared to the prior year. Our customer momentum continued as we added a combined 220,000 residential and business customers in the quarter, up 22% over last year's net adds and added 1.4 million combined customers over the past 12 months. We continued to gain market share and benefit from growth in the overall market as customers respond to our product differentiation. At the end of the quarter, 79% of our residential customers received speeds of 50 megabits per second or greater compared to 69% in the prior year.
Video revenue increased 2.8% to $5.6 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services, including premium channels, HD DVR and additional outlets. Our rate of growth was impacted by the challenging comparison to the hugely successful Pacquiao versus Mayweather fight on Pay-Per-View in last year second quarter. Our rate adjustments are primarily from Broadcast TV and RSN fees, which, as we will as discuss in programming expenses, are the most significant sources of our cost pressure.
In terms of volume, our total video customer base has grown modestly year-over-year as we have consistently improved our video customer metrics for several quarters. In a quarter that's typically seasonally weak, we lost a combined 4,000 net video customers, an improvement of 64,000 versus the year-ago quarter. And as Brian noted, making this our best second quarter result in over 10 years. The improvement continues to be driven primarily by improved churn.
Our X1 platform is proving to be a real competitive differentiator, and we continue to make good progress, rolling it out to 855,000 net new and existing customers this quarter, with nearly 40% of our total video customers now having X1. In addition to great technology, we coupled this with a breadth of content available On Demand and with a compelling TV Everywhere offering. Our customers are responding to these choices. On X1, 85% of our subscribers are using XFINITY On Demand monthly, viewing 29 hours a month on average. And 42% of our subscribers are using our TV Everywhere platforms monthly, up 17% from last year, viewing 10 hours a month on average. We think this adds great utility to our video service.
Rounding out our Residential products. Voice revenue declined by 1.1% to $893 million in the second quarter as customer combined the net additions of 64,000 were offset by a modest decline in ARPU, reflecting our usual revenue allocations within our multiproduct packages.
Let's now turn to Business Services, which continues to deliver excellent results. Revenue increased 17% to $1.4 billion, with the small business segment accounting for about 75% of our revenue and 60% of our growth. Revenue for the midsized business segment continues to grow at an attractive rate, and its contribution as a percentage of total business revenue is increasing. Overall, Business Services had strong positive momentum and continues to represent a large and attractive growth opportunity for the company.
Cable Advertising revenue increased 3.5% to $597 million, reflecting higher political revenue as we continue to benefit from advertising for the upcoming elections. Excluding the political contribution, our Cable Advertising revenue increased 1.1%, reflecting slower growth across core categories and the timing of media spending. Despite the slowdown in core local advertising, we expect Advertising revenue growth to ramp in the second half of this year, again driven by political revenue from the upcoming elections.
Turning to Slide 6. Second quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased to 5.7% to $5 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.6%, relatively consistent with the second quarter of 2015. Programming expenses grew 7.4%. However, excluding the impact of the Pay-Per-View fees associated with the fight in last year second quarter, Programming expense growth would have been 9.4%. This growth reflects programming contract renewals, higher retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs. We continue to expect approximately 10% growth in programming costs for 2016 as growth ramps in the second half of the year, driven by upcoming contract renewals.
Nonprogramming expenses increased 5.5%, reflecting our planned investment to improve the customer experience and to continue the rollout of X1. We've added technicians and service personnel, strengthened our dispatch teams and operations and invested in training, tools and technology. As a result, technical and product support and customer service costs, each increased 6%. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow increased 5.3% to $9.9 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.3%, down 40 basis points compared to the same period in 2015. As a reminder, earlier this year, we provided full year guidance for our 2016 Cable operating margin to be flat to down 50 basis points compared to 40.6% in 2015, and that guidance is unchanged.
Now let's move onto NBCUniversal's results. On Slide 7, you can see NBCUniversal delivered strong results in our TV and Theme Park businesses, offset by the challenging Filmed comparison. Revenue declined 1.8%, and operating cash flow remained stable at $1.7 billion. Adjusting to include the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan in last year's results, pro forma revenue decreased 5.1%, and operating cash flow decreased 6.4%. Cable Networks revenue increased 4.7%, and operating cash flow increased 8.3% to $944 million, reflecting higher distribution and content licensing and other revenue as well as lower advertising, marketing and promotion expenses, partially offset by an increase in programming and production costs.
Distribution revenue increased 6.9%, driven by contractual rate increases and contract renewals, partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers at our Cable Networks. Advertising revenue was flat compared to the second quarter of 2015, reflecting strong pricing, offset by audience ratings decline at our Cable Networks.
Broadcast Television had another strong quarter with revenue growth of 17.3% and operating cash flow growth of 70.5% to $394 million. This increase reflects higher content licensing, retransmission and advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming and production spending. Content licensing increased 59.9%, primarily due to the availability of content in our current SVOD deals. Distribution and other revenue growth of 35% was driven by 63% increase in retransmission revenue. Last, Advertising revenue increased a healthy 2.9%, reflecting a strong scatter market, partially offset by a challenging comparison in sports advertising due to less favorable NHL playoff matchups and the absence of a Triple Crown contender.
Film revenue declined 40.4%, and operating cash flow declined 86.7% to $56 million, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year's Film performance. Most notably, theatrical revenue declined 78.8% compared to last year second quarter, which included the strong performances of Furious 7 and Jurassic World.
In addition, home entertainment revenue declined 25.1% due to the strong performance of several releases last year, including Fifty Shades of Grey. Partially offsetting this lower revenue was higher content licensing revenue due to several of last year's theatrical releases like Minions and Jurassic World now in the pay-TV window.
Theme Parks revenue increased 47% to $1.1 billion, and operating cash flow increased to 40.5% to $469 million in the second quarter of 2016. On a pro forma basis, revenue increased 10.6%, and operating cash flow increased 5.3%. These results were driven by higher per capita spending at the parks and the successful opening of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood. Partially offsetting these results was the timing of spring break, which was more concentrated in the first quarter this year and pre-opening cost ahead of the new King Kong attraction this summer in Orlando.
Let's move on to Slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures increased 15.2% to $2.3 billion in the second quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 12% to $1.9 billion for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis have increased 10.6% to $3.5 billion, representing capital intensity of 14% compared to 13.5% for the first half of 2015. The higher spending reflects increased investment in line extensions and a higher level of investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity. Our investment in our network helps enhance our competitive position in broadband while staying ahead of rapid growth and bandwidth consumption by our customers. 
We believe we have and will continue to monetize these investments effectively through subscriber growth and rate adjustments. In addition, our higher capital expenditures reflect spending on customer premise equipment related to the deployment of our Wireless Gateways and the X1 platform. We continue to expect that for the full year of 2016, our Cable capital intensity will remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%.
At NBCUniversal, capital expenditures increased 32.4% to $360 million in the second quarter and increased 21.3% to $655 million on a year-to-date basis, driven by the inclusion of a full quarter of Universal Studios Japan. We continue to expect NBCUniversal's CapEx to increase approximately 10% this year.
I'll now finish up on Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, consolidated free cash flow declined 5.4% to $1.4 billion in the second quarter, reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow, offset by higher capital expenditures. For the first half of the year, we generated $4.2 billion in free cash flow, a decrease of 9.8% over the first half of 2015. This decline reflects growth in consolidated operating cash flow, offset by increased working capital as well as higher capital expenditures and cash paid for capitalized software and other intangible assets. In addition to investing in the business, we are also successfully executing our plan for returning capital to shareholders. Dividend payments during the quarter were $670 million, up 6.6%, and share repurchases were $1.1 billion, consistent with our plan to repurchase $5 billion of our common stock during the full year. In addition, we ended the quarter right at 2.0x net leverage, in line with our stated target.
That concludes our summary of the quarter. I hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our results as well as our momentum going into the second half of the year.
Now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A."

We have more channels and more eyeballs than anyone else, and we're pretty much essential to those bundles.

We also have had a monetization gap on the affiliate side, which is the gap between the retrans or the affiliate fees that we received and similarly situated channels. At the time we did the deal, the monetization gap was about 20% on ad sales. We've closed the majority of that gap, and the biggest progress we made in any single upfront was a progress we just made. A few years ago, we put all our channels together. We have previously sold Cable separately from Broadcast, and sports separately from prime time and news. We put everything together so now if you want to buy from any part of the company, we have a discussion about every part of the company, and that, because we're the largest provider of television advertising in the country, people come to us first. So for the last couple of fronts, we've really led the discussions and led the sort of negotiations and price setting of the entire market. Bryan mentioned it in his overview, but we've got 12.5% increases on NBC Entertainment, but we also got 13% on U.S.A. We got 12% on Bravo -- on E!. We got 10% on Bravo. And overall, Cable was up double digits, and Broadcast was up double digits. So we had a wonderful upfront. I think in some instances, we might be a few percentage points ahead of similarly situated networks this year, but we think we deserve that and we still have the gap that we're trying to close. It's hard to make progress that's much more material than a few percentage points, but I think we certainly made it this year. And we're also taking advantage of the fact that it's a strong advertising market both in scatter and upfront pricing. And I think big advertisers realize that digital is an important part of the mix. But if you have a major product launch, you really, really have to look at big events on Broadcast and Cable television that can provide the kind of reach and sort of depth that you get. Think of what someone gets when they advertise in the Olympics. We have 3x the combined ratings on any given night during the Olympics of ABC, CBS and FOX. So that kind of appeal if you're marketing an automobile or a beer or a car, I mean, it's just a tremendous value proposition, and we're happy to have it. And we made real progress this year."

So for first time since we've been here, we hit our Advertising budget for the Olympics 3 weeks before the start of the Olympics. Normally, we would hit the budget right about the time the Olympic started or shortly thereafter. And our budget was about a 20% increase from London, so we're very, very happy with how we're doing in terms of Olympic sales. We might make money a lot of different ways in the Olympics. We have national advertising, which is what I was just referring to. We also have a lot of Advertising in our own stations. We get paid in affiliate fee by cable and satellite and telco operators, then we have a very big digital business. All of those businesses look terrific. And the way the Olympics work, you have a sufficient make good to cover any rating shortfall, which we hope and think there won't be. But even if there was a significant shortfall, we would just make good during the Olympics. So we're looking, I think, at a very profitable Olympics. We made $120 million or thereabouts in London, and we're going to make a lot more than that in Rio. So we're looking forward to that. China, Brian and I were in China 2 weeks ago, and we are very, very bullish on our business there as our most people doing business in China. Our -- NBCUniversal made essentially nothing in China 4 years ago, I'm talking movies, television, consumer products and theme parks. Last year, we made, call it, $170 million in China from movies and television. That number is going to grow substantially in the future. We have existing deals and new deals, and we're getting better and better at bringing our products to China. And then in 2020, we're projecting to open a theme park in Beijing, which we're very bullish about. We have not signed all the documents, but we've had countless meetings. By the way, our first meeting about Beijing happened something like 12 years ago, so this has been going on a long, long time. But we're essentially -- we're in schematic drawings we've had countless discussions on. We have all the attractions laid out. I mean, we're really in production mode.

Normally, when you do these reallocations, they're not all that negative for the content owner because you can take some of the programming and fees and ad sales and move them, consolidate them on some of your bigger networks. The good news for us, really, and you're seeing this with OTT is, if you have NBC, you really need to be in a bundle. If you have USA, it really needs to be in a bundle. If you have Syfy or Bravo or E!, those are big, substantial networks that are in the bundle. And when you really look at our Cable Networks, we make most of our money in those big channels, and we've trimmed. And I think you'll see us and others continue to trim some of the more marginal channels. There's just too many channels, and people are spending too much programming channels that are not fully distributed. You'd much rather put your money in have Mr. Robot on USA. and have The Voice Blindspot on NBC and really go with your strong networks."

I just wanted to get your thoughts on the value of premium pay-TV networks to your video platform given that they're going direct-to-consumer increasingly.

But I think the fact that Neil is putting on a set-top box, it's a great idea. It's very customer-focused. It's going to make Comcast an easier place to view, particularly with X1, easier place to view all the options in video.

We are really pleased with the second quarter results as we continue our terrific momentum this year. We increased revenue and operating cash flow, thanks to broad-based strength across our businesses. As you",983,"Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. We are really pleased with the second quarter results as we continue our terrific momentum this year. We increased revenue and operating cash flow, thanks to broad-based strength across our businesses. As you will hear, we have many positive trends in each part of the company.
At Cable, we achieved some of the best customer metrics in nearly a decade while posting strong operating cash flow growth. Our results this quarter provide further evidence that customers are responding favorably to many of our new initiatives. We added 115,000 customer relationships, which is more than triple the number we added in the second quarter of 2015. In what is normally a negative seasonal quarter, we lost only 4,000 video customers, the best second quarter result we have had in over 10 years. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have now added about 90,000 video customers, a remarkable improvement in the face of significant competitive and technological change and a testament to the investments we've made in our platform and breadth of content.
X1 is now about 40% penetrated, and we have deployed a total of 8 million voice remotes. We're rolling out 800,000 new voice remotes each month, and customers love it. It's generating over 200 million commands per month. Overall, the feedback on X1 continues to be terrific, and the voice remote is driving customer satisfaction with the platform even higher.
Next at High-Speed Internet, we added 220,000 customers, the best second quarter result in 8 years. Similar to Video, the improvement was driven by better customer retention. We started our rollout of DOCSIS 3.1 and expect this to continue to enhance the quality of our offering and, ultimately, our competitive advantage.
We've been investing in improving the customer experience at every touch point, and we're very encouraged by our progress. Many of the key indicators around customer service are showing real improvement. First call resolution is at a multiyear high. Our billing and on-boarding contact rates are down significantly. Our customer satisfaction scores are up, and external indicators are pointing in the right direction as well. So all in all, another very strong quarter at Cable.
At NBCUniversal, as expected, we had a challenging comparison in Film, but we delivered very strong performance at Broadcast and solid growth in our Theme Parks and Cable Networks. I'm pleased to report that we've now completed our most successful upfront since owning the company with a 12.5% CPM increase at NBC prime time. Overall, demand is strong across our entire portfolio.
We've got a differentiated story versus our peers. Part of our success in leadership comes from a unified approach. We go to market as one company. Also, our big night strategy is compelling. If you aggregate big nights on TV in 2016, defined as a 10 household rating and a 5 in the 18 to 49 demo. We project that NBC will own 70% of those nights.
We're also continuing our leading position in news. NBC Nightly News won both, total viewers and the demo, for the fourth consecutive quarter. The Today Show remains #1 in demo. And Meet the Press has risen from #3 to #1 in the key demo in the past year alone. We're on track to finish #1 in Broadcast for the full year, and Cable Networks continue to benefit from a great portfolio in entertainment, sports and news. For example, we saw particular strength at MSNBC during the quarter and are proud of the 6 recent Emmy nominations for USA's Mr. Robot, including for outstanding drama series.
At Theme Parks, the highlight during the quarter was our launch of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Hollywood, which has been a tremendous early success. Both attendance and per capita spending at the park saw significant lift, and guest satisfaction is at record levels.
In Film, we announced our acquisition of DreamWorks in the second quarter. We look forward to welcoming the team and their wonderful creative talent to Universal and the broader Comcast family.
Speaking of animation, the Secret Life of Pets is a huge success and another great example of what happens when we put the entire weight of the company behind an initiative. We featured Pets on many different platforms across all of Comcast NBCUniversal, including integration with our X1 experience. The movie opened to a record-breaking $104 million, the highest-ever opening in the U.S. for an original animated film. And importantly, we created another franchise for Chris Meledandri and Illumination.
Finally, let me just say a word about the Olympics. It's an honor to be the company that brings the Olympic Games to America. It's one of our greatest moments of pride, and the entire organization is ready to deliver the most comprehensive and technologically advanced Olympics in history. Starting next week in Rio, NBC's coverage will be unprecedented. Everything live streamed. 306 events, 11 networks, close to 6,800 hours of content. And our Emmy winning team will bring to life the stories of these remarkable athletes in a way that nobody else can. What excites me is the opportunity to marry the unique storytelling capabilities of NBC with Comcast's world-class technology. The best way to experience Rio will be on the X1 platform. For the first time, we have built a destination that will combine live television, online streaming and on-demand content, athlete profiles and up-to-the-minute stats in one integrated NBC Olympics dashboard that's all searchable with our X1 voice remote. We think that our viewers and customers are going to be amazed. Those 17 nights will showcase the strength of NBC, all of our cable networks and Comcast Cable working together, and we couldn't be more excited. So we've had a great first half of the year on so many fronts, and we're very excited to build on this in the second half.
Mike, over to you."

I'm starting on Slide 4 for those following the presentation. Our second quarter results reflect broad-based strength across our businesses, partially offset by a challenging comparison in Film where revenue declined by $915 million, and operating cash flow declined by $366 million as a result of tough comparisons to a record-breaking performance in the second quarter of 2015.

Earnings per share was $0.83, a 1.2% decrease compared to a year ago, and free cash flow was $1.4 billion in the quarter, a decline of 5.4%. We will go into greater detail on these results on the slides to come.
Now let's start with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable Communications delivered strong second quarter results. Revenue increased 6% to $12.4 billion as we increased customer relationships and grew total revenue per customer relationship by 3% to $148 per month. We added 115,000 customer relationships, an increase of 83,000 compared to last year's second quarter, with broad-based improvement and strength across our entire footprint. 
Growth in 2-product and 3-product customers and a reduction in churn across all products drove the improvement. In fact, we have improved churn in Video and High-Speed Data for 29 consecutive months as customers increasingly recognize the value of our X1 platform and superior High-Speed Data product, and we make meaningful strides in improving customer service.
High-Speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall Cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 8.6% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, reflecting strong customer growth, customers subscribing to higher levels of service and rate adjustments, which were more modest compared to the prior year. Our customer momentum continued as we added a combined 220,000 residential and business customers in the quarter, up 22% over last year's net adds and added 1.4 million combined customers over the past 12 months. We continued to gain market share and benefit from growth in the overall market as customers respond to our product differentiation. At the end of the quarter, 79% of our residential customers received speeds of 50 megabits per second or greater compared to 69% in the prior year.
Video revenue increased 2.8% to $5.6 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services, including premium channels, HD DVR and additional outlets. Our rate of growth was impacted by the challenging comparison to the hugely successful Pacquiao versus Mayweather fight on Pay-Per-View in last year second quarter. Our rate adjustments are primarily from Broadcast TV and RSN fees, which, as we will as discuss in programming expenses, are the most significant sources of our cost pressure.
In terms of volume, our total video customer base has grown modestly year-over-year as we have consistently improved our video customer metrics for several quarters. In a quarter that's typically seasonally weak, we lost a combined 4,000 net video customers, an improvement of 64,000 versus the year-ago quarter. And as Brian noted, making this our best second quarter result in over 10 years. The improvement continues to be driven primarily by improved churn.
Our X1 platform is proving to be a real competitive differentiator, and we continue to make good progress, rolling it out to 855,000 net new and existing customers this quarter, with nearly 40% of our total video customers now having X1. In addition to great technology, we coupled this with a breadth of content available On Demand and with a compelling TV Everywhere offering. Our customers are responding to these choices. On X1, 85% of our subscribers are using XFINITY On Demand monthly, viewing 29 hours a month on average. And 42% of our subscribers are using our TV Everywhere platforms monthly, up 17% from last year, viewing 10 hours a month on average. We think this adds great utility to our video service.
Rounding out our Residential products. Voice revenue declined by 1.1% to $893 million in the second quarter as customer combined the net additions of 64,000 were offset by a modest decline in ARPU, reflecting our usual revenue allocations within our multiproduct packages.
Let's now turn to Business Services, which continues to deliver excellent results. Revenue increased 17% to $1.4 billion, with the small business segment accounting for about 75% of our revenue and 60% of our growth. Revenue for the midsized business segment continues to grow at an attractive rate, and its contribution as a percentage of total business revenue is increasing. Overall, Business Services had strong positive momentum and continues to represent a large and attractive growth opportunity for the company.
Cable Advertising revenue increased 3.5% to $597 million, reflecting higher political revenue as we continue to benefit from advertising for the upcoming elections. Excluding the political contribution, our Cable Advertising revenue increased 1.1%, reflecting slower growth across core categories and the timing of media spending. Despite the slowdown in core local advertising, we expect Advertising revenue growth to ramp in the second half of this year, again driven by political revenue from the upcoming elections.
Turning to Slide 6. Second quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased to 5.7% to $5 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.6%, relatively consistent with the second quarter of 2015. Programming expenses grew 7.4%. However, excluding the impact of the Pay-Per-View fees associated with the fight in last year second quarter, Programming expense growth would have been 9.4%. This growth reflects programming contract renewals, higher retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs. We continue to expect approximately 10% growth in programming costs for 2016 as growth ramps in the second half of the year, driven by upcoming contract renewals.
Nonprogramming expenses increased 5.5%, reflecting our planned investment to improve the customer experience and to continue the rollout of X1. We've added technicians and service personnel, strengthened our dispatch teams and operations and invested in training, tools and technology. As a result, technical and product support and customer service costs, each increased 6%. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow increased 5.3% to $9.9 billion, resulting in a margin of 40.3%, down 40 basis points compared to the same period in 2015. As a reminder, earlier this year, we provided full year guidance for our 2016 Cable operating margin to be flat to down 50 basis points compared to 40.6% in 2015, and that guidance is unchanged.
Now let's move onto NBCUniversal's results. On Slide 7, you can see NBCUniversal delivered strong results in our TV and Theme Park businesses, offset by the challenging Filmed comparison. Revenue declined 1.8%, and operating cash flow remained stable at $1.7 billion. Adjusting to include the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan in last year's results, pro forma revenue decreased 5.1%, and operating cash flow decreased 6.4%. Cable Networks revenue increased 4.7%, and operating cash flow increased 8.3% to $944 million, reflecting higher distribution and content licensing and other revenue as well as lower advertising, marketing and promotion expenses, partially offset by an increase in programming and production costs.
Distribution revenue increased 6.9%, driven by contractual rate increases and contract renewals, partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers at our Cable Networks. Advertising revenue was flat compared to the second quarter of 2015, reflecting strong pricing, offset by audience ratings decline at our Cable Networks.
Broadcast Television had another strong quarter with revenue growth of 17.3% and operating cash flow growth of 70.5% to $394 million. This increase reflects higher content licensing, retransmission and advertising revenue, partially offset by higher programming and production spending. Content licensing increased 59.9%, primarily due to the availability of content in our current SVOD deals. Distribution and other revenue growth of 35% was driven by 63% increase in retransmission revenue. Last, Advertising revenue increased a healthy 2.9%, reflecting a strong scatter market, partially offset by a challenging comparison in sports advertising due to less favorable NHL playoff matchups and the absence of a Triple Crown contender.
Film revenue declined 40.4%, and operating cash flow declined 86.7% to $56 million, reflecting the difficult comparison to last year's Film performance. Most notably, theatrical revenue declined 78.8% compared to last year second quarter, which included the strong performances of Furious 7 and Jurassic World.
In addition, home entertainment revenue declined 25.1% due to the strong performance of several releases last year, including Fifty Shades of Grey. Partially offsetting this lower revenue was higher content licensing revenue due to several of last year's theatrical releases like Minions and Jurassic World now in the pay-TV window.
Theme Parks revenue increased 47% to $1.1 billion, and operating cash flow increased to 40.5% to $469 million in the second quarter of 2016. On a pro forma basis, revenue increased 10.6%, and operating cash flow increased 5.3%. These results were driven by higher per capita spending at the parks and the successful opening of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood. Partially offsetting these results was the timing of spring break, which was more concentrated in the first quarter this year and pre-opening cost ahead of the new King Kong attraction this summer in Orlando.
Let's move on to Slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures increased 15.2% to $2.3 billion in the second quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 12% to $1.9 billion for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis have increased 10.6% to $3.5 billion, representing capital intensity of 14% compared to 13.5% for the first half of 2015. The higher spending reflects increased investment in line extensions and a higher level of investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity. Our investment in our network helps enhance our competitive position in broadband while staying ahead of rapid growth and bandwidth consumption by our customers. 
We believe we have and will continue to monetize these investments effectively through subscriber growth and rate adjustments. In addition, our higher capital expenditures reflect spending on customer premise equipment related to the deployment of our Wireless Gateways and the X1 platform. We continue to expect that for the full year of 2016, our Cable capital intensity will remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%.
At NBCUniversal, capital expenditures increased 32.4% to $360 million in the second quarter and increased 21.3% to $655 million on a year-to-date basis, driven by the inclusion of a full quarter of Universal Studios Japan. We continue to expect NBCUniversal's CapEx to increase approximately 10% this year.
I'll now finish up on Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, consolidated free cash flow declined 5.4% to $1.4 billion in the second quarter, reflecting growth in consolidated operating cash flow, offset by higher capital expenditures. For the first half of the year, we generated $4.2 billion in free cash flow, a decrease of 9.8% over the first half of 2015. This decline reflects growth in consolidated operating cash flow, offset by increased working capital as well as higher capital expenditures and cash paid for capitalized software and other intangible assets. In addition to investing in the business, we are also successfully executing our plan for returning capital to shareholders. Dividend payments during the quarter were $670 million, up 6.6%, and share repurchases were $1.1 billion, consistent with our plan to repurchase $5 billion of our common stock during the full year. In addition, we ended the quarter right at 2.0x net leverage, in line with our stated target.
That concludes our summary of the quarter. I hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our results as well as our momentum going into the second half of the year.
Now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A."

Brian, the industry has a long history of collaboration that's been a big part of the success, if you think about CableLabs, et cetera. Wondering in the context of all the big changes in ownership outside of Comcast, and when you look at how much more software driven the business is becoming, you look at how much more streaming is happening around the country and things from the OTT. Do you see either an opportunity or a need for greater collaboration throughout the cable industry going forward and you -- something that you think might actually impact your business or and make what you offer the consumer even more powerful? And then I'll just ask my follow-up to Steve. Steve, you had a huge content licensing quarter this quarter. And I'm just wondering in that context, can you talk about your philosophy on SVOD licensing, particularly as we head towards this Hulu bundle, which, while we don't know what it looks like, there's a lot of talk about kind of cutting back on licensing to folks like Netflix and putting more product inside the bundle.

We've run the business being very careful about Windows and being very careful about the way -- various ways that we make money. And we've essentially licensed to everybody that you would expect us to license to. As it relates to the new OTT entrants, I think the key there is going to be making sure that we're in every bundle, and I think we're going to be. We have more channels and more eyeballs than anyone else, and we're pretty much essential to those bundles. And then as they go out, making sure that they're incremental, that they're not cannibalistic, wholly cannibalistic. I believe the vast majority of OTT subscribers will be incremental. We'll be going after people who currently are not part of the ecosystem and, therefore, will be additive to NBCUniversal and all of Comcast NBCUniversal as well."

As we look at things like Business Services and advanced advertising, one of the reasons we were happy to see some of the other consolidation that took place earlier in the year and has been happening is to enable that collaboration.

We moved it up from 300 gigabyte to 1 terabyte in 14% of our markets where we have usage-based pricing. We think we're going to continue to adjust and look at it as the market evolves and as usage evolves. We have different pricing models, some based on speed, some based on usage. And we're going to be flexible and kind of let the market tell us, which way is best for consumers and how we add the most value. We continue to add speeds. We've added speeds 17 times in 15 years. We built out the fastest Wi-Fi, so we're going to continue to invest in the network to stay ahead of things. Concerning prepaid, there was a segment of the customer or consumer base that we felt there was a better model at serving the generally lower income, may or may not have a credit card and generally wouldn't meet our credit ratings or credit standards that we had applied for customers -- acquiring customers. So we felt this is a good model, we tested it and it worked well. And -- so we'll be rolling out on a broader basis."

We also have had a monetization gap on the affiliate side, which is the gap between the retrans or the affiliate fees that we received and similarly situated channels. At the time we did the deal, the monetization gap was about 20% on ad sales. We've closed the majority of that gap, and the biggest progress we made in any single upfront was a progress we just made. A few years ago, we put all our channels together. We have previously sold Cable separately from Broadcast, and sports separately from prime time and news. We put everything together so now if you want to buy from any part of the company, we have a discussion about every part of the company, and that, because we're the largest provider of television advertising in the country, people come to us first. So for the last couple of fronts, we've really led the discussions and led the sort of negotiations and price setting of the entire market. Bryan mentioned it in his overview, but we've got 12.5% increases on NBC Entertainment, but we also got 13% on U.S.A. We got 12% on Bravo -- on E!. We got 10% on Bravo. And overall, Cable was up double digits, and Broadcast was up double digits. So we had a wonderful upfront. I think in some instances, we might be a few percentage points ahead of similarly situated networks this year, but we think we deserve that and we still have the gap that we're trying to close. It's hard to make progress that's much more material than a few percentage points, but I think we certainly made it this year. And we're also taking advantage of the fact that it's a strong advertising market both in scatter and upfront pricing. And I think big advertisers realize that digital is an important part of the mix. But if you have a major product launch, you really, really have to look at big events on Broadcast and Cable television that can provide the kind of reach and sort of depth that you get. Think of what someone gets when they advertise in the Olympics. We have 3x the combined ratings on any given night during the Olympics of ABC, CBS and FOX. So that kind of appeal if you're marketing an automobile or a beer or a car, I mean, it's just a tremendous value proposition, and we're happy to have it. And we made real progress this year."

So for first time since we've been here, we hit our Advertising budget for the Olympics 3 weeks before the start of the Olympics. Normally, we would hit the budget right about the time the Olympic started or shortly thereafter. And our budget was about a 20% increase from London, so we're very, very happy with how we're doing in terms of Olympic sales. We might make money a lot of different ways in the Olympics. We have national advertising, which is what I was just referring to. We also have a lot of Advertising in our own stations. We get paid in affiliate fee by cable and satellite and telco operators, then we have a very big digital business. All of those businesses look terrific. And the way the Olympics work, you have a sufficient make good to cover any rating shortfall, which we hope and think there won't be. But even if there was a significant shortfall, we would just make good during the Olympics. So we're looking, I think, at a very profitable Olympics. We made $120 million or thereabouts in London, and we're going to make a lot more than that in Rio. So we're looking forward to that. China, Brian and I were in China 2 weeks ago, and we are very, very bullish on our business there as our most people doing business in China. Our -- NBCUniversal made essentially nothing in China 4 years ago, I'm talking movies, television, consumer products and theme parks. Last year, we made, call it, $170 million in China from movies and television. That number is going to grow substantially in the future. We have existing deals and new deals, and we're getting better and better at bringing our products to China. And then in 2020, we're projecting to open a theme park in Beijing, which we're very bullish about. We have not signed all the documents, but we've had countless meetings. By the way, our first meeting about Beijing happened something like 12 years ago, so this has been going on a long, long time. But we're essentially -- we're in schematic drawings we've had countless discussions on. We have all the attractions laid out. I mean, we're really in production mode. And I think when you look forward to 2020, combination of movies and television and theme parks, China is going to be a very, very substantial profit generator for our company."

If you have Syfy or Bravo or E!, those are big, substantial networks that are in the bundle.

But I think the Advertising market is very, very strong. And some of that is reflected in the upfront. In terms of volume in the upfront, I think we could have sold a lot more than we sold in the upfront. We sold about 10% more volume on the Broadcast side, about 5% overall. We turned away a lot of volume. We're working on mix on the Cable side to try to get higher, more profitable advertising into our mix in some of our cable channels. But there was plenty of volume, and we could have sold more if we wanted to. The percentage sold as a percent of the total is roughly comparable to previous year, so we still have, depending on the network, 20%, 25% of the volume available for a strong scatter market."

Consolidated revenue and operating cash flow were up 14% and 11%, respectively, driven by broad-based strength across",1009,"Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report terrific operational and financial results during the third quarter. Consolidated revenue and operating cash flow were up 14% and 11%, respectively, driven by broad-based strength across the company. And for a company of our size, this is a tremendous result. From our perspective, 3 things stood out in the quarter: our results in video, which were the best for a third quarter in the last 10 years; in broadband, which were the best in 7 years; and our successful broadcast and distribution of the Rio Olympics. 
Let's start with Rio, which again validated that the Olympics are the most valuable and most consumed property in media. NBC won all 17 nights of primetime, and the NBC Sports Network was the #1 sports cable network in primetime over the 14 days that it presented live coverage of the games. In fact, in the 18 to 49 demo, NBC's primetimes ratings more than quadrupled the other broadcast networks combined and were nearly 5x greater with millennials. Moreover, that lead widened versus prior Olympics. The audience for the Rio Olympics was enormous, encompassing almost 200 million Americans on television alone, not to mention those who also engage on our other platforms. Rio was also very strong from a financial perspective, significantly exceeding our prior results. And we believe it will continue to be a big success going forward. One of the key reasons for our outstanding performance with the games is that our teams from across Comcast NBCUniversal worked so well together. We partnered closely, innovated quickly and as a result, delivered the most comprehensive and technologically advanced Olympics coverage in history. 
In our TV businesses, the Olympics drove our exceptional performance during the quarter and were a great way to wrap up our 2015-2016 television season. NBC finished the season as the #1 broadcast network for the third year in a row and was also the #1 broadcast network for the sixth summer in a row. And the fall season is off to a good start with This Is Us as the highest-rated new series and Saturday Night Live kicking off its 42nd season with its highest-rated premieres in 3 years. 
Telemundo is another bright spot in broadcast. It was the #1-rated Spanish language TV network in Monday to Friday primetime for the quarter. We have fundamentally repositioned this network through investments in original content, infrastructure and talent. And it's working. 
Our Cable Networks delivered solid cash flow growth. We had a lot of successes in entertainment, sports and news in the quarter. MSNBC's ratings were up 95%, and we also announced an exclusive deal in which all 8 of the Harry Potter films will begin airing on U.S.A. in sci-fi beginning in 2018, plus we have rights to air the films across our other television properties, too. We believe we are taking the right steps and remain on a trajectory to continue to grow this business. 
At film, we completed the acquisition of DreamWorks, and we're happy to welcome the team to the Comcast NBCUniversal family. 
In animation, the Secret Life of Pets from Illumination was a huge hit during the quarter. It had the highest-ever opening in the U.S. for an original animated movie and importantly, gives us another valuable franchise. Looking ahead, we're thrilled about our new original animated film, Sing, which opens in the U.S. in December. I believe this is one of the best movies that Chris Meledandri and the team at Illumination has ever made. 
At Theme Parks, we also delivered fantastic results. We continue to be extremely pleased with the opening of Harry Potter in Hollywood. 
Now over Cable, the team continue to expertly balance improvement in the financial and customer results. We generated strong growth in revenue and operating cash flow while also achieving some of our best customer metrics in nearly a decade. We ended the quarter with 28.3 million customer relationships, adding 216,000 during the quarter. 
In video, we added 32,000 customers in the quarter. We now have added 170,000 video customers in the last 12 months. We also delivered great results in high-speed Internet, adding 330,000 customers during the quarter. 
Across all of our product categories, better customer retention was a key driver of our performance. So how are we doing this? Well, we've shifted the culture of our company to put the customer truly first, and that's driving the focus of our product and technology innovation and also our customer service.  A perfect example is Netflix, which we have now integrated into X1. Our agreement with Netflix highlights the flexibility that we have in our platform and what a fantastic showcase X1 is for different types of content, all in an elegantly designed and integrated experience. We did the same integration with live sports with the Olympics. 
Similarly, in high-speed Internet, we're increasing speed and continue to deliver the fastest in-home Wi-Fi. Earlier this year, we launched a new residential Internet service that delivers gigabit speeds to customers using DOCSIS 3.1 technology. We're also leveraging our position in the home to offer new services. And this was through Voice, when we introduced it, and more recently, our home security product. And as we announced last month, we're planning to bring a wireless service to our customers in mid-2017 as part of an attractively priced, multiproduct bundle. Stay tuned, and we'll have more to tell you about this at a later date. 
Finally, we continue to make significant strides with customer service. Our efforts are focused on 3 areas: First, serving our customers faster; second, improving and simplifying the experience, particularly in onboarding, [ph] billing and repair; and third, fixing issues the first time. And when we fall short, making it right. 
So all in all, I'm really proud of the performance in the quarter, and we're encouraged by the momentum that we have in our businesses. Our teams are executing well and also working well together. And we're excited and optimistic about our future. 
Mike, over to you."

I'm starting on Slide 4 for those following the presentation online. Our third quarter results reflect consistent execution and broad-based strength across our businesses. Consolidated revenue increased 14.2%,",1896,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody. I'm starting on Slide 4 for those following the presentation online. 
Our third quarter results reflect consistent execution and broad-based strength across our businesses. Consolidated revenue increased 14.2%, and operating cash flow grew 10.5% for the third quarter, reflecting solid growth in our Cable business and strong growth at NBCUniversal, partly driven by the success of the Rio Olympics. 
Earnings per share was $0.92, a 15% increase compared to a year ago. And free cash flow was $1.4 billion in the quarter, a decline of 48.5%. This decline was driven by higher working capital primarily related to the Rio Olympics. We will go into greater detail on these results on the slides to come. 
Now let's start with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable Communications delivered strong third quarter results. Revenues increased 6.9% to $12.6 billion as we increased customer relationships and grew total revenue per customer relationship by 3.6% to $148 per month. We added 216,000 customer relationships, driven by 2 product customer additions and a reduction in churn across all products. In fact, we have improved churn in video and high-speed data for 32 consecutive months, as customers increasingly recognize the value of our X1 platform and superior high-speed data product. And we make meaningful strides in improving customer service. 
High-speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 8.8% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, reflecting an increase in our customer base; rate adjustments, which were more modest compared to the prior year; and customers subscribing to higher levels of service. Our customer momentum continued as we added a combined 330,000 residential and business customers in the quarter, up 3% over last year's net adds. And we added 1.4 million combined customers over the past 12 months. We continue to benefit from growth in the overall market and gain market share as customers respond to our product differentiation. We've increased Internet speeds 17 times in the last 15 years. About 80% of our residential customers take speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. And we have over 15 million Wi-Fi hotspots for our customers to access, which, combined, greatly increases our customer value proposition and competitive differentiation. 
Video revenue increased 4.5% to $5.6 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services and growth in our customer base. Our rate adjustments are primarily from broadcast TV and RSN fees, [ph] as we have noted in previous quarters, are the most significant sources of our programming cost pressure. In terms of volume, we have consistently improved our video customer metrics for several quarters. In the third quarter, we continued the momentum and added a combined 32,000 net video customers, an improvement of 80,000 versus the year-ago quarter, and as Brian noted, making this our best third quarter result in 10 years. 
Driving these impressive customer metrics is improved customer retention, as our X1 platform proves to be a real competitive differentiator. X1 combines innovative technology with the breadth of content that is easily searchable, and customers are clearly responding. As we expand our X1 customer base, the positive customer benefits continue. X1 customers have higher customer satisfaction and better retention rates. In addition, X1 customers, compared to non-X1 customers, have 3x higher activations of DVRs, more outlets in the home and spend twice as much on pay-per-view. As a result, the overall ARPU of an X1 customer is higher. We've been adding about 5 percentage points of X1 penetration each quarter this year, and we kept that pace this quarter. We added 948,000 net new and existing customers, with nearly 45% of our residential video customers now having X1. 
Voice revenue declined by 2.4% to $878 million in the third quarter, as combined customer net additions of 2,000 were offset by a modest decline in ARPU. Our back-to-school initiatives were heavily focused on Double Play this quarter, driving a greater increase in 2-product video high-speed data customer relationships versus the Triple Play that includes Voice. 
Let's now turn to business services, which continues to deliver excellent results. Revenue increased 15.5% to $1.4 billion, with a small business segment accounting for over 70% of our revenue and 60% of our growth, driven primarily by the net increase in customers. Revenue for the midsize business segment has a higher growth rate, fueled by primarily additional Ethernet sites as we continue to invest in expanding that business. 
Cable advertising revenue increased 7.7% to $634 million, reflecting higher political revenue related to the upcoming elections. Excluding the political contribution, our cable advertising revenue decreased 2%. 
Turning to Slide 6. Second quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 5.5% to $5 billion, resulting in a margin of 39.7% compared to 40.2% in the third quarter of 2015, driven by higher expenses primarily related to increases in programming costs and the investments we are making to improve the customer experience. Programming expenses grew 11.4%, reflecting the timing of programming contract renewals. The underlying growth continues to be driven by higher retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs. For the full year, we expect program expense growth to be slightly above 10%. Nonprogramming expenses increased 5.6%, reflecting higher expenses to continue the rollout of X1; planned investment to improve the customer experience, driven primarily by increased technicians and service personnel; and an increase in advertising, marketing and promotion costs. Year-to-date, our cable operating margin is down 40 basis points, and that is roughly where we would expect to end the year. 
Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. On Slide 7, you can see NBCUniversal's revenues increased 28.3% and operating cash flow increased 31.5%. Adjusting to include the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan in last year's results, pro forma revenue increased 22.5%, and operating cash flow increased 19.2%. These exceptional results were driven in part by the success of the Rio Olympics, which added $1.6 billion in revenue, of which $1.2 billion is related to advertising revenue and is included in the Cable Networks and Broadcast segments. In addition to the Olympics, NBCUniversal results reflect strong performance at parks and broadcast as well as the theatrical success of the Secret Life of Pets. 
Cable Networks revenue increased 22% to $2.9 billion, including $432 million of revenue associated with the Rio Olympics. Excluding the Olympics, revenue increased 4.1%, reflecting higher distribution and content licensing and other revenue and relatively flat advertising revenue. This was primarily driven by distribution revenue which increased about 6%, driven by contractual rate increases and contract renewals partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers at our Cable Networks. 
Advertising revenue was relatively stable, reflecting strong pricing, offset by audience rating declines at our Cable Networks. Operating cash flow increased 7% to $893 million, reflecting a profitable [ph] Olympics and increased sports programming costs as well as our continued investment in original programming. 
Broadcast Television had another strong quarter with revenue growth of 56.6% to $3.1 billion, including $1.2 billion of revenue associated with the Rio Olympics. Excluding the Olympics, revenue declined 3.6%, reflecting lower content licensing revenue, partially offset by higher retransmission and advertising revenue. Content licensing revenue declined 32% due to a difficult comparison to last year's results, which included new Law & Order syndication deals. Excluding the Olympics, distribution and other revenue growth of 21% was driven by a 52% increase in retransmission revenue. 
Last, advertising revenue increased a healthy 4%, reflecting a strong scatter market. Broadcast operating cash flow increased by $228 million to $378 million, reflecting a profitable Olympics and growth in high-margin retransmission consent fees as well as lower programming costs compared to last year. 
Film revenue declined 7.9% to $1.8 billion, and operating cash flow declined 6.1% to $353 million. These results include DreamWorks from its acquisition date of August 22, including $50 million related to severance. Excluding this charge, operating cash flow increased as the successful performance of the Secret Life of Pets and higher content licensing more than offset the difficult comparison to last year's record third quarter, which included Minions and Jurassic World. 
Theme Parks revenue increased 60.6% to $1.4 billion, and operating cash flow increased 62.4% to $706 million in the third quarter of 2016. On a pro forma basis for Universal Japan, revenue increased 16.1%, and operating cash flow increased 17.1%. These results reflect higher attendance and higher per capita spending, driven by the successful opening of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood as well as the positive impact of a stronger Japanese yen, which accounted for about 1/3 of the growth. We are pleased with the performance of Harry Potter in Hollywood as it is trending in line with previous Potter launches at our other parks. Partially offsetting these results were higher costs associated with new attractions like King Kong that opened in Orlando this past summer. 
Let's move to Slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures increased 11.1% to $2.4 billion in the third quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 10.4% to $2 billion for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, have increased 10.5% to $5.5 billion, representing capital intensity of 14.8% compared to 14.2% for the first 9 months of 2015. While the largest component of our capital spending continues to be customer premise equipment, including X1 and wireless gateways, the largest source of year-over-year growth in spending is our investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity. We believe this investment in scalable infrastructure enhances our competitive position in broadband by staying ahead of rapid growth in bandwidth consumption by our customers. In addition, we have extended our network to more customer addresses, primarily business addresses, through line extensions. We continue to expect that for the full year of 2016, our cable capital intensity will remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%. 
At NBCUniversal, capital expenditures increased 16.3% to $336 million in the third quarter and increased 19.5% to $991 million on a year-to-date basis, driven by the inclusion of Universal Studios Japan. We continue to expect NBCUniversal's CapEx to increase approximately 10% this year. 
Now finishing up on Slide 9. On a year-to-date basis, we generated $5.6 billion in free cash flow, a decrease of 23.8% over the comparable period of 2015, primarily driven by lower third quarter results. Consolidated free cash flow in the third quarter declined 48.5% to $1.4 billion, reflecting the 10.5% growth in operating cash flow, which was offset by an increase in capital expenditures, as we just reviewed, and higher working capital, primarily due to the 2016 Rio Olympics. This is a timing issue, and we will see a positive swing in Olympic working capital in the fourth quarter. 
In terms of capital returns, dividend payments during the quarter were $663 million, up 6.5%, and share repurchases were $1.4 billion, consistent with our plan to repurchase $5 billion of our common stock during the full year. We ended the quarter at 2.2x net leverage, primarily reflecting the closing of the DreamWorks acquisition and payment of a deposit in the third quarter. 
So that concludes our summary of the quarter. I hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our the results as well as our momentum. And now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A."

And there's a lot of speculation as to why. One of the things that frequently cited is that more consumption of these events is happening online. You're a big partner with both of the examples I cited. And you're very involved obviously in both the linear and the online distribution of the Olympics. And so it would seem that you have a unique vantage point. So I guess, my question is, what do you think is going on here? Do you think the viewership of these events have actually declined? Or do you think it's correct to assume that more of it has gone to a streaming format? So it's not being captured. If that is the case, how do you make sure, as you move ahead, that you're able to monetize your role in those events properly?"

In the case of the Olympics, London was the biggest Olympics that we ever had in terms of primetime ratings. Rio was lower than London, but Rio was really on par with the previous 3 Summer Olympics. And if you look at all the various ways of consuming, we had an extraordinary Olympics. Financially, ratings, advertiser happiness, et cetera. The streaming portion of the viewership was actually very low relative to television for the Olympics, call it 1% or 2%. And I think that same numbers apply to the NFL, 1% or 2%, 1% of people stream NFL games. I think what's really happening -- and by the way, the NFL, we have an extraordinary season last year, which everybody's comparing to. We're actually down versus last year, but down much less versus 2 years ago. It's -- I think it's very difficult to tell precisely what's happening on any sporting property, particularly in the case of the NFL, because it's only been a half dozen weeks. I do think there a lot of different things that people are using to consuming on the Internet and spending time on. I also think there are seasons stronger than other seasons. And we may be in a season, just speaking for Sunday Night Football, with the matchups aren't as good as they could have been. But if you step back, the Olympics and the NFL are the 2 highest-rated programs of the year in all of television. They dominate the nights that they are on. They dominate, as Brian mentioned, and the Olympics, we're 4x the next highest rated shows. Sunday Night Football is by far the highest-rated show on television. And we have very, very good partnerships with International Olympic Committee and the NFL that go out many, many years. And those are very profitable relationship. So we're watching it. And obviously, you'd rather have ratings up and down, but having ratings decline modestly and still be very, very strong properties doesn't cause us too much concern."

Something like 100 million Americans consumed at least part of the Olympics online. It was a huge, huge phenomenon on Snapchat and Facebook and other places. And the inability for us to articulately walk into an advertiser and talk about all that consumption in an aggregated way is a real problem. And it's a problem that obviously going to get solved, but the progress as great as it should be. I think what everybody wants is pretty obvious. They want to know what is the total audience delivery of a television show, wherever it gets consumed. And they want it to be done by a third party in a way that is objective and quantifiable. And that's what we're all working to. I think the world is moving towards C7 from C3. I think the world is moving toward measuring alternative vehicles, and I think most advertisers understand, when they buy a hit property, they're going to get a lot of consumption elsewhere. And they sort of factor that into the effectiveness intellectually, but you'd certainly love for it to be done in a quantifiable way by an unbiased third party, and we're not making enough progress on that."

The first is, it looks like the industry is moving more towards the Comcast model more vertically integrated and so on, with obviously the Time Warner deal, [indiscernible] buying content and so on. So from that perspective, you guys have a unique vantage point, given you had NBC for a while. If you could talk a little bit about what the advantages of that model are and whether owning NBC as well as Cable on the other side of it provides a better business model from a consumer perspective as well as for the company as a whole? And secondly, from the perspective of the X1 platform, obviously, it's an industry-leading platform, and the way the content is presented there is in a disaggregated format. From that perspective, in terms of the vision you have of how a video can be packaged maybe 5 years from now, does the bundle, in any form -- I mean skinny or non-skinny, make any sense in the next 5 years or 10 years, given how the industry is evolving and consumption patterns are evolving?"

What X1 does, from my perspective, our perspective, I think is really helped you with search navigation, discovery and enjoyment of the content you end up deciding to procure. So if you just pick a movie star, you talk to the remote, you say it, and then gives you a recommendation, and that tells you, every episode now, whether that episode resides on Netflix or resides in a broadcaster, resides in the cable network or if you DVR it. And it's more like this. And it gives you lots of choices. So in the case -- to your point, we'll be up-selling Netflix, as an example. And I guess as we up-sell HBO and Showtime and others. So some content allows you to be show by show or network by network, but it's the breadth of all the choices in the bundle that I think what has powered this industry. And we're clearly, as Neil said, we need to evolve and continue to progress. And we will, and we need to compete with whatever the future brings. But the investment we've made in innovation, the people we recruited, I think, sort of ties to your first question. Very broadly put, Comcast-NBCUniversal is a very special company, and we've recruit -- we've moved hundreds of people back and forth between different parts of the company in the corporate office. We -- the Olympics, I think are just a shining example of where all those live streams that Steve was just talking about were available on X1 and on the NBC Sports app. And you could get there through your Voice remote or through your XFINITY mobile app. And we call that Symphony. And we've seen it whether it's talent, wanted to work with the company, people wanting to join the company or innovation that the company is doing And could we do more? And will we do more to innovate? Yes. But we've seen a lot of people want to use the X1 platform. There are other operators around the world, in Canada and with Cox, and we've had others requesting to use the platform. So we're -- it seems to be resonating in almost every part of the ecosystem, the strategy we're on. And again, you get to a quarter like this, and you see really working all together...."

I'm pleased to report terrific operational and financial results during the third quarter.

I'm pleased to report terrific operational and financial results during the third quarter. Consolidated revenue and operating cash flow were up 14% and 11%, respectively, driven by broad-based strength across the company. And for a company of our size, this is a tremendous result. From our perspective, 3 things stood out in the quarter: our results in video, which were the best for a third quarter in the last 10 years; in broadband, which were the best in 7 years; and our successful broadcast and distribution of the Rio Olympics. 
Let's start with Rio, which again validated that the Olympics are the most valuable and most consumed property in media. NBC won all 17 nights of primetime, and the NBC Sports Network was the #1 sports cable network in primetime over the 14 days that it presented live coverage of the games. In fact, in the 18 to 49 demo, NBC's primetimes ratings more than quadrupled the other broadcast networks combined and were nearly 5x greater with millennials. Moreover, that lead widened versus prior Olympics. The audience for the Rio Olympics was enormous, encompassing almost 200 million Americans on television alone, not to mention those who also engage on our other platforms. Rio was also very strong from a financial perspective, significantly exceeding our prior results. And we believe it will continue to be a big success going forward. One of the key reasons for our outstanding performance with the games is that our teams from across Comcast NBCUniversal worked so well together. We partnered closely, innovated quickly and as a result, delivered the most comprehensive and technologically advanced Olympics coverage in history. 
In our TV businesses, the Olympics drove our exceptional performance during the quarter and were a great way to wrap up our 2015-2016 television season. NBC finished the season as the #1 broadcast network for the third year in a row and was also the #1 broadcast network for the sixth summer in a row. And the fall season is off to a good start with This Is Us as the highest-rated new series and Saturday Night Live kicking off its 42nd season with its highest-rated premieres in 3 years. 
Telemundo is another bright spot in broadcast. It was the #1-rated Spanish language TV network in Monday to Friday primetime for the quarter. We have fundamentally repositioned this network through investments in original content, infrastructure and talent. And it's working. 
Our Cable Networks delivered solid cash flow growth. We had a lot of successes in entertainment, sports and news in the quarter. MSNBC's ratings were up 95%, and we also announced an exclusive deal in which all 8 of the Harry Potter films will begin airing on U.S.A. in sci-fi beginning in 2018, plus we have rights to air the films across our other television properties, too. We believe we are taking the right steps and remain on a trajectory to continue to grow this business. 
At film, we completed the acquisition of DreamWorks, and we're happy to welcome the team to the Comcast NBCUniversal family. 
In animation, the Secret Life of Pets from Illumination was a huge hit during the quarter. It had the highest-ever opening in the U.S. for an original animated movie and importantly, gives us another valuable franchise. Looking ahead, we're thrilled about our new original animated film, Sing, which opens in the U.S. in December. I believe this is one of the best movies that Chris Meledandri and the team at Illumination has ever made. 
At Theme Parks, we also delivered fantastic results. We continue to be extremely pleased with the opening of Harry Potter in Hollywood. 
Now over Cable, the team continue to expertly balance improvement in the financial and customer results. We generated strong growth in revenue and operating cash flow while also achieving some of our best customer metrics in nearly a decade. We ended the quarter with 28.3 million customer relationships, adding 216,000 during the quarter. 
In video, we added 32,000 customers in the quarter. We now have added 170,000 video customers in the last 12 months. We also delivered great results in high-speed Internet, adding 330,000 customers during the quarter. 
Across all of our product categories, better customer retention was a key driver of our performance. So how are we doing this? Well, we've shifted the culture of our company to put the customer truly first, and that's driving the focus of our product and technology innovation and also our customer service. A perfect example is Netflix, which we have now integrated into X1. Our agreement with Netflix highlights the flexibility that we have in our platform and what a fantastic showcase X1 is for different types of content, all in an elegantly designed and integrated experience. We did the same integration with live sports with the Olympics. 
Similarly, in high-speed Internet, we're increasing speed and continue to deliver the fastest in-home Wi-Fi. Earlier this year, we launched a new residential Internet service that delivers gigabit speeds to customers using DOCSIS 3.1 technology. We're also leveraging our position in the home to offer new services. And this was through Voice, when we introduced it, and more recently, our home security product. And as we announced last month, we're planning to bring a wireless service to our customers in mid-2017 as part of an attractively priced, multiproduct bundle. Stay tuned, and we'll have more to tell you about this at a later date. 
Finally, we continue to make significant strides with customer service. Our efforts are focused on 3 areas: First, serving our customers faster; second, improving and simplifying the experience, particularly in onboarding, billing and repair; and third, fixing issues the first time. And when we fall short, making it right. 
So all in all, I'm really proud of the performance in the quarter, and we're encouraged by the momentum that we have in our businesses. Our teams are executing well and also working well together. And we're excited and optimistic about our future. 
Mike, over to you."

I'm starting on Slide 4 for those following the presentation online. Our third quarter results reflect consistent execution and broad-based strength across our businesses. Consolidated revenue increased 14.2%,",1894,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody. I'm starting on Slide 4 for those following the presentation online. 
Our third quarter results reflect consistent execution and broad-based strength across our businesses. Consolidated revenue increased 14.2%, and operating cash flow grew 10.5% for the third quarter, reflecting solid growth in our Cable business and strong growth at NBCUniversal, partly driven by the success of the Rio Olympics. 
Earnings per share was $0.92, a 15% increase compared to a year ago. And free cash flow was $1.4 billion in the quarter, a decline of 48.5%. This decline was driven by higher working capital primarily related to the Rio Olympics. We will go into greater detail on these results on the slides to come. 
Now let's start with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable Communications delivered strong third quarter results. Revenues increased 6.9% to $12.6 billion as we increased customer relationships and grew total revenue per customer relationship by 3.6% to $148 per month. We added 216,000 customer relationships, driven by 2 product customer additions and a reduction in churn across all products. In fact, we have improved churn in video and high-speed data for 32 consecutive months, as customers increasingly recognize the value of our X1 platform and superior high-speed data product. And we make meaningful strides in improving customer service. 
High-speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 8.8% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, reflecting an increase in our customer base; rate adjustments, which were more modest compared to the prior year; and customers subscribing to higher levels of service. Our customer momentum continued as we added a combined 330,000 residential and business customers in the quarter, up 3% over last year's net adds. And we added 1.4 million combined customers over the past 12 months. We continue to benefit from growth in the overall market and gain market share as customers respond to our product differentiation. We've increased Internet speeds 17 times in the last 15 years. About 80% of our residential customers take speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. And we have over 15 million Wi-Fi hotspots for our customers to access, which, combined, greatly increases our customer value proposition and competitive differentiation. 
Video revenue increased 4.5% to $5.6 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services and growth in our customer base. Our rate adjustments are primarily from broadcast TV and RSN fees, as we have noted in previous quarters, are the most significant sources of our programming cost pressure. In terms of volume, we have consistently improved our video customer metrics for several quarters. In the third quarter, we continued the momentum and added a combined 32,000 net video customers, an improvement of 80,000 versus the year-ago quarter, and as Brian noted, making this our best third quarter result in 10 years. 
Driving these impressive customer metrics is improved customer retention, as our X1 platform proves to be a real competitive differentiator. X1 combines innovative technology with the breadth of content that is easily searchable, and customers are clearly responding. As we expand our X1 customer base, the positive customer benefits continue. X1 customers have higher customer satisfaction and better retention rates. In addition, X1 customers, compared to non-X1 customers, have 3x higher activations of DVRs, more outlets in the home and spend twice as much on pay-per-view. As a result, the overall ARPU of an X1 customer is higher. We've been adding about 5 percentage points of X1 penetration each quarter this year, and we kept that pace this quarter. We added 948,000 net new and existing customers, with nearly 45% of our residential video customers now having X1. 
Voice revenue declined by 2.4% to $878 million in the third quarter, as combined customer net additions of 2,000 were offset by a modest decline in ARPU. Our back-to-school initiatives were heavily focused on Double Play this quarter, driving a greater increase in 2-product video high-speed data customer relationships versus the Triple Play that includes Voice. 
Let's now turn to business services, which continues to deliver excellent results. Revenue increased 15.5% to $1.4 billion, with a small business segment accounting for over 70% of our revenue and 60% of our growth, driven primarily by the net increase in customers. Revenue for the midsize business segment has a higher growth rate, fueled by primarily additional Ethernet sites as we continue to invest in expanding that business. 
Cable advertising revenue increased 7.7% to $634 million, reflecting higher political revenue related to the upcoming elections. Excluding the political contribution, our cable advertising revenue decreased 2%. 
Turning to Slide 6. Second quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 5.5% to $5 billion, resulting in a margin of 39.7% compared to 40.2% in the third quarter of 2015, driven by higher expenses primarily related to increases in programming costs and the investments we are making to improve the customer experience. Programming expenses grew 11.4%, reflecting the timing of programming contract renewals. The underlying growth continues to be driven by higher retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs. For the full year, we expect program expense growth to be slightly above 10%. Nonprogramming expenses increased 5.6%, reflecting higher expenses to continue the rollout of X1; planned investment to improve the customer experience, driven primarily by increased technicians and service personnel; and an increase in advertising, marketing and promotion costs. Year-to-date, our cable operating margin is down 40 basis points, and that is roughly where we would expect to end the year. 
Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. On Slide 7, you can see NBCUniversal's revenues increased 28.3% and operating cash flow increased 31.5%. Adjusting to include the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan in last year's results, pro forma revenue increased 22.5%, and operating cash flow increased 19.2%. These exceptional results were driven in part by the success of the Rio Olympics, which added $1.6 billion in revenue, of which $1.2 billion is related to advertising revenue and is included in the Cable Networks and Broadcast segments. In addition to the Olympics, NBCUniversal results reflect strong performance at parks and broadcast as well as the theatrical success of the Secret Life of Pets. 
Cable Networks revenue increased 22% to $2.9 billion, including $432 million of revenue associated with the Rio Olympics. Excluding the Olympics, revenue increased 4.1%, reflecting higher distribution and content licensing and other revenue and relatively flat advertising revenue. This was primarily driven by distribution revenue which increased about 6%, driven by contractual rate increases and contract renewals partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers at our Cable Networks. 
Advertising revenue was relatively stable, reflecting strong pricing, offset by audience rating declines at our Cable Networks. Operating cash flow increased 7% to $893 million, reflecting a profitable Olympics and increased sports programming costs as well as our continued investment in original programming. 
Broadcast Television had another strong quarter with revenue growth of 56.6% to $3.1 billion, including $1.2 billion of revenue associated with the Rio Olympics. Excluding the Olympics, revenue declined 3.6%, reflecting lower content licensing revenue, partially offset by higher retransmission and advertising revenue. Content licensing revenue declined 32% due to a difficult comparison to last year's results, which included new Law & Order syndication deals. Excluding the Olympics, distribution and other revenue growth of 21% was driven by a 52% increase in retransmission revenue. 
Last, advertising revenue increased a healthy 4%, reflecting a strong scatter market. Broadcast operating cash flow increased by $228 million to $378 million, reflecting a profitable Olympics and growth in high-margin retransmission consent fees as well as lower programming costs compared to last year. 
Film revenue declined 7.9% to $1.8 billion, and operating cash flow declined 6.1% to $353 million. These results include DreamWorks from its acquisition date of August 22, including $50 million related to severance. Excluding this charge, operating cash flow increased as the successful performance of the Secret Life of Pets and higher content licensing more than offset the difficult comparison to last year's record third quarter, which included Minions and Jurassic World. 
Theme Parks revenue increased 60.6% to $1.4 billion, and operating cash flow increased 62.4% to $706 million in the third quarter of 2016. On a pro forma basis for Universal Japan, revenue increased 16.1%, and operating cash flow increased 17.1%. These results reflect higher attendance and higher per capita spending, driven by the successful opening of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood as well as the positive impact of a stronger Japanese yen, which accounted for about 1/3 of the growth. We are pleased with the performance of Harry Potter in Hollywood as it is trending in line with previous Potter launches at our other parks. Partially offsetting these results were higher costs associated with new attractions like King Kong that opened in Orlando this past summer. 
Let's move to Slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures increased 11.1% to $2.4 billion in the third quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 10.4% to $2 billion for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, have increased 10.5% to $5.5 billion, representing capital intensity of 14.8% compared to 14.2% for the first 9 months of 2015. While the largest component of our capital spending continues to be customer premise equipment, including X1 and wireless gateways, the largest source of year-over-year growth in spending is our investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity. We believe this investment in scalable infrastructure enhances our competitive position in broadband by staying ahead of rapid growth in bandwidth consumption by our customers. In addition, we have extended our network to more customer addresses, primarily business addresses, through line extensions. We continue to expect that for the full year of 2016, our cable capital intensity will remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%. 
At NBCUniversal, capital expenditures increased 16.3% to $336 million in the third quarter and increased 19.5% to $991 million on a year-to-date basis, driven by the inclusion of Universal Studios Japan. We continue to expect NBCUniversal's CapEx to increase approximately 10% this year. 
Now finishing up on Slide 9. On a year-to-date basis, we generated $5.6 billion in free cash flow, a decrease of 23.8% over the comparable period of 2015, primarily driven by lower third quarter results. Consolidated free cash flow in the third quarter declined 48.5% to $1.4 billion, reflecting the 10.5% growth in operating cash flow, which was offset by an increase in capital expenditures, as we just reviewed, and higher working capital, primarily due to the 2016 Rio Olympics. This is a timing issue, and we will see a positive swing in Olympic working capital in the fourth quarter. 
In terms of capital returns, dividend payments during the quarter were $663 million, up 6.5%, and share repurchases were $1.4 billion, consistent with our plan to repurchase $5 billion of our common stock during the full year. We ended the quarter at 2.2x net leverage, primarily reflecting the closing of the DreamWorks acquisition and payment of a deposit in the third quarter. 
So that concludes our summary of the quarter. I hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our the results as well as our momentum. And now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A."

I think we all have a healthy degree of skepticism that these new over-the-top entrants are going to create millions and millions and millions of subscribers anytime soon. I think if you look at the cable ecosystem, I've now been with Comcast for 18 years. And for 18 years, Comcast earnings have been up every single quarter. And yes, as new entrants come in, they take fractional share away from the existing suppliers. But the fact of the matter is most people find tremendous value and enjoyment in their cable or satellite subscription and are not looking to change. And there's all sorts of issues that over-the-top providers are going to have to deal with, including cost and service and everything else. So I think there could be a modest positive for NBCUniversal. I don't expect it to be material in the next year or 2. But I think over time, as some of those 20 million nonsubscribers become subscribers, it would be positive."

So you take this box, you plug it in, and you attach it, if you want, to your television with an HDMI, and that's it. And it doesn't have to have any cable in that room.

In the case of the Olympics, London was the biggest Olympics that we ever had in terms of primetime ratings. Rio was lower than London, but Rio was really on a par with the previous 3 Summer Olympics. And if you look at all the various ways of consuming, we had an extraordinary Olympics financially, ratings, advertiser happiness, et cetera. The streaming portion of the viewership was actually very low relative to television for the Olympics, call it, 1% or 2%. And I think the same numbers apply to the NFL, 1% or 2%. 1% of people stream NFL games. I think what's really -- and by the way, the NFL, we had an extraordinary season last year, which everybody is comparing to. We're actually down versus last year, but down much less versus 2 years ago. It's -- I think it's very difficult to tell precisely what's happening on any sporting property, particularly in the case of the NFL because it's only been a half dozen weeks. I do think there a lot of different things that people are using to -- consuming on the Internet and spending their time on. I also think there are seasons that are stronger than other seasons. And we may be in a season, just speaking for Sunday Night Football, where the matchups aren't as good as they could have been. But if you step back, the Olympics and the NFL are the 2 highest-rated programs of the year in all of television. They dominate the nights that they're on. They dominate -- as Brian mentioned, during the Olympics, we're 4x the next highest-rated show. Sunday Night Football is, by far, the highest-rated show on television. And we have very, very good partnerships with the International Olympic Committee and the NFL that go out many, many years. And those are very profitable relationships. So we're watching it. And obviously, you'd rather have ratings up than down. But having ratings decline modestly and still be very, very strong properties doesn't cause us too much concern."

For the quarter, our advertising for Broadcast ex Olympics was up 4%. Our advertising for Cable ex Olympics was about flat. And the up 4% is the sign of CPMs being high enough on the Broadcast side to go over -- to exceed ratings decline. And in Cable, they were about flat. Cable, in the last quarter, there are certain quarters where we have more new launches and more things going on. And of course, the Olympics really took a lot of the advertising from the ongoing programs during the quarter."

Something like 100 million Americans consumed at least part of the Olympics online. It was a huge, huge phenomenon on Snapchat and Facebook and other places. And the inability for us to articulately walk into an advertiser and talk about all that consumption in an aggregated way is a real problem. And it's a problem that, obviously, is going to get solved, but the progress is not as great as it should be. I think what everybody wants is pretty obvious. They want to know what is the total audience delivery of a television show wherever it gets consumed, and they want it to be done by a third party in a way that is objective and quantifiable. And that's what we're all working to. I think the world is moving towards C7 from C3. I think the world is moving toward measuring alternative vehicles. And I think most advertisers understand, when they buy a hit property, they're going to get a lot of consumption elsewhere. And they sort of factor that into the effectiveness intellectually, but you'd certainly love for it to be done in a quantifiable way by an unbiased third party. And we're not making enough progress on that."

The first is, it looks like the industry is moving more towards the Comcast model more vertically integrated and so on with, obviously, the Time Warner deal, Verizon buying content and so on. So from that perspective, you guys have a unique vantage point, given you had NBC for a while. If you could talk a little bit about what the advantages of that model are and whether owning NBC as well as Cable on the other side of it provides a better business model from a consumer perspective as well as for the company as a whole. And secondly, from the perspective of the X1 platform, obviously, it's an industry-leading platform. And the way the content is presented there is in a disaggregated format. From that perspective, in terms of the vision you have of how video can be packaged maybe 5 years from now, does the bundle, in any form, I mean, skinny or nonskinny, make any sense in the next 5 years or 10 years, given how the industry is evolving and consumption patterns are evolving?"

What X1 does, from my perspective, our perspective, I think is really help you with search, navigation, discovery and enjoyment of the content you end up deciding to procure. So if you just pick a movie star, you put the -- you now talk to the remote, you say it, and then it gives you recommendations. And it tells you every episode now, whether that episode resides on Netflix or resides on a broadcaster, or resides on the cable network or if you DVR-ed it. And then it's more like this. And it gives you lots of choices. So in the case -- to your point, we'll be upselling Netflix, as an example, I guess, as we upsell HBO and Showtime and others. So some content allows you to be show by show or network by network. But it's the breadth of all the choices in the bundle that I think is what has powered this industry. And clearly, as Neil said, we need to evolve and continue to progress, and we will, and we need to compete with whatever the future brings. But the investment that we've made and the innovation and the people we recruited, I think, sort of ties to your first question. Very broadly put, Comcast-NBCUniversal is a very special company, and we've moved hundreds of people back and forth between different parts of the company in the corporate office. We -- the Olympics, I think, are just a shining example of where all those live streams that Steve was just talking about were available on X1 and on the NBC Sports app. And you could get there through your Voice remote or through your XFINITY mobile app. And we're -- we call that symphony. And we've seen it whether it's talent wanting to work with the company, people wanting to join the company or innovation that the company is doing. And could we do more? And will we do more and innovate? Yes. But we've seen a lot of people want to use the X1 platform. There are other operators around the world, in Canada with Cox, and we've had others requesting to use the platform. So we're -- it seems to be resonating in almost every part of the ecosystem, the strategy we're on. And again, you get to a quarter like this and you see it really all working all together so..."

I'm pleased to report terrific operational and financial results during the third quarter. Consolidated revenue and operating cash flow were up 14% and 11%, respectively, driven by broad-based strength across",1008,"Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report terrific operational and financial results during the third quarter. Consolidated revenue and operating cash flow were up 14% and 11%, respectively, driven by broad-based strength across the company. And for a company of our size, this is a tremendous result. From our perspective, 3 things stood out in the quarter: our results in video, which were the best for a third quarter in the last 10 years; in broadband, which were the best in 7 years; and our successful broadcast and distribution of the Rio Olympics. 
Let's start with Rio, which again validated that the Olympics are the most valuable and most consumed property in media. NBC won all 17 nights of primetime, and the NBC Sports Network was the #1 sports cable network in primetime over the 14 days that it presented live coverage of the games. In fact, in the 18 to 49 demo, NBC's primetime ratings more than quadrupled the other broadcast networks combined and were nearly 5x greater with millennials. Moreover, that lead widened versus prior Olympics. The audience for the Rio Olympics was enormous, encompassing almost 200 million Americans on television alone, not to mention those who also engaged on our other platforms. Rio was also very strong from a financial perspective, significantly exceeding our prior results, and we believe it will continue to be a big success going forward. One of the key reasons for our outstanding performance with the games is that our teams from across Comcast NBCUniversal worked so well together. We partnered closely, innovated quickly and as a result, delivered the most comprehensive and technologically advanced Olympics coverage in history. 
In our TV businesses, the Olympics drove our exceptional performance during the quarter and were a great way to wrap up our 2015-2016 television season. NBC finished the season as the #1 broadcast network for the third year in a row and was also the #1 broadcast network for the sixth summer in a row. And the fall season is off to a good start with This Is Us as the highest-rated new series and Saturday Night Live kicking off its 42nd season with its highest-rated premieres in 3 years. 
Telemundo is another bright spot in broadcast. It was the #1-rated Spanish language TV network in Monday to Friday primetime for the quarter. We have fundamentally repositioned this network through investments in original content, infrastructure and talent. And it's working. 
Our Cable Networks delivered solid cash flow growth. We had a lot of successes in entertainment, sports and news in the quarter. MSNBC's ratings were up 95%, and we also announced an exclusive deal in which all 8 of the Harry Potter films will begin airing on U.S.A. in Sci-fi beginning in 2018, plus we have rights to air the films across our other television properties, too. We believe we are taking the right steps and remain on a trajectory to continue to grow this business. 
At film, we completed the acquisition of DreamWorks, and we're happy to welcome the team to the Comcast NBCUniversal family. 
In animation, the Secret Life of Pets from Illumination was a huge hit during the quarter. It had the highest-ever opening in the U.S. for an original animated movie and importantly, gives us another valuable franchise. Looking ahead, we're thrilled about our new original animated film, Sing, which opens in the U.S. in December. I believe this is one of the best movies that Chris Meledandri and the team at Illumination has ever made. 
At Theme Parks, we also delivered fantastic results. We continue to be extremely pleased with the opening of Harry Potter in Hollywood. 
Now over Cable, the team continued to expertly balance improvement in the financial and customer results. We generated strong growth in revenue and operating cash flow while also achieving some of our best customer metrics in nearly a decade. We ended the quarter with 28.3 million customer relationships, adding 216,000 during the quarter. 
In video, we added 32,000 customers in the quarter. We now have added 170,000 video customers in the last 12 months. We also delivered great results in high-speed Internet, adding 330,000 customers during the quarter. 
Across all of our product categories, better customer retention was a key driver of our performance. So how are we doing this? Well, we've shifted the culture of our company to put the customer truly first, and that's driving the focus of our product and technology innovation and also our customer service. A perfect example is Netflix, which we have now integrated into X1. Our agreement with Netflix highlights the flexibility that we have in our platform and what a fantastic showcase X1 is for different types of content, all in an elegantly designed and integrated experience. We did the same integration with live sports with the Olympics. 
Similarly, in high-speed Internet, we're increasing speed and continue to deliver the fastest in-home Wi-Fi. Earlier this year, we launched a new residential Internet service that delivers gigabit speeds to customers using DOCSIS 3.1 technology. We're also leveraging our position in the home to offer new services. And this was through Voice, when we introduced it, and more recently, our home security product. And as we announced last month, we're planning to bring a wireless service to our customers in mid-2017 as part of an attractively priced, multiproduct bundle. Stay tuned, and we'll have more to tell you about this at a later date. 
Finally, we continue to make significant strides with customer service. Our efforts are focused on 3 areas: First, serving our customers faster; second, improving and simplifying the experience, particularly in onboarding, billing and repair; and third, fixing issues the first time. And when we fall short, making it right. 
So all in all, I'm really proud of the performance in the quarter, and we're encouraged by the momentum that we have in our businesses. Our teams are executing well and also working well together. And we're excited and optimistic about our future. 
Mike, over to you."

I'm starting on Slide 4 for those following the presentation online. Our third quarter results reflect consistent execution and broad-based strength across our businesses. Consolidated revenue increased 14.2%,",1894,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody. I'm starting on Slide 4 for those following the presentation online. 
Our third quarter results reflect consistent execution and broad-based strength across our businesses. Consolidated revenue increased 14.2%, and operating cash flow grew 10.5% for the third quarter, reflecting solid growth in our Cable business and strong growth at NBCUniversal, partly driven by the success of the Rio Olympics. 
Earnings per share was $0.92, a 15% increase compared to a year ago. And free cash flow was $1.4 billion in the quarter, a decline of 48.5%. This decline was driven by higher working capital primarily related to the Rio Olympics. We will go into greater detail on these results on the slides to come. 
Now let's start with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable Communications delivered strong third quarter results. Revenues increased 6.9% to $12.6 billion as we increased customer relationships and grew total revenue per customer relationship by 3.6% to $148 per month. We added 216,000 customer relationships, driven by 2 product customer additions and a reduction in churn across all products. In fact, we have improved churn in video and high-speed data for 32 consecutive months, as customers increasingly recognize the value of our X1 platform and superior high-speed data products and we make meaningful strides in improving customer service. 
High-speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 8.8% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, reflecting an increase in our customer base; rate adjustments, which were more modest compared to the prior year; and customers subscribing to higher levels of service. Our customer momentum continued as we added a combined 330,000 residential and business customers in the quarter, up 3% over last year's net adds. And we added 1.4 million combined customers over the past 12 months. We continue to benefit from growth in the overall market and gain market share as customers respond to our product differentiation. We've increased Internet speeds 17 times in the last 15 years. About 80% of our residential customers take speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. And we have over 15 million Wi-Fi hotspots for our customers to access, which, combined, greatly increases our customer value proposition and competitive differentiation. 
Video revenue increased 4.5% to $5.6 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services and growth in our customer base. Our rate adjustments are primarily from broadcast TV and RSN fees, as we have noted in previous quarters, are the most significant sources of our programming cost pressure. In terms of volume, we have consistently improved our video customer metrics for several quarters. In the third quarter, we continued the momentum and added a combined 32,000 net video customers, an improvement of 80,000 versus the year-ago quarter, and as Brian noted, making this our best third quarter result in 10 years. 
Driving these impressive customer metrics is improved customer retention, as our X1 platform proves to be a real competitive differentiator. X1 combines innovative technology with a breadth of content that is easily searchable, and customers are clearly responding. As we expand our X1 customer base, the positive customer benefits continue. X1 customers have higher customer satisfaction and better retention rates. In addition, X1 customers, compared to non-X1 customers, have 3x higher activations of DVRs, more outlets in the home and spend twice as much on pay-per-view. As a result, the overall ARPU of an X1 customer is higher. We've been adding about 5 percentage points of X1 penetration each quarter this year, and we kept that pace this quarter. We added 948,000 net new and existing customers, with nearly 45% of our residential video customers now having X1. 
Voice revenue declined by 2.4% to $878 million in the third quarter, as combined customer net additions of 2,000 were offset by a modest decline in ARPU. Our back-to-school initiatives were heavily focused on Double Play this quarter, driving a greater increase in 2-product video high-speed data customer relationships versus the Triple Play that includes Voice. 
Let's now turn to business services, which continues to deliver excellent results. Revenue increased 15.5% to $1.4 billion, with the small business segment accounting for over 70% of our revenue and 60% of our growth, driven primarily by the net increase in customers. Revenue for the midsize business segment has a higher growth rate, fueled by primarily additional Ethernet sites as we continue to invest in expanding that business. 
Cable advertising revenue increased 7.7% to $634 million, reflecting higher political revenue related to the upcoming elections. Excluding the political contribution, our cable advertising revenue decreased 2%. 
Turning to Slide 6. Second quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 5.5% to $5 billion, resulting in a margin of 39.7% compared to 40.2% in the third quarter of 2015, driven by higher expenses primarily related to increases in programming costs and the investments we are making to improve the customer experience. Programming expenses grew 11.4%, reflecting the timing of programming contract renewals. The underlying growth continues to be driven by higher retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs. For the full year, we expect program expense growth to be slightly above 10%. Nonprogramming expenses increased 5.6%, reflecting higher expenses to continue the rollout of X1; planned investment to improve the customer experience, driven primarily by increased technicians and service personnel; and an increase in advertising, marketing and promotion costs. Year-to-date, our cable operating margin is down 40 basis points, and that is roughly where we would expect to end the year. 
Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. On Slide 7, you can see NBCUniversal's revenues increased 28.3% and operating cash flow increased 31.5%. Adjusting to include the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan in last year's results, pro forma revenue increased 22.5%, and operating cash flow increased 19.2%. These exceptional results were driven in part by the success of the Rio Olympics, which added $1.6 billion in revenue, of which $1.2 billion is related to advertising revenue and is included in the Cable Networks and Broadcast segments. In addition to the Olympics, NBCUniversal results reflect strong performance at parks and broadcast as well as the theatrical success of the Secret Life of Pets. 
Cable Networks revenue increased 22% to $2.9 billion, including $432 million of revenue associated with the Rio Olympics. Excluding the Olympics, revenue increased 4.1%, reflecting higher distribution and content licensing and other revenue and relatively flat advertising revenue. This was primarily driven by distribution revenue which increased about 6%, driven by contractual rate increases and contract renewals partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers at our Cable Networks. 
Advertising revenue was relatively stable, reflecting strong pricing offset by audience rating declines at our Cable Networks. Operating cash flow increased 7% to $893 million, reflecting a profitable Olympics and increased sports programming costs as well as our continued investment in original programming. 
Broadcast Television had another strong quarter with revenue growth of 56.6% to $3.1 billion, including $1.2 billion of revenue associated with the Rio Olympics. Excluding the Olympics, revenue declined 3.6%, reflecting lower content licensing revenue, partially offset by higher retransmission and advertising revenue. Content licensing revenue declined 32% due to a difficult comparison to last year's results, which included new Law & Order syndication deals. Excluding the Olympics, distribution and other revenue growth of 21% was driven by a 52% increase in retransmission revenue. 
Last, advertising revenue increased a healthy 4%, reflecting a strong scatter market. Broadcast operating cash flow increased by $228 million to $378 million, reflecting a profitable Olympics and growth in high-margin retransmission consent fees as well as lower programming costs compared to last year. 
Film revenue declined 7.9% to $1.8 billion, and operating cash flow declined 6.1% to $353 million. These results include DreamWorks from its acquisition date of August 22, including $50 million related to severance. Excluding this charge, operating cash flow increased as the successful performance of the Secret Life of Pets and higher content licensing more than offset the difficult comparison to last year's record third quarter, which included Minions and Jurassic World. 
Theme Parks revenue increased 60.6% to $1.4 billion, and operating cash flow increased 62.4% to $706 million in the third quarter of 2016. On a pro forma basis for Universal Japan, revenue increased 16.1%, and operating cash flow increased 17.1%. These results reflect higher attendance and higher per capita spending, driven by the successful opening of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood as well as the positive impact of a stronger Japanese yen, which accounted for about 1/3 of the growth. We are pleased with the performance of Harry Potter in Hollywood as it is trending in line with previous Potter launches at our other parks. Partially offsetting these results were higher costs associated with new attractions like King Kong that opened in Orlando this past summer. 
Let's move to Slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures increased 11.1% to $2.4 billion in the third quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 10.4% to $2 billion for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, have increased 10.5% to $5.5 billion, representing capital intensity of 14.8% compared to 14.2% for the first 9 months of 2015. While the largest component of our capital spending continues to be customer on-premise equipment, including X1 and wireless gateways, the largest source of year-over-year growth in spending is our investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity. We believe this investment in scalable infrastructure enhances our competitive position in broadband by staying ahead of rapid growth in bandwidth consumption by our customers. In addition, we have extended our network to more customer addresses, primarily business addresses, through line extensions. We continue to expect that for the full year of 2016, our cable capital intensity will remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%. 
At NBCUniversal, capital expenditures increased 16.3% to $336 million in the third quarter and increased 19.5% to $991 million on a year-to-date basis, driven by the inclusion of Universal Studios Japan. We continue to expect NBCUniversal's CapEx to increase approximately 10% this year. 
Now finishing up on Slide 9. On a year-to-date basis, we generated $5.6 billion in free cash flow, a decrease of 23.8% over the comparable period of 2015, primarily driven by lower third quarter results. Consolidated free cash flow in the third quarter declined 48.5% to $1.4 billion, reflecting the 10.5% growth in operating cash flow, which was offset by an increase in capital expenditures, as we just reviewed, and higher working capital, primarily due to the 2016 Rio Olympics. This is a timing issue, and we will see a positive swing in Olympic working capital in the fourth quarter. 
In terms of capital returns, dividend payments during the quarter were $663 million, up 6.5%, and share repurchases were $1.4 billion, consistent with our plan to repurchase $5 billion of our common stock during the full year. We ended the quarter at 2.2x net leverage, primarily reflecting the closing of the DreamWorks acquisition and payment of a deposit in the third quarter. 
So that concludes our summary of the quarter. I hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our the results as well as our momentum. And now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A."

First, I'd like to ask about the business services side, which is certainly additive to growth with the continued deceleration, while capital intensity is increasing is interesting. Should we be looking at this as a $200 million a year of incremental growth and the percent falling? Or is it hard to hold that dollars of growth? And is anything happening in pricing or competition? And then just following up on your churn comments, is video strength still mostly a churn-driven improvement? Or are gross adds up year-over-year as well maybe due to your segmenting efforts?"

But one of the things that frequently is cited is that more consumption of these events is happening online. You're a big partner with both of the examples I cited, and you were very involved, obviously, in both the linear and the online distribution of the Olympics. And so it would seem that you have a unique vantage point. So I guess my question is, what do you think is going on here? Do you think that viewership of these events has actually declined? Or do you think it is correct to assume that more of it has gone to a streaming format so it's not being captured? And if that is the case, how do you make sure, as you move ahead, that you're able to monetize your role in those events properly?"

In the case of the Olympics, London was the biggest Olympics that we ever had in terms of primetime ratings. Rio was lower than London, but Rio was really on a par with the previous 3 Summer Olympics. And if you look at all the various ways of consuming, we had an extraordinary Olympics -- financially, ratings, advertiser happiness, et cetera. The streaming portion of the viewership was actually very low relative to television for the Olympics, call it, 1% or 2%. And I think the same numbers apply to the NFL, 1% or 2%. 1% of people stream NFL games. I think what's really -- and by the way, the NFL, we had an extraordinary season last year, which everybody is comparing to. We're actually down versus last year, but down much less versus 2 years ago. It's -- I think it's very difficult to tell precisely what's happening on any sporting property, particularly in the case of the NFL because it's only been a half dozen weeks. I do think there a lot of different things that people are using to -- consuming on the Internet and spending their time on. I also think there are seasons that are stronger than other seasons. And we may be in a season, just speaking for Sunday Night Football, where the matchups aren't as good as they could have been. But if you step back, the Olympics and the NFL are the 2 highest-rated programs of the year in all of television. They dominate the nights that they're on. They dominate -- as Brian mentioned, during the Olympics, we're 4x the next highest-rated show. Sunday Night Football is, by far, the highest-rated show on television. And we have very, very good partnerships with the International Olympic Committee and the NFL that go out many, many years. And those are very profitable relationships. So we're watching it. And obviously, you'd rather have ratings up than down. But having ratings decline modestly and still be very, very strong properties doesn't cause us too much concern."

And it's a problem that, obviously, is going to get solved, but the progress is not as great as it should be. I think what everybody wants is pretty obvious. They want to know what is the total audience delivery of a television show wherever it gets consumed, and they want it to be done by a third party in a way that is objective and quantifiable. And that's what we're all working to. I think the world is moving towards C7 from C3. I think the world is moving toward measuring alternative vehicles.

What X1 does, from my perspective, our perspective, I think is really help you with search, navigation, discovery and enjoyment of the content you end up deciding to procure. So if you just take a movie star, you put her -- you now talk to the remote, you say it, and then it gives you recommendations. And it tells you every episode now, whether that episode resides on Netflix or resides on a broadcaster, or resides on the cable network or if you DVR-ed it. And then it's more like this. And it gives you lots of choices. So in the case -- to your point, we'll be upselling Netflix, as an example, I guess, as we upsell HBO and Showtime and others. So some content allows you to be show by show or network by network. But it's the breadth of all the choices in the bundle that I think is what has powered this industry. And clearly, as Neil said, we need to evolve and continue to progress, and we will, and we need to compete with whatever the future brings. But the investment that we've made and the innovation and the people we recruited, I think, sort of ties to your first question. Very broadly put, Comcast-NBCUniversal is a very special company, and we've moved hundreds of people back and forth between different parts of the company in the corporate office. We -- the Olympics, I think, are just a shining example of where all those live streams that Steve was just talking about were available on X1 and on the NBC Sports app. And you could get there through your Voice remote or through your XFINITY mobile app. And we're -- we call that Symphony. And we've seen it whether it's talent wanting to work with the company, people wanting to join the company or innovation that the company is doing. And could we do more? And will we do more and innovate? Yes. But we've seen a lot of people want to use the X1 platform. There are other operators around the world, in Canada and with Cox, and we've had others requesting to use the platform. So we're -- it seems to be resonating in almost every part of the ecosystem, the strategy we're on. And again, you get to a quarter like this and you see it really all working all together so..."

I'm pleased to report terrific operational and financial results during the third quarter. Consolidated revenue and operating cash flow were up 14% and 11%, respectively, driven by broad-based strength across",1008,"Thank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report terrific operational and financial results during the third quarter. Consolidated revenue and operating cash flow were up 14% and 11%, respectively, driven by broad-based strength across the company. And for a company of our size, this is a tremendous result. From our perspective, 3 things stood out in the quarter: our results in video, which were the best for a third quarter in the last 10 years; in broadband, which were the best in 7 years; and our successful broadcast and distribution of the Rio Olympics. 
Let's start with Rio, which again validated that the Olympics are the most valuable and most consumed property in media. NBC won all 17 nights of primetime, and the NBC Sports Network was the #1 sports cable network in primetime over the 14 days that it presented live coverage of the games. In fact, in the 18 to 49 demo, NBC's primetime ratings more than quadrupled the other broadcast networks combined and were nearly 5x greater with millennials. Moreover, that lead widened versus prior Olympics. The audience for the Rio Olympics was enormous, encompassing almost 200 million Americans on television alone, not to mention those who also engaged on our other platforms. Rio was also very strong from a financial perspective, significantly exceeding our prior results, and we believe it will continue to be a big success going forward. One of the key reasons for our outstanding performance with the games is that our teams from across Comcast NBCUniversal worked so well together. We partnered closely, innovated quickly and as a result, delivered the most comprehensive and technologically advanced Olympics coverage in history. 
In our TV businesses, the Olympics drove our exceptional performance during the quarter and were a great way to wrap up our 2015-2016 television season. NBC finished the season as the #1 broadcast network for the third year in a row and was also the #1 broadcast network for the sixth summer in a row. And the fall season is off to a good start with This Is Us as the highest-rated new series and Saturday Night Live kicking off its 42nd season with its highest-rated premieres in 3 years. 
Telemundo is another bright spot in broadcast. It was the #1-rated Spanish language TV network in Monday to Friday primetime for the quarter. We have fundamentally repositioned this network through investments in original content, infrastructure and talent. And it's working. 
Our Cable Networks delivered solid cash flow growth. We had a lot of successes in entertainment, sports and news in the quarter. MSNBC's ratings were up 95%, and we also announced an exclusive deal in which all 8 of the Harry Potter films will begin airing on U.S.A. in Sci-fi beginning in 2018, plus we have rights to air the films across our other television properties, too. We believe we are taking the right steps and remain on a trajectory to continue to grow this business. 
At film, we completed the acquisition of DreamWorks, and we're happy to welcome the team to the Comcast NBCUniversal family. 
In animation, the Secret Life of Pets from Illumination was a huge hit during the quarter. It had the highest-ever opening in the U.S. for an original animated movie and importantly, gives us another valuable franchise. Looking ahead, we're thrilled about our new original animated film, Sing, which opens in the U.S. in December. I believe this is one of the best movies that Chris Meledandri and the team at Illumination has ever made. 
At Theme Parks, we also delivered fantastic results. We continue to be extremely pleased with the opening of Harry Potter in Hollywood. 
Now over Cable, the team continued to expertly balance improvement in the financial and customer results. We generated strong growth in revenue and operating cash flow while also achieving some of our best customer metrics in nearly a decade. We ended the quarter with 28.3 million customer relationships, adding 216,000 during the quarter. 
In video, we added 32,000 customers in the quarter. We now have added 170,000 video customers in the last 12 months. We also delivered great results in high-speed Internet, adding 330,000 customers during the quarter. 
Across all of our product categories, better customer retention was a key driver of our performance. So how are we doing this? Well, we've shifted the culture of our company to put the customer truly first, and that's driving the focus of our product and technology innovation and also our customer service. A perfect example is Netflix, which we have now integrated into X1. Our agreement with Netflix highlights the flexibility that we have in our platform and what a fantastic showcase X1 is for different types of content, all in an elegantly designed and integrated experience. We did the same integration with live sports with the Olympics. 
Similarly, in high-speed Internet, we're increasing speed and continue to deliver the fastest in-home Wi-Fi. Earlier this year, we launched a new residential Internet service that delivers gigabit speeds to customers using DOCSIS 3.1 technology. We're also leveraging our position in the home to offer new services. And this was through Voice, when we introduced it, and more recently, our home security product. And as we announced last month, we're planning to bring a wireless service to our customers in mid-2017 as part of an attractively priced, multiproduct bundle. Stay tuned, and we'll have more to tell you about this at a later date. 
Finally, we continue to make significant strides with customer service. Our efforts are focused on 3 areas: First, serving our customers faster; second, improving and simplifying the experience, particularly in onboarding, billing and repair; and third, fixing issues the first time. And when we fall short, making it right. 
So all in all, I'm really proud of the performance in the quarter, and we're encouraged by the momentum that we have in our businesses. Our teams are executing well and also working well together. And we're excited and optimistic about our future. 
Mike, over to you."

I'm starting on Slide 4 for those following the presentation online. Our third quarter results reflect consistent execution and broad-based strength across our businesses. Consolidated revenue increased 14.2%,",1894,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everybody. I'm starting on Slide 4 for those following the presentation online. 
Our third quarter results reflect consistent execution and broad-based strength across our businesses. Consolidated revenue increased 14.2%, and operating cash flow grew 10.5% for the third quarter, reflecting solid growth in our Cable business and strong growth at NBCUniversal, partly driven by the success of the Rio Olympics. 
Earnings per share was $0.92, a 15% increase compared to a year ago. And free cash flow was $1.4 billion in the quarter, a decline of 48.5%. This decline was driven by higher working capital primarily related to the Rio Olympics. We will go into greater detail on these results on the slides to come. 
Now let's start with Cable Communications on Slide 5. Cable Communications delivered strong third quarter results. Revenues increased 6.9% to $12.6 billion as we increased customer relationships and grew total revenue per customer relationship by 3.6% to $148 per month. We added 216,000 customer relationships, driven by 2 product customer additions and a reduction in churn across all products. In fact, we have improved churn in video and high-speed data for 32 consecutive months, as customers increasingly recognize the value of our X1 platform and superior high-speed data products and we make meaningful strides in improving customer service. 
High-speed Internet continues to be the largest contributor to overall cable revenue growth. Revenue increased 8.8% to $3.4 billion in the quarter, reflecting an increase in our customer base; rate adjustments, which were more modest compared to the prior year; and customers subscribing to higher levels of service. Our customer momentum continued as we added a combined 330,000 residential and business customers in the quarter, up 3% over last year's net adds. And we added 1.4 million combined customers over the past 12 months. We continue to benefit from growth in the overall market and gain market share as customers respond to our product differentiation. We've increased Internet speeds 17 times in the last 15 years. About 80% of our residential customers take speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. And we have over 15 million Wi-Fi hotspots for our customers to access, which, combined, greatly increases our customer value proposition and competitive differentiation. 
Video revenue increased 4.5% to $5.6 billion in the quarter, primarily due to rate adjustments as well as customers subscribing to additional services and growth in our customer base. Our rate adjustments are primarily from broadcast TV and RSN fees, as we have noted in previous quarters, are the most significant sources of our programming cost pressure. In terms of volume, we have consistently improved our video customer metrics for several quarters. In the third quarter, we continued the momentum and added a combined 32,000 net video customers, an improvement of 80,000 versus the year-ago quarter, and as Brian noted, making this our best third quarter result in 10 years. 
Driving these impressive customer metrics is improved customer retention, as our X1 platform proves to be a real competitive differentiator. X1 combines innovative technology with a breadth of content that is easily searchable, and customers are clearly responding. As we expand our X1 customer base, the positive customer benefits continue. X1 customers have higher customer satisfaction and better retention rates. In addition, X1 customers, compared to non-X1 customers, have 3x higher activations of DVRs, more outlets in the home and spend twice as much on pay-per-view. As a result, the overall ARPU of an X1 customer is higher. We've been adding about 5 percentage points of X1 penetration each quarter this year, and we kept that pace this quarter. We added 948,000 net new and existing customers, with nearly 45% of our residential video customers now having X1. 
Voice revenue declined by 2.4% to $878 million in the third quarter, as combined customer net additions of 2,000 were offset by a modest decline in ARPU. Our back-to-school initiatives were heavily focused on Double Play this quarter, driving a greater increase in 2-product video high-speed data customer relationships versus the Triple Play that includes Voice. 
Let's now turn to business services, which continues to deliver excellent results. Revenue increased 15.5% to $1.4 billion, with the small business segment accounting for over 70% of our revenue and 60% of our growth, driven primarily by the net increase in customers. Revenue for the midsize business segment has a higher growth rate, fueled by primarily additional Ethernet sites as we continue to invest in expanding that business. 
Cable advertising revenue increased 7.7% to $634 million, reflecting higher political revenue related to the upcoming elections. Excluding the political contribution, our cable advertising revenue decreased 2%. 
Turning to Slide 6. Second quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 5.5% to $5 billion, resulting in a margin of 39.7% compared to 40.2% in the third quarter of 2015, driven by higher expenses primarily related to increases in programming costs and the investments we are making to improve the customer experience. Programming expenses grew 11.4%, reflecting the timing of programming contract renewals. The underlying growth continues to be driven by higher retransmission consent fees and sports programming costs. For the full year, we expect program expense growth to be slightly above 10%. Nonprogramming expenses increased 5.6%, reflecting higher expenses to continue the rollout of X1; planned investment to improve the customer experience, driven primarily by increased technicians and service personnel; and an increase in advertising, marketing and promotion costs. Year-to-date, our cable operating margin is down 40 basis points, and that is roughly where we would expect to end the year. 
Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results. On Slide 7, you can see NBCUniversal's revenues increased 28.3% and operating cash flow increased 31.5%. Adjusting to include the acquisition of Universal Studios Japan in last year's results, pro forma revenue increased 22.5%, and operating cash flow increased 19.2%. These exceptional results were driven in part by the success of the Rio Olympics, which added $1.6 billion in revenue, of which $1.2 billion is related to advertising revenue and is included in the Cable Networks and Broadcast segments. In addition to the Olympics, NBCUniversal results reflect strong performance at parks and broadcast as well as the theatrical success of the Secret Life of Pets. 
Cable Networks revenue increased 22% to $2.9 billion, including $432 million of revenue associated with the Rio Olympics. Excluding the Olympics, revenue increased 4.1%, reflecting higher distribution and content licensing and other revenue and relatively flat advertising revenue. This was primarily driven by distribution revenue which increased about 6%, driven by contractual rate increases and contract renewals partially offset by a slight decline in subscribers at our Cable Networks. 
Advertising revenue was relatively stable, reflecting strong pricing offset by audience rating declines at our Cable Networks. Operating cash flow increased 7% to $893 million, reflecting a profitable Olympics and increased sports programming costs as well as our continued investment in original programming. 
Broadcast Television had another strong quarter with revenue growth of 56.6% to $3.1 billion, including $1.2 billion of revenue associated with the Rio Olympics. Excluding the Olympics, revenue declined 3.6%, reflecting lower content licensing revenue, partially offset by higher retransmission and advertising revenue. Content licensing revenue declined 32% due to a difficult comparison to last year's results, which included new Law & Order syndication deals. Excluding the Olympics, distribution and other revenue growth of 21% was driven by a 52% increase in retransmission revenue. 
Last, advertising revenue increased a healthy 4%, reflecting a strong scatter market. Broadcast operating cash flow increased by $228 million to $378 million, reflecting a profitable Olympics and growth in high-margin retransmission consent fees as well as lower programming costs compared to last year. 
Film revenue declined 7.9% to $1.8 billion, and operating cash flow declined 6.1% to $353 million. These results include DreamWorks from its acquisition date of August 22, including $50 million related to severance. Excluding this charge, operating cash flow increased as the successful performance of the Secret Life of Pets and higher content licensing more than offset the difficult comparison to last year's record third quarter, which included Minions and Jurassic World. 
Theme Parks revenue increased 60.6% to $1.4 billion, and operating cash flow increased 62.4% to $706 million in the third quarter of 2016. On a pro forma basis for Universal Japan, revenue increased 16.1%, and operating cash flow increased 17.1%. These results reflect higher attendance and higher per capita spending, driven by the successful opening of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood as well as the positive impact of a stronger Japanese yen, which accounted for about 1/3 of the growth. We are pleased with the performance of Harry Potter in Hollywood as it is trending in line with previous Potter launches at our other parks. Partially offsetting these results were higher costs associated with new attractions like King Kong that opened in Orlando this past summer. 
Let's move to Slide 8 to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. Consolidated capital expenditures increased 11.1% to $2.4 billion in the third quarter. At Cable Communications, capital expenditures increased 10.4% to $2 billion for the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, have increased 10.5% to $5.5 billion, representing capital intensity of 14.8% compared to 14.2% for the first 9 months of 2015. While the largest component of our capital spending continues to be customer on-premise equipment, including X1 and wireless gateways, the largest source of year-over-year growth in spending is our investment in scalable infrastructure to increase network capacity. We believe this investment in scalable infrastructure enhances our competitive position in broadband by staying ahead of rapid growth in bandwidth consumption by our customers. In addition, we have extended our network to more customer addresses, primarily business addresses, through line extensions. We continue to expect that for the full year of 2016, our cable capital intensity will remain flat to 2015 at approximately 15%. 
At NBCUniversal, capital expenditures increased 16.3% to $336 million in the third quarter and increased 19.5% to $991 million on a year-to-date basis, driven by the inclusion of Universal Studios Japan. We continue to expect NBCUniversal's CapEx to increase approximately 10% this year. 
Now finishing up on Slide 9. On a year-to-date basis, we generated $5.6 billion in free cash flow, a decrease of 23.8% over the comparable period of 2015, primarily driven by lower third quarter results. Consolidated free cash flow in the third quarter declined 48.5% to $1.4 billion, reflecting the 10.5% growth in operating cash flow, which was offset by an increase in capital expenditures, as we just reviewed, and higher working capital, primarily due to the 2016 Rio Olympics. This is a timing issue, and we will see a positive swing in Olympic working capital in the fourth quarter. 
In terms of capital returns, dividend payments during the quarter were $663 million, up 6.5%, and share repurchases were $1.4 billion, consistent with our plan to repurchase $5 billion of our common stock during the full year. We ended the quarter at 2.2x net leverage, primarily reflecting the closing of the DreamWorks acquisition and payment of a deposit in the third quarter. 
So that concludes our summary of the quarter. I hope that everyone now has a good sense for how pleased we are with our the results as well as our momentum. And now I'll turn it back to Jason to lead the Q&A."

Advanced advertising has been around -- people have been talking about it for a long time. It's not easy. It's hard to develop these products, but it's clearly what advertisers want. They want to combine the data intensity of Internet advertising with the clear value and ability to change people's perceptions that you get with the television ads. So it's a pretty important part of Neil and my agenda. And I think we're at the head of the pack in terms of delivering on it, but there's still work to do."

I think if you look at the cable ecosystem, I've now been with Comcast for 18 years. And for 18 years, Comcast earnings have been up every single quarter. And yes, as new entrants come in, they take fractional share away from the existing suppliers. But the fact of the matter is most people find tremendous value and enjoyment in their cable or satellite subscription and are not looking to change. And there's all sorts of issues that over-the-top providers are going to have to deal with, including cost and service and everything else.

But one of the things that frequently is cited is that more consumption of these events is happening online. You're a big partner with both of the examples I cited, and you were very involved, obviously, in both the linear and the online distribution of the Olympics. And so it would seem that you have a unique vantage point. So I guess my question is, what do you think is going on here? Do you think that viewership of these events has actually declined? Or do you think it is correct to assume that more of it has gone to a streaming format so it's not being captured? And if that is the case, how do you make sure, as you move ahead, that you're able to monetize your role in those events properly?"

In the case of the Olympics, London was the biggest Olympics that we ever had in terms of primetime ratings. Rio was lower than London, but Rio was really on a par with the previous 3 Summer Olympics. And if you look at all the various ways of consuming, we had an extraordinary Olympics -- financially, ratings, advertiser happiness, et cetera. The streaming portion of the viewership was actually very low relative to television for the Olympics, call it, 1% or 2%. And I think the same numbers apply to the NFL, 1% or 2%. 1% of people stream NFL games. I think what's really -- and by the way, the NFL, we had an extraordinary season last year, which everybody is comparing to. We're actually down versus last year, but down much less versus 2 years ago. It's -- I think it's very difficult to tell precisely what's happening on any sporting property, particularly in the case of the NFL because it's only been a half dozen weeks. I do think there a lot of different things that people are using to -- consuming on the Internet and spending their time on. I also think there are seasons that are stronger than other seasons. And we may be in a season, just speaking for Sunday Night Football, where the matchups aren't as good as they could have been. But if you step back, the Olympics and the NFL are the 2 highest-rated programs of the year in all of television. They dominate the nights that they're on. They dominate -- as Brian mentioned, during the Olympics, we're 4x the next highest-rated show. Sunday Night Football is, by far, the highest-rated show on television. And we have very, very good partnerships with the International Olympic Committee and the NFL that go out many, many years. And those are very profitable relationships. So we're watching it. And obviously, you'd rather have ratings up than down. But having ratings decline modestly and still be very, very strong properties doesn't cause us too much concern."

Something like 100 million Americans consumed at least part of the Olympics online. It was a huge, huge phenomenon on Snapchat and Facebook and other places. And the inability for us to articulately walk into an advertiser and talk about all that consumption in an aggregated way is a real problem. And it's a problem that, obviously, is going to get solved, but the progress is not as great as it should be. I think what everybody wants is pretty obvious. They want to know what is the total audience delivery of a television show wherever it gets consumed, and they want it to be done by a third party in a way that is objective and quantifiable. And that's what we're all working to. I think the world is moving towards C7 from C3. I think the world is moving toward measuring alternative vehicles. And I think most advertisers understand, when they buy a hit property, they're going to get a lot of consumption elsewhere. And they sort of factor that into the effectiveness intellectually, but you'd certainly love for it to be done in a quantifiable way by an unbiased third party.

The first is, it looks like the industry is moving more towards the Comcast model more vertically integrated and so on with, obviously, the Time Warner deal, Verizon buying content and so on. So from that perspective, you guys have a unique vantage point, given you had NBC for a while. If you could talk a little bit about what the advantages of that model are and whether owning NBC as well as Cable on the other side of it provides a better business model from a consumer perspective as well as for the company as a whole. And secondly, from the perspective of the X1 platform, obviously, it's an industry-leading platform. And the way the content is presented there is in a disaggregated format. From that perspective, in terms of the vision you have of how video can be packaged maybe 5 years from now, does the bundle, in any form, I mean, skinny or nonskinny, make any sense in the next 5 years or 10 years, given how the industry is evolving and consumption patterns are evolving?"

What X1 does, from my perspective, our perspective, I think is really help you with search, navigation, discovery and enjoyment of the content you end up deciding to procure. So if you just take a movie star, you put her -- you now talk to the remote, you say it, and then it gives you recommendations. And it tells you every episode now, whether that episode resides on Netflix or resides on a broadcaster, or resides on the cable network or if you DVR-ed it. And then it's more like this. And it gives you lots of choices. So in the case -- to your point, we'll be upselling Netflix, as an example, I guess, as we upsell HBO and Showtime and others. So some content allows you to be show by show or network by network. But it's the breadth of all the choices in the bundle that I think is what has powered this industry. And clearly, as Neil said, we need to evolve and continue to progress, and we will, and we need to compete with whatever the future brings. But the investment that we've made and the innovation and the people we recruited, I think, sort of ties to your first question. Very broadly put, Comcast-NBCUniversal is a very special company, and we've moved hundreds of people back and forth between different parts of the company in the corporate office. We -- the Olympics, I think, are just a shining example of where all those live streams that Steve was just talking about were available on X1 and on the NBC Sports app. And you could get there through your Voice remote or through your XFINITY mobile app. And we're -- we call that Symphony. And we've seen it whether it's talent wanting to work with the company, people wanting to join the company or innovation that the company is doing. And could we do more? And will we do more and innovate? Yes. But we've seen a lot of people want to use the X1 platform. There are other operators around the world, in Canada and with Cox, and we've had others requesting to use the platform. So we're -- it seems to be resonating in almost every part of the ecosystem, the strategy we're on. And again, you get to a quarter like this and you see it really all working all together so..."
