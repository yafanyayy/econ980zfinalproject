By now, I hope you've had the chance to review the press release announcing our fourth quarter and full year results. As I said at our most recent Analyst Day, the second half of the year was an inflection poi",1250,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. By now, I hope you've had the chance to review the press release announcing our fourth quarter and full year results. 
As I said at our most recent Analyst Day, the second half of the year was an inflection point for our company. We believe that the progress across our overall business, achieved during the fourth quarter and more broadly over the course of 2015, reinforces this view and provides us with a reason to be optimistic about the long-term future of Pitney Bowes. Evidence of this is that our SMB equipment sales revenue performance continued to improve in the second half of the year. 
Secondly, we deployed our ambitious process reengineering and systems project in Canada, and we are on target to deploy in the United States in the first half of 2016, which is key for us to realize the benefits of investments we have made. 
And finally, after several years of focus on our balance sheet, our capital allocation priorities have evolved to a more balanced approach in deploying capital for growth and returning capital to our shareholders. While our overall business did improve in the fourth quarter, it'd also be true that I expected more, particularly from our Software business. 
The performance of our Software business was not consistent with our long-term model. Over the last several quarters and really over the last couple of years, our Software team had been more effective in terms of their sales execution. The fourth quarter is a departure from this pattern. We do not experience the close rates or the deal size growth rate we would have expected for the fourth quarter of the year. 
The net of this was a disappointing performance. We continue to work to move our Software business into new markets and to develop new channels. There's no doubt this is the right strategy. Our existing client base tells the way of the right products, but we need to move faster into these new markets. 
To that end, I'm confident our new advertising campaigns will help condition the market, and our client-driven product innovation will help us build opportunities faster. 
In addition, we have named Bob to one of our Software business. Bob is a proven executive, including his tenure as the General Manager of IBM Software sales. We look forward to Bob's contribution and expect that he will have a positive impact on our Software business. 
All that being said, the objective of our transformation has been and continues to be to create long-term value. Through that lens, we made the initial progress on our agenda in 2015. 
In SMB, revenue trends continue to moderate as ever new go-to-market model continued to mature. Fourth quarter equipment sales in the U.S. were down only 1%, and in our International Mailing business, equipment sales grew on a constant currency basis, confirming the progress we have made on our new go-to-market initiatives. 
To remind everyone, while implementation of our new go-to-market model in SMB was constructed, our new channel strategy provides more reach, drives higher client satisfaction and is more efficient than the model we are coming from. 
The stabilization of our equipment sales is clear evidence of the effectiveness of the new strategy. In addition, equipment sales continue to moderate, the associated revenue streams will also stabilize. In terms of operational effectiveness, we continue to build the right platform and rationalize our portfolio for the long term. 
In 2015, we continued to dramatically simplify our business, tightening focus on our geographic footprint. Additionally, we are creating a foundation for a better client-driven processes with our new ERP application. 
As I mentioned previously, this work has moved from design to deployment, and with the United States clearly in our sights, we're that much closer to realizing the benefits of these new investments. 
In addition, we continue to focus on optimizing our working capital. Our inventory is now less than half of what it was when we began this transformation. 
Finally, growing Digital Commerce. In 2015, we grew Digital Commerce. We changed the overall capability mix and focus with the acquisition of Borderfree and the divestitures of Imagitas. Our portfolio's now more focused and well positioned going forward. 
DCS grew 14% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter. The integration of Borderfree is on track, and we continue to be on our business case. I'm very optimistic about the ecommerce market and how we are positioning ourselves to capitalize on this growing market opportunity. 
Now let me take a moment to provide broader perspective on our transformation. The first point I will make is a point I'd made from the beginning. Transformations are not straight lines. They are difficult. They're hard, and they take time. That being said, I think the evidence that we are making a successful transformation is compelling. 
When we started 3 years ago, our North American Mailing business was declining 7%. We've lessened that decline to around 3% by constant currency. As you all know, equipment sales are the leading indicator for the SMB business. 
Over the last 6 months on a constant currency level, equipment sales in North America Mailing had been essentially flat. In the last quarter, equipment sales in our International Mailing business returned to growth. We did in this while dramatically changing our go-to-market model, which providers reach, better client service and a more efficient manner. 
In terms of operational excellence, we reduced our debt by over $1 billion, cut our inventory by more than half and improved our margins. We dramatically simplified our business and rationalized our portfolio. 
Finally, we have undertaken a substantial systems project to fundamentally reengineer how we do business. The impact of all these changes business more able to address the market needs of our clients more efficiently. 
In terms of Digital Commerce business, we have focused our portfolio and made targeted acquisitions to improve our capabilities. We've done this while substantially present our organizational capability. As we transformed our business, we laid out long-term markers: stabilizing SMB and operate at low single-digit declines, enterprise business flat to slight growth and Digital Commerce growing north of 10%. 
We haven't hit those markers every quarter, but over the last 3 years, we have operated basically within those parameters. We also have transitioned from a position of rehabilitating our balance sheet to a more balanced approach to capital allocation, enabling us to return capital to shareholders. 
We need to build on our performance during the fourth quarter. When I looked at what we have accomplished over the last 3 years, I think the evidence is clear that our transformation is on track. We're embarking on our most significant advertising campaign in 20 years as we seek to further expand and capitalize on our brand. 
We have 1.5 million small and medium business clients in addition to more than 90% of the Fortune 500. We have established a position of trust and early innings of bringing expanded product and solution offerings to these clients. 
We continue to strengthen our systems and processes while adding great talent to our team. And as Mike will describe shortly, 2016 will be another step forward in our transformation. Again this will not be a straight line to the top. That's why it's so important we invest in our future like our systems, our brand and continue to build our organizational capability. 
With that said, let me turn this call over to Mike."
297018,322461739,924435,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Marc, and good morning. As I mentioned when I gave guidance at the onset of the year, my two cents [ph], 2015 represented a critical third year in the company's business transformation. As Marc noted, we made significant progress during the yea",3729,"Thank you, Marc, and good morning. As I mentioned when I gave guidance at the onset of the year, my two cents [ph], 2015 represented a critical third year in the company's business transformation. As Marc noted, we made significant progress during the year, progress that is setting us up for the long-term growth. 
This included repositioning the portfolio through several acquisitions and divestitures, introducing a new brand marketing effort, launching several new products, completing the go-to-market transition in our major markets and strengthening our balance sheet. This all while we continue to reduce costs across the organization through our operational excellence initiatives and work to implement a new ERP system, which is initially launched in Canada in October. 
Several of these actions caused periodic disruptions across business, but we remain focused on transforming and streamlining our business. There were several factors that had a direct impact on our results, which we identified earlier in the year, most notably the net impact of the sale of our Imagitas business and the acquisition of Borderfree and the exit of several smaller markets and noncore products in Europe in 2014. 
In aggregate, these actions negatively impacted revenue comparisons by 1% for the year and earnings per share by $0.10 per share. Additionally, our full year tax rate and adjusted earnings of 33.5% was at the high end of our guidance range. This higher tax rate was driven primarily by a higher mix of U.S.-sourced income. 
And as with any business, there were elements outside of our control that had a major impact on our results. For us, the most significant of these was currency, particularly the U.S. dollar. First, it negatively impacted both revenue and earnings per share from translation effects, reducing revenue by $133 million or 3.5% and earnings per share by $0.07 per share for the year. 
Second, the stronger U.S. dollar made purchases from the U.S. that much more expensive, which lowered ecommerce cross-border activity. That being said, we remain focused on ecommerce by signing 59 new brands and retailers to our platform since acquiring Borderfree, increasing the number of countries to which we ship, expanding our payment options and growing penetration in the cross-border community. 
For the year, our ecommerce marketplace business grew 10% organically, and the global ecommerce segment grew 30% when you layer in shipping and the incremental revenue from the Borderfree acquisition. While currencies will continue to fluctuate, we are well positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities in this exciting growth market. 
Let me now turn to the financials. First, I'll take you through a high-level overview of our annual results and then I'll discuss the quarter in more detail. I will then conclude with our guidance for 2016 and open the line for questions. 
Please note that a reconciliation of adjusted to recorded financial information can be found in the financial schedules in our earnings press release and posted on our Investor Relations website.
Turning to our full year results. The company achieved results in its full year guidance range for adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. Annual revenue was $3.58 billion, a 3% decline from prior year on a constant currency basis and a 6% decline on a reported basis. 
Revenue results fell a bit short of our expectations. As Marc discussed, this was largely the result of lower licensed revenue within our Software business during the fourth quarter. We have made and we'll continue to make refinements to the Software business model to focus our selling efforts on solutions of high value to our clients. 
Our SMB business continues to improve and stabilize despite some temporary disruption from the go-to-market changes we made in Europe. In the U.S., annual equipment sales only declined 2% from prior year, largely as a result of a less than 1% decline in the installation of our core mail finishing machines. 
Additionally, the revenue trend in most of our major markets outside the U.S. continue to improve as we work through the go-to-market changes and sales organization maturity and productivity. Revenue for the year grew on a constant currency basis in the U.K. and Italy due to growth in equipment sales in most countries. And as I mentioned earlier, we went live with our ERP system in Canada in October with little disruption to the business. 
Turning to annual revenue results by segment group on a constant currency basis. Digital Commerce Solutions revenue grew 9%. Enterprise revenue was flat, and SMB revenue declined 5%. 
Excluding the impacts of the divested revenues in Europe, SMB revenues would have declined 4%. As a reminder, the annual growth rates for SMB and enterprise are in line with the long-term market growth rate ranges that are presented at Analyst Day for the last 3 years. 
And Digital Commerce Solutions is approaching its target growth range. On a reported basis, Digital Commerce Solutions revenue grew 5%. Enterprise revenue declined 3%, and SMB revenue declined 9%. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the full year was $1.75. As I mentioned earlier, currency had a $0.07 per share negative impact on earnings for the year. 
GAAP earnings per share for the full year were $2.03 and included $0.32 per share, which reflects the gain on sale from the Imagitas of $0.44 and net acquisition and disposition-related expense of $0.12, $0.09 per share restructuring charges, $0.02 per share for a legal settlement, $0.04 per share benefit related to previous investment divestiture and $0.03 per share of income from discontinued operations. 
Free cash flow for the full year was $456 million, and on a GAAP basis, we generated $515 million in cash from operations. Overall, cash flow was impacted primarily by timing of working capital requirements. 
During the year, we used our cash flow to return capital to our common shareholders, best evidenced by our competitive dividend and our share repurchases. For the year, the company paid $150 million of cash in the form of dividends, bought back more than 6.6 million shares of common stock for $135 million and made $62 million in restructuring payments. 
We also strengthened our balance sheet through prudent debt management. From a debt management perspective, the company paid down approximately $280 million of debt using combination of cash on the balance sheet and the issuance of commercial paper. 
Further, in January of 2016, the company obtained additional $300 million of bank term loans and refinanced a $371 million note that matured in January. We also invested in the business through acquisition, including Borderfree ecommerce and Real Time Content, our EngageOne Video Software solution. The divestiture of Imagitas generated net proceeds of approximately $270 million, which we were able to use to partially fund Borderfree acquisition. 
At year-end, we had just under $3 billion of debt on the balance sheet, which was about $280 million less than the prior year. The company ended the year with $677 million of cash on hand and $90 million in commercial paper outstanding. 
Looking at the full year income statement, as a reminder, a reconciliation can be found in our financial statements for any of the adjusted numbers that I talked about. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT were $716 million, which was $15 million lower than prior year. 
Adjusted EBIT margin was 20%, which was an increase of 90 basis points over prior year. Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA for the year was $889 million. 
SG&A for the year was $1.28 billion, which was $98 million or 7% lower than the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 35.8%, which was an improvement of 30 basis points. Since 2012, we have reduced absolute SG&A by $210 million while continuing to invest in our new ERP system and expanding our marketing efforts. 
For the full year, we recorded pretax restructuring charges totaling $26 million for actions associated with our previously announced plans to reduce costs. 
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $159 million, which was a decline of $10 million when compared to the prior year. This was the result of the actions we've taken to manage our debt over the last year. 
The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the year was 33.5%, the high end of our guidance range compared to the 27.7% last year. Last year's lower tax rate was due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. As I previously stated, this year's tax rate was impacted primarily by the higher percentage of U.S.-sourced income. 
Now let me turn to the quarter's results. Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $937 million. Compared to the prior year, revenue declined 2% on a constant currency basis and 5% on a reported basis, a continuation of improvement in trend. 
On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 14% in Digital Commerce Solutions, grew 1% in Enterprise Business Solutions and declined 3% in SMB. On a reported basis, revenue grew 11% in Digital Commerce Solutions, declined 2% in Enterprise Business Solutions and declined 6% in SMB. 
Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $0.48 for the fourth quarter. Currency had a $0.02 per share negative impact on EPS this quarter. 
GAAP earnings per share were $0.44 and included $0.02 in SG&A expense of cost related to the exit of certain geographic markets during the fourth quarter, a $0.05 restructuring charge and income of $0.03 from discontinued operations. Free cash flow during the quarter was $157 million, and on a GAAP basis, we generated $164 million in cash from operations. 
During the quarter, we used $37 million of cash to return capital to our common shareholders in the form of dividends. We also repurchased 1.7 million shares of our common stock for $35 million. 
Additionally, we made $16 million in restructuring payments during the quarter. From a debt management perspective, the company used funds from a newly obtained $150 million bank term loan to refinance $110 million of debt. 
Additionally, in January of 2016, we obtained an additional $300 million of bank term loans and refinanced a $371 million note that matured in January. 
Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT were $185 million this quarter, which was $15 million lower than the prior year. Adjusted EBIT margin was 19.8%, which was a decrease of 60 basis points over the prior year but in line with the EBIT margin for the full year 2015. 
Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $231 million. SG&A for the quarter was $341 million, which was $6 million or 2% lower than the prior year. 
As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 36.4%, which was 110 basis points higher than the prior year. This increase was due in part to incremental cost associated with the exit of certain geographic markets in the quarter, incremental cost associated with the amortization of Borderfree intangibles and higher expenses related to the ERP implementation. 
During the quarter, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $11 million. Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $40 million, which was a decline of about $2 million when compared to the prior year. 
Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were $233 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 5.34%, which was nearly flat to the prior year. The effective tax rate in adjusted earnings for the quarter was 32.1%, which was flat to the prior year. 
Now I'd like to discuss the fourth quarter results for each of our business segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we posted to the pb.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
For SMB Solutions in North America Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $363 million, and EBIT was $165 million. Revenue declined 2% on a constant currency basis and 3% on a reported basis. Revenue for the quarter declined on a constant currency basis at a lesser rate than it did for the first 9 months of the year. 
Equipment sales in the U.S. declined 1% versus the prior year, and recurring revenue streams continued to perform in line with prior quarters. EBIT margin was 45.3%, which was an improvement of 130 basis points versus the prior year due to the mix of business and lower employee-related costs. 
International Mailing revenue for the quarter was $114 million, and EBIT was $14 million. Revenue declined 6% on a constant currency basis and 15% on a reported basis. Revenue declined at its lowest rate all year, benefiting from improved equipment sales trends in most of the major markets, where the company has completed the shift in its go-to-market strategy. 
Equipment sales revenue grew on a constant currency basis, driven in part by increased sales in U.K. In France, equipment sales declined at a lesser rate than in previous quarters as the new sales structure increased productivity. However, equipment sales growth was offset by a decline in recurring revenue streams. 
During the quarter, the company sold or entered into agreements to sell assets and convert to a dealer model in model Mexico, South Africa and 5 markets in Asia. 
International Mailing's EBIT margin was 12.7%, a decline of 330 basis points versus the prior year due to the impact of currency on costs and lower recurring revenue streams. 
In the Enterprise Solutions business starting with production mail, revenue for the quarter was $122 million, and EBIT was $17 million. Revenue declined 3% on a constant currency basis and 7% on a reported basis. 
Revenue trend improved versus the prior 2 quarters and benefited from growth in certain equipment sales, driven in part by the new Epic product line and higher supplies revenue. Revenue was adversely impacted by fewer printer installations than the prior year. 
EBIT margin was 13.7%, a decline of 120 basis points versus the prior year due to product mix and increased engineering investments, which offset cost-reduction initiatives. In Presort Services, revenue for the quarter was $122 million, and EBIT was $28 million. Revenue grew 4% on a constant currency and reported basis. Revenue benefited from higher volumes of First Class and Standard class mail processed versus the prior year as well as new clients acquisitions. EBIT margin was 22.7%, which was a decline of 290 basis points versus the prior year due to start-up cost to expand the network into 2 new U.S. markets, which offset the benefit from revenue growth. 
Turning to Digital Commerce Solutions. In the Software business, revenue for the quarter was $103 million, and EBIT was $14 million. Revenue declined 7% on a constant currency basis and 12% on a reported basis. Revenue declined largely due to lower Location Intelligence licensing revenues in the Americas and Europe, which was in line with a slowdown in the broader Software market. However, as Marc noted, sales execution was disappointing this quarter. 
Looking ahead, the company's expanding its partner channel reach and focusing on several high potential industry specific solutions to drive growth. 
EBIT margin was 13.2%, a decline of 450 basis points as a result of the lower amount of license revenue, which has high margin. In global ecommerce, revenue for the quarter was $112 million, and EBIT was $9 million. Revenue grew 46% on a constant currency basis and 45% on a reported basis. Results included a full quarter of revenue from Borderfree and growth in the U.K. marketplace revenue. The company added a number of new retail clients and expanded its payment options during the quarter. However, outbound package shipments from the U.S. continue to be pressured by the strong U.S. dollar. This is especially true with regards to the Canadian and Australian dollars, both of which were 15% lower in value against the U.S. dollar in the quarter versus the prior year. 
These markets represent 2 of our top 3 markets for volume shipped from the U.S. EBIT margin was 8.3%, which was a decline of 150 basis points versus the prior year due to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, which offset the early stages of synergy savings. 
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the year and the quarter. Now I'd like to provide some insights on our outlook for 2016. As in the past, we're providing guidance on a constant currency basis. The company's guidance assumes that the global economy and foreign exchange markets will not change significantly from year-end 2015 levels. 
However, as we have seen over the last 18 months, currency exchange rates are subject to substantial movement. Therefore, reported results may vary materially from a constant currency of view. 
From a sensitivity perspective, each 5% movement in the exchange rates material to the company's business could impact reported revenue growth by approximately 150 basis points and adjusted earnings per share could be impacted by about $0.03 per share. 
For 2016, revenue, excluding the impacts from currency, is expected to be in a range of a 1% decline to 2% growth when compared to 2015. We expect the segment groups to continue to trend towards the global market growth rates that we communicated at Analyst Day. 
Therefore, versus prior year, we expect SMB revenue to have a low single-digit decline, enterprise revenue to be in a range of flat to low single-digit growth and Digital Commerce Solutions revenue to grow at a low double-digit range. Revenue is expected to benefit from the completion of the go-to-market changes in the company's major markets; new product launches across the portfolio; recent acquisitions, including Borderfree, Real Time Content and Enroute Systems Corporation; continued growth in a number of new brands and clients on our platform; and the expansion of the company's presort services network. 
The benefits will be offset, in part, by the exit of businesses in Mexico, South Africa and 5 markets in Asia and the conversion of those markets to a dealer network. In aggregate, these markets generated $26 million in revenue in 2015. 
EPS from continuing operations on both and adjusted and GAAP basis are expected to be in a range of $1.80 to $2 in 2016. As I laid out at Analyst Day in September, in 2016, we expect earnings per share to benefit by $0.12 to $0.15 associated with prior restructuring efforts and early ERP benefits. We also expect $0.03 to $0.05 in incremental earnings per share from a full year of synergies associated with the Borderfree integration, net of incremental amortization costs for intangibles. 
Conversely, there's $0.04 of earnings in 2015 associated with the Imagitas that will not repeat in 2016. The remaining benefits are expected to come from operating leverage resulting from the actions taken in our portfolio and additional operational excellence initiatives. 
Additionally, we have assumed a tax rate in the range of 32% to 35%. This range reflects a higher mix of U.S.-sourced income. We've included a slide in our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website, which lays out a reconciliation for adjusted earnings per share. 
Free cash flow for 2016 is expected to be in a range of $425 million to $525 million. Again, as I noted in Analyst Day in September, free cash flow is expected to benefit from $25 million to $35 million in operational excellence initiatives, mostly from changes in ERP spend and the related early benefits as well as the $5 million from portfolio-driven initiatives. Further stabilization of our core Mailing business and lower cost will improve free cash flow further. 
However, you should note that there was about $7 million of free cash flow from the Imagitas operations that we got in the first half of 2015 that we will not get in 2016 as a result of the sale in May 2015. 
Let me now provide some color around 2016 from a timing perspective and time line for our ERP implementation. The company expects ongoing improvement in SG&A as a percentage of revenue as a result of the expected benefits from the implementation of the new ERP program. The majority of these 2016 benefits are expected to be realized in the second half of the year as we plan to launch the new system in the U.S. in the first half, and we'll be investing heavily to make sure the launch goes as smoothly as possible. 
We will also incur incremental marketing expense related to our advertising campaign. This expense is expected to be highest in the first and fourth quarters of the year as a result of the planned timing of company's new advertising placements. Therefore, we expect earnings in the first half of the year to be more heavily impacted by both ERP and marketing spends. We will start to realize most of the ERP benefits, both from a savings and cost-reduction perspective, starting in the third quarter and increasing through the fourth quarter. 
As I said at Analyst Day regarding ERP, we designed the system in 2014. 2015 involved the build-out, data cleansing and preparing our environment to operate within this new system, and 2016 will be about deploying of the new system. We also started recognizing initial benefits in 2015 as we changed and streamlined our processes in order to be prepared for the ERP go live. As we enter 2016, the capital expenses related to this project are expected to come to down, and the benefits will start to materialize as a result of the implementation. We will realize even greater benefits in 2017 post our full global deployment. 
So I'm taking you through our 2016 outlook from a P&L, free cash flow and timing perspective. Let me close with a few comments on capital allocation, and then we can take your questions. 
Again, as I mentioned at Analyst Day, over the next 3 years from 2016 to 2018, we expect to yield more than $1 billion in free cash flow. As we have said, we are disciplined stewards of your capital, and we'll continue to take a balanced approach with our capital allocation strategy. 
We remain focused on investing in the growth drivers of our business as well as returning capital to our shareholders, both in the form of a continued competitive dividend and continued share repurchase. We expect to continue to have the flexibility and capacity to do so. 
That concludes my remarks. Operator, can you please open the line for questions?"

So if you look at the end user growth rates for those markets, they're all very strong. I think -- I know rather if you look at the clients that are using our products, they are very sophisticated consumers of technology, which tells me we have a good product, and as we've surveyed the market, we have brand permission to sell these offerings. So the first point I'd make, Shannon, is we continue to be bullish about the market as well as the products. In terms of what happened in the quarter, plainly said, the team didn't execute. So after as I said a couple of years of pretty strong execution in terms of doing what they said they were going to do, we just didn't hit the ball. So I don't see it as a pervasive problem. I see it as a quarter aberration. That's not to say other quarters are going to be precisely the way we wanted. I do think to Mike's point, we're making a couple of incremental adjustments, which will be important. The first is we continue to pursue new channels. I will note as we accrue these new channels, they've all taken most of our advertising campaign, and it helps us recruit new partners as well as new clients. Secondly, we've fine-tuned our offerings to put them much more in a solution context, which helps our clients better understand the value proposition. And finally, I think our advertising campaign will help, and as I said, Bob is a great leader over this. So I don't see it as a business that need to get fixed. I think get back on the horse and go."

Again, in terms of the guidance we gave I think very consistent with what we said last year, our guidance does not include any restructuring that hasn't been defined and declared at this point in time. So the possibility exists that there's activities that we would undertake, and we would certainly call those out. As you recall at Analyst Day when we talked about the ERP implementation, we did note the fact that there will likely be additional restructuring associated with the program when we fully deploy it on the back end. As you saw in the fourth quarter, we took a charge about $11 million related to some of the early opportunities that we've identified in the program. So as we go through the deployment, we'll make a determination whether or not there's additional restructuring activities we need to undertake, but clearly the benefits will begin to accrue more to the second half after the implementation, and that's when the opportunity would present itself."

Let me do the last one first, which is I think we've addressed all the markets we see in terms of moving to a dealer-type structure in the fourth quarter. We did several, and I think pretty much completed that process. Obviously, there'll be an ongoing review, but we really identified 12 core markets and about 7 additional markets around those 12 that would be the core focus for us in terms of systems, products and other investments, and so we are at that level now and feel like that's a good place to be. With respect to equipment sales, I would say very much what we're seeing is consistent with what we laid out and a trend that we would expect to see. You saw the continued improvement in North America Mailing in the U.S. in particular. That was minus 1% [ph], which was again an improvement on a year-over-year basis. International actually grew equipment sales. We had good performance in both U.K. and actually Italy with placements with the Italian post. We have work to do yet to continue to improve the markets like France, which really undertake that process later than some of the other markets. So we believe that glide path is in the right direction. In terms of your question about how does that ultimately affect recurring revenue streams, obviously, recurring revenue streams are built up over a period of time. So as equipment sales stabilized and in some instances, grow, then that will begin to turn the direction of the recurring revenue streams or improve the comparisons in recurring revenue streams, but that'll be a more gradual process. I guess, a good example of that as you could see in the North American business, the U.S. in particular, our finance receivables actually went up from the third quarter to the fourth quarter as a result of the performance of the equipment sales modestly, and that's not a year-over-year comparison but a quarter-to-quarter, but the relative rate of decline in finance receivables has come down in large part as a result of the beginning to see the improvement in those comparisons of the equipment sales on a year-over-year basis."

Right now, the preponderance of that business is U.S. outbound, which will be in the short term and, by the way, I mean, I think one of the things we believe is this currency cycle is going to last for a while longer. So we are under no delusion currency dynamics change in anytime in the near future. That being said, we do have opportunities to move this business outside of the United States. We moved it to the U.K. It's been a very important driver of growth. We continue to survey other parts of the world where we think we can get on the other side of currency. If you look at this organically, I think it's very interesting to note and Michael alluded to it, we added 75 clients since the acquisition. So it takes a while longer for those clients to come online and make a meaningful revenue impact, but that is a material increase the number of clients, and when you see clients like Target or Harrods that tells you that we've got great capability. So that's why we're so optimistic about the long-term prospects of this business. It clearly will have some short-term pressures until we get diversified outside the United States, and we get some of these incremental clients online and producing revenue. But if you look at the overall market opportunity and how well we are positioned, I think you can't help but conclude this is a wonderful opportunity for us."

I mentioned in my comments that we expect the spend to be highest in the first quarter and the fourth quarter, and you might ask why that kind of timing. It really bookends what'll be a very aggressive and active political season, and so we believe in establishing in the first quarter and then reenergizing it from a broad advertising standpoint in the fourth quarter while still doing a lot of digital and more direct targeted stuff in between is the most efficient use of our capital. In doing that, in terms of our total marketing spend, there'll probably be about a $0.03 higher spend in the first and fourth quarters relative to the prior year and hopefully, that's helpful in terms of how people look at the calendarization of that. So that's in aggregate how the marketing will layout."

That being said, I wouldn't blame what happened to us in the fourth quarter on the economy. We had within our control the opportunity to better. We didn't just hit the ball. So I think there's 2 separate thing going on. We've got plenty of headroom in this market regardless of what's going on in the overall economy. So that's point one. Point two, if you think about how we thought about guidance, I will say, and we're not oblivious to what's going on around us. So our buildup of how we thought about guidance was primarily driven by think that we could control within our own grasp. We had savings from our ERP project.

Shareholder repurchases aren't to advantaged shareholders that we're buying stock from. It's to advantage the shareholders that continues to stick with us. My view is . there's a lot of earnings opportunity that is in front of us in the short term and to have that earnings over a more leveraged capital base is a good thing for our shareholders. So we think about different context of how we drive shareholder return that's twice over time but based on what we see we're still confident of what we laid out at Analyst Day."

By now, I hope you've had the chance to review the press release announcing our fourth quarter and full year results.
As I said at our most recent Analyst Day, the second half of the year was an inflection point for our company. We believe that the progress across our overall business, achieved during the fourth quarter and more broadly over the course of 2015, reinforces this view and provides us with a reason to be optimistic about the long-term future of Pitney Bowes. Evidence of this is that our SMB equipment sales revenue performance continued to improve in the second half of the year.
Secondly, we deployed our ambitious process reengineering and systems project in Canada, and we are on target to deploy in the United States in the first half of 2016, which is key for us to realize the benefits of investments we have made.
And finally, after several years of focus on our balance sheet, our capital allocation priorities have evolved to a more balanced approach from deploying capital for growth and returning capital to our shareholders. While our overall business did improve in the fourth quarter, it'd also be true that I expected more, particularly from our Software business.
The performance of our Software business was not consistent with our long-term model. Over the last several quarters and really over the last couple of years, our Software team had been more effective in terms of their sales execution. The fourth quarter is a departure from this pattern. We do not experience the close rates or the deal size growth rate we would have expected for the fourth quarter of the year.
The net of this was a disappointing performance. We continued to work to move our Software business into new markets and to develop new channels. There's no doubt this is the right strategy. Our existing client base tells that we have the right products, but we need to move faster into these new markets.
To that end, I'm confident our new advertising campaigns will help condition the market, and our client-driven product innovation will help us build opportunities faster.
In addition, we have named Bob Guidotti to run our Software business. Bob is a proven executive, including his tenure as the General Manager of IBM Software sales. We look forward to Bob's contribution and expect that he will have a positive impact on our Software business.
All that being said, the objective of our transformation has been and continues to be to create long-term value. Through that lens, we made substantial progress on our agenda in 2015.
In SMB, revenue trends continue to moderate as our new go-to-market model continued to mature. Fourth quarter equipment sales in the U.S. were down only 1%, and in our International Mailing business, equipment sales grew on a constant currency basis, confirming the progress we have made on our new go-to-market initiative.
To remind everyone, while implementation of our new go-to-market model in SMB was constructive, our new channel strategy provides more reach, drives higher client satisfaction and is more efficient than the model we are coming from.
The stabilization of our equipment sales is clear evidence of the effectiveness of the new strategy. In addition, as equipment sales continue to moderate, the associated revenue streams will also stabilize. In terms of operational effectiveness, we continue to build the right platform and rationalize our portfolio for the long term.
In 2015, we continued to dramatically simplify our business, tightening focus on our geographic footprint. Additionally, we are creating a foundation for better client-driven processes with our new ERP application.
As I mentioned previously, this work has moved from design to deployment, and with the United States clearly in our sights, we're that much closer to realizing the benefits of these new investments.
In addition, we continue to focus on optimizing our working capital. Our inventory is now less than half of what it was when we began this transformation.
Finally, growing Digital Commerce. In 2015, we grew Digital Commerce. We changed the overall capability mix and focus with the acquisition of Borderfree and the divestiture of Imagitas. Our portfolio's now more focused and well positioned going forward.
DCS grew 14% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter. The integration of Borderfree is on track, and we continue to be on our business case. I'm very optimistic about the e-commerce market and how we are positioning ourselves to capitalize on this growing market opportunity.
Now let me take a moment to provide broader perspective on our transformation. The first point I'll make is a point I'd made from the beginning. Transformations are not straight lines. They are difficult, they are hard and they take time. That being said, I think the evidence that we are making a successful transformation is compelling.
When we started 3 years ago, our North American Mailing business was declining 7%. We have lessened that decline to around 3% by constant currency. As you all know, equipment sales are the leading indicator for the SMB business.
Over the last 6 months on a constant currency level, equipment sales in North America Mailing had been essentially flat. In the last quarter, equipment sales in our International Mailing business returned to growth. We did this while dramatically changing our go-to-market model, which providers better reach, better client service in a more efficient manner.
In terms of operational excellence, we reduced our debt by over $1 billion, cut our inventory by more than half and improved our margins. We dramatically simplified our business and rationalized our portfolio.
Finally, we have undertaken a substantial systems project to fundamentally reengineer how we do business. The impact of all these changes we did in business more able to address the market needs of our clients a lot more efficiently.
In terms of Digital Commerce business, we have focused our portfolio and made targeted acquisitions to improve our capabilities. We've done this while substantially increasing our organizational capability. As we transformed our business, we laid out long-term markers: stabilizing SMB and operating at low single-digit declines, enterprise business flat to slight growth and Digital Commerce growing north of 10%.
We haven't hit those markers every quarter, but over the last 3 years, we have operated basically within those parameters. We also have transitioned from a position of rehabilitating our balance sheet to a more balanced approach to capital allocation, enabling us to return capital to shareholders.
We need to build on our performance during the fourth quarter, but when I looked at what we have accomplished over the last 3 years, I think the evidence is clear that our transformation is on track. We're embarking on our most significant advertising campaign in 20 years as we seek to further expand and capitalize on our brand.
We have 1.5 million small and medium business clients in addition to more than 90% of the Fortune 500. We have established a position of trust and are in the early innings of bringing expanded product and solution offerings to these clients.
We continue to strengthen our systems and processes while adding great talent to our team. And as Mike will describe shortly, 2016 will be another step forward in our transformation. Again, this will not be a straight line to the top. That's why it's so important we invest in our future like our systems, our brand and continue to build our organizational capability.
With that said, let me turn this call over to Mike."
297018,322461739,924697,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Marc, and good morning. As I mentioned when I gave guidance at the onset of the year and my referred $0.02, 2015 represented a critical third year in the company's business transformation. As Marc noted, we made significant progress during the",3733,"Thank you, Marc, and good morning. As I mentioned when I gave guidance at the onset of the year and my referred $0.02, 2015 represented a critical third year in the company's business transformation. As Marc noted, we made significant progress during the year, progress that is setting us up for the long-term growth.
This included repositioning the portfolio through several acquisitions and divestitures, introducing a new brand and marketing effort, launching several new products, completing the go-to-market transition in our major markets and strengthening our balance sheet. This all while we continue to reduce costs across the organization through our operational excellence initiatives and work to implement a new ERP system, which is initially launched in Canada in October.
Several of these actions caused periodic disruptions across the business, but we remained focus on transforming and streamlining our business. There were several factors that had a direct impact on our results, which we identified earlier in the year, most notably the net impact from the sale of our Imagitas business and the acquisition of Borderfree and the exit of several smaller markets and noncore products in Europe in 2014.
In aggregate, these actions negatively impacted revenue comparisons by 1% for the year and earnings per share by $0.10 per share. Additionally, our full year tax rate on adjusted earnings of 33.5% was at the high end of our guidance range. This higher tax rate was driven primarily by a higher mix of U.S.-sourced income.
And as with any business, there were elements outside of our control that had a major impact on our results. For us, the most significant of these was currency, particularly the U.S. dollar. First, it negatively impacted both revenue and earnings per share from translation effects, reducing revenue by $133 million or 3.5% and earnings per share by $0.07 per share for the year.
Second, the stronger U.S. dollar made purchases from the U.S. that much more expensive, which lowered e-commerce cross-border activity. That being said, we remain focused on e-commerce by signing 59 new brands and retailers to our platform since acquiring Borderfree, increasing the number of countries to which we ship, expanding our payment options and growing penetration in the cross-border community.
For the year, our e-commerce marketplace business grew 10% organically, and the Global Ecommerce segment grew 30% when you layer in shipping and the incremental revenue from the Borderfree acquisition. While currencies will continue to fluctuate, we are well positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities in this exciting growth market.
Let me now turn to the financials. First, I'll take you through a high-level overview of our annual results and then I'll discuss the quarter in more detail. I will then conclude with our guidance for 2016 and open the line for questions.
Please note that a reconciliation of adjusted to reported financial information can be found in the financial schedules in our earnings press release and posted on our Investor Relations website.
Turning to our full year results. The company achieved results in its full year guidance range for adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. Annual revenue was $3.58 billion, a 3% decline from prior year on a constant currency basis and a 6% decline on a reported basis.
Revenue results fell a bit short of our expectations. As Marc discussed, this was largely the result of lower licensed revenue within our Software business during the fourth quarter. We have made and we'll continue to make refinements to the Software business model to focus our selling efforts on solutions of high value to our clients.
Our SMB business continues to improve and stabilize despite some temporary disruption from the go-to-market changes we made in Europe. In the U.S., annual equipment sales declined only 2% from prior year, largely as a result of a less than 1% decline in the installation of our core mail finishing machines.
Additionally, the revenue trend in most of our major markets outside the U.S. continue to improve as we work through the go-to-market changes and sales organization maturity and productivity. Revenue for the year grew on a constant currency basis in the U.K. and Italy due to growth in equipment sales in those countries. And as I mentioned earlier, we went live with our ERP system in Canada in October with little disruption to the business.
Turning to annual revenue results by segment group on a constant currency basis. Digital Commerce Solutions revenue grew 9%, enterprise revenue was flat and SMB revenue declined 5%. 
Excluding the impacts of the divested revenues in Europe, SMB revenue would have declined 4%. As a reminder, the annual growth rates for SMB and enterprise are in line with the long-term market growth rate ranges that are presented at Analyst Day for the last 3 years.
And Digital Commerce Solutions is approaching its target growth range. On a reported basis, Digital Commerce Solutions revenue grew 5%, enterprise revenue declined 3% and SMB revenue declined 9%.
Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the full year was $1.75. As I mentioned earlier, currency had a $0.07 per share negative impact on earnings for the year.
GAAP earnings per share for the full year were $2.03 and included $0.32 per share, which reflects the gain on the sale from Imagitas of $0.44 and net acquisition and disposition-related expense of $0.12, $0.09 per share restructuring charges, $0.02 per share for a legal settlement, $0.04 per share benefit related to previous investment divestiture and $0.03 per share of income from discontinued operations.
Free cash flow for the full year was $456 million, and on a GAAP basis, we generated $515 million in cash from operations. Overall, cash flow was impacted primarily by timing of working capital requirements.
During the year, we used our cash flow to return capital to our common shareholders, best evidenced by our competitive dividend and our share repurchases. For the year, the company paid $150 million of cash in the form of dividends, bought back more than 6.6 million shares of common stock for $135 million and made $62 million in restructuring payments.
We also strengthened our balance sheet through prudent debt management. From a debt management perspective, the company paid down approximately $280 million of debt using a combination of cash on the balance sheet and the issuance of commercial paper.
Further, in January of 2016, the company obtained additional $300 million of bank term loans and refinanced a $371 million note that matured in January. We also invested in the business through acquisition, including Borderfree and Ecommerce and Real Time Content, our EngageOne Video software solution. The divestiture of Imagitas generated net proceeds of approximately $270 million, which we were able to use to partially fund Borderfree acquisition.
At year-end, we had just under $3 billion of debt on the balance sheet, which was about $280 million less than the prior year. The company ended the year with $677 million of cash on hand and $90 million in commercial paper outstanding.
Looking at the full year income statement, as a reminder, a reconciliation can be found in our financial statements for any of the adjusted numbers that I talk about. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT were $716 million, which was $15 million lower than prior year.
Adjusted EBIT margin was 20%, which was an increase of 90 basis points over prior year. Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA for the year was $889 million.
SG&A for the year was $1.28 billion, which was $98 million or 7% lower than the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 35.8%, which was an improvement of 30 basis points. Since 2012, we have reduced absolute SG&A by $210 million while continuing to invest in our new ERP system and expanding our marketing efforts.
For the full year, we recorded pretax restructuring charges totaling $26 million for actions associated with our previously announced plans to reduce costs.
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $159 million, which was a decline of $10 million when compared to the prior year. This was the result of the actions we've taken to manage our debt over the last year.
The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the year was 33.5%, the high end of our guidance range compared with 27.7% last year. Last year's lower tax rate was due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. As I previously stated, this year's tax rate was impacted primarily by the higher percentage of U.S.-sourced income.
Now let me turn to the quarter's results. Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $937 million. Compared to the prior year, revenue declined 2% on a constant currency basis and 5% on a reported basis, a continuation of improvement in trend.
On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 14% in Digital Commerce Solutions, grew 1% in Enterprise Business Solutions and declined 3% in SMB. On a reported basis, revenue grew 11% in Digital Commerce Solutions, declined 2% in Enterprise Business Solutions and declined 6% in SMB.
Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $0.48 for the fourth quarter. Currency had a $0.02 per share negative impact on EPS this quarter.
GAAP earnings per share were $0.44 and included $0.02 in SG&A expense of cost related to the exit of certain geographic markets during the fourth quarter, a $0.05 restructuring charge and income of $0.03 from discontinued operations. Free cash flow during the quarter was $157 million, and on a GAAP basis, we generated $164 million in cash from operations.
During the quarter, we used $37 million of cash to return capital to our common shareholders in the form of dividends. We also repurchased 1.7 million shares of our common stock for $35 million. Additionally, we made $16 million in restructuring payments during the quarter. From a debt management perspective, the company used funds from a newly obtained $150 million bank term loan to refinance $110 million of debt.
Additionally, in January of 2016, we obtained an additional $300 million of bank term loans and refinanced a $371 million note that matured in January.
Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT were $185 million this quarter, which was $15 million lower than the prior year. Adjusted EBIT margin was 19.8%, which was decrease of 60 basis points over the prior year but in line with the EBIT margin for the full year 2015.
Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $231 million. SG&A for the quarter was $341 million, which was $6 million or 2% lower than the prior year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 36.4%, which was 110 basis points higher than the prior year. This increase was due in part to incremental cost associated with the exit of certain geographic markets in the quarter, incremental cost associated with the amortization of Borderfree intangibles and higher expenses related to the ERP implementation.
During the quarter, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $11 million. Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $40 million, which was a decline of about $2 million when compared to the prior year.
Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were $233 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 5.34%, which was nearly flat to the prior year. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter was 32.1%, which was flat to the prior year.
Now I'd like to discuss the fourth quarter results for each of our business segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we posted to the pb.com website under the Investor Relations section.
For SMB Solutions in North America Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $363 million and EBIT was $165 million. Revenue declined 2% on a constant currency basis and 3% on a reported basis. Revenue for the quarter declined on a constant currency basis at a lesser rate than it did for the first 9 months of the year.
Equipment sales in the U.S. declined 1% versus the prior year, and recurring revenue streams continued to perform in line with prior quarters. EBIT margin was 45.3%, which was an improvement of 130 basis points versus the prior year due to the mix of business and lower employee-related costs.
In International Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $114 million, and EBIT was $14 million. Revenue declined 6% on a constant currency basis and 15% on a reported basis. Revenue declined at its lowest rate all year, benefiting from improved equipment sales trends in most of the major markets, where the company has completed the shift in its go-to-market strategy.
Equipment sales revenue grew on a constant currency basis, driven in part by increased sales in the U.K. In France, equipment sales declined at a lesser rate than in previous quarters as the new sales structure increased productivity. However, equipment sales growth was offset by a decline in the recurring revenue streams.
During the quarter, the company sold or entered into agreements to sell assets and convert to a dealer model in Mexico, South Africa and 5 markets in Asia.
International Mailing's EBIT margin was 12.7%, decline of 330 basis points versus the prior year due to the impact of currency on costs and lower recurring revenue streams.
In the Enterprise Solutions business starting with production mail, revenue for the quarter was $122 million, and EBIT was $17 million. Revenue declined 3% on a constant currency basis and 7% on a reported basis.
Revenue trends improved versus the prior 2 quarters and benefited from growth in inserting equipment sales, driven in part by the new Epic product line and higher supplies revenue. Revenue was adversely impacted by fewer printer installations than the prior year.
EBIT margin was 13.7%, a decline of 120 basis points versus the prior year due to product mix and increased engineering investments, which offset cost-reduction initiatives. In Presort Services, revenue for the quarter was $122 million, and EBIT was $28 million. Revenue grew 4% on a constant currency and reported basis. Revenue benefited from higher volumes of First Class and Standard class mail process versus the prior year as well as new client acquisitions. EBIT margin was 22.7%, which was a decline of 290 basis points versus the prior year due to start-up cost to expand the network into 2 new U.S. markets, which offset the benefit from revenue growth.
Turning to Digital Commerce Solutions. In the Software business, revenue for the quarter was $103 million, and EBIT was $14 million. Revenue declined 7% on a constant currency basis and 12% on a reported basis. Revenue declined largely due to lower Location Intelligence licensing revenues in the Americas and Europe, which was in line with a slowdown in the broader Software market. However, as Marc noted, sales execution was disappointing this quarter.
Looking ahead, the company's expanding its partner channel reach and focusing on several high potential industry specific solutions to drive growth.
EBIT margin was 13.2%, a decline of 450 basis points as a result of the lower amount of license revenue, which has high margin. In Global Ecommerce, revenue for the quarter was $112 million, and EBIT was $9 million. Revenue grew 46% on a constant currency basis and 45% on a reported basis. Results included a full quarter of revenue from Borderfree and growth in the U.K. marketplace revenue. The company added a number of new retail clients and expanded its payment options during the quarter. However, outbound package shipments from the U.S. continued to be pressured by the strong U.S. dollar. This is especially true with regards to the Canadian and Australian dollars, both of which were 15% lower in value against the U.S. dollar in the quarter versus the prior year.
These markets represent 2 of our top 3 markets for volume shipped from the U.S. EBIT margin was 8.3%, which was a decline of 150 basis points versus the prior year due to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, which offset the early stages of synergy savings.
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the year and the quarter. Now I'd like to provide some insights on our outlook for 2016. As in the past, we're providing guidance on a constant currency basis. The company's guidance assumes that the global economy and foreign exchange markets will not change significantly from year-end 2015 levels.
However, as we have seen over the last 18 months, currency exchange rates are subject to substantial movement. Therefore, reported results may vary materially from a constant currency view.
From a sensitivity perspective, each 5% movement of the exchange rates material to the company's business, could impact reported revenue growth by approximately 150 basis points and adjusted earnings per share could be impacted by about $0.03 per share.
For 2016, revenue, excluding the impacts from currency, is expected to be in the range of 1% decline to 2% growth when compared to 2015. We expect the segment groups to continue to trend towards the global market growth rates that we communicated at Analyst Day.
Therefore, versus prior year, we expect SMB revenue to have a low single-digit decline, enterprise revenue to be in a range of flat to low single-digit growth and Digital Commerce Solutions revenue to grow at a low double-digit range. Revenue is expected to benefit from the completion of the go-to-market changes in the company's major markets; new product launches across the portfolio; recent acquisitions, including Borderfree, Real Time Content and Enroute Systems Corporation; continued growth in a number of Ecommerce brands and clients on our platform; and the expansion of the company's Presort Services network.
The benefits will be offset, in part, by the exit of businesses in Mexico, South Africa and 5 markets in Asia and the conversion of those markets to a dealer network. In aggregate, these markets generated $26 million in revenue in 2015.
EPS from continuing operations on both an adjusted and GAAP basis are expected to be in the range of $1.80 to $2 in 2016. As I laid out at Analyst Day in September, in 2016, we expect earnings per share to benefit by $0.12 to $0.15 associated with prior restructuring efforts and early ERP benefits. We also expect $0.03 to $0.05 in incremental earnings per share from a full year of synergies associated with the Borderfree integration, net of incremental amortization costs for intangibles.
Conversely, there's $0.04 of earnings in 2015 associated with Imagitas that will not repeat in 2016. The remaining benefits are expected to come from operating leverage resulting from the actions taken in our portfolio and additional operational excellence initiatives.
Additionally, we have assumed a tax rate in the range of 32% to 35%. This range reflects a higher mix of U.S.-sourced income. We've included a slide in our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website, which lays out the reconciliation for adjusted earnings per share.
Free cash flow for 2016 is expected to be in the range of $425 million to $525 million. Again, as I noted in Analyst Day in September, free cash flow is expected to benefit from $25 million to $35 million in operational excellence initiatives, mostly from changes in ERP spend and the related early benefits as well as the $5 million from portfolio-driven initiatives. Further stabilization of our core Mailing business and lower cost will improve free cash flow further.
However, you should note that there was about $7 million of free cash flow from the Imagitas operations that we got in the first half of 2015 that we will not get in 2016 as a result of the sale in May 2015.
Let me now provide some color around 2016 from a timing perspective and time line for our ERP implementation. The company expects ongoing improvement in SG&A as a percentage of revenue as a result of the expected benefits from the implementation of the new ERP program. The majority of these 2016 benefits are expected to be realized in the second half of the year as we plan to launch the new system in the U.S. in the first half, and we'll be investing heavily to make sure the launch goes as smoothly as possible.
We will also incur incremental marketing expense related to our new advertising campaign. This expense is expected to be highest in the first and fourth quarters of the year as a result of the planned timing of company's new advertising placements. Therefore, we expect earnings in the first half of the year to be more heavily impacted by both ERP and marketing expense. We will start to realize most of the ERP benefits, both from a savings and cost-reduction perspective, starting in the third quarter and increasing through the fourth quarter.
As I said at Analyst Day regarding ERP, we designed the system in 2014. 2015 involved the build-out, data cleansing and preparing our environment to operate within this new system, and 2016 will be about deployment of the new system. We also started to recognize some initial benefits in 2015 as we changed and streamlined our processes in order to be prepared for the ERP go live. As we enter 2016, the capital expenses related to this project are expected to come to down, and the benefits will start to materialize as a result of the implementation. We will realize even greater benefits in 2017 post our full global deployment.
So I'm taking you through our 2016 outlook from a P&L, free cash flow and timing perspective. Let me close with a few comments on capital allocation and then we can take your questions.
Again, as I mentioned at Analyst Day, over the next 3 years from 2016 to 2018, we expect to yield more than $1 billion in free cash flow. As we have said, we are disciplined stewards of your capital, and we'll continue to take a balanced approach with our capital allocation strategy.
We remain focused on investing in the growth drivers of our business as well as returning capital to our shareholders, both in the form of a continued competitive dividend and continued share repurchase. We expect to continue to have the flexibility and capacity to do so.
That concludes my remarks. Operator, can you please open the line for questions?"

I think -- I know rather if you look at the clients that are using our products, they are very sophisticated consumers of technology, which tells me we have good products. And as we've surveyed the market, we have brand permission to sell these offerings. So the first point I'd make, Shannon, is we continue to be bullish about the market as well as the products. In terms of what happened in the quarter, plainly said, the team didn't execute. So after -- as I said a couple of years of pretty strong execution in terms of doing what they said they were going to do, we just didn't hit the ball. So I don't see it as a pervasive problem. I see it as a quarter aberration. That's not to say other quarters are going to be precisely the way that we wanted. I do think to Mike's point, we're making a couple of incremental adjustments, which will be important. The first is we continue to pursue new channels. I will note as we recruit these new channels. They've all taken note of our advertising campaign, and it helps us recruit new partners as well as new clients. Secondly, we've fine-tuned our offerings to put them much more in a solution context, which helps our clients better understand the value proposition. And finally, I think our advertising campaign will help. And as I said, Bob Guidotti is a great leader over this. So through the business that it need to get fixed.

That's helpful. And can you talk about -- I don't know this is for Mike or what, but on GAAP and adjusted earnings now sort of being equal, which is good because it shows that you're sort of getting through your restructuring and all the other charges, but how do we think about that as you look at the year given some of the pressures you're seeing in that and then also from an ERP standpoint? Do you need more restructuring charges as you get the ERP in place, because then you can sort of let some people go? Or just give us an idea of how we should think about that?

Yes, in terms of the guidance we gave, I think very consistent with what we said last year. Our guidance does not include any restructuring that hasn't been defined and declared at this point in time. So the possibility exists that there's activities that we would undertake, and we would certainly call those out. As you recall at Analyst Day when we talked about the ERP implementation, we did note the fact that there will likely be additional restructuring associated with the program when we fully deploy it on the back end. As you saw in the fourth quarter, we took a charge about $11 million related to some of the early opportunities we've identified in the program. So as we go through the deployment, we'll make a determination whether or not there's additional restructuring activities we need to undertake, but clearly the benefits will begin to accrue more to the second half after the implementation, and that's when the opportunity would present itself."

Just how this sort of wave theory of the improvement in equipment then coming through on some of the recurring revenue side? And then also just if you can talk a little bit about the distribution decisions, and if there are any more markets where you might make that decision?"

We did several, and I think I had pretty much completed that process. Obviously, there'll be an ongoing review, but we really identified 12 core markets and about 7 additional markets around those 12 that would be the core focus for us in terms of systems, products and other investments. And so we are at that level now and feel like that's a good place to be. With respect to equipment sales, I would say very much what we're seeing is consistent with what we laid out and the trend we would expect to see. You saw the continued improvement in North American Mailing in the U.S. in particular, that was minus 1%, which was again an improvement on a year-over-year basis. International actually grew equipment sales. We had good performance in both U.K. and actually Italy with placements with the Italian post. We have work to do yet to continue to improve the markets like France, which really undertook that process later than some of the other markets. So we believe the glide path is in the right direction. In terms of your question about how does that ultimately affect recurring revenue streams, obviously, recurring revenue streams are built up over a period of time. So as equipment sales stabilize and in some instances grow, then that will begin to turn the direction of the recurring revenue streams or improve the comparisons in the recurring revenue streams, but that will be a more gradual process. I guess, a good example of that as you could see in the North American business, the U.S. in particular, our finance receivables actually went up from the third quarter to the fourth quarter as a result of the performance of equipment sales modestly, and that's not a year-over-year comparison but a quarter-to-quarter, but the relative rate of decline in finance receivables has come down in large part as a result of beginning to see the improvement in those comparisons of equipment sales on a year-over-year basis."

At one level, the revenue that we missed, as we exited those markets, would have been mighty helpful last year. That said, we took the short-term hit in order we could drive better focus on the places where we did get profit as well as simplify our systems project. So I think it's a good example of where our mindset is. We'll take some short-term pains particularly on the top line in order to secure the long-term of the business.

As you appropriately point out, George, right now, the preponderance of that business is U.S. outbound, which will be in the short term. And by the way, I mean, I think one of the things we believe is this currency cycle is going to last for a while longer. So we are under no delusions about the currency dynamics changing anytime in the near future. That being said, we do have opportunities to move this business outside of the United States. We moved it to the U.K. It's been a very important driver of growth. We continue to survey other parts of the world, where we think we can get on the other side of currency. If you look at this organically, I think it's very interesting to note and Mike alluded to it that we added 75 clients since the acquisition. So it takes a while longer for those clients to come online and make a meaningful revenue impact, but that is a material increase in the number of clients. And when you see clients like Target or Harrods that tells you that we've got great capabilities. So that's why we're so optimistic about the long-term prospects of this business. It clearly will have some short-term pressures until we get diversified outside of the United States, and we get some of these incremental clients online and producing revenue. But if you look at the overall market opportunity and how well we're positioned, I think you can't help but conclude this is a wonderful opportunity for us."

I mentioned in my comments that we expect the spend to be highest in the first quarter and the fourth quarter, and you might ask why that kind of timing. It really bookends what will be a very aggressive and active political season. And so we believe in establishing it in the first quarter and then reenergizing it from a broad advertising standpoint in the fourth quarter, while still doing a lot of digital and more direct targeted stuff in between is the most efficient use of our capital. In doing that, in terms of our total marketing spend, there'll probably be about a $0.03 higher spend in the first and fourth quarters relative to the prior year and hopefully, that's helpful in terms of how people look at the calendarization of that.

That being said, I wouldn't blame what happened to us in the fourth quarter on the economy. We had within our control, the opportunity to do better, and we just didn't hit the ball. So I think there's 2 separate things going on. We got plenty of headroom in these markets regardless of what's going on in the overall economy. So that's point one. Point two, if you think about how we thought about guidance, I will say, we're not oblivious to what's going on around us. So our buildup of how we thought about guidance was primarily driven by things that we could control within our own grasp, read that as savings from our ERP project. That spending beginning to moderate secondly, and third, synergies from Borderfree. So we were -- I won't tell you we're conservative as we thought about 2016, but we're much more focused on things that we could control.

Our bias in the short term is around repurchases and that's simply because if you look at the different returns of uses of capital we think that's the highest. And let me make an additional point. Shareholder repurchases aren't to advantage shareholders that we're buying the stock from, it's to advantage the shareholders that continue to stick with us. My view is there's a lot of earnings opportunity that is in front of us in the short term and to have that earnings over a more leveraged capital base is a good thing for our shareholders. So we think about different contexts of how we drive shareholder return that's twice as well evolve over time, but right now based on what we see, we're still confident of what we laid out at Analyst Day."

By now, I hope you've had the chance to review the press release announcing our fourth quarter and full year results.
As I said at our most recent Analyst Day, the second half of the year was an inflection point for our company. We believe that the progress across our overall business, achieved during the fourth quarter and more broadly over the course of 2015, reinforces this view and provides us with a reason to be optimistic about the long-term future of Pitney Bowes. Evidence of this is that our SMB equipment sales revenue performance continued to improve in the second half of the year.
Secondly, we deployed our ambitious process reengineering and systems project in Canada, and we are on target to deploy in the United States in the first half of 2016, which is key for us to realize the benefits of investments we have made. And finally, after several years of focus on our balance sheet, our capital allocation priorities have evolved to a more balanced approach from deploying capital for growth and returning capital to our shareholders. While our overall business did improve in the fourth quarter, it'd also be true that I expected more, particularly from our Software business.
The performance of our Software business was not consistent with our long-term model. Over the last several quarters and really over the last couple of years, our Software team had been more effective in terms of their sales execution. The fourth quarter was a departure from this pattern. We did not experience the close rates or the deal sized growth rate we would have expected for the fourth quarter of the year. The net of this was a disappointing performance. We continued to work to move our Software business into new markets and to develop new channels. There's no doubt this is the right strategy. Our existing client base tells that we have the right products, but we need to move faster into these new markets. To that end, I'm confident our new advertising campaigns will help condition the market, and our client-driven product innovation will help us build opportunities faster. In addition, we have named Bob Guidotti to run our Software business. Bob is a proven executive, including his tenure as the General Manager of IBM Software sales. We look forward to Bob's contribution and expect that he will have a positive impact on our Software business. 
All that being said, the objective of our transformation has been and continues to be to create long-term value. Through that lens, we made substantial progress on our agenda in 2015. In SMB, revenue trends continue to moderate as our new go-to-market model continued to mature. Fourth quarter equipment sales in the U.S. were down only 1%, and in our International Mailing business, equipment sales grew on a constant currency basis, confirming the progress we have made on our new go-to-market initiative. To remind everyone, while implementation of our new go-to-market model in SMB was constructive, our new channel strategy provides more reach, drives higher client satisfaction and is more efficient than the model we are coming from. The stabilization of our equipment sales is clear evidence of the effectiveness of the new strategy. In addition, as equipment sales continue to moderate, the associated revenue streams will also stabilize. 
In terms of operational effectiveness, we continue to build the right platform and rationalize our portfolio for the long term. In 2015, we continued to dramatically simplify our business, tightening focus on our geographic footprint. Additionally, we are creating a foundation for better client-driven processes with our new ERP application. As I mentioned previously, this work has moved from design to deployment, and with the United States clearly in our sights, we're that much closer to realizing the benefits of these new investments. In addition, we continue to focus on optimizing our working capital. Our inventory is now less than half of what it was when we began this transformation.
Finally, growing Digital Commerce. In 2015, we grew Digital Commerce. We changed the overall capability mix and focus with the acquisition of Borderfree and the divestiture of Imagitas. Our portfolio's now more focused and well positioned going forward. DCS grew 14% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter. The integration of Borderfree is on track, and we continue to be on our business case. I'm very optimistic about the e-commerce market and how we are positioning ourselves to capitalize on this growing market opportunity.
Now let me take a moment to provide broader perspective on our transformation. The first point I'll make is a point I'd made from the beginning. Transformations are not straight lines. They are difficult, they are hard and they take time. That being said, I think the evidence that we are making a successful transformation is compelling. When we started 3 years ago, our North American Mailing business was declining 7%. We have lessened that decline to around 3% by constant currency. As you all know, equipment sales are the leading indicator for the SMB business.
Over the last 6 months on a constant currency level, equipment sales in North America Mailing had been essentially flat. In the last quarter, equipment sales in our International Mailing business returned to growth. We did this while dramatically changing our go-to-market model, which providers better reach, better client service in a more efficient manner. In terms of operational excellence, we reduced our debt by over $1 billion, cut our inventory by more than half and improved our margins. We dramatically simplified our business and rationalized our portfolio. Finally, we have undertaken a substantial systems project to fundamentally reengineer how we do business. The impact of all these changes will be a business more able to address the market needs of our clients a lot more efficiently.
In terms of Digital Commerce business, we have focused our portfolio and made targeted acquisitions to improve our capabilities. We have done this while substantially increasing our organizational capability. As we transformed our business, we laid out long-term markers: stabilizing SMB and operating at low single-digit declines, enterprise business flat to slight growth and Digital Commerce growing north of 10%. We haven't hit those markers every quarter, but over the last 3 years, we have operated basically within those parameters. We also have transitioned from a position of rehabilitating our balance sheet to a more balanced approach to capital allocation, enabling us to return capital to shareholders.
We need to build on our performance during the fourth quarter, but when I look at what we have accomplished over the last 3 years, I think the evidence is clear that our transformation is on track. We're embarking on our most significant advertising campaign in 20 years as we seek to further expand and capitalize on our brand. We have 1.5 million small and medium business clients in addition to more than 90% of the Fortune 500. We have established a position of trust and are in the early innings of bringing expanded product and solution offerings to these clients. We continue to strengthen our systems and processes while adding great talent to our team. And as Mike will describe shortly, 2016 will be another step forward in our transformation. Again, this will not be a straight line to the top. That's why it's so important we invest in our future with our systems, our brand and continue to build our organizational capability.
With that said, let me turn this call over to Mike."

As Marc noted, we made significant progress during t",3737,"Thank you, Marc, and good morning. As I mentioned when I gave guidance at the onset of the year and my referred to since, 2015 represented a critical third year in the company's business transformation. As Marc noted, we made significant progress during the year, progress that is setting us up for the long-term growth. This included repositioning the portfolio through several acquisitions and divestitures, introducing a new brand and marketing effort, launching several new products, completing the go-to-market transition in our major markets and strengthening our balance sheet. This all while we continue to reduce costs across the organization through our operational excellence initiatives and work to implement a new ERP system, which is initially launched in Canada in October.
Several of these actions caused periodic disruptions across the business, but we remained focus on transforming and streamlining our business. There were several factors that had a direct impact on our results, which we identified earlier in the year, most notably the net impact from the sale of our Imagitas business and the acquisition of Borderfree and the exit of several smaller markets and noncore products in Europe in 2014. In aggregate, these actions negatively impacted revenue comparisons by 1% for the year and earnings per share by $0.10 per share. Additionally, our full year tax rate on adjusted earnings of 33.5% was at the high end of our guidance range. This higher tax rate was driven primarily by a higher mix of U.S.-sourced income.
And as with any business, there were elements outside our control that had a major impact on our results. For us, the most significant of these was currency, particularly the U.S. dollar. First, it negatively impacted both revenue and earnings per share from translation effects, reducing revenue by $133 million or 3.5% and earnings per share by $0.07 per share for the year. Second, the stronger U.S. dollar made purchases from the U.S. that much more expensive, which lowered e-commerce cross-border activity. That being said, we remained focused on e-commerce by signing 59 new brands and retailers to our platform since acquiring Borderfree, increasing the number of countries to which we ship, expanding our payment options and growing penetration in the cross-border community. For the year, our e-commerce marketplace business grew 10% organically, and the Global Ecommerce segment grew 30% when you layer in shipping and the incremental revenue from the Borderfree acquisition. While currencies will continue to fluctuate, we are well positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities in this exciting growth market.
Let me now turn to the financials. First, I'll take you through a high-level overview of our annual results and then I'll discuss the quarter in more detail. I will then conclude with our guidance for 2016 and open the line for questions. Please note that a reconciliation of adjusted to reported financial information can be found in the financial schedules in our earnings press release and posted on our Investor Relations website.
Turning to our full year results. The company achieved results in its full year guidance range for adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow. Annual revenue was $3.58 billion, a 3% decline from prior year on a constant currency basis and a 6% decline on a reported basis. Revenue results fell a bit short of our expectations. As Marc discussed, this was largely the result of lower licensed revenue within our Software business during the fourth quarter. We have made and we'll continue to make refinements to the Software business model to focus our selling efforts on solutions of high value to our clients.
Our SMB business continues to improve and stabilize despite some temporary disruption from the go-to-market changes we made in Europe. In the U.S., annual equipment sales declined only 2% from prior year, largely as a result of a less than 1% decline in the installation of our core mail finishing machines. Additionally, the revenue trend in most of our major markets outside the U.S. continue to improve as we work through the go-to-market changes and sales organization maturity and productivity. Revenue for the year grew on a constant currency basis in the U.K. and Italy due to growth in equipment sales in those countries. And as I mentioned earlier, we went live with our ERP system in Canada in October with little disruption to the business.
Turning to annual revenue results by segment group on a constant currency basis. Digital Commerce Solutions revenue grew 9%, enterprise revenue was flat and SMB revenue declined 5%.  Excluding the impacts of the divested revenues in Europe, SMB revenue would have declined 4%. As a reminder, the annual growth rates for SMB and enterprise are in line with the long-term market growth rate ranges that are presented at Analyst Day for the last 3 years. And Digital Commerce Solutions is approaching its target growth range. On a reported basis, Digital Commerce Solutions revenue grew 5%, enterprise revenue declined 3% and SMB revenue declined 9%.
Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the full year was $1.75. As I mentioned earlier, currency had a $0.07 per share negative impact on earnings for the year. GAAP earnings per share for the full year were $2.03 and included $0.32 per share, which reflects the gain on the sale from Imagitas of $0.44 and net acquisition and disposition-related expense of $0.12; $0.09 per share of restructuring charges, $0.02 per share for a legal settlement, $0.04 per share benefit related to previous investment divestiture and $0.03 per share of income from discontinued operations. Free cash flow for the full year was $456 million, and on a GAAP basis, we generated $515 million in cash from operations. 
Overall, cash flow was impacted primarily by timing of working capital requirements. During the year, we used our cash flow to return capital to our common shareholders, best evidenced by our competitive dividend and our share repurchases. For the year, the company paid $150 million of cash in the form of dividends, bought back more than 6.6 million shares of common stock for $135 million and made $62 million in restructuring payments. We also strengthened our balance sheet through prudent debt management. From a debt management perspective, the company paid down approximately $280 million of debt using a combination of cash on the balance sheet and the issuance of commercial paper.
Further, in January of 2016, the company obtained additional $300 million of bank term loans and refinanced a $371 million note that matured in January. We also invested in the business through acquisition, including Borderfree and Ecommerce and Real Time Content, our EngageOne Video software solution. The divestiture of Imagitas generated net proceeds of approximately $270 million, which we were able to use to partially fund Borderfree acquisition. At year-end, we had just under $3 billion of debt on the balance sheet, which was about $280 million less than the prior year. The company ended the year with $677 million of cash on hand and $90 million in commercial paper outstanding.
Looking at the full year income statement, as a reminder, a reconciliation can be found in our financial statements for any of the adjusted numbers that I talk about. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT were $716 million, which was $15 million lower than prior year. Adjusted EBIT margin was 20%, which was an increase of 90 basis points over prior year. Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA for the year was $889 million.
SG&A for the year was $1.28 billion, which was $98 million or 7% lower than the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 35.8%, which was an improvement of 30 basis points. Since 2012, we have reduced absolute SG&A by $210 million while continuing to invest in our new ERP system and expanding our marketing efforts. For the full year, we recorded pretax restructuring charges totaling $26 million for actions associated with our previously announced plans to reduce costs.
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $159 million, which was a decline of $10 million when compared to the prior year. This was the result of the actions we've taken to manage our debt over the last year. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the year was 33.5%, the high end of our guidance range compared with 27.7% last year. Last year's lower tax rate was due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. As I previously stated, this year's tax rate was impacted primarily by the higher percentage of U.S.-sourced income.
Now let me turn to the quarter's results. Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $937 million. Compared to the prior year, revenue declined 2% on a constant currency basis and 5% on a reported basis, a continuation of improvement in trend. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 14% in Digital Commerce Solutions, grew 1% in Enterprise Business Solutions and declined 3% in SMB. On a reported basis, revenue grew 11% in Digital Commerce Solutions, declined 2% in Enterprise Business Solutions and declined 6% in SMB. 
Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations were $0.48 for the fourth quarter. Currency had a $0.02 per share negative impact on EPS this quarter. GAAP earnings per share were $0.44 and included $0.02 in SG&A expense of cost related to the exit of certain geographic markets during the fourth quarter, a $0.05 restructuring charge and income of $0.03 from discontinued operations. Free cash flow during the quarter was $157 million, and on a GAAP basis, we generated $164 million in cash from operations.
During the quarter, we used $37 million of cash to return capital to our common shareholders in the form of dividends, and we also repurchased 1.7 million shares of our common stock for $35 million. Additionally, we made $16 million in restructuring payments during the quarter. From a debt management perspective, the company used funds from a newly obtained $150 million bank term loan to refinance $110 million of debt. Additionally, in January of 2016, we obtained an additional $300 million of bank term loans and refinanced a $371 million note that matured in January.
Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT were $185 million this quarter, which was $15 million lower than the prior year. Adjusted EBIT margin was 19.8%, which was a decrease of 60 basis points over the prior year but in line with the EBIT margin for the full year 2015. Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $231 million. SG&A for the quarter was $341 million, which was $6 million or 2% lower than the prior year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 36.4%, which was 110 basis points higher than the prior year. This increase was due in part to incremental costs associated with the exit of certain geographic markets in the quarter, incremental cost associated with the amortization of Borderfree intangibles and higher expenses related to the ERP implementation. During the quarter, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $11 million. 
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $40 million, which was a decline of about $2 million when compared to the prior year. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were $233 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 5.34%, which was nearly flat to the prior year. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter was 32.1%, which was flat to the prior year.
Now I'd like to discuss the fourth quarter results for each of our business segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we posted to the pb.com website under the Investor Relations section. For SMB Solutions in North America Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $363 million and EBIT was $165 million. Revenue declined 2% on a constant currency basis and 3% on a reported basis. Revenue for the quarter declined on a constant currency basis at a lesser rate than it did for the first 9 months of the year. Equipment sales in the U.S. declined 1% versus the prior year, and recurring revenue streams continued to perform in line with prior quarters. 
EBIT margin was 45.3%, which was an improvement of 130 basis points versus the prior year due to the mix of business and lower employee-related costs. In International Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $114 million, and EBIT was $14 million. Revenue declined 6% on a constant currency basis and 15% on a reported basis. Revenue declined at its lowest rate all year, benefiting from improved equipment sales trends in most of the major markets, where the company has completed the shift in its go-to-market strategy. Equipment sales revenue grew on a constant currency basis, driven in part by increased sales in the U.K. In France, equipment sales declined at a lesser rate than in previous quarters as the new sales structure increased productivity. However, equipment sales growth was offset by a decline in the recurring revenue streams.
During the quarter, the company sold or entered into agreements to sell assets and convert to a dealer model in Mexico, South Africa and 5 markets in Asia. International Mailing's EBIT margin was 12.7%, decline of 330 basis points versus the prior year due to the impact of currency on costs and lower recurring revenue streams. In the Enterprise Solutions business starting with production mail, revenue for the quarter was $122 million, and EBIT was $17 million. Revenue declined 3% on a constant currency basis and 7% on a reported basis. Revenue trends improved versus the prior 2 quarters and benefited from growth in inserting equipment sales, driven in part by the new Epic product line and higher supplies revenue. Revenue was adversely impacted by fewer printer installations than the prior year.
EBIT margin was 13.7%, a decline of 120 basis points versus prior year due to product mix and increased engineering investments, which offset cost-reduction initiatives. In Presort Services, revenue for the quarter was $122 million, and EBIT was $28 million. Revenue grew 4% on a constant currency and reported basis. Revenue benefited from higher volumes of First Class and Standard class mail processed versus the prior year as well as new client acquisitions. EBIT margin was 22.7%, which was a decline of 290 basis points versus the prior year due to start-up costs to expand the network into 2 new U.S. markets, which offset the benefit from revenue growth.
Turning to Digital Commerce Solutions. In the Software business, revenue for the quarter was $103 million, and EBIT was $14 million. Revenue declined 7% on a constant currency basis and 12% on a reported basis. Revenue declined largely due to lower Location Intelligence licensing revenues in the Americas and Europe, which was in line with a slowdown in the broader Software market. However, as Marc noted, sales execution was disappointing this quarter. Looking ahead, the company's expanding its partner channel reach and focusing on several high potential industry specific solutions to drive growth. EBIT margin was 13.2%, a decline of 450 basis points as a result of the lower amount of license revenue, which has high margin. 
In Global Ecommerce, revenue for the quarter was $112 million, and EBIT was $9 million. Revenue grew 46% on a constant currency basis and 45% on a reported basis. Results included a full quarter of revenue from Borderfree and growth in the U.K. marketplace revenue. The company added a number of new retail clients and expanded its payment options during the quarter. However, outbound package shipments from the U.S. continued to be pressured by the strong U.S. dollar. This was especially true with regards to the Canadian and Australian dollars, both of which were 15% lower in value against the U.S. dollar in the quarter versus the prior year. These markets represent 2 of our top 3 markets for volume shipped from the U.S. EBIT margin was 8.3%, which was a decline of 150 basis points versus the prior year due to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, which offset the early stages of synergy savings.
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the year and the quarter. Now I'd like to provide some insights on our outlook for 2016. As in the past, we're providing guidance on a constant currency basis. The company's guidance assumes that the global economy and foreign exchange markets will not change significantly from year-end 2015 levels. However, as we have seen over the last 18 months, currency exchange rates are subject to substantial movement. Therefore, reported results may vary materially from a constant currency view.
From a sensitivity perspective, each 5% movement in the exchange rates material to the company's business could impact reported revenue growth by approximately 150 basis points and adjusted earnings per share could be impacted by about $0.03 per share. For 2016, revenue, excluding the impacts from currency, is expected to be in the range of a 1% decline to 2% growth when compared to 2015. We expect the segment groups to continue to trend towards the global market growth rates that we communicated at Analyst Day.
Therefore, versus prior year, we expect SMB revenue to have a low single-digit decline, enterprise revenue to be in a range of flat to low single-digit growth and Digital Commerce Solutions revenue to grow at a low double-digit range. Revenue is expected to benefit from the completion of the go-to-market changes in the company's major markets; new product launches across the portfolio; recent acquisitions, including Borderfree, Real Time Content and Enroute Systems Corporation; continued growth in a number of Ecommerce brands and clients on our platform; and the expansion of the company's Presort Services network. The benefits will be offset, in part, by the exit of businesses in Mexico, South Africa and 5 markets in Asia and the conversion of those markets to a dealer network. In aggregate, these markets generated $26 million in revenue in 2015.
EPS from continuing operations on both an adjusted and GAAP basis are expected to be in the range of $1.80 to $2 in 2016. As I laid out at Analyst Day in September, in 2016, we expect earnings per share to benefit by $0.12 to $0.15 associated with prior restructuring efforts and early ERP benefits. We also expect $0.03 to $0.05 in incremental earnings per share from a full year of synergies associated with the Borderfree integration, net of incremental amortization costs for intangibles. Conversely, there is $0.04 of earnings in 2015 associated with Imagitas that will not repeat in 2016. The remaining benefits are expected to come from operating leverage resulting from the actions taken in our portfolio and additional operational excellence initiatives.
Additionally, we have assumed a tax rate in the range of 32% to 35%. This range reflects a higher mix of U.S.-sourced income. We've included a slide in our earnings presentation on the Investor Relations website, which lays out the reconciliation for adjusted earnings per share. Free cash flow for 2016 is expected to be in the range of $425 million to $525 million. Again, as I noted at Analyst Day in September, free cash flow is expected to benefit from $25 million to $35 million in operational excellence initiatives, mostly from changes in ERP spend and the related early benefits as well as the $5 million from portfolio-driven initiatives. Further stabilization of our core Mailing business and lower cost will improve free cash flow further. However, you should note that there was about $7 million of free cash flow from the Imagitas operations that we got in the first half of 2015 that we will not get in 2016 as a result of the sale in May 2015.
Let me now provide some color around 2016 from a timing perspective and time line for our ERP implementation. The company expects ongoing improvement in SG&A as a percentage of revenue as a result of the expected benefits from the implementation of the new ERP program. The majority of these 2016 benefits are expected to be realized in the second half of the year as we plan to launch the new system in the U.S. in the first half, and we'll be investing heavily to make sure the launch goes as smoothly as possible.
We will also incur incremental marketing expense related to our new advertising campaign. This expense is expected to be highest in the first and fourth quarters of the year as a result of the planned timing of company's new advertising placements. Therefore, we expect earnings in the first half of the year to be more heavily impacted by both ERP and marketing expense. We will start to realize most of the ERP benefits, both from a savings and cost-reduction perspective, starting in the third quarter and increasing through the fourth quarter.
As I said at Analyst Day regarding ERP, we designed the system in 2014. 2015 involved the build-out, data cleansing and preparing our environment to operate within this new system, and 2016 will be about deployment of the new system. We also started to recognize some initial benefits in 2015 as we changed and streamlined our processes in order to be prepared for the ERP go live. As we enter 2016, the capital expenses related to this project are expected to come to down, and the benefits will start to materialize as a result of the implementation. We will realize even greater benefits in 2017 post our full global deployment.
So I'm taking you through our 2016 outlook from a P&L, free cash flow and timing perspective. Let me close with a few comments on capital allocation and then we can take your questions. Again, as I mentioned at Analyst Day, over the next 3 years from 2016 to 2018, we expect to yield more than $1 billion in free cash flow. As we have said, we are disciplined stewards of your capital, and we'll continue to take a balanced approach with our capital allocation strategy. We remain focused on investing in the growth drivers of our business as well as returning capital to our shareholders, both in the form of a continued competitive dividend and continued share repurchase. We expect to continue to have the flexibility and capacity to do so.
That concludes my remarks. Operator, can you please open the line for questions?"

So if you look at the end-user growth rates for those markets, they're all very strong. I think -- I know, rather, if you look at the clients that are using our products, they are very sophisticated consumers of technology, which tells me we have good products. And as we have surveyed the market, we have brand permission to sell these offerings. So the first point I'd make, Shannon, is we continue to be bullish about the market as well as the products. In terms of what happened in the quarter, plainly said, the team didn't execute. So after, as I said, a couple of years of pretty strong execution in terms of doing what they said they were going to do, we just didn't hit the ball. So I don't see it as a pervasive problem. I see it as a quarter aberration. That's not to say other quarters are going to be precisely the way that we wanted. I do think to Mike's point, we're making a couple of incremental adjustments, which will be important. The first is we continue to pursue new channels. I will note as we recruit these new channels, they've all taken note of our advertising campaign, and it helps us recruit new partners as well as new clients. Secondly, we've fine-tuned our offerings to put them much more in a solution context, which helps our clients better understand the value proposition. And finally, I think our advertising campaign will help. And as I said, Bob Guidotti is a great lead arbiter. So I don't think it's a business that needs to get fixed. I think I see this as a business that needs to get back on the horse and go."

Yes, in terms of the guidance we gave, I think very consistent with what we said last year. Our guidance does not include any restructuring that hasn't been defined and declared at this point in time. So the possibility exists that there's activities that we would undertake, and we would certainly call those out. As you recall at Analyst Day when we talked about the ERP implementation, we did note the fact that there will likely be additional restructuring associated with the program when we fully deploy it on the back end. As you saw in the fourth quarter, we took a charge about $11 million related to some of the early opportunities we've identified in the program. So as we go through the deployment, we'll make a determination whether or not there's additional restructuring activities we need to undertake, but clearly the benefits will begin to accrue more to the second half after the implementation, and that's when the opportunity would present itself."

But how -- on the first part, how do we think about equipment sales improvement that you've seen through this year then sort of representing itself in numbers in -- well, I guess, second half of 2016 and then into 2017 and beyond? Just how this sort of wave theory of the improvement in equipment then coming through on some of the recurring revenue side? And then also just if you can talk a little bit about the distribution decisions, and if there are any more markets where you might make that decision? And that's it."

We did several, and I think I had pretty much completed that process. Obviously, there'll be an ongoing review, but we really identified 12 core markets and about 7 additional markets around those 12 that would be the core focus for us in terms of systems, products and other investments. And so we are at that level now and feel like that's a good place to be. With respect to equipment sales, I would say very much what we're seeing is consistent with what we laid out and the trend we would expect to see. You saw the continued improvement in North American Mailing in the U.S. in particular, that was minus 1%, which was again an improvement on a year-over-year basis. International actually grew equipment sales. We had good performance in both U.K. and actually Italy with placements with the Italian post. We have work to do yet to continue to improve the markets like France, which really undertook that process later than some of the other markets. So we believe the glide path is in the right direction. In terms of your question about how does that ultimately affect recurring revenue streams, obviously, recurring revenue streams are built up over a period of time. So as equipment sales stabilize and in some instances grow, then that will begin to turn the direction of the recurring revenue streams or improve the comparisons in the recurring revenue streams, but that will be a more gradual process. I guess, a good example of that as you could see in the North American business, the U.S. in particular, our finance receivables actually went up from the third quarter to the fourth quarter as a result of the performance of equipment sales modestly, and that's not a year-over-year comparison but a quarter-to-quarter, but the relative rate of decline in finance receivables has come down in large part as a result of beginning to see the improvement in those comparisons of equipment sales on a year-over-year basis."

At one level, the revenue that we missed, as we exited those markets, would have been mighty helpful last year. That said, we took the short-term hit in order we could drive better focus on the places where we did get profit as well as simplify our systems project. So I think it's a good example of where our mindset is. We'll take some short-term pains particularly on the top line in order to secure the long-term of the business.

As you appropriately point out, George, right now, the preponderance of that business is U.S. outbound, which will be in the short term. And by the way, I mean, I think one of the things we believe is this currency cycle is going to last for a while longer. So we are under no delusions about the currency dynamics changing anytime in the near future. That being said, we do have opportunities to move this business outside of the United States. We moved it to the U.K. It's been a very important driver of growth. We continue to survey other parts of the world, where we think we can get on the other side of currency. If you look at this organically, I think it's very interesting to note and Mike alluded to it, we added 75 clients since the acquisition. So it takes a while longer for those clients to come online and make a meaningful revenue impact, but that is a material increase in the number of clients. And when you see clients like Target or Harrods, it tells you that we've got great capabilities. So that's why we're so optimistic about the long-term prospects of this business. It clearly will have some short-term pressures until we get diversified outside of the United States, and we get some of these incremental clients online and producing revenue. But if you look at the overall market opportunity and how well we're positioned, I think you can't help but conclude this is a wonderful opportunity for us."

The number of times over the last 3 years, where I've talked to clients and described to them our capabilities in Software or Ecommerce, I said, ""My gosh, I never knew that."" And this is a fast way to accelerate our awareness and ultimately our consideration. It is predicated on that there's -- that we have brand permission in these spaces.

I mentioned in my comments that we expect the spend to be highest in the first quarter and the fourth quarter, and you might ask why that kind of timing. It really bookends what will be a very aggressive and active political season. And so we believe in establishing it in the first quarter and then reenergizing it from a broad advertising standpoint in the fourth quarter, while still doing a lot of digital and more direct targeted stuff in between is the most efficient use of our capital. In doing that, in terms of our total marketing spend, there'll probably be about a $0.03 higher spend in the first and fourth quarters relative to the prior year and hopefully, that's helpful in terms of how people look at the calendarization of that.

And I think you see that in GDP, you see it in durable goods, you see it in monetary policies around the world. That being said, I wouldn't blame what happened to us in the fourth quarter on the economy. We had within our control, the opportunity to do better, and we just didn't hit the ball. So I think there's 2 separate things going on. We got plenty of headroom in these markets regardless of what's going on in the overall economy. So that's point one. Point two, if you think about how we thought about guidance, I will say, we're not oblivious to what's going on around us. So our buildup of how we thought about guidance was primarily driven by things that we could control within our own grasp, read that as savings from our ERP project. That spending beginning to moderate secondly, and third, synergies from Borderfree. So we were -- I won't tell you we're conservative as we thought about 2016, but we're much more focused on things that we could control.

Our bias in the short term is around repurchases and that's simply because if you look at the different returns of uses of capital we think that's the highest. And let me make an additional point. Shareholder repurchases aren't to advantage shareholders that we're buying the stock from, it's to advantage the shareholders that continue to stick with us. My view is there's a lot of earnings opportunity that is in front of us in the short term and to have that earnings over a more leveraged capital base is a good thing for our shareholders. So we think about different contexts of how we drive shareholder return. The process will evolve over time, but right now based on what we see, we're still confident of what we laid out in Analyst Day."

The one, as I pointed out, the 2 currencies that probably have had the biggest impact on us when you look at both translation as well as impact from affecting the purchases from the U.S. because of the strong U.S. dollar have been the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar. So as an example on a year-over-year basis, they had appreciated about 15% against the U.S. dollar. The key will be whether we see sort of a stabilization or a more modest rate of change in the currencies going forward, that creates a little more visibility and predictability in terms of how people's buying behaviors will be impacted, but we, obviously, looked at it from a -- where we are today versus the prior year."

Last week, we made one of the most consequential announcements in Pitney Bowes' history. We introduced the Pitney Bowes' Commerce Cloud along with several SaaS-based products and solutions. This aligns our physical and digital capabilities along with our mobile, location and e-commerce technologies with all of the end-to-end requirements that drive commerce. To my mind, this was more than a product announcement. This is the foundation for all of our future products and solutions, adding digital capabilities and web-based solutions that span all of our business units. It is also a demonstration of how we are redefining and transforming Pitney Bowes by expanding our reach as we finance existing client relationships and cultivate new ones. And it broadens our addressable market for our 1.5 million clients by an order of magnitude. This is a substantial opportunity for our company and is consistent with the strategy we've been pursuing for the past 3 years. While our competitors may have parts of e-commerce solution, we are the only company that provides such a broad range of commerce solutions that deliver the functionality, speed and agility our clients need from small businesses to large global companies. In addition to the launch of e-commerce cloud, we achieve a number of milestones during the first quarter that will further advance our transformation. 
In January, we launched our first major television advertising campaign in 20 years. We've completed our move to a dealer market in Mexico, South Africa and 5 markets in Asia. And finally, we deployed our newly designed business processes and accompanying technology in April. While we sometimes refer to this as the new ERP project, it's much bigger as it completely design of our business processes. As we've said, this product is key for us to realize the benefits of investments we have made in delivering new products such as those enabled by our Commerce Cloud. Those benefits are clearly in our sights, and we are evaluating the feasibility of accelerating our business case. 
Turning to the results for our first quarter. Our financial performance was largely consistent and in line with our expectations, the same with our Software Solutions businesses. We turned in another strong performance in Presort and Global Ecommerce businesses, while SMB revenue trends continue to stabilize and improve. SMB new equipment sales, a leading indicator of our future reoccurring revenue streams, were positive, highlighted by the largest growth in North America equipment sales in several years. However, our Software Solutions business performance was disappointing. Simply put, we do not execute, and while the business issues we see are not complicated, we need to fix them. I'm confident that the new leadership are doing well. We have the right products, and our Software solution strategy is resonating with the clients. During the quarter, we have a new President, a new leader to drive our channel strategy and a new Head of Marketing. In December, we appointed a new worldwide sales leader to drive sales efficiency and productivity globally. We expected this business can and should be better. While the market conditions in the technology industry are currently not great, I'm confident that we will see a slow and steady improvement in our Software Solutions business throughout the year. 
Now, as I have every quarter, let me update you on our 3 strategic initiatives for creating long-term value: reinventing mailing, operational excellence and growth by providing access to our digital commerce capabilities across our business. 
First, reinventing mailing. The positive year-over-year growth in North America Mailing equipment sales and continued moderation of declines in International Mailing revenue reflect the benefits of moves we made to stabilize the business, including go-to-market changes and realigning our geographic footprint. We're not done, and we'll continue to focus on enhancing sales productivity globally. Last week's launch of Sempro, as an application of Commerce Cloud, is a great demonstration of how we are reinventing mailing to deliver new value to our SMB clients. We're integrating physical and digital technologies into more relevant solutions and enhancing their experience with us through digital interfaces. 
Next, operational excellence. The new business processes and accompanying technology we're deploying is foundational to be globally integrated and a more efficient company. In 2 years, the benefits have moved from possible to probable and now to reality, and we did it on time. Our successful launch in April on the U.S. and ongoing stabilization in Canada are already starting to provide benefits for our clients in terms of improved business processes, enhanced productivity improvements and easier access to a web store. Their early returns are good, and the issues are what we would've expected and are manageable. As part of this initiative, we also deployed a client portal that provides better visibility into transaction data and client activity to help them better manage and anticipate their enterprise-wide needs and help us provide relevant recommendations for next actions. 
And finally, grow our Digital Commerce Solutions by leveraging our existing client base. In the first quarter, Digital Commerce Solutions were 11% despite being negatively impacted by our Software Solutions business. E-commerce continued to grow with the inclusion of retail revenue from Borderfree and marketplace growth in U.K. Today, the Pitney Bowes Borderfree retail platform has 222 storefront, and we're adding more every month. We also saw an increase in the outbound package volumes. We are well positioned to capitalize on the large opportunities that this market represents. I continue to believe this is one of the most exciting opportunities I've ever seen in the technology industry. 
We are disappointed with our Software performance and Software Solutions business, but the issues are addressable and the other aspects of our long-term plan are coming together nicely. We see a clear path forward and will not be deterred. I'm confident in our ability to deliver our long-term strategic plan and continue to unlock value for our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike."

As Marc discussed, the start to 2016 has been about achieving a number of milestones in the company's transformation, important milestones in that they are solidifying the key financial drivers of our results over the next 2 to 3 years. We have now delivered a new operating platform and an initial set of cutting-edge solutions designed to sit on that platform. And additionally, we completed a first quarter that validated our actions to stabilize and reinvent our Mailing business but also highlighted areas like Software where we have further work to do. Over the past 2-plus years, we've implemented both a go-to-market channel transformation and a recasting of our direct distribution geographic footprint in our SMB business. Our first quarter results represent an important milestone. On a constant currency basis and when the adjusted the recent market exits, global SMB grew equipment sales 3% led by growth in North America Mailing, which had its best quarter of equipment sales growth in several years. 
In April, we took another critical step forward in delivering operational excellence that will not only reduce cost but dramatically enhances our ability to deliver and manage new products and services. Following on our pilot in Canada in late 2015, we delivered our ERP platform in the U.S., along with a new web store and client portal that support our new Commerce Cloud solutions. While we remain in ramp-up phase, we have no enabled nearly 80% of our revenue base on the new platform. This new platform and the solutions that supports further fulfills the goal of bringing enterprise capabilities to our entire client base. 
Before turning to the specifics of the quarter, I also wanted to highlight that our investments in the company's future have been balanced with our commitment to managing total return to shareholders. In addition to providing a competitive dividend, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of our common stock during the first quarter. I will take you through our first quarter results in a moment, but it's important to reiterate Marc's sentiment that we have our eye on the prize. The business model innovation we are achieving as a company be it through our brands, infrastructure, technology or the solutions we offer to our clients all are keeping us on track for attaining our long-term objectives. 
Turning to the quarter. We again experienced positive trends in a number of key indicators. SMB equipment sales growth accelerated, which coupled with our recent market exits and previous EBIT margin improvements, reflect the successful transition in our go-to-market model in our SMB Solutions Group. Our Presort Services continues to turn in a strong performance, once again growing revenue and maintaining a strong EBIT margin. Global Ecommerce also continues to perform well with improving trends in both retail and marketplace volumes, with particular strength from our U.K. marketplace. We also continued to add new brands to our retail platform. Production Mail and Software results were below our expectations and were impacted in part by a weaker macroeconomic environment. Our Production Mail results, which can be lumpy at times, were a function of a weak pipeline coming into 2016, a shift to third-party mailers and recent small market exits. As a result of focused pipeline build, we expect this business to strengthen beginning in the second quarter. As Marc discussed, we have more work to do on our Software business as the new management team focuses on improving sales efficiency and expanding our indirect channels to broaden our pipeline of opportunities while also focusing on our new offerings. When we provided guidance for 2016, we identified 3 factors that would affect our year-over-year comparison in the first quarter. First, the sale of our Imagitas business last May. Imagitas contributed about $0.02 to earnings per share last year, which was not repeated this year. Second, incremental expenses related to our advertising campaign and ERP implementation. In aggregate, this lowered earnings per share by $0.04 per share in the quarter compared to the prior year. And third, we announced the exit of direct operations in Mexico, South Africa and 5 markets in Asia and the conversion of those markets to a dealer network. In aggregate, these markets generated approximately $6 million in revenue in last year's first quarter, which was not repeated this year and, thus, had an adverse impact on our revenue comparisons, particularly in the International Mail and Production Mail segments. I will detail this further when I review our segment results. 
Let me now take you through the high-level financial results and then I'll drill down in each of the segments results and provide some additional color around our guidance. Please note that a reconciliation of adjusted to GAAP financial information can be found in the financial schedules in our earnings press release and earnings slides posted to our pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section. Revenue for the first quarter totaled $845 million, which was a decline of 3% on a constant currency basis adjusted for recent market exits, a decline of 4% on a constant currency basis and 5% on a reported basis. Revenue in our SMB segment group declined 3% on a constant currency basis adjusted for recent market exits, declined 4% on a constant currency basis and 5% on a reported basis. Revenue in our Enterprise Business Solutions group declined 1% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits, declined 2% on a constant currency basis and 3% on a reported basis. Digital Commerce Solutions revenue grew 11% on a constant currency basis and 9% on a reported basis. Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.34 for the first quarter. As noted, when compared to the prior year, our adjusted earnings per share results were $0.02 lower due to income in the prior year before the sale of Imagitas as well as $0.03 of incremental advertising expense and $0.01 of incremental ERP systems expense. GAAP earnings per share were $0.30, which includes $0.02 in restructuring charges and $0.01 in disposition cost related to the recent market exits. Free cash flow was $60 million, and we generated $58 million on a GAAP basis in cash from operations. Compared to prior year, free cash flow declined in part due to the early payments to critical vendors resulting from the go-live, blackout period of the new ERP program in the U.S. Free cash flow this quarter was also impacted by the lower net income, which was partly due to the incremental expenses related to the advertising campaign and ERP. This lower decline in finance receivables resulting from favorable equipment sales also impacted the comparison to prior year. 
During the quarter, we returned cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We spent $128 million on the repurchase of our common stock, buying 6.8 million shares in the quarter. We also paid $36 million in dividends to our common shareholders. Additionally, we made $22 million in restructuring payments and made a $37 million contribution to our U.K. pension fund. 
From a debt management perspective, we obtained $300 million of bank term loans and refinanced a $371 million note that matured in January. We disclosed this information in our prior earnings call. 
Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT was $144 million this quarter, which was $34 million lower than the prior year as a result of the incremental advertising ERP expenses, the sale of Imagitas, acquisition cost related to Borderfree and the decline in revenue. Adjusted EBIT margin was 17%. Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $188 million.
SG&A for the quarter was $327 million, which was $12 million or 4% higher than the prior year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 38.7%, which was 340 basis points higher than the prior year. The increase in SG&A was the result of incremental costs associated with the new advertising campaign and ERP implementation as well as the net increase in SG&A resulting from the acquisition of Borderfree. SG&A, excluding these factors, declined year-over-year. 
During the quarter, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $7 million for actions taken in the first quarter to align our operations. Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $34 million, which was a decline of about $9 million when compared to the prior year. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were $178 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 4.66%, which was 74 basis points lower than the prior year. The effective tax rate on an adjusted earnings for the quarter was 36.7%, which was 60 basis points lower than the prior year's tax rate but the above our expected tax rate for the full year, which we expect to still be between 32% and 35%. 
Now I'd like to discuss the first quarter results for each of our business segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we post to the pb.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
For SMB Solutions in North American Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $350 million, and EBIT was $156 million. Revenue declined 3% both on a constant currency and a reported basis. The rate of decline in revenue was in line with prior quarter's results, which reflects a portfolio that is a stabilizing and the maturing of our go-to-market changes as well as our targeted marketing initiatives. On a constant currency basis, equipment sales grew a strong 6% over prior year, which was the highest rate of growth in several years. Recurring revenue streams continue to decline but are expected to benefit in future periods as the trend in equipment sales revenue improves. EBIT margin continued to perform strongly at 44.6%, reflecting ongoing focus on productivity improvements. 
In International Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $104 million, and EBIT was $12 million. Revenue declined 7% on a constant currency basis and 11% on a reported basis. Adjusting constant currency revenue for the recent market exits, revenue declined 5%, which is an improvement from prior quarters. Revenue benefited from equipment sales growth in France, Germany and Japan as the go-to-market strategy matures and productivity benefits are being recognized. The decline in the recurring revenue stream was consistent with prior quarters, and the trend is expected to improve in future periods as the trend in equipment sales revenue improves. EBIT margin was 11.4%, which was 130 basis points higher than prior year as a result of lower cost associated with the change in go-to market. 
Turning to Enterprise Business Solutions. In Production Mail, revenue for the quarter was $87 million, and EBIT was $7 million. Revenue declined 11% on a constant currency basis and 12% on a reported basis. Adjusting constant currency revenue for the recent market exits, revenue declined 8%. Equipment sales declined from prior year partly due to fewer inserting equipment installations and the timing of closing some large deals. Support services and supplies revenue declined in part as a result of some in-house mailers shifting their mail processing to third-party outsourcers and the recent market exits. EBIT margin was 7.8%, which was a decline of 130 basis points versus the prior year due to the lower revenue, especially the higher-margin inserting equipment sales. 
In Presort Services, revenue for the quarter was $127 million, and EBIT was $29 million. Revenue and EBIT both grew 5% on a constant currency basis and reported basis. Revenue benefited from the higher volume of first-class mail processed as well as expansion into the St. Louis market. EBIT margin continued to perform strongly at 22.7%. 
Turning to Digital Commerce Solutions. In Software, revenue for the quarter was $78 million, and EBIT was a loss of $3 million. Revenue declined 7% on a constant currency basis and 10% on a reported basis. Revenue declined due to fewer large licensing deals and lower data-related licenses versus the prior year. The company is expanding its channel reach and focus on several high-potential industries and solutions, which have longer sales cycles. As I mentioned earlier, the new management team is focused on improving sales efficiency and expanding our indirect channel to build the opportunity pipeline. EBIT margin was a negative 3% largely as a result of the lower licensing revenue, which has a high margin and increased selling and marketing investments. 
In Global Ecommerce, revenue for the quarter was $98 million, and EBIT was about $1 million. Revenue grew 31% on a constant currency basis and 30% on a reported basis. Results included another full quarter of revenue from Borderfree. In the quarter, we grew the number of retail storefront clients and had strong growth in the U.K. marketplace. And although the stronger U.S. dollar continued to have an impact on outbound demand, the recent trading range against key buying currencies resulted in improving volumes trends for the course of the quarter in our U.S. marketplace. EBIT margin was about 1% due to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and investments in the business, which more than offset early synergy savings. The business remains on track to achieve its synergy run rate objective by the end of the year. 
That concludes my remarks on the segments. Let me now take a moment to discuss our 2016 guidance.
The company is reaffirming its annual revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow guidance. We expect revenue on a constant currency basis to be in the range of 1% decline to 2% growth. We also expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.80 to $2 on both an adjusted and GAAP basis. We also expect free cash flow to be in the range of $425 million to $525 million. 
It's important to note that the recent market exits will have an adverse impact on revenue comparisons each quarter this year. In aggregate, the markets we exited generated approximately $26 million in revenue in 2015 and had an immaterial earnings contribution. 
While we have moved into indirect operations in most of those markets, we do not expect the same level of revenue in 2016, particularly in equipment sales and support services, which will negatively impact our year-over-year comparisons. We're providing further detail on the timing of advertising and ERP expenses among the quarters. For the year, we now expect incremental marketing expense in the second quarter to have a similar impact on earnings as the first quarter. The change and timing of the expenses related in part to an extension of the company's advertising campaign and support for the launch of the new Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud solutions. Total annual expense is expected to remain the same. Incremental ERP expense is expected to be the highest in the second quarter as the company supports the post-launch implementation phase that fits ERP platform in the U.S. The aggregate of these incremental advertising and ERP expenses in the second quarter are expected to be at a similar level to the impact on earnings in the first quarter or approximately $0.04 per share higher than the prior year. As a reminder, we still expect to recognize the early benefits from the ERP implementation some time in the third quarter and then ramp up more in the fourth quarter. 
Before I open the line for questions, I'd like to take a moment to note the recent launch of our Commerce Cloud, which is enabled by our new ERP platform. The Commerce Cloud is a commerce enabler, providing access to solutions, analytics and APIs across the full commerce continuum. The Commerce Cloud will enable us to easily and quickly provide our solutions and capabilities to all our clients. As many of these SaaS-based solutions will be subscription or usage-based, the financial impact will build over time, especially as we continue to add new applications. The Commerce Cloud and ERP platform are providing new value to our existing clients and the opportunity to acquire new clients. 
Operator, that concludes my remarks. Please open the line for questions."

I think it's an excellent question, one we've obviously thought a lot about. So let me start with the market. I mean, if you look at the market in the first quarter, business investment in the United States were down 6%. If you look at several of the large technology companies, they had, I would say, similar results. So it's not a great market, and as you know, our long-term aspirations for this business are exactly that long term, so they transcend any 1 quarter. Let me kind of -- that being said, I still think we can do better than the market here. And let me kind of give you a little bit of texture on other kinds of execution issues that we talked about. So there's different buckets. The first, and Mike mentioned it, one of the places where we've been working and this, by the way, is the last 3 or 4 months, this is for the last several years, is to build an indirect channel with system integrators. We're making progress on that albeit at much slower than I would like. And by systems integrators, it's the large technology systems integrators that you'd be familiar with. Another change that we're making, our services attach rate to our license revenue has been less than we thought. So we changed the compensation model to pay our sales force for services attach rate. I'll give you a third example. We had too much of our resource stacked up on our install base, so in the first quarter -- and by the way, again, this was something that was contemplated before the previous regime, so I don't want to paint this as something the new guys have thought of. This is something that started well before. But we have too much of our resource base, too much of our resource stacked in our install base. So there are 3 kinds of examples. Now let me kind of get to the underneath part of your question, why my continued confidence? First of all, if you look at the nature of the problems, these are problems that, well, frustrating, and there's no one more frustrated with our performance than me, but fixable. Secondly, what I take great -- it gives me the ultimate confidence is, we've got good products, and you can see it in the affirmation that we've got from third parties. We've got important affirmation in the first quarter. You can see it in the quality and the sophistication of the clients that buy our software. We just do a better job of executing. So that kind of gives you a texture of how I think about the problem, why I'm confident, and we will improve going forward."

I don't personally consider any of those changes that have been made over the last several years. That's material. In terms of things that take longer, it does take longer to build an indirect sales channel. These arrangements with systems integrators take a while to alnd. Candidly, they've taken longer than I would hope. I know personally interjected myself in those conversations, reaching out to my peers of these firms to feel we can accelerate it. And finally, moving resources to whitespace is something that I'm highly confident will pay off over the long term takes a while. So you've got new folks calling our new clients. They've got to establish those relationships. They've got to re-introduce Pitney Bowes to these clients, and it underlines why the advertising campaign is so important. The advertising campaign is important for multiple different reasons. But as you're trying to break into new markets, whether that be systems integrators or other aspects of indirect channel or new customers, having a degree of area cover so that we spend a little bit less time explaining who we are and the technology that we have and more time focusing on the client issues is a good thing."

Of particular interest is the Canadian dollar and Australian currency, and both of those strengthened vis-à-vis the dollar. So we think that turns from what has been a headwind to the last several quarters to something potentially can help us more in the back half of the year. We would see how it unfolds. I mean, a lot of people have gussed on currencies over the last couple of years, and a lot of people have lost. So while a couple of months doesn't make a trend, we like this currency environment to stay this way and continue to move. But it's going to be predicated on what happened with interest rates in the United States and around the world, and that's hard to call."

So we would expect interest expense to continue to have some favorability on a year-over-year basis. With respect to taxes, we had a higher-than-projected full year tax rate in the first quarter, in large part because of the concentration of our earnings in the U.S., which has a higher average tax rate. So to the extent that we start to see a little better mix of earnings outside the U.S. and software being 50% outside the U.S. is part of that factor as well.

That market is between minus 2 to minus 4. We're minus 3-ish in the first quarter. Clearly, with equipment sales 6%, that means streams will catch up with that and you realized that benefit last quarter, so we plan that takes a year or so to begin to run through the balance sheet, but the trends are clear. I would take the opportunity to kind of talk about the balance of the year in equipment sales. While we think there's more we can do here. That said, our second quarter may be with the deployment of impact and ERP, we've got some work to do in the second quarter as it relates to equipment sales. So there might be some timing issues, second quarter, the third quarter. I think the trend over the last few quarters is clear, and that the new go-to-market as we move from face-to-face sales to inside sales is not only stabilizing, but it's beginning to work. That being said, there is another turn of the crank and you intimated to it, as we move to the web. So one of the important things about the new technology platform that we have rolled out, one of the important things about the Commerce Cloud announcement is digital enabling our relationships with our clients. So that not only allows you more efficiency, but it will provide you a better way to make realtime offers to those clients. So it's one thing to make calls to 1.5 million clients. It's another thing to send out an email blast to 1.5 million clients, targeted based on their particular usage. So I think there's another turn of the crank here that will take us a while to get to. And then you throw on top of that the ability to drive new content into those relationships, and then I think you've got a whole new ballgame. And that's why we're so excited about what we talked about last week. It is admittedly to the previous question, it's going to be a slow burn. But to have this 1.5 million client relationships and now have the ability to digitally interact with them and drive new content and you value those relationships, that but the is a game-changer for us.

So where we indicated last quarter that we expected the first and fourth quarters to be the highest from marketing expense spend, we shifted that. We're continuing some of our advertising spend into the second quarter. We're supporting our Commerce Cloud launch. So we increased that marketing spend anticipation. So as I said, the marketing expense second quarter versus second quarter last year, we expect to be $0.03 higher. ERP, now that we're out live with the U.S. in April, we're now in what we call hyper-care period where we really are going through and invest in all the training and those types of things, we said that's $0.01 or so higher than the prior year. I think those are 2 things that are specific guidance adjustments that we've made in terms of timing of expenses, now knowing that we've got this is them out and knowing what we want to do in terms of support of Commerce Cloud in advertising. Beyond that, I think the biggest variable from the first quarter is what was the question was about, which is performance from a Software business. And as Marc said, we expect to continue to see some improvement in there, but it's not quite where we wanted to be yet. So I would say those are the major variables on an ERP basis."

Some of those will accrue, particularly the Software and e-commerce related ones will accrue to the DCS businesses, e-commerce and Software businesses, Location Intelligence and the Software business. Where you'll see some accruing to the SMB business will be particularly Sempro, which is the multi-carrier shipping solution. There are add-on products around Sempro, so we have something called a Semkit that provides scale and other solutions for printer label printer for using the Sempro application. And then leave included the Sempro application in our high-end meters series as well, so it's accessible through that. So that in case, it accrues basically subscription added to that equipment sale. So those are the main ways that it will affect the SMB business. To Marc's earlier comment, in most all these cases, it will generate levels of recurring revenue that will help further mitigate the declines we've seen in some of our recurring revenue streams."

Again, great question. So the way I think about the portfolio broadly is the portfolio needs to be congruent with 3 basic principles, they have leaders in their businesses, they got to strategically coherent and they have to cover their return on invested capital. The problem with answering your question is those dynamics move, so as value continues to move in different segments, then that equation changes. So we will continue to evaluate the portfolio in context of what we think the best decision for our shareholders and best way to create value. So in the end, I like all businesses and [indiscernible] and we will continue to evaluate businesses, growing the portfolio vis-à-vis those 3 strategic criteria. As it relates to potential acquisitions, our focus continues to be within our Digital Commerce space broadly. And e-commerce, I would say, is kind of the first amongst equals, but that's where we think we can get the best return from our shareholders. But again, we put pretty strict criteria in terms of the types of financial metrics that acquisition would have to conform to, and we're not backing off those. And what I would say is acquisitions appear to us right now to be pretty expensive, so that's not to say we won't do some. But when we look around the neighborhood, it seems it's hard for us to close the Math. So we continue to look and we continue to think as an important option to have available to us. But at these prices, it's hard to close the map. In terms of uses of cash, one, again, the question that we think a lot about, I would just double-click on your point. I mean, we did $5 million or $6 million -- or 6 million shares in the first quarter. And if you look at from 2015 to 2016, those 2 years, I think we're closer to $260 [ph] million of share repurchases. If you put that in context of what we said at Analyst Day, we talked about $1 billion of available free cash balance between acquisitions and return of cash to shareholders with a bias towards return of cash to shareholders. So I think we're fulfilling that promise as we saw at that time. In terms of conversations with the shareholders, you wouldn't expect our conversations with the board, you wouldn't expect that we would reveal that beyond it's an ongoing discussion we talk about every almost board meeting in terms of trying to balance our uses of cash in the way that generates the best return for our shareholders."

Now think of that moving the resource from install base to prospects. So that's what takes a while longer to begin to realize the benefits. The other thing I'd say about Software is, in the context of the size of this business, 5 or 10 transactions can make a big difference one way or the other in a quarter. So it's one thing when you have a volume-based business that gets behind and trying to catch up throughout the course of the year.

So Charlie, I will miss you, and thank you for all you've done. So let me now close. It's easy to get lost and amazed with numbers, but the bottom line is, we continue to make good progress in transforming our business. Our advertising campaign to re-introduce PBI of the road from that point of our totally reengineered processes and technology for 80% of our business, setting the stage for substantial benefits realization. The assumption of equipment sales, our cash generation machine and in North America and finally, the introduction of PB Commerce Cloud open up a whole net new set of opportunities to our 1.5 million clients. Bottom line, we're creating the foundation of our company to be successful well into the future. I've never been more confident about our ability to deliver long-term strategic value to our shareholders. As I've said countless times before, transformation is not a straight line. We know we have some things that we needed to complete up. But I think as we talk about, if you look at the body of work that we are undertaking, the problems have become very isolated into a single dimension. That's not to say that we won't have future problems in different, places but as we contemplate our transformation, we're now down to a fairly narrow set of problems that I think are manageable.

Last week, we made one of the most consequential announcements in Pitney Bowes' history. We introduced the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud along wit",1015,"Thanks, Adam, and thanks, everyone, for joining this morning for our First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. 
Last week, we made one of the most consequential announcements in Pitney Bowes' history. We introduced the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud along with several SaaS-based products and solutions. This aligns our physical and digital capabilities, along with our mobile, location and e-commerce technologies, with all of the end-to-end requirements that drive commerce. 
To my mind, this was more than a product announcement. This is the foundation for all of our future products and solutions, adding digital capabilities and web-based solutions that span all of our business units. It is also a demonstration of how we are redefining and transforming Pitney Bowes by expanding our reach as we cement existing client relationships and cultivate new ones. And it broadens our addressable market for our 1.5 million clients by an order of magnitude. 
This is a substantial opportunity for our company and is consistent with the strategy we've been pursuing for the past 3 years. While our competitors may have parts of a commerce solution, we are the only company that provides such a broad range of commerce solutions that deliver the functionality, speed and agility our clients need, from small businesses to large global companies. 
In addition to the launch of the Commerce Cloud, we achieved a number of milestones during the first quarter that will further advance our transformation. 
In January, we launched our first major television advertising campaign in 20 years. We've completed our move to a dealer market in Mexico, South Africa and 5 markets in Asia. 
And finally, we deployed our newly designed business processes and accompanying technology in April. While we sometimes refer to this as the new ERP project, it is much bigger. It's a complete redesign of our business processes. As we've said, this product is key for us to realize the benefits of the investments we have made in delivering new products, such as those enabled by our Commerce Cloud. Those benefits are clearly in our sights, and we are evaluating the feasibility of accelerating our business case. 
Turning to the results for our first quarter. Our financial performance was largely consistent and in line with our expectations, save our Software Solutions businesses. We turned in another strong performance in Presort and Global Ecommerce businesses, while SMB revenue trends continued to stabilize and improve. SMB new equipment sales, a leading indicator of our future reoccurring revenue streams, were positive, highlighted by the largest growth in North America equipment sales in several years. 
However, our Software Solutions business performance was disappointing. Simply put, we did not execute, and while the business issues we see are not complicated, we need to fix them. I am confident that the new leadership team will. We have the right products, and our Software solutions strategy is resonating with the clients. During the quarter, we had a new President, a new leader to drive our channel strategy and a new Head of Marketing. In December, we appointed a new worldwide sales leader to drive sales efficiency and productivity globally. We expect that this business can and should be better. While the market conditions in the technology industry are currently not great, I am confident that we will see a slow and steady improvement in our Software Solutions business throughout the year. 
Now as I have every quarter, let me update you on our 3 strategic initiatives for creating long-term value: Reinventing Mailing, operational excellence and growth by providing access to our digital commerce capabilities across our business. 
First, reinventing Mailing. The positive year-over-year growth in North America mailing equipment sales and continued moderation of declines in International Mailing revenue reflect the benefits of moves we made to stabilize the business, including go-to-market changes and realigning our geographic footprint. We're not done, and we'll continue to focus on enhancing sales productivity globally. 
Last week's launch of SendPro as an application of Commerce Cloud is a great demonstration of how we are reinventing Mailing to deliver new value to our SMB clients. We are integrating physical and digital technologies into more relevant solutions and enhancing their experience with us through digital interfaces. 
Next, operational excellence. The new business processes and accompanying technology we are deploying is foundational to be globally integrated and a more efficient company. In 2 years, the benefits have moved from possible to probable and now to reality, and we did it on time. Our successful launch in April on the U.S. and ongoing stabilization in Canada are already starting to provide benefits for our clients in terms of improved business processes, enhanced productivity improvements and easier access to a web store. Their early returns are good, and the issues are what we would've expected and are manageable. 
As part of this initiative, we also deployed a client portal that provides better visibility into transaction data and client activity to help them better manage and anticipate their enterprise-wide needs and help us provide relevant recommendations for next actions. 
And finally, grow our Digital Commerce Solutions by leveraging our existing client base. In the first quarter, Digital Commerce Solutions grew 11% despite being negatively impacted by our Software Solutions business. E-commerce continued to grow with the inclusion of retail revenue from Borderfree and marketplace growth in the U.K. Today, the Pitney Bowes Borderfree retail platform has 222 storefronts, and we are adding more every month. We also saw an increase in the outbound package volumes. We are well positioned to capitalize on the large opportunities that this market represents. I continue to believe this is one of the most exciting opportunities I have ever seen in the technology industry. 
We are disappointed with our Software performance and Software Solutions business, but the issues are addressable and the other aspects of our long-term plan are coming together nicely. We see a clear path forward and will not be deterred. I am confident in our ability to deliver our long-term strategic plans and continue to unlock value for our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike."

As Marc discussed, the start to 2016 has been about achieving a number of milestones in the company's transformation, important milestones in that they are solidifying the key financial drivers of our results over the ne",2684,"Thank you, Marc, and good morning. As Marc discussed, the start to 2016 has been about achieving a number of milestones in the company's transformation, important milestones in that they are solidifying the key financial drivers of our results over the next 2 to 3 years. We have now delivered a new operating platform and an initial set of cutting-edge solutions designed to sit on that platform. 
And additionally, we completed a first quarter that validated our actions to stabilize and reinvent our Mailing business but also highlighted areas like Software, where we have further work to do. Over the past 2-plus years, we have implemented both a go-to-market channel transformation and a recasting of our direct distribution geographic footprint in our SMB business. 
Our first quarter results represent an important milestone. On a constant currency basis and when the adjusted the recent market exits, global SMB grew equipment sales 3%, led by growth in North America Mailing, which had its best quarter of equipment sales growth in several years. 
In April, we took another critical step forward in delivering operational excellence that will not only reduce cost, but dramatically enhances our ability to deliver and manage new products and services. Following on our pilot in Canada in late 2015, we delivered our ERP platform in the U.S., along with a new web store and client portal that support our new Commerce Cloud solutions. While we remain in ramp-up phase, we have now enabled nearly 80% of our revenue base on the new platform. This new platform and the solutions it supports further fulfills the goal of bringing enterprise capabilities to our entire client base. 
Before turning to the specifics of the quarter, I also wanted to highlight that our investments in the company's future have been balanced with our commitment to managing total return to shareholders. In addition to providing a competitive dividend, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of our common stock during the first quarter. 
I will take you through our first quarter results in a moment, but it's important to reiterate Marc's sentiment that we have our eye on the prize. The business model innovation we are achieving as a company, be it through our brands, infrastructure, technology or the solutions we offer to our clients, all are keeping us on track for attaining our long-term objectives. 
Turning to the quarter. We again experienced positive trends in a number of key indicators. SMB equipment sales growth accelerated, which coupled with our recent market exits and previous EBIT margin improvements, reflect the successful transition in our go-to-market model in our SMB Solutions group. Our Presort Services continues to turn in a strong performance, once again growing revenue and maintaining a strong EBIT margin. Global Ecommerce also continues to perform well, with improving trends in both retail and marketplace volumes, with particular strength from our U.K. marketplace. We also continued to add new brands to our retail platform. 
Production Mail and Software results were below our expectations and were impacted in part by a weaker macroeconomic environment. Our Production Mail results, which can be lumpy at times, were a function of a weak pipeline coming into 2016, a shift to third-party mailers and recent small market exits. As a result of focused pipeline build, we expect this business to strengthen, beginning in the second quarter. 
As Marc discussed, we have more work to do on our Software business, as the new management team focuses on improving sales efficiency and expanding our indirect channels to broaden our pipeline of opportunities while also focusing on our new offerings. 
When we provided guidance for 2016, we identified 3 factors that would affect our year-over-year comparison in the first quarter. First, the sale of our Imagitas business last May. Imagitas contributed about $0.02 to earnings per share last year, which was not repeated this year. Second, incremental expenses related to our advertising campaign and ERP implementation. In aggregate, these lowered earnings per share by $0.04 per share in the quarter compared to the prior year. 
And third, we announced the exit of direct operations in Mexico, South Africa and 5 markets in Asia, and the conversion of those markets to a dealer network. In aggregate, these markets generated approximately $6 million in revenue in last year's first quarter, which was not repeated this year and thus had an adverse impact on our revenue comparisons, particularly in the International Mail and Production Mail segments. I will detail this further when I review our segment results. 
Let me now take you through the high-level financial results, and then I'll drill down in each of the segments' results and provide some additional color around our guidance. Please note that a reconciliation of adjusted to GAAP financial information can be found in the financial schedules in our earnings press release and earnings slides posted to our pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
Revenue for the first quarter totaled $845 million, which was a decline of 3% on a constant currency basis adjusted for recent market exits, a decline of 4% on a constant currency basis and 5% on a reported basis. Revenue in our SMB segment group declined 3% on a constant currency basis adjusted for recent market exits, declined 4% on a constant currency basis and 5% on a reported basis. Revenue in our Enterprise Business Solutions group declined 1% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits, declined 2% on a constant currency basis and 3% on a reported basis. Digital Commerce Solutions revenue grew 11% on a constant currency basis and 9% on a reported basis. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.34 for the first quarter. As noted, when compared to the prior year, our adjusted earnings per share results were $0.02 lower due to income in the prior year before the sale of Imagitas, as well as $0.03 of incremental advertising expense and $0.01 of incremental ERP systems expense. 
GAAP earnings per share were $0.30, which includes $0.02 in restructuring charges and $0.01 in disposition cost related to the recent market exits. 
Free cash flow was $60 million, and we generated $58 million on a GAAP basis in cash from operations. Compared to prior year, free cash flow declined in part due to the early payments to critical vendors resulting from the go-live blackout period of the new ERP program in the U.S. Free cash flow this quarter was also impacted by the lower net income, which was partly due to the incremental expenses related to the advertising campaign and ERP. The slower decline in finance receivables resulting from favorable equipment sales also impacted the comparison to prior year. 
During the quarter, we returned cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We spent $128 million on the repurchase of our common stock, buying 6.8 million shares in the quarter. We also paid $36 million in dividends to our common shareholders. Additionally, we made $22 million in restructuring payments and made a $37 million contribution to our U.K. pension fund. 
From a debt management perspective, we obtained $300 million of bank term loans and refinanced a $371 million note that matured in January. We disclosed this information in our prior earnings call. 
Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, was $144 million this quarter, which was $34 million lower than the prior year as a result of the incremental advertising and ERP expenses, the sale of Imagitas, acquisition cost related to Borderfree and the decline in revenue. Adjusted EBIT margin was 17%. Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $188 million.
SG&A for the quarter was $327 million, which was $12 million or 4% higher than the prior year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 38.7%, which was 340 basis points higher than the prior year. The increase in SG&A was the result of incremental costs associated with the new advertising campaign and ERP implementation, as well as the net increase in SG&A resulting from the acquisition of Borderfree. SG&A, excluding these factors, declined year-over-year. 
During the quarter, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $7 million for actions taken in the first quarter to align our operations. Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $34 million, which was a decline of about $9 million when compared to the prior year. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were $178 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 4.66%, which was 74 basis points lower than the prior year. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter was 36.7%, which was 60 basis points lower than the prior year's tax rate but the above our expected tax rate for the full year, which we expect to still be between 32% and 35%. 
Now I'd like to discuss the first quarter results for each of our business segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we post to the pb.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
For SMB Solutions. In North American Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $350 million, and EBIT was $156 million. Revenue declined 3% both on a constant currency and a reported basis. The rate of decline in revenue was in line with the prior quarter's results, which reflects a portfolio that is a stabilizing and the maturing of our go-to-market changes, as well as our targeted marketing initiatives. 
On a constant currency basis, equipment sales grew a strong 6% over prior year, which was the highest rate of growth in several years. Recurring revenue streams continued to decline but are expected to benefit in future periods as the trend in equipment sales revenue improves. EBIT margin continued to perform strongly at 44.6%, reflecting ongoing focus on productivity improvements. 
In International Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $104 million, and EBIT was $12 million. Revenue declined 7% on a constant currency basis and 11% on a reported basis. Adjusting constant currency revenue for the recent market exits, revenue declined 5%, which is an improvement from prior quarters. Revenue benefited from equipment sales growth in France, Germany and Japan, as the go-to-market strategy matures and productivity benefits are being recognized. The decline in the recurring revenue stream was consistent with prior quarters, and the trend is expected to improve in future periods, as the trend in equipment sales revenue improves. EBIT margin was 11.4%, which was 130 basis points higher than prior year, as a result of lower cost associated with the change in go-to market. 
Turning to Enterprise Business Solutions. In Production Mail, revenue for the quarter was $87 million, and EBIT was $7 million. Revenue declined 11% on a constant currency basis and 12% on a reported basis. Adjusting constant currency revenue for the recent market exits, revenue declined 8%. Equipment sales declined from prior year, partly due to fewer inserting equipment installations and the timing of closing some large deals. Support services and supplies revenue declined in part as a result of some in-house mailers shifting their mail processing to third-party outsourcers and the recent market exits. EBIT margin was 7.8%, which was a decline of 130 basis points versus the prior year due to the lower revenue, especially the higher-margin inserting equipment sales. 
In Presort Services, revenue for the quarter was $127 million, and EBIT was $29 million. Revenue and EBIT both grew 5% on a constant currency basis and reported basis. Revenue benefited from the higher volume of first-class mail processed, as well as expansion into the St. Louis market. EBIT margin continued to perform strongly at 22.7%. 
Turning to Digital Commerce Solutions. In Software, revenue for the quarter was $78 million, and EBIT was a loss of $3 million. Revenue declined 7% on a constant currency basis and 10% on a reported basis. Revenue declined due to fewer large licensing deals and lower data-related licenses versus the prior year. The company is expanding its channel reach and focus on several high-potential industries and solutions, which have longer sales cycles. As I mentioned earlier, the new management team is focused on improving sales efficiency and expanding our indirect channel to build the opportunity pipeline. EBIT margin was a negative 3%, largely as a result of the lower licensing revenue, which has a high margin, and increased selling and marketing investments. 
In Global Ecommerce, revenue for the quarter was $98 million, and EBIT was about $1 million. Revenue grew 31% on a constant currency basis and 30% on a reported basis. Results included another full quarter of revenue from Borderfree. In the quarter, we grew the number of retail storefront clients and had strong growth in the U.K. marketplace. And although the stronger U.S. dollar continued to have an impact on outbound demand, the recent trading range against key buying currencies resulted in improving volume trends through the course of the quarter in our U.S. marketplace. EBIT margin was about 1% due to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and investments in the business, which more than offset early synergy savings. The business remains on track to achieve its synergy run rate objective by the end of the year. 
That concludes my remarks on the segments. Let me now take a moment to discuss our 2016 guidance.
The company is reaffirming its annual revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow guidance. We expect revenue on a constant currency basis to be in the range of a 1% decline to 2% growth. We also expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.80 to $2 on both an adjusted and GAAP basis. And we also expect free cash flow to be in the range of $425 million to $525 million. 
It's important to note that the recent market exits will have an adverse impact on revenue comparisons each quarter this year. In aggregate, the markets we exited generated approximately $26 million in revenue in 2015 and had an immaterial earnings contribution. While we have moved into indirect operations in most of those markets, we do not expect the same level of revenue in 2016, particularly in equipment sales and support services, which will negatively impact our year-over-year comparisons. 
We're providing further detail on the timing of advertising and ERP expenses among the quarters. For the year, we now expect incremental marketing expense in the second quarter to have a similar impact on earnings as the first quarter. The change and timing of the expenses related in part to an extension of the company's advertising campaign and support for the launch of the new Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud solutions. Total annual expense is expected to remain the same. Incremental ERP expense is expected to be the highest in the second quarter, as the company supports the post-launch implementation phase of its ERP platform in the U.S. The aggregate of these incremental advertising and ERP expenses in the second quarter are expected to be at a similar level to the impact on earnings in the first quarter or approximately $0.04 per share higher than the prior year. As a reminder, we still expect to recognize the early benefits from the ERP implementation some time in the third quarter and then ramp up more in the fourth quarter. 
Before I open the line for questions, I'd like to take a moment to note the recent launch of our Commerce Cloud, which is enabled by our new ERP platform. The Commerce Cloud is a commerce enabler, providing access to solutions, analytics and APIs across the full commerce continuum. The Commerce Cloud will enable us to easily and quickly provide our solutions and capabilities to all our clients. As many of these SaaS-based solutions will be subscription or usage-based, the financial impact will build over time, especially as we continue to add new applications. The Commerce Cloud and ERP platform are providing new value to our existing clients and the opportunity to acquire new clients. 
Operator, that concludes my remarks. Please open the line for questions."

And I think it's an excellent question, one we've obviously thought a lot about. So let me just start with the market. If you look at the market in the first quarter, business investment in the United States was down 6%. If you look at several of the large technology companies, they had, I would say, similar results, some way or -- so It's not a great market. And as you know, our long-term aspirations for this business are exactly that, long term, so they transcend any one quarter. Let me kind of -- that being said, I still think we can do better than the market here. And let me kind of give you a little bit of texture on the kinds of execution issues that we talked about. So there's different buckets. The first, and Mike mentioned it, one of the places where we've been working -- and this, by the way, isn't the last 3 or 4 months, this is for the last several years, is to build an indirect channel with systems integrators. We're making progress on that, albeit at much slower than I would like. And by systems integrators, it's the large technology systems integrators that you would be familiar with. Another change that we're making, our services attach rate to our license revenue has been less than we thought. So we changed the compensation model to pay our sales force for services attach rate. I'll give you a third example. We had too much of our resource stacked up on our install base, so in the first quarter -- and by the way, again, this was something that was contemplated before the previous regime, so I don't want to paint this as something that the new guys have thought of. This is something that started well before. But we had too much of our resource base, too much of our resource stacked in our install base. So those are 3 kinds of examples. Now let me kind of get to the underneath part of your question, why my continued confidence? First of all, if you look at the nature of the problems, these are problems that, well, frustrating, and there's no one more frustrated with our Software performance than me, they're fixable. Secondly, what I -- take rate -- umbridge [ph], and it gives me the ultimate confidence, is we've got good products. And you can see it in the affirmation that we've gotten from third parties. We've got important affirmation in the first quarter. You can see it in the quality and the sophistication of the clients that are buying our software. We just need to do a better job executing. So that kind of gives you a texture of how I think about the problem, why I'm confident, and we will improve going forward."

I don't personally consider any of those changes that have been made the last several years. That's material. In terms of things that take longer, it does take longer to build an indirect sales channel. These arrangements with systems integrators take a while to land. Candidly, they have taken longer than I would hope. I've now personally interjected myself in those conversations, reaching out to my peers of these firms to see if we can accelerate it. And finally, moving resources to whitespace, while something that I'm highly confident will pay off over the long term, takes a while. So you've got new folks calling on new clients. They've got to establish those relationships, they've got to re-introduce Pitney Bowes to these clients, and it underlines why the advertising campaign is so important. The advertising campaign is important for multiple different reasons. But as you're trying to break into new markets, whether that be systems integrators or other aspects of indirect channel or new customers, having a degree of air cover so that we spend a little bit less time explaining who we are and the technology that we have and more time focusing on the client issues is a good thing."

So we think that turns from what has been a headwind to the last several quarters to something that potentially can help us more in the back half of the year. We'll see how it unfolds. I mean, a lot of people have guessed on currencies over the last couple of years, and a lot of people have lost.

On interest, as we've -- as I mentioned, we're, year-over-year, about $178 million lower in average debt outstanding in the quarter, so that's a factor. We have a little bit more of a mix because we did some term loans of floating rate versus fixed rate, which has driven the overall interest rate down. So we would expect interest expense to continue to have some favorability on a year-over-year basis. With respect to taxes, we had a higher-than-projected full year tax rate in the first quarter, in large part because of the concentration of our earnings in the U.S., which has a higher average tax rate. So to the extent that we start to see a little better mix of earnings outside the U.S., and Software being 50% outside the U.S., is part of that factor as well. We're still projecting a annualized tax rate in the 32% to 35% range, albeit we might be trending a little bit towards the higher end than midpoint."

I don't think you're quite there yet in Europe. What you sort of announced this week ties into the web-based aspect. Is that the entirety of the web-based dynamic, the interfacing?

So I continue to think about our SMB and Mailing business in the same dimensions that I always have, that we can get that business stabilized. That market is between minus 2% to minus 4%, we're minus 3%-ish in the first quarter. Clearly, with equipment sales 6%, that means streams will catch up with that. And you're right, that's been for the last several quarters. So we just planned it, that takes a year or so to begin to run through the balance sheet. But the trends are clear. I would take the opportunity to kind of talk about the balance of the year in equipment sales. We think there's more we can do here. That said, our second quarter, maybe with the deployment of impact and ERP, we've got some work to do in the second quarter as it relates to equipment sales. So there might be some timing issues, second quarter to third quarter. But I think the trend over the last few quarters there is clear, and that the new go-to-market, as we move from face-to-face sales to inside sales, is not only stabilizing, but it's beginning to work. That being said, there is another turn of the crank, and you intimated to it, as we move to the web. So one of the important things about the new technology platform that we have rolled out, one of the important things about the Commerce Cloud announcement is digital enabling our relationships with our clients. So that not only allows you more efficiency, but it will provide you a better way to make real time offers to those clients. So it's one thing to make calls to 1.5 million clients. It's another thing to send out an email blast to 1.5 million clients, targeted, based on their particular usage. So I think there's another turn of the crank here that will take us a while to get to. And then you throw on top of that the ability to drive new content into those relationships, and then you're thinking about a whole new ball game. And then that's why we're so excited about what we talked about last week. It is admittedly to the previous question, it's going to be a slow burn. But to have these 1.5 million client relationships and now have the ability to digitally interact with them and drive new content, new value into those relationships, that, I believe, is a game-changer for us. So we're really excited about where we sit with that."

So I was just looking at The Street at $0.46 and looking at the fact that you did $0.34 this quarter and trying to think about where we should all, in your mind, sort of come out, given the puts and takes. So I mean, maybe if you can just kind of walk us through again because I'd rather not see another quarter like this, where we obviously were off relative to where your expectations were, given the underlying trends in your business.

So very specifically, I would say where we modified our guidance was in the timing of marketing expense. So where we indicated last quarter that we expected the first and fourth quarters to be the highest for marketing expense, spend, we shifted that. We're continuing some of our advertising spend into the second quarter. We're supporting our Commerce Cloud launch. So we've increased that marketing spend anticipation. So as I said, the marketing expense, second quarter versus second quarter last year, we expect to be $0.03 higher ERP, now that we're out live with the U.S. in April, we're now in what we call hyper-care period, where we really are going through and invest in all the training and those types of things. We said that's $0.01 or so higher than the prior year. I think those are 2 things that are specific guidance adjustments that we've made in terms of timing of expenses, now knowing that we've got the system out and knowing what we want to do in terms of support of Commerce Cloud in advertising. Beyond that, I think the biggest variable from the first quarter is what was the questions were about, which is the performance of the Software business. And as Marc said, we expect to continue to see some improvement in there, but it's not quite where we wanted to be yet. So I would say those are the major variables on an year-over-year basis."

So in terms of the Commerce Cloud, it is -- you saw, there were 5 different solutions that were announced initially, and there'll be additional as we go forward. Some of those will accrue, particularly the Software and e-commerce related ones, will accrue to the DCS businesses, e-commerce and Software businesses, Location Intelligence and the Software business. Where you'll see some accruing to the SMB business will be particularly around SendPro, which is the multi-carrier shipping solution. There are add-on products around SendPro, so we have something called a send kit that provides scale and other solutions for printer -- label printer for using the SendPro application. And then we've included the SendPro application in our high-end meter series as well, so it's accessible through that. So that in case, it accrues as, basically, a subscription added on to that equipment sale. So those are the main ways that it will affect the SMB business. To Marc's earlier comment, in most all these cases, they will generate levels of recurring revenue that will help further mitigate the declines we've seen in some of our recurring revenue streams."

Other benefits -- or other businesses are accruing the benefits of those.

And then also, are there any other areas where you think you might want to augment more? And of course, I'm getting back to my usual use of cash question here at the end of this.

Again, a great question. So the way I think about the portfolio broadly is the portfolio needs to be congruent with 3 basic principles: They got to be leaders in their businesses, they got to be strategically coherent and they have to cover their return on invested capital. The problem with answering your question is those dynamics move. So as value continues to move in different segments, then that equation changes. So we will continue to evaluate the portfolio in context of what we think is the best decision for our shareholders and the best way to create value. So in the end, I like all the businesses, I'm wed to none of them. And we will continue to evaluate businesses, growing the portfolio vis-à-vis those 3 strategic criteria. As it relates to potential acquisitions, our focus continues to be within our Digital Commerce space broadly. And e-commerce, I would say, is kind of the first amongst equals, but that's where we think we can get the best return for our shareholders. But again, we've put pretty strict criteria in terms of the types of financial metrics that acquisitions would have to conform to, and we're not backing off those. And what I would say is acquisitions appear to us right now to be pretty expensive. So that's not to say we won't do some, but when we look around the neighborhood, it seems it's hard for us to close the math. So we continue to look and we continue to think that's an important option to have available to us. But at these prices, hard to close the math. In terms of uses of cash, one, again, the question that we think a lot about, I would just double-click on your point. I mean, we did $5 million, $6 million -- or 6 million shares in the first quarter. And if you look at from 2015 to 2016, those 2 years, I think we're close to, like, $260 million of share repurchases. If you put that in context of what we said at Analyst Day, we talked about $1 billion of available free cash balance between acquisitions and return of cash to shareholders with a bias towards return of cash to shareholders. So I think we're fulfilling that promise, as we saw at that time. In terms of conversations with the shareholders, you wouldn't expect that -- or conversations with the board, you wouldn't expect that we would reveal that beyond that this is an ongoing conversation that we talk about every almost board meeting in terms of trying to balance our uses of cash in the way that generates the best return for our shareholders."

So out of deference to everyone's time, let me wrap up. 
Before I close, I'd like to acknowledge Charlie McBride. As you all know, we announced Adam David as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Consequently, this will be Charlie's last call with all of us. Charlie's been a long-standing and important contributor to Pitney Bowes. He's been here for 42 years. He's been in this particular role for 19, that's 76 quarters for those of you who think of life in that context as I do. 
And I can't tell you how important he's been to our transformation and to me personally. Charlie has been a tireless adviser. He has helped us in what has been a very difficult transition over the last couple of years, and I personally will miss him. And I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank Charlie for all that he's done for our company for the last -- over 4 decades, which is hard to even contemplate. So Charlie, we'll miss you, and thank you for all you've done. 
Let me now close. It's easy to get lost and amazed with numbers, but the bottom line is we continue to make good progress in transforming our business. Our advertising campaign to re-introduce PB to the world; the deployment of our totally reengineered processes and technology for 80% of our business setting the stage for substantial benefit realization; the assumption of equipment sales, our cash generation machine in North America; and finally, the introduction of PB Commerce Cloud opening up a whole new set of opportunities to our 1.5 million clients. 
Bottom line, we're creating the foundation for our company to be successful well into the future. I've never been more confident about our ability to deliver long-term strategic value to our shareholders. 
As I've said countless times before, transformations are not a straight line. We knew we have some things that we need to clean up. But I think as we talked about, if you look at the body of work that we are undertaking, the problems have become very isolated into a single dimension. That's not to say that we won't have future problems in different places, but as we contemplate our transformation, we're now down to a fairly narrow set of problems that I think are manageable. We've got a lot more to do, but we have created the foundation for this company to be successful well into the future. 
So we'll talk again in 90 days. Thank you for your attention this morning."

Last week, we made one of the most consequential announcements in Pitney Bowes' history.

Last week, we made one of the most consequential announcements in Pitney Bowes' history. We introduced the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud along with several SaaS-based products and solutions. This aligns our physical and digital capabilities, along with our mobile, location and e-commerce technologies, with all of the end-to-end requirements that drive commerce. 
To my mind, this was more than a product announcement. This is the foundation for all of our future products and solutions, adding digital capabilities and web-based solutions that span all of our business units. It is also a demonstration of how we are redefining and transforming Pitney Bowes by expanding our reach as we cement existing client relationships and cultivate new ones. And it broadens our addressable market for our 1.5 million clients by an order of magnitude. 
This is a substantial opportunity for our company and is consistent with the strategy we've been pursuing for the past 3 years. While our competitors may have parts of a commerce solution, we are the only company that provides such a broad range of commerce solutions that deliver the functionality, speed and agility our clients need, from small businesses to large global companies. 
In addition to the launch of the Commerce Cloud, we achieved a number of milestones during the first quarter that will further advance our transformation. 
In January, we launched our first major television advertising campaign in 20 years. We've completed our move to a dealer market in Mexico, South Africa and 5 markets in Asia. 
And finally, we deployed our newly designed business processes and accompanying technology in April. While we sometimes refer to this as the new ERP project, it is much bigger. It's a complete redesign of our business processes. As we've said, this product is key for us to realize the benefits of the investments we have made in delivering new products, such as those enabled by our Commerce Cloud. Those benefits are clearly in our sights, and we are evaluating the feasibility of accelerating our business case. 
Turning to the results for our first quarter. Our financial performance was largely consistent and in line with our expectations, save our Software Solutions businesses. We turned in another strong performance in Presort and Global Ecommerce businesses, while SMB revenue trends continued to stabilize and improve. SMB new equipment sales, a leading indicator of our future reoccurring revenue streams, were positive, highlighted by the largest growth in North America equipment sales in several years. 
However, our Software Solutions business performance was disappointing. Simply put, we did not execute, and while the business issues we see are not complicated, we need to fix them. I am confident that the new leadership team will. We have the right products, and our Software solutions strategy is resonating with the clients. During the quarter, we had a new President, a new leader to drive our channel strategy and a new Head of Marketing. In December, we appointed a new worldwide sales leader to drive sales efficiency and productivity globally. We expect that this business can and should be better. While the market conditions in the technology industry are currently not great, I am confident that we will see a slow and steady improvement in our Software Solutions business throughout the year. 
Now as I have every quarter, let me update you on our 3 strategic initiatives for creating long-term value: Reinventing Mailing, operational excellence and growth by providing access to our digital commerce capabilities across our business. 
First, reinventing Mailing. The positive year-over-year growth in North America mailing equipment sales and continued moderation of declines in International Mailing revenue reflect the benefits of moves we made to stabilize the business, including go-to-market changes and realigning our geographic footprint. We're not done, and we'll continue to focus on enhancing sales productivity globally. 
Last week's launch of SendPro as an application of Commerce Cloud is a great demonstration of how we are reinventing Mailing to deliver new value to our SMB clients. We are integrating physical and digital technologies into more relevant solutions and enhancing their experience with us through digital interfaces. 
Next, operational excellence. The new business processes and accompanying technology we are deploying is foundational to be globally integrated and a more efficient company. In 2 years, the benefits have moved from possible to probable and now to reality, and we did it on time. Our successful launch in April on the U.S. and ongoing stabilization in Canada are already starting to provide benefits for our clients in terms of improved business processes, enhanced productivity improvements and easier access to a web store. Their early returns are good, and the issues are what we would've expected and are manageable. 
As part of this initiative, we also deployed a client portal that provides better visibility into transaction data and client activity to help them better manage and anticipate their enterprise-wide needs and help us provide relevant recommendations for next actions. 
And finally, grow our Digital Commerce Solutions by leveraging our existing client base. In the first quarter, Digital Commerce Solutions grew 11% despite being negatively impacted by our Software Solutions business. E-commerce continued to grow with the inclusion of retail revenue from Borderfree and marketplace growth in the U.K. Today, the Pitney Bowes Borderfree retail platform has 222 storefronts, and we are adding more every month. We also saw an increase in the outbound package volumes. We are well positioned to capitalize on the large opportunities that this market represents. I continue to believe this is one of the most exciting opportunities I have ever seen in the technology industry. 
We are disappointed with our Software performance and Software Solutions business, but the issues are addressable and the other aspects of our long-term plan are coming together nicely. We see a clear path forward and will not be deterred. I am confident in our ability to deliver our long-term strategic plans and continue to unlock value for our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike."
297018,331413376,970898,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 03, 2016",2016-05-03,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Marc, and good morning.

As Marc discussed, the start to 2016 has been about achieving a number of milestones in the company's transformation, important milestones in that they are solidifying the key financial drivers of our results over the next 2 to 3 years. We have now delivered a new operating platform and an initial set of cutting-edge solutions designed to sit on that platform. 
And additionally, we completed a first quarter that validated our actions to stabilize and reinvent our Mailing business but also highlighted areas like Software, where we have further work to do. Over the past 2-plus years, we have implemented both a go-to-market channel transformation and a recasting of our direct distribution geographic footprint in our SMB business. 
Our first quarter results represent an important milestone. On a constant currency basis and when adjusted the recent market exits, global SMB grew equipment sales 3%, led by growth in North America Mailing, which had its best quarter of equipment sales growth in several years. 
In April, we took another critical step forward in delivering operational excellence that will not only reduce cost, but dramatically enhances our ability to deliver and manage new products and services. Following on our pilot in Canada in late 2015, we delivered our ERP platform in the U.S., along with a new web store and client portal that support our new Commerce Cloud solutions. While we remain in ramp-up phase, we have now enabled nearly 80% of our revenue base on the new platform. This new platform and the solutions it supports further fulfills the goal of bringing enterprise capabilities to our entire client base. 
Before turning to the specifics of the quarter, I also wanted to highlight that our investments in the company's future have been balanced with our commitment to managing total return to shareholders. In addition to providing a competitive dividend, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of our common stock during the first quarter. 
I will take you through our first quarter results in a moment, but it's important to reiterate Marc's sentiment that we have our eye on the prize. The business model innovation we are achieving as a company, be it through our brands, infrastructure, technology or the solutions we offer to our clients, all are keeping us on track for attaining our long-term objectives. 
Turning to the quarter. We again experienced positive trends in a number of key indicators. SMB equipment sales growth accelerated, which coupled with our recent market exits and previous EBIT margin improvements, reflect the successful transition in our go-to-market model in our SMB Solutions group. Our Presort Services continues to turn in a strong performance, once again growing revenue and maintaining a strong EBIT margin. Global Ecommerce also continues to perform well, with improving trends in both retail and marketplace volumes, with particular strength from our U.K. marketplace. We also continued to add new brands to our retail platform. 
Production Mail and Software results were below our expectations and were impacted in part by a weaker macroeconomic environment. Our Production Mail results, which can be lumpy at times, were a function of a weak pipeline coming into 2016, a shift to third-party mailers and recent small market exits. As a result of focused pipeline build, we expect this business to strengthen, beginning in the second quarter. 
As Marc discussed, we have more work to do on our Software business, as the new management team focuses on improving sales efficiency and expanding our indirect channels to broaden our pipeline of opportunities while also focusing on our new offerings. 
When we provided guidance for 2016, we identified 3 factors that would affect our year-over-year comparison in the first quarter. First, the sale of our Imagitas business last May. Imagitas contributed about $0.02 to earnings per share last year, which was not repeated this year. Second, incremental expenses related to our advertising campaign and ERP implementation. In aggregate, these lowered earnings per share by $0.04 per share in the quarter compared to the prior year. 
And third, we announced the exit of direct operations in Mexico, South Africa and 5 markets in Asia, and the conversion of those markets to a dealer network. In aggregate, these markets generated approximately $6 million in revenue in last year's first quarter, which was not repeated this year and thus had an adverse impact on our revenue comparisons, particularly in the International Mail and Production Mail segments. I will detail this further when I review our segment results. 
Let me now take you through the high-level financial results, and then I'll drill down in each of the segments' results and provide some additional color around our guidance. Please note that a reconciliation of adjusted to GAAP financial information can be found in the financial schedules in our earnings press release and earnings slides posted to our pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
Revenue for the first quarter totaled $845 million, which was a decline of 3% on a constant currency basis adjusted for recent market exits, a decline of 4% on a constant currency basis and 5% on a reported basis. Revenue in our SMB segment group declined 3% on a constant currency basis adjusted for recent market exits, declined 4% on a constant currency basis and 5% on a reported basis. Revenue in our Enterprise Business Solutions group declined 1% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits, declined 2% on a constant currency basis and 3% on a reported basis. Digital Commerce Solutions revenue grew 11% on a constant currency basis and 9% on a reported basis. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.34 for the first quarter. As noted, when compared to the prior year, our adjusted earnings per share results were $0.02 lower due to income in the prior year before the sale of Imagitas, as well as $0.03 of incremental advertising expense and $0.01 of incremental ERP systems expense. 
GAAP earnings per share were $0.30, which includes $0.02 in restructuring charges and $0.01 in disposition cost related to the recent market exits. 
Free cash flow was $60 million, and we generated $58 million on a GAAP basis in cash from operations. Compared to prior year, free cash flow declined in part due to the early payments to critical vendors resulting from the go-live blackout period of the new ERP program in the U.S. Free cash flow this quarter was also impacted by the lower net income, which was partly due to the incremental expenses related to the advertising campaign and ERP. The slower decline in finance receivables resulting from favorable equipment sales also impacted the comparison to prior year. 
During the quarter, we returned cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We spent $128 million on the repurchase of our common stock, buying 6.8 million shares in the quarter. We also paid $36 million in dividends to our common shareholders. Additionally, we made $22 million in restructuring payments and made a $37 million contribution to our U.K. pension fund. 
From a debt management perspective, we obtained $300 million of bank term loans and refinanced a $371 million note that matured in January. We disclosed this information in our prior earnings call. 
Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, was $144 million this quarter, which was $34 million lower than the prior year as a result of the incremental advertising and ERP expenses, the sale of Imagitas, acquisition cost related to Borderfree and the decline in revenue. Adjusted EBIT margin was 17%. Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $188 million.
SG&A for the quarter was $327 million, which was $12 million or 4% higher than the prior year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 38.7%, which was 340 basis points higher than the prior year. The increase in SG&A was the result of incremental costs associated with the new advertising campaign and ERP implementation, as well as the net increase in SG&A resulting from the acquisition of Borderfree. SG&A, excluding these factors, declined year-over-year. 
During the quarter, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $7 million for actions taken in the first quarter to align our operations. Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $34 million, which was a decline of about $9 million when compared to the prior year. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were $178 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 4.66%, which was 74 basis points lower than the prior year. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter was 36.7%, which was 60 basis points lower than the prior year's tax rate but the above our expected tax rate for the full year, which we expect to still be between 32% and 35%. 
Now I'd like to discuss the first quarter results for each of our business segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we post to the pb.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
For SMB Solutions. In North American Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $350 million, and EBIT was $156 million. Revenue declined 3% both on a constant currency and a reported basis. The rate of decline in revenue was in line with the prior quarter's results, which reflects a portfolio that is a stabilizing and the maturing of our go-to-market changes, as well as our targeted marketing initiatives. 
On a constant currency basis, equipment sales grew a strong 6% over prior year, which was the highest rate of growth in several years. Recurring revenue streams continued to decline but are expected to benefit in future periods as the trend in equipment sales revenue improves. EBIT margin continued to perform strongly at 44.6%, reflecting ongoing focus on productivity improvements. 
In International Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $104 million, and EBIT was $12 million. Revenue declined 7% on a constant currency basis and 11% on a reported basis. Adjusting constant currency revenue for the recent market exits, revenue declined 5%, which is an improvement from prior quarters. Revenue benefited from equipment sales growth in France, Germany and Japan, as the go-to-market strategy matures and productivity benefits are being recognized. The decline in the recurring revenue stream was consistent with prior quarters, and the trend is expected to improve in future periods, as the trend in equipment sales revenue improves. EBIT margin was 11.4%, which was 130 basis points higher than prior year, as a result of lower cost associated with the change in go-to market. 
Turning to Enterprise Business Solutions. In Production Mail, revenue for the quarter was $87 million, and EBIT was $7 million. Revenue declined 11% on a constant currency basis and 12% on a reported basis. Adjusting constant currency revenue for the recent market exits, revenue declined 8%. Equipment sales declined from prior year, partly due to fewer inserting equipment installations and the timing of closing some large deals. Support services and supplies revenue declined in part as a result of some in-house mailers shifting their mail processing to third-party outsourcers and the recent market exits. EBIT margin was 7.8%, which was a decline of 130 basis points versus the prior year due to the lower revenue, especially the higher-margin inserting equipment sales. 
In Presort Services, revenue for the quarter was $127 million, and EBIT was $29 million. Revenue and EBIT both grew 5% on a constant currency basis and reported basis. Revenue benefited from the higher volume of first-class mail processed, as well as expansion into the St. Louis market. EBIT margin continued to perform strongly at 22.7%. 
Turning to Digital Commerce Solutions. In Software, revenue for the quarter was $78 million, and EBIT was a loss of $3 million. Revenue declined 7% on a constant currency basis and 10% on a reported basis. Revenue declined due to fewer large licensing deals and lower data-related licenses versus the prior year. The company is expanding its channel reach and focus on several high-potential industries and solutions, which have longer sales cycles. As I mentioned earlier, the new management team is focused on improving sales efficiency and expanding our indirect channel to build the opportunity pipeline. EBIT margin was a negative 3%, largely as a result of the lower licensing revenue, which has a high margin, and increased selling and marketing investments. 
In Global Ecommerce, revenue for the quarter was $98 million, and EBIT was about $1 million. Revenue grew 31% on a constant currency basis and 30% on a reported basis. Results included another full quarter of revenue from Borderfree. In the quarter, we grew the number of retail storefront clients and had strong growth in the U.K. marketplace. And although the stronger U.S. dollar continued to have an impact on outbound demand, the recent trading range against key buying currencies resulted in improving volume trends through the course of the quarter in our U.S. marketplace. EBIT margin was about 1% due to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and investments in the business, which more than offset early synergy savings. The business remains on track to achieve its synergy run rate objective by the end of the year. 
That concludes my remarks on the segments. Let me now take a moment to discuss our 2016 guidance.
The company is reaffirming its annual revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow guidance. We expect revenue on a constant currency basis to be in the range of a 1% decline to 2% growth. We also expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.80 to $2 on both an adjusted and GAAP basis. And we also expect free cash flow to be in the range of $425 million to $525 million. 
It's important to note that the recent market exits will have an adverse impact on revenue comparisons each quarter this year. In aggregate, the markets we exited generated approximately $26 million in revenue in 2015 and had an immaterial earnings contribution. While we have moved to indirect operations in most of those markets, we do not expect the same level of revenue in 2016, particularly in equipment sales and support services, which will negatively impact our year-over-year comparisons. 
We're providing further detail on the timing of advertising and ERP expenses among the quarters. For the year, we now expect incremental marketing expense in the second quarter to have a similar impact on earnings as the first quarter. The change and timing of the expenses related in part to an extension of the company's advertising campaign and support for the launch of the new Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud solutions. Total annual expense is expected to remain the same. Incremental ERP expense is expected to be the highest in the second quarter, as the company supports the post-launch implementation phase of its ERP platform in the U.S. The aggregate of these incremental advertising and ERP expenses in the second quarter are expected to be at a similar level to the impact on earnings in the first quarter or approximately $0.04 per share higher than the prior year. As a reminder, we still expect to recognize the early benefits from the ERP implementation some time in the third quarter and then ramp up more in the fourth quarter. 
Before I open the line for questions, I'd like to take a moment to note the recent launch of our Commerce Cloud, which is enabled by our new ERP platform. The Commerce Cloud is a commerce enabler, providing access to solutions, analytics and APIs across the full commerce continuum. The Commerce Cloud will enable us to easily and quickly provide our solutions and capabilities to all our clients. As many of these SaaS-based solutions will be subscription or usage-based, the financial impact will build over time, especially as we continue to add new applications. The Commerce Cloud and ERP platform are providing new value to our existing clients and the opportunity to acquire new clients. 
Operator, that concludes my remarks. Please open the line for questions."

And I think it's an excellent question, one we've obviously thought a lot about. So let me just start with the market. If you look at the market in the first quarter, business investment in the United States was down 6%. If you look at several of the large technology companies, they had, I would say, similar results, some way or -- so It's not a great market. And as you know, our long-term aspirations for this business are exactly that, long term, so they transcend any one quarter. Let me kind of -- that being said, I still think we can do better than the market here. And let me kind of give you a little bit of texture on the kinds of execution issues that we talked about. So there's different buckets. The first, and Mike mentioned it, one of the places where we've been working -- and this, by the way, isn't the last 3 or 4 months, this is for the last several years, is to build an indirect channel with systems integrators. We're making progress on that, albeit at much slower than I would like. And by systems integrators, it's the large technology systems integrators that you would be familiar with. Another change that we're making, our services attach rate to our license revenue has been less than we thought. So we changed the compensation model to pay our sales force for services attach rate. I'll give you a third example. We had too much of our resource stacked up on our install base, so in the first quarter -- and by the way, again, this was something that was contemplated before the previous regime, so I don't want to paint this as something that the new guys have thought of. This is something that started well before. But we had too much of our resource base, too much of our resource stacked in our install base. So those are 3 kinds of examples. Now let me kind of get to the underneath part of your question, why my continued confidence? First of all, if you look at the nature of the problems, these are problems that, while, frustrating, and there's no one more frustrated with our Software performance than me, they're fixable. Secondly, what I -- take great umbridge in, and it gives me the ultimate confidence, is we've got good products. And you can see it in the affirmation that we've gotten from third parties. We've got important affirmation in the first quarter. You can see it in the quality and the sophistication of the clients that are buying our software. We just need to do a better job executing. So that kind of gives you a texture of how I think about the problem, why I'm confident, and we will improve going forward."

I don't personally consider any of those changes that have been made the last several years that material. In terms of things that take longer, it does take longer to build an indirect sales channel. These arrangements with systems integrators take a while to land. Candidly, they have taken longer than I would hope. I've now personally interjected myself in those conversations, reaching out to my peers of these firms to see if we can accelerate it. And finally, moving resources to whitespace, while something that I'm highly confident will pay off over the long term, takes a while. So you've got new folks calling on new clients. They've got to establish those relationships, they've got to re-introduce Pitney Bowes to these clients, and it underlines why the advertising campaign is so important. The advertising campaign is important for multiple different reasons. But as you're trying to break into new markets, whether that be systems integrators or other aspects of indirect channel or new customers, having a degree of air cover so that we spend a little bit less time explaining who we are and the technology that we have and more time focusing on the client issues is a good thing."

So we think that turns from what has been a headwind for the last several quarters to something that potentially can help us more in the back half of the year. We'll see how it unfolds. I mean, a lot of people have guessed on currencies over the last couple of years, and a lot of people have lost.

So there might be some timing issues, second quarter to third quarter. But I think the trend over the last few quarters there is clear, and that the new go-to-market, as we move from face-to-face sales to inside sales, is not only stabilizing, but it's beginning to work. That being said, there is another turn of the crank, and you intimated to it, as we move to the web. So one of the important things about the new technology platform that we have rolled out, one of the important things about the Commerce Cloud announcement is digital enabling our relationships with our clients. So that not only allows you more efficiency, but it will provide you a better way to make real time offers to those clients. So it's one thing to make calls to 1.5 million clients. It's another thing to send out an email blast to 1.5 million clients, targeted, based on their particular usage. So I think there's another turn of the crank here that will take us a while to get to. And then you throw on top of that the ability to drive new content into those relationships, and then you're thinking about a whole new ball game. And then that's why we're so excited about what we talked about last week. It is admittedly to the previous question, it's going to be a slow burn. But to have these 1.5 million client relationships and now have the ability to digitally interact with them and drive new content, new value into those relationships, that, I believe, is a game-changer for us. So we're really excited about where we sit with that."

Given the EPS miss relative to expectations this quarter, or at least relative to what Street was at, I'm trying to figure out how to think about second quarter. And I understand you have incremental expense related to ERP and the marketing, which is $0.04. Tax looks like it'll be, on a year-over-year basis, somewhat negative. And then you have some benefit from share repurchase. So I was just looking at The Street at $0.46 and looking at the fact that you did $0.34 this quarter and trying to think about where we should all, in your mind, sort of come out, given the puts and takes. So I mean, maybe if you can just kind of walk us through again because I'd rather not see another quarter like this, where we obviously were off relative to where your expectations were, given the underlying trends in your business. So anything you can give us to sort of walk through that would be really helpful."

So very specifically, I would say where we modified our guidance was in the timing of marketing expense. So where we indicated last quarter that we expected the first and fourth quarters to be the highest for marketing expense, spend, we shifted that. We're continuing some of our advertising spend into the second quarter. We're supporting our Commerce Cloud launch. So we've increased that marketing spend anticipation. So as I said, the marketing expense, second quarter versus second quarter last year, we expect to be $0.03 higher ERP, now that we're out live with the U.S. in April, we're now in what we call hyper-care period, where we really are going through and invest in all the training and those types of things. We said that's $0.01 or so higher than the prior year. I think those are 2 things that are specific guidance adjustments that we've made in terms of timing of expenses, now knowing that we've got the system out and knowing what we want to do in terms of support of Commerce Cloud in advertising. Beyond that, I think the biggest variable from the first quarter is what was the questions were about, which is the performance of the Software business. And as Marc said, we expect to continue to see some improvement in there, but it's not quite where we wanted to be yet. So I would say those are the major variables on an year-over-year basis."

So in terms of the Commerce Cloud, it is -- you saw, there were 5 different solutions that were announced initially, and there'll be additional as we go forward. Some of those will accrue, particularly the Software and e-commerce related ones, will accrue to the DCS businesses, e-commerce and Software businesses, Location Intelligence and the Software business. Where you'll see some accruing to the SMB business will be particularly around SendPro, which is the multi-carrier shipping solution. There are add-on products around SendPro, so we have something called a send kit that provides scale and other solutions for printer -- label printer for using the SendPro application. And then we've included the SendPro application in our high-end meter series as well, so it's accessible through that. So in that case, it accrues as, basically, a subscription added on to that equipment sale. So those are the main ways that it will affect the SMB business. To Marc's earlier comment, in most all these cases, they will generate levels of recurring revenue that will help further mitigate the declines we've seen in some of our recurring revenue streams."

Because it's one we're thinking about a lot as those business evolves, I mean, how it is that we portray ourselves in a way that we're easily understandable.

Other benefits -- or other businesses are accruing the benefits of those. So it's an important question in the micro, it's an important question how we present ourselves, but it's also, I think, an important question in terms of how it is that we amortize these capabilities over the breadth of the business."

And clearly, we understand going indirect in some of the countries that you're going indirect in this quarter. But as you look at sort of the assets you have right now, do you think we're kind of through that period? And so we won't have some of these, where you've got to pull revenue out even though it sort of business is still ongoing? And then also, are there any other areas where you think you might want to augment more? And of course, I'm getting back to my usual use of cash question here at the end of this. So just any discussion about that. And then also, you're kind of getting through the end of the share repurchase. Any more thoughts on what your board is thinking with regard to return of cash to shareholders?"

Again, a great question. So the way I think about the portfolio broadly is the portfolio needs to be congruent with 3 basic principles: They got to be leaders in their businesses, they got to be strategically coherent and they have to cover their return on invested capital. The problem with answering your question is those dynamics move. So as value continues to move in different segments, then that equation changes. So we will continue to evaluate the portfolio in context of what we think is the best decision for our shareholders and the best way to create value. So in the end, I like all the businesses, I'm wed to none of them. And we will continue to evaluate businesses, growing the portfolio vis-à-vis those 3 strategic criteria. As it relates to potential acquisitions, our focus continues to be within our Digital Commerce space broadly. And e-commerce, I would say, is kind of the first amongst equals, but that's where we think we can get the best return for our shareholders. But again, we've put pretty strict criteria in terms of the types of financial metrics that acquisitions would have to conform to, and we're not backing off those. And what I would say is acquisitions appear to us right now to be pretty expensive. So that's not to say we won't do some, but when we look around the neighborhood, it seems it's hard for us to close the math. So we continue to look and we continue to think that's an important option to have available to us. But at these prices, hard to close the math. In terms of uses of cash, one, again, the question that we think a lot about, I would just double-click on your point. I mean, we did $5 million, $6 million -- or 6 million shares in the first quarter. And if you look at from 2015 to 2016, those 2 years, I think we're close to, like, $260 million of share repurchases. If you put that in context of what we said at Analyst Day, we talked about $1 billion of available free cash balance between acquisitions and return of cash to shareholders with a bias towards return of cash to shareholders. So I think we're fulfilling that promise, as we saw at that time. In terms of conversations with the shareholders, you wouldn't expect that -- or conversations with the board, you wouldn't expect that we would reveal that beyond that this is an ongoing conversation that we talk about every almost board meeting in terms of trying to balance our uses of cash in the way that generates the best return for our shareholders."

So out of deference to everyone's time, let me wrap up. 
Before I close, I'd like to acknowledge Charlie McBride. As you all know, we announced Adam David as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Consequently, this will be Charlie's last call with all of us. Charlie's been a long-standing and important contributor to Pitney Bowes. He's been here for 42 years. He's been in this particular role for 19, that's 76 quarters for those of you who think of life in that context as I do. 
And I can't tell you how important he's been to our transformation and to me personally. Charlie has been a tireless adviser. He has helped us in what has been a very difficult transition over the last couple of years, and I personally will miss him. And I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank Charlie for all that he's done for our company for the last -- over 4 decades, which is hard to even contemplate. So Charlie, we'll miss you, and thank you for all you've done. 
Let me now close. It's easy to get lost and amazed with numbers, but the bottom line is we continue to make good progress in transforming our business. Our advertising campaign to re-introduce PB to the world; the deployment of our totally reengineered processes and technology for 80% of our business setting the stage for substantial benefit realization; the assumption of equipment sales, our cash generation machine in North America; and finally, the introduction of PB Commerce Cloud opening up a whole new set of opportunities to our 1.5 million clients. 
Bottom line, we're creating the foundation for our company to be successful well into the future. I've never been more confident about our ability to deliver long-term strategic value to our shareholders. 
As I've said countless times before, transformations are not a straight line. We knew we have some things that we need to clean up. But I think as we talked about, if you look at the body of work that we are undertaking, the problems have become very isolated into a single dimension. That's not to say that we won't have future problems in different places, but as we contemplate our transformation, we're now down to a fairly narrow set of problems that I think are manageable. We've got a lot more to do, but we have created the foundation for this company to be successful well into the future. 
So we'll talk again in 90 days. Thank you for your attention this morning."

Last week, we made one of the most consequential announcements in Pitney Bowes' history. We introduced the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud along with several SaaS-based products and solutions. This aligns our physical and digital capabilities, along with our mobile, location and e-commerce technologies, with all of the end-to-end requirements that drive commerce. 
To my mind, this was more than a product announcement. This is the foundation for all of our future products and solutions, adding digital capabilities and web-based solutions that span all of our business units. It is also a demonstration of how we are redefining and transforming Pitney Bowes by expanding our reach as we cement existing client relationships and cultivate new ones. And it broadens our addressable market for our 1.5 million clients by an order of magnitude. 
This is a substantial opportunity for our company and is consistent with the strategy we've been pursuing for the past 3 years. While our competitors may have parts of a commerce solution, we are the only company that provides such a broad range of commerce solutions that deliver the functionality, speed and agility our clients need, from small businesses to large global companies. 
In addition to the launch of the Commerce Cloud, we achieved a number of milestones during the first quarter that will further advance our transformation. 
In January, we launched our first major television advertising campaign in 20 years. We've completed our move to a dealer market in Mexico, South Africa and 5 markets in Asia. 
And finally, we deployed our newly designed business processes and accompanying technology in April. While we sometimes refer to this as the new ERP project, it is much bigger. It's a complete redesign of our business processes. As we've said, this product is key for us to realize the benefits of the investments we have made in delivering new products, such as those enabled by our Commerce Cloud. Those benefits are clearly in our sights, and we are evaluating the feasibility of accelerating our business case. 
Turning to the results for our first quarter. Our financial performance was largely consistent and in line with our expectations, save our Software Solutions businesses. We turned in another strong performance in Presort and Global Ecommerce businesses, while SMB revenue trends continued to stabilize and improve. SMB new equipment sales, a leading indicator of our future reoccurring revenue streams, were positive, highlighted by the largest growth in North America equipment sales in several years. 
However, our Software Solutions business performance was disappointing. Simply put, we did not execute, and while the business issues we see are not complicated, we need to fix them. I am confident that the new leadership team will. We have the right products, and our Software solutions strategy is resonating with the clients. During the quarter, we had a new President, a new leader to drive our channel strategy and a new Head of Marketing. In December, we appointed a new worldwide sales leader to drive sales efficiency and productivity globally. We expect that this business can and should be better. While the market conditions in the technology industry are currently not great, I am confident that we will see a slow and steady improvement in our Software Solutions business throughout the year. 
Now as I have every quarter, let me update you on our 3 strategic initiatives for creating long-term value: Reinventing Mailing, operational excellence and growth by providing access to our digital commerce capabilities across our business. 
First, reinventing Mailing. The positive year-over-year growth in North America mailing equipment sales and continued moderation of declines in International Mailing revenue reflect the benefits of moves we made to stabilize the business, including go-to-market changes and realigning our geographic footprint. We're not done, and we'll continue to focus on enhancing sales productivity globally. 
Last week's launch of SendPro as an application of Commerce Cloud is a great demonstration of how we are reinventing Mailing to deliver new value to our SMB clients. We are integrating physical and digital technologies into more relevant solutions and enhancing their experience with us through digital interfaces. 
Next, operational excellence. The new business processes and accompanying technology we are deploying is foundational to be globally integrated and a more efficient company. In 2 years, the benefits have moved from possible to probable and now to reality, and we did it on time. Our successful launch in April on the U.S. and ongoing stabilization in Canada are already starting to provide benefits for our clients in terms of improved business processes, enhanced productivity improvements and easier access to a web store. Their early returns are good, and the issues are what we would've expected and are manageable. 
As part of this initiative, we also deployed a client portal that provides better visibility into transaction data and client activity to help them better manage and anticipate their enterprise-wide needs and help us provide relevant recommendations for next actions. 
And finally, grow our Digital Commerce Solutions by leveraging our existing client base. In the first quarter, Digital Commerce Solutions grew 11% despite being negatively impacted by our Software Solutions business. E-commerce continued to grow with the inclusion of retail revenue from Borderfree and marketplace growth in the U.K. Today, the Pitney Bowes Borderfree retail platform has 222 storefronts, and we are adding more every month. We also saw an increase in the outbound package volumes. We are well positioned to capitalize on the large opportunities that this market represents. I continue to believe this is one of the most exciting opportunities I have ever seen in the technology industry. 
We are disappointed with our Software performance and Software Solutions business, but the issues are addressable and the other aspects of our long-term plan are coming together nicely. We see a clear path forward and will not be deterred. I am confident in our ability to deliver our long-term strategic plans and continue to unlock value for our shareholders. 
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike."

As Marc discussed, the start to 2016 has been about achieving a number of milestones in the company's transformation, important milestones in that they are solidifying the key financial drivers of our results over the next 2 to 3 years. We have now delivered a new operating platform and an initial set of cutting-edge solutions designed to sit on that platform. 
And additionally, we completed a first quarter that validated our actions to stabilize and reinvent our Mailing business but also highlighted areas like Software, where we have further work to do. Over the past 2-plus years, we have implemented both a go-to-market channel transformation and a recasting of our direct distribution geographic footprint in our SMB business. 
Our first quarter results represent an important milestone. On a constant currency basis and when adjusted the recent market exits, global SMB grew equipment sales 3%, led by growth in North America Mailing, which had its best quarter of equipment sales growth in several years. 
In April, we took another critical step forward in delivering operational excellence that will not only reduce cost, but dramatically enhances our ability to deliver and manage new products and services. Following on our pilot in Canada in late 2015, we delivered our ERP platform in the U.S., along with a new web store and client portal that support our new Commerce Cloud solutions. While we remain in ramp-up phase, we have now enabled nearly 80% of our revenue base on the new platform. This new platform and the solutions it supports further fulfills the goal of bringing enterprise capabilities to our entire client base. 
Before turning to the specifics of the quarter, I also wanted to highlight that our investments in the company's future have been balanced with our commitment to managing total return to shareholders. In addition to providing a competitive dividend, we repurchased 6.8 million shares of our common stock during the first quarter. 
I will take you through our first quarter results in a moment, but it's important to reiterate Marc's sentiment that we have our eye on the prize. The business model innovation we are achieving as a company, be it through our brands, infrastructure, technology or the solutions we offer to our clients, all are keeping us on track for attaining our long-term objectives. 
Turning to the quarter. We again experienced positive trends in a number of key indicators. SMB equipment sales growth accelerated, which coupled with our recent market exits and previous EBIT margin improvements, reflect the successful transition in our go-to-market model in our SMB Solutions group. Our Presort Services continues to turn in a strong performance, once again growing revenue and maintaining a strong EBIT margin. Global Ecommerce also continues to perform well, with improving trends in both retail and marketplace volumes, with particular strength from our U.K. marketplace. We also continued to add new brands to our retail platform. 
Production Mail and Software results were below our expectations and were impacted in part by a weaker macroeconomic environment. Our Production Mail results, which can be lumpy at times, were a function of a weak pipeline coming into 2016, a shift to third-party mailers and recent small market exits. As a result of focused pipeline build, we expect this business to strengthen, beginning in the second quarter. 
As Marc discussed, we have more work to do on our Software business, as the new management team focuses on improving sales efficiency and expanding our indirect channels to broaden our pipeline of opportunities while also focusing on our new offerings. 
When we provided guidance for 2016, we identified 3 factors that would affect our year-over-year comparison in the first quarter. First, the sale of our Imagitas business last May. Imagitas contributed about $0.02 to earnings per share last year, which was not repeated this year. Second, incremental expenses related to our advertising campaign and ERP implementation. In aggregate, these lowered earnings per share by $0.04 per share in the quarter compared to the prior year. 
And third, we announced the exit of direct operations in Mexico, South Africa and 5 markets in Asia, and the conversion of those markets to a dealer network. In aggregate, these markets generated approximately $6 million in revenue in last year's first quarter, which was not repeated this year and thus had an adverse impact on our revenue comparisons, particularly in the International Mail and Production Mail segments. I will detail this further when I review our segment results. 
Let me now take you through the high-level financial results, and then I'll drill down in each of the segments' results and provide some additional color around our guidance. Please note that a reconciliation of adjusted to GAAP financial information can be found in the financial schedules in our earnings press release and earnings slides posted to our pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
Revenue for the first quarter totaled $845 million, which was a decline of 3% on a constant currency basis adjusted for recent market exits, a decline of 4% on a constant currency basis and 5% on a reported basis. Revenue in our SMB segment group declined 3% on a constant currency basis adjusted for recent market exits, declined 4% on a constant currency basis and 5% on a reported basis. Revenue in our Enterprise Business Solutions group declined 1% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits, declined 2% on a constant currency basis and 3% on a reported basis. Digital Commerce Solutions revenue grew 11% on a constant currency basis and 9% on a reported basis. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.34 for the first quarter. As noted, when compared to the prior year, our adjusted earnings per share results were $0.02 lower due to income in the prior year before the sale of Imagitas as well as $0.03 of incremental advertising expense and $0.01 of incremental ERP systems expense. 
GAAP earnings per share were $0.30, which includes $0.02 in restructuring charges and $0.01 in disposition cost related to the recent market exits. 
Free cash flow was $60 million, and we generated $58 million on a GAAP basis in cash from operations. Compared to prior year, free cash flow declined in part due to the early payments to critical vendors resulting from the go-live blackout period of the new ERP program in the U.S. Free cash flow this quarter was also impacted by the lower net income, which was partly due to the incremental expenses related to the advertising campaign and ERP. The slower decline in finance receivables resulting from favorable equipment sales also impacted the comparison to prior year. 
During the quarter, we returned cash to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We spent $128 million on the repurchase of our common stock, buying 6.8 million shares in the quarter. We also paid $36 million in dividends to our common shareholders. Additionally, we made $22 million in restructuring payments and made a $37 million contribution to our U.K. pension fund. 
From a debt management perspective, we obtained $300 million of bank term loans and refinanced a $371 million note that matured in January. We disclosed this information in our prior earnings call. 
Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, was $144 million this quarter, which was $34 million lower than the prior year as a result of the incremental advertising and ERP expenses, the sale of Imagitas, acquisition cost related to Borderfree and the decline in revenue. Adjusted EBIT margin was 17%. Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $188 million.
SG&A for the quarter was $327 million, which was $12 million or 4% higher than the prior year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 38.7%, which was 340 basis points higher than the prior year. The increase in SG&A was the result of incremental costs associated with the new advertising campaign and ERP implementation as well as the net increase in SG&A resulting from the acquisition of Borderfree. SG&A, excluding these factors, declined year-over-year. 
During the quarter, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $7 million for actions taken in the first quarter to align our operations. Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $34 million, which was a decline of about $9 million when compared to the prior year. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were $178 million lower than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 4.66%, which was 74 basis points lower than the prior year. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter was 36.7%, which was 60 basis points lower than the prior year's tax rate but the above our expected tax rate for the full year, which we expect to still be between 32% and 35%. 
Now I'd like to discuss the first quarter results for each of our business segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we post to the pb.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
For SMB Solutions. In North American Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $350 million, and EBIT was $156 million. Revenue declined 3% both on a constant currency and a reported basis. The rate of decline in revenue was in line with the prior quarter's results, which reflects a portfolio that is a stabilizing and the maturing of our go-to-market changes as well as our targeted marketing initiatives. 
On a constant currency basis, equipment sales grew a strong 6% over prior year, which was the highest rate of growth in several years. Recurring revenue streams continued to decline but are expected to benefit in future periods as the trend in equipment sales revenue improves. EBIT margin continued to perform strongly at 44.6%, reflecting ongoing focus on productivity improvements. 
In International Mailing, revenue for the quarter was $104 million, and EBIT was $12 million. Revenue declined 7% on a constant currency basis and 11% on a reported basis. Adjusting constant currency revenue for the recent market exits, revenue declined 5%, which is an improvement from prior quarters. Revenue benefited from equipment sales growth in France, Germany and Japan, as the go-to-market strategy matures and productivity benefits are being recognized. The decline in the recurring revenue stream was consistent with prior quarters, and the trend is expected to improve in future periods, as the trend in equipment sales revenue improves. EBIT margin was 11.4%, which was 130 basis points higher than prior year, as a result of lower cost associated with the change in go-to market. 
Turning to Enterprise Business Solutions. In Production Mail, revenue for the quarter was $87 million, and EBIT was $7 million. Revenue declined 11% on a constant currency basis and 12% on a reported basis. Adjusting constant currency revenue for the recent market exits, revenue declined 8%. Equipment sales declined from prior year, partly due to fewer inserting equipment installations and the timing of closing some large deals. Support services and supplies revenue declined in part as a result of some in-house mailers shifting their mail processing to third-party outsourcers and the recent market exits. EBIT margin was 7.8%, which was a decline of 130 basis points versus the prior year due to the lower revenue, especially the higher-margin inserting equipment sales. 
In Presort Services, revenue for the quarter was $127 million, and EBIT was $29 million. Revenue and EBIT both grew 5% on a constant currency basis and reported basis. Revenue benefited from the higher volume of first-class mail processed as well as expansion into the St. Louis market. EBIT margin continued to perform strongly at 22.7%. 
Turning to Digital Commerce Solutions. In Software, revenue for the quarter was $78 million, and EBIT was a loss of $3 million. Revenue declined 7% on a constant currency basis and 10% on a reported basis. Revenue declined due to fewer large licensing deals and lower data-related licenses versus the prior year. The company is expanding its channel reach and focus on several high-potential industries and solutions, which have longer sales cycles. As I mentioned earlier, the new management team is focused on improving sales efficiency and expanding our indirect channel to build the opportunity pipeline. EBIT margin was a negative 3%, largely as a result of the lower licensing revenue, which has a high margin, and increased selling and marketing investments. 
In Global Ecommerce, revenue for the quarter was $98 million, and EBIT was about $1 million. Revenue grew 31% on a constant currency basis and 30% on a reported basis. Results included another full quarter of revenue from Borderfree. In the quarter, we grew the number of retail storefront clients and had strong growth in the U.K. marketplace. And although the stronger U.S. dollar continued to have an impact on outbound demand, the recent trading range against key buying currencies resulted in improving volume trends through the course of the quarter in our U.S. marketplace. EBIT margin was about 1% due to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and investments in the business, which more than offset early synergy savings. The business remains on track to achieve its synergy run rate objective by the end of the year. 
That concludes my remarks on the segments. Let me now take a moment to discuss our 2016 guidance.
The company is reaffirming its annual revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow guidance. We expect revenue on a constant currency basis to be in the range of a 1% decline to 2% growth. We also expect earnings per share to be in the range of $1.80 to $2 on both an adjusted and GAAP basis. And we also expect free cash flow to be in the range of $425 million to $525 million. 
It's important to note that the recent market exits will have an adverse impact on revenue comparisons each quarter this year. In aggregate, the markets we exited generated approximately $26 million in revenue in 2015 and had an immaterial earnings contribution. While we have moved to indirect operations in most of those markets, we do not expect the same level of revenue in 2016, particularly in equipment sales and support services, which will negatively impact our year-over-year comparisons. 
We're providing further detail on the timing of advertising and ERP expenses among the quarters. For the year, we now expect incremental marketing expense in the second quarter to have a similar impact on earnings as the first quarter. The change and timing of the expenses related in part to an extension of the company's advertising campaign and support for the launch of the new Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud solutions. Total annual expense is expected to remain the same. Incremental ERP expense is expected to be the highest in the second quarter, as the company supports the post-launch implementation phase of its ERP platform in the U.S. The aggregate of these incremental advertising and ERP expenses in the second quarter are expected to be at a similar level to the impact on earnings in the first quarter or approximately $0.04 per share higher than the prior year. As a reminder, we still expect to recognize the early benefits from the ERP implementation sometime in the third quarter and then ramp up more in the fourth quarter. 
Before I open the line for questions, I'd like to take a moment to note the recent launch of our Commerce Cloud, which is enabled by our new ERP platform. The Commerce Cloud is a commerce enabler, providing access to solutions, analytics and APIs across the full commerce continuum. The Commerce Cloud will enable us to easily and quickly provide our solutions and capabilities to all our clients. As many of these SaaS-based solutions will be subscription or usage-based, the financial impact will build over time, especially as we continue to add new applications. The Commerce Cloud and ERP platform are providing new value to our existing clients and the opportunity to acquire new clients. 
Operator, that concludes my remarks. Please open the line for questions."

And I think it's an excellent question, one we've obviously thought a lot about. So let me just start with the market. If you look at the market in the first quarter, business investment in the United States was down 6%. If you look at several of the large technology companies, they had, I would say, similar results, some way or -- so It's not a great market. And as you know, our long-term aspirations for this business are exactly that, long term, so they transcend any one quarter. Let me kind of -- that being said, I still think we can do better than the market here. And let me kind of give you a little bit of texture on the kinds of execution issues that we talked about. So there's different buckets. The first, and Mike mentioned it, one of the places where we've been working -- and this, by the way, isn't the last 3 or 4 months, this is for the last several years, is to build an indirect channel with systems integrators. We're making progress on that, albeit at much slower than I would like. And by systems integrators, it's the large technology systems integrators that you would be familiar with. Another change that we're making, our services attach rate to our license revenue has been less than we thought. So we changed the compensation model to pay our sales force for services attach rate. I'll give you a third example. We had too much of our resource stacked up on our install base, so in the first quarter -- and by the way, again, this was something that was contemplated before the previous regime, so I don't want to paint this as something that the new guys have thought of. This is something that started well before. But we had too much of our resource base, too much of our resource stacked in our install base. So those are 3 kinds of examples. Now let me kind of get to the underneath part of your question, why my continued confidence? First of all, if you look at the nature of the problems, these are problems that, while, frustrating, and there's no one more frustrated with our Software performance than me, they're fixable. Secondly, what I -- take great umbridge in, and it gives me the ultimate confidence, is we've got good products. And you can see it in the affirmation that we've gotten from third parties. We've got important affirmation in the first quarter. You can see it in the quality and the sophistication of the clients that are buying our software. We just need to do a better job executing. So that kind of gives you a texture of how I think about the problem, why I'm confident, and we will improve going forward."

These arrangements with systems integrators take a while to land. Candidly, they have taken longer than I would hope. I've now personally interjected myself in those conversations, reaching out to my peers of these firms to see if we can accelerate it. And finally, moving resources to whitespace, while something that I'm highly confident will pay off over the long term, takes a while. So you've got new folks calling on new clients. They've got to establish those relationships, they've got to re-introduce Pitney Bowes to these clients, and it underlines why the advertising campaign is so important. The advertising campaign is important for multiple different reasons. But as you're trying to break into new markets, whether that be systems integrators or other aspects of indirect channel or new customers, having a degree of air cover so that we spend a little bit less time explaining who we are and the technology that we have and more time focusing on the client issues is a good thing."

So we would expect interest expense to continue to have some favorability on a year-over-year basis. With respect to taxes, we had a higher-than-projected full year tax rate in the first quarter, in large part because of the concentration of our earnings in the U.S., which has a higher average tax rate. So to the extent that we start to see a little better mix of earnings outside the U.S., and Software being 50% outside the U.S., is part of that factor as well.

So I continue to think about our SMB and Mailing business in the same dimensions that I always have, that we can get that business stabilized. That market is between minus 2% to minus 4%, we're minus 3%-ish in the first quarter. Clearly, with equipment sales 6%, that means streams will catch up with that. And you're right, that's been for the last several quarters. So we just planned it, that takes a year or so to begin to run through the balance sheet. But the trends are clear. I would take the opportunity to kind of talk about the balance of the year in equipment sales. We think there's more we can do here. That said, our second quarter, maybe with the deployment of impact and ERP, we've got some work to do in the second quarter as it relates to equipment sales. So there might be some timing issues, second quarter to third quarter. But I think the trend over the last few quarters there is clear, and that the new go-to-market, as we move from face-to-face sales to inside sales, is not only stabilizing, but it's beginning to work. That being said, there is another turn of the crank, and you intimated to it, as we move to the web. So one of the important things about the new technology platform that we have rolled out, one of the important things about the Commerce Cloud announcement is digital enabling our relationships with our clients. So that not only allows you more efficiency, but it will provide you a better way to make real time offers to those clients. So it's one thing to make calls to 1.5 million clients. It's another thing to send out an email blast to 1.5 million clients, targeted, based on their particular usage. So I think there's another turn of the crank here that will take us a while to get to. And then you throw on top of that the ability to drive new content into those relationships, and then you're thinking about a whole new ball game. And then that's why we're so excited about what we talked about last week. It is admittedly to the previous question, it's going to be a slow burn. But to have these 1.5 million client relationships and now have the ability to digitally interact with them and drive new content, new value into those relationships, that, I believe, is a game-changer for us.

I think those are 2 things that are specific guidance adjustments that we've made in terms of timing of expenses, now knowing that we've got the system out and knowing what we want to do in terms of support of Commerce Cloud in advertising. Beyond that, I think the biggest variable from the first quarter is what was the questions were about, which is the performance of the Software business. And as Marc said, we expect to continue to see some improvement in there, but it's not quite where we wanted to be yet. So I would say those are the major variables on an year-over-year basis."

So in terms of the Commerce Cloud, it is -- you saw, there were 5 different solutions that were announced initially, and there'll be additional as we go forward. Some of those will accrue, particularly the Software and e-commerce related ones, will accrue to the DCS businesses, e-commerce and Software businesses, Location Intelligence and the Software business. Where you'll see some accruing to the SMB business will be particularly around SendPro, which is the multi-carrier shipping solution. There are add-on products around SendPro, so we have something called a send kit that provides scale and other solutions for printer -- label printer for using the SendPro application. And then we've included the SendPro application in our high-end meter series as well, so it's accessible through that. So in that case, it accrues as, basically, a subscription added on to that equipment sale. So those are the main ways that it will affect the SMB business. To Marc's earlier comment, in most all these cases, they will generate levels of recurring revenue that will help further mitigate the declines we've seen in some of our recurring revenue streams."

Because it's one we're thinking about a lot as those business evolves, I mean, how it is that we portray ourselves in a way that we're easily understandable. But one of the points that we've made for a while is the import of our digital capabilities transcends our Software segment, so a lot of these capabilities are things that were capabilities that were born or nested within our Software business per se. Other benefits -- or other businesses are accruing the benefits of those. So it's an important question in the micro, it's an important question how we present ourselves, but it's also, I think, an important question in terms of how it is that we amortize these capabilities over the breadth of the business."

If you can talk a bit about any more divestitures. And you've done a good job of cleaning the business up. I mean, there have been a number of things that have moved. And clearly, we understand going indirect in some of the countries that you're going indirect in this quarter. But as you look at sort of the assets you have right now, do you think we're kind of through that period? And so we won't have some of these, where you've got to pull revenue out even though it sort of business is still ongoing? And then also, are there any other areas where you think you might want to augment more? And of course, I'm getting back to my usual use of cash question here at the end of this. So just any discussion about that. And then also, you're kind of getting through the end of the share repurchase. Any more thoughts on what your board is thinking with regard to return of cash to shareholders?"

Again, a great question. So the way I think about the portfolio broadly is the portfolio needs to be congruent with 3 basic principles: They got to be leaders in their businesses, they got to be strategically coherent and they have to cover their return on invested capital. The problem with answering your question is those dynamics move. So as value continues to move in different segments, then that equation changes. So we will continue to evaluate the portfolio in context of what we think is the best decision for our shareholders and the best way to create value. So in the end, I like all the businesses, I'm wed to none of them. And we will continue to evaluate businesses, growing the portfolio vis-à-vis those 3 strategic criteria. As it relates to potential acquisitions, our focus continues to be within our Digital Commerce space broadly. And e-commerce, I would say, is kind of the first amongst equals, but that's where we think we can get the best return for our shareholders. But again, we've put pretty strict criteria in terms of the types of financial metrics that acquisitions would have to conform to, and we're not backing off those. And what I would say is acquisitions appear to us right now to be pretty expensive. So that's not to say we won't do some, but when we look around the neighborhood, it seems it's hard for us to close the math. So we continue to look and we continue to think that's an important option to have available to us. But at these prices, hard to close the math. In terms of uses of cash, one, again, the question that we think a lot about, I would just double-click on your point. I mean, we did $5 million, $6 million -- or 6 million shares in the first quarter. And if you look at from 2015 to 2016, those 2 years, I think we're close to, like, $260 million of share repurchases. If you put that in context of what we said at Analyst Day, we talked about $1 billion of available free cash balance between acquisitions and return of cash to shareholders with a bias towards return of cash to shareholders. So I think we're fulfilling that promise, as we saw at that time. In terms of conversations with the shareholders, you wouldn't expect that -- or conversations with the board, you wouldn't expect that we would reveal that beyond that this is an ongoing conversation that we talk about every almost board meeting in terms of trying to balance our uses of cash in the way that generates the best return for our shareholders."

So out of deference to everyone's time, let me wrap up. 
Before I close, I'd like to acknowledge Charlie McBride. As you all know, we announced Adam David as our new Vice President of Investor Relations. Consequently, this will be Charlie's last call with all of us. Charlie's been a long-standing and important contributor to Pitney Bowes. He's been here for 42 years. He's been in this particular role for 19, that's 76 quarters for those of you who think of life in that context as I do. 
And I can't tell you how important he's been to our transformation and to me personally. Charlie has been a tireless adviser. He has helped us in what has been a very difficult transition over the last couple of years, and I personally will miss him. And I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank Charlie for all that he's done for our company for the last -- over 4 decades, which is hard to even contemplate. So Charlie, we'll miss you, and thank you for all you've done. 
Let me now close. It's easy to get lost and amazed with numbers, but the bottom line is we continue to make good progress in transforming our business. Our advertising campaign to re-introduce PB to the world; the deployment of our totally reengineered processes and technology for 80% of our business setting the stage for substantial benefit realization; the assumption of equipment sales, our cash generation machine in North America; and finally, the introduction of PB Commerce Cloud opening up a whole new set of opportunities to our 1.5 million clients. 
Bottom line, we're creating the foundation for our company to be successful well into the future. I've never been more confident about our ability to deliver long-term strategic value to our shareholders. 
As I've said countless times before, transformations are not a straight line. We knew we have some things that we need to clean up. But I think as we talked about, if you look at the body of work that we are undertaking, the problems have become very isolated into a single dimension. That's not to say that we won't have future problems in different places, but as we contemplate our transformation, we're now down to a fairly narrow set of problems that I think are manageable. We've got a lot more to do, but we have created the foundation for this company to be successful well into the future. 
So we'll talk again in 90 days. Thank you for your attention this morning."

Mike will take you through the specifics of the quarter. As it's been the case for the last several years, there were a lot of moving parts to the quarter. From our perspective th",1287,"Good morning, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Mike will take you through the specifics of the quarter. As it's been the case for the last several years, there were a lot of moving parts to the quarter. 
From our perspective there were 4 themes. So let me discuss each of them. First, our ecommerce business continued to gain momentum, and the business is positioned for a strong second half. We continue to add new clients and new geographies. I'll come back to this in a moment. However, this business is well positioned in a rapidly growing market. 
Second, in our Software business, we still have work to do. In previous communications, I have pointed to the importance of building channel partnerships with systems integrators and other technology companies, and we did make substantial progress on that score in the second quarter. We signed with 11 systems integrators, 2 global and 9 regional. 
Let me give you an example of a relationship with a global systems integrator. In June, we joined forces with Accenture digital, a world-class leader in digital customer experience. Pitney Bowes EngageOne video solution will be offered to Accenture digital clients who are in the midst of their digital transformation strategy. Clients across verticals and public service industries can deploy and EngageOne video to boost customer loyalty, improve new customer onboarding process, spur content development and scale video production. The scale that a partner like Accenture brings to Pitney Bowes gives us opportunity for meaningful progress. 
On a related point, according to the second quarter Forrester Wave communications management report and I quote, ""video support through Pitney Bowes interactive and personalized EngageOne video solution is best-in-class."" 
Also in June, we entered into an OEM agreement with IBM. This agreement helps strengthen our position as a Location Intelligence supplier to a market leader in business intelligence and analytics markets. These relationships and accolades are important for 2 reasons: first, they confirm that we have good products; second, getting good products to market requires the right channels. All these partners are best-in-class in their respective markets, and I'm confident they'll be important partners in bringing our products to market. 
So let me lay out how I see the Software business moving forward. You should see improved license performance as the first step in this business improvement, and we are starting the second half with a much improved pipeline. That will lead to improvements in subsequent quarters and the related streams. As I mentioned in the last quarter, I expect this business to improve throughout the course of the year. While overall business investment in technology is soft, I still believe we can turn in better performance. 
Third, as we discussed on our last call, we deployed our new enterprise business platform in April in the United States. Although we often called this an ERP project, that really does not do justice to the scale of this initiative. The platform affects every aspect of our business, including how sales opportunities are managed, products are configured, leases and bills calculated, financials produced, customer service delivered and client satisfaction managed. It is a substantial business process and technology reengineering project and now extends to approximately 80% of our revenue base. 
It is already producing benefits to our business and will deliver substantial benefits to our business over time. It is worth noting that some of these significant products announcements we had made in the last 90 days have been enabled by our new business platform. 
All that said, the implementation of this platform caused some short-term interruptions to our business, particularly in the high-volume portion of our meter business in April. Mike will elaborate on this more in his comments, but here's the bottom line. The platform now covers the preponderance of our business, and the business case is still intact. In some cases, we can already see that the business benefits will be beyond what we had originally contemplated. 
Fourth, and most importantly, we have been focused from the beginning on creating long-term shareholder value. I said to my team this last April that I believe the second quarter of 2016 will be one of the most pivotal quarters in our company's history in our transformation efforts to establish those fundamentals that enable long-term success. Let me explain what I mean based on our strategic pillars: the reinvention of mail, operational excellence and growth of our Digital Commerce business. 
We made substantial progress in the reinvention of our Mail business during the second quarter. A big part of this, as you all know, was the launch of the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud in April. The response from clients has been very encouraging. We've already attracted more than 1 million unique visitors to the Commerce Cloud portal. The number of clients using the web to purchase supplies has increased by 25%, and we are seeing incremental demand for our shipping products, particularly our SendPro solution and our APIs. 
API is providing new opportunities to monetize our Software assets as developers and ISVs embed our capabilities in their products. While it will take time for demand to drive recurring revenue streams in these new areas, this initiative is integral to create new value for the small and medium business market and all of our existing clients. 
Last month, we announced SmartLink, a digital technology solution that connects our existing installed base of process meters to the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud to streamline the client experience, enable services from the Commerce Cloud. We will continue to innovate in this area. 
Next, operational excellence. In one of my very early earnings calls as a CEO, I said that I thought CEOs are sometimes guilty of blaming execution without looking more deeply at root causes. Things like do you have the right channels, the right skills? Is the brand positioned correctly? Do you have the right systems to enable execution? Over the last 3 years, we are slowly, sometimes more slowly than I wanted but methodically addressed these items. I also said over time, you'll see the benefits of these endeavors in the income statement and balance sheet. I still believe that. The benefits never come fast enough, but there's no doubt in my mind that investing in channels, brands, systems, products and our people is the best way for us to build long-term shareholder value. 
Finally, growing Digital Commerce. We've already covered Software. So I won't rehash it beyond saying that while we still need to improve, we can deliver results, and we've made real progress in the second quarter building channels and pipeline for the second half. 
In our ecommerce business, we added 15 new retail storefronts in the second quarter, bringing our total to almost 240 worldwide. Last week, we added an additional 5 stores and announced that we were adding outbound capabilities in Australia to our existing outbound businesses in the United States and U.K. In addition to growing our existing relationships, these new storefronts have positioned this business for sustainable growth going forward. 
One opportunity that has become particularly hot is helping U.S. and U.K. retailers sell into Asia, particularly China. Over the last several months, I've had the opportunity to visit potential clients in India and China, and demand for our cross-brand capabilities is one of the most impressive things I've ever seen. 
Bottom line, while I thought we had the opportunity to do better in the second quarter, we cannot be more pleased with the progress we've made on our strategic agenda, and we have set ourselves up for improved second half. 
I will make a few final remarks after Mike, but at this point, let me turn the call to Mike."
297018,377726043,1021061,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Marc, and good morning. Marc outlined how our actions in the quarter are in line with our transformation objectives. I want to focus my comments on 3 things: first, the impact of our enterprise business platform launch in the U.S. on our result",3509,"Thank you, Marc, and good morning. Marc outlined how our actions in the quarter are in line with our transformation objectives. I want to focus my comments on 3 things: first, the impact of our enterprise business platform launch in the U.S. on our results in the quarter and forward; second, the specifics of the second quarter; and third, our outlook for the remainder of 2016. 
Let me begin with what we have been calling our ERP program but is actually a remake of our enterprise business platform, including IT systems, web capability and new product enablement. In fact, at the same time we went live with this new platform, we also brought online new web store capability, client self-service functionality and our new SaaS-based SendPro product, which leverages new subscription billing capably. The new platform we put in place was critical to us launching each of these items. 
As we look to the future, the long-term benefits of our new systems far outweigh the impact on results in the second quarter. In April, we launched the new enterprise business platform in the U.S. U.S. represents 75% of our consolidated revenue, generates 90% of consolidated business segment EBIT and covers every one of our business models. As a result, we developed and implemented a robust cutover plan. The results from the second quarter reflect the temporary impacts to that transition. 
Our enterprise-based businesses, including Production Mail, presort, Software and Cross-Border Ecommerce were not materially impacted by the transition. However, given the scale and run rate nature of selling to a large installed base in our SMB and shipping businesses, there were impacts to revenue and profit resulting from the transition. This manifested itself principally in 2 areas: first, in sales productivity, particularly inside sales and supply sales where selling days were lost to conversion, training and early productivity; and second, in financing-related fees as a result of proactive waivers to compensate for delayed billing associated with the system cutover and client acclimation to new billing formats. 
To give you some sense of the work needed to do this transformation, we had to take down multiple older legacy systems; do a phased ramp up of new functionality; train across our sales, service, customer care and back-office teams; and then validate the new processes. All of these efforts had an impact on sales productivity. Our inside sales and supply sales group initiate and make sales on the same day whilst still in a single call. So time off the phone is lost sales productivity. So while it's not our practice to provide comments on monthly activity, we felt it would be instructive to provide insight in this case, given the unique circumstances related to the systems go live. 
The impact on our results from this change was most pronounced in the month of April. We began to see productivity improvements in May as teams adapted to new processes, but we were not yet at prego live levels. By June, sales and supplies performance began to normalize closer in line with prego live levels. Late June and early July results suggest a return to prego live levels, and we will continue to drive further automation and process enhancements throughout the second half. 
It is our estimate when comparing monthly activity in the second quarter to prego live activity levels in the first quarter of this year and second quarter of last year that total revenue was reduced in the second quarter by an estimated $15 million to $20 million or 2 percentage points related to our systems go live activities. Based on the mix of revenue impacted, we estimate EBIT margin impact to be about 100 basis points. Overall, earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, is estimated to have been negatively impacted by about $9 million to $12 million or an estimated $0.03 per share. Earnings results for the quarter also included costs of development and deployment of our business platform. 
While we continue to make refinements and enhancements to the system and have opportunities for further improvements in productivity, we believe material impacts to revenue related to the U.S. go live are behind us as we enter the second half of the year. We are pleased that with the cutover in both Canada and the U.S, we now have approximately 80% of our revenue and the vast majority of our profit for the company deployed on our new infrastructure. 
Turning to the quarter. We did see some improving trends in several parts of the business this quarter as compared to our first quarter results. But in addition to the impacts of our enterprise business platform, Software continued to underperform as Marc mentioned. Within Global Ecommerce, our Cross-Border Ecommerce business grew organically at a double-digit rate over prior year and improved its EBIT margin from first quarter performance. The shipping solutions business was down year-over-year, in part as a result of the enterprise business platform cutover. International Mailing's revenue comparison continues to improve from prior trends. Production Mail saw an improvement in its revenue comparison and EBIT margin. Presort Services also continue to show revenue growth, though at a lower rate than the prior quarters. Our Software business continued to experience lower license sales year-over-year as we take actions to improve our channel effectiveness. 
As Marc outlined, we are improving sales efficiency and are making good progress expanding indirect channels to improve our market access. As we noted, we added a total of 11 new and regional systems integrators. These actions will take time to be fully reflected in the results, but we've already increased our pipeline of deals during the second quarter. 
I also wanted to highlight that the work we have done thus far to invest in and change our business operating infrastructure continues to be balanced with our commitment to managing total return to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $66 million in shares of our common stock and continue to pay a competitive dividend. This brings our year-to-date total share repurchase to about $195 million or a little over 10 million shares. And at the end of the quarter, we have about $20 million remaining on our authorization of $150 million. 
Let me now take you through the high-level second quarter financial results, and then I'll provide details on each of the segment's results and provide an update on our 2016 guidance. Please note that a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the financial schedules appended to our earnings press release and earnings slides, which are posted on the pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
Turning to the results. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $836 million, which was a decline of 4% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits, a decline of 5% on a reported basis. The revenue impact of these systems cutover reduced consolidated revenues by an estimated $15 million to $20 million or about 2 percentage points of growth. 
Revenue in our SMB segment group declined 7% at constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and declined 8% on a reported basis. Within SMB, North American Mailing's revenue comparison to prior year was adversely impacted by an estimated 5 percentage point due to the temporary business impact of the cutover to the new enterprise business platform in the U.S. 
Revenue in our Enterprise Business Solutions group grew 1% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and was flat on a reported basis. Digital Commerce Solutions revenue grew 12% on a constant currency basis and 11% on a reported basis. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.39. When compared to the prior year, our adjusted earnings per share results this quarter were impacted by the estimated $0.03 impact that I discussed earlier related to the disruption caused by the system integration cutover, $0.02 of incremental ERP expense and $0.02 of income recorded in the second quarter 2015 for our Imagitas business that was subsequently divested last May. 
GAAP earnings per share were $0.28, which included $0.09 in restructuring charges recorded in the quarter and $0.01 loss from discontinued operations. Free cash flow was $86 million, and we generated $95 million on a GAAP basis in cash from operations. Free cash flow was slightly favorable to prior year as favorable working capital and lower capital expenditures were partly offset by lower net income. Free cash flow was also impacted by a delayed billing and collections activity associated with the systems cutover. These impacts are expected to normalize in the second half of the year. 
During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We spent $66 million on the repurchase of our common stock, buying 3.5 million shares in the quarter. We also paid $35 million in dividends to our common shareholders. Additionally, we made $12 million in restructuring payments. The company also received $18 million of cash from investing activities related to the sale of a building in Troy, New York. 
Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, was $154 million this quarter, which was $26 million lower than the prior year as a result of the reduced revenue related to systems cutover as well as incremental ERP and R&D expenses, the sale of Imagitas and the Software revenue decline. Adjusted EBIT margin was 18.4%. 
Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA was $199 million for the quarter. SG&A for the quarter was $289 million, which was $17 million or 5% lower than the prior year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 34.5%, which was nearly flat to last year. SG&A declined in absolute terms year-to-year primarily driven by lower employee-related costs. This quarter included incremental ERP and marketing expenses. Also when compared to the prior year, current year SG&A includes a full quarter of amortization expense associated with the acquisition of Borderfree. 
In support of the savings objectives related to our enterprise business platform rollout, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $17 million at the end of the quarter for actions taken to improve operational efficiency and productivity across our business portfolio. In addition, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $8 million in the quarter. 
Also, R&D expense increased from prior year by $6 million as a result of bringing new solution like SendPro, SmartLink and the Commerce Cloud to market concurrent with our infrastructure rollout. In addition, investments in e-commerce R&D were up from prior year due to the integration of our technology platforms. 
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $34 million, which was a decline of about $5 million compared to the prior year, which is the result of the actions we have taken to manage our debt portfolio. Outstanding borrowings during the quarter were about $200 million higher than the prior year. 
The average interest rate this quarter was 4.46%, which was about 80 basis points lower than the prior year. The effective tax rate and adjusted earnings for the quarter was 35.7%, which was 320 basis points higher than the prior year's tax rate. This reflects increased tax attributable to the change in the mix of earnings. 
Now I'd like to discuss our second quarter results for each of our business segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we post to the pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
For SMB Solutions in North America Mailing, revenue was $322 million, and EBIT was $142 million. As I discussed earlier, we have estimated this quarter's revenue comparison to prior year was negatively impacted in the range of $15 million to $20 million or about 5% due to the revenue reduction related to the enterprise business platform implementation and its impact on equipment sales and recurring revenue streams. Of the estimated revenue reduction, the split is roughly 2/3 equipment sales and 1/3 for the recurring revenue streams. 
I should note these temporary impacts related to the system cutover in the quarter are not ongoing changes in the end market. Therefore, on a reported basis, equipment sales and recurring revenue streams declined from prior years at a greater rate versus prior quarter trends. 
EBIT margin was 44.2%, which was 50 basis points lower than prior year, mostly the result of the lower revenue. In International Mailing, revenue was $106 million, and EBIT was $13 million. The segment's year-over-year revenue performance continues to improve. Equipment sales grew from prior year, most notably in France, Italy and Japan in part due to improved sales productivity from the go-to-market changes, especially in France. 
The decline in recurring revenue streams was also the lowest we saw in 7 quarters. Overall, constant currency revenue adjusted for market exits was flat to the prior year. EBIT margin was 12%, which was 80 basis points lower from prior year, primarily due to the equipment sales mix of business. 
Turning to Enterprise Business Solutions. Our overall segment group's revenue was flat on a reported basis and grew 1.5% when adjusting for Production Mail market exits, which is in line with our long-term outlook for the segment. In Production Mail, revenue was $96 million, and EBIT was $13 million. Equipment sales grew over prior year due to higher sorter equipment installation. Support services and suppliers revenue declined in part as a result of some in-house mailers shifting their mail processing to third-party outsourcers and the recent market exits. 
EBIT margin was 13.5%, which was an improvement of 320 basis points from prior year and mostly driven by service delivery cost management initiatives. In Presort Services, revenue was $116 million, and EBIT was $21 million. Revenue benefited from the higher volume of first-class mail processed as well as expansion into the St. Louis, Chicago and Portland markets but was partly offset by lower volumes of Standard Mail process. EBIT margin was 18.3%, which was a decline of about 240 basis points versus prior year, primarily as a result of the USPS rate change and increased labor costs. 
For Digital Commerce Solutions, in Software Solutions, revenue was $90 million, and EBIT was $10 million. Revenue declined from prior year due to lower licensing revenues and lower data-related revenue. As Marc outlined and I noted earlier, we are actively signing up new systems integrators and reseller partners as part of our continued focus on expanding the indirect channel and improving sales efficiency to improve the pipeline of deals. 
EBIT margin was 11.2%, which was a decline of 510 basis points versus prior year, mostly due to the lower licensing revenue, which has a higher margin. We are taking actions to further improve our Software margins. 
In Global Ecommerce, revenue was $105 million, and EBIT was $4 million. Results this quarter included a full quarter of Borderfree revenue as compared to 1 month of revenue in the prior year. Revenue benefited from strong growth in the U.K. marketplace business and the launch of new retail storefronts. Outbound U.S. marketplace package shipments grew in the quarter despite the stronger U.S. dollar versus prior year. 
When adding preacquisition Borderfree revenue back to the prior year, for comparative purposes, organic growth in our cross-border business was 11%. This compares favorably with the first quarter, which was slightly down from prior year. 
The improved second quarter performance is due to the growth in outbound volumes in both the U.K. and the U.S. Shipping revenue declined from prior year, in part as a result of the enterprise business platform cutover and lower license sales. EBIT margin was 3.5%, which was a slight decline of 40 basis points versus the prior year. This was due to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, investments for growth in the business and a lower mix of our higher margin domestic shipping business, which more than offset synergy savings. This business remains on track to achieve its synergy run rate objective by year-end. 
One thing of note I'd like to also address is the impact of Brexit on our Global Ecommerce business. Due to the vote passing late in June, we did not see any material impact on our results in the second quarter. It is still early days and difficult to determine the longer-term impact to the business. However, in the short term, the weakened British pound has created additional opportunity for our U.K. outbound business but has an opposite impact for U.S. goods into the U.K. as the goods have now become more expensive. We'll continue to monitor the situation. 
Early July results suggest that the U.K. outbound growth is being more than offset by the decline in U.S. outbound to the U.K. Over time, expansion and globalization of our Cross-Border Ecommerce business will create natural hedges that should moderate the impacts of currency movements. 
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter. Now I'd like to discuss our updated annual guidance and provide some insights for the second half of 2016. Based on year-to-date results, particularly in Software along with the second quarter temporary impact in North America Mailing as a result of the new enterprise business platform cutover, the company is adjusting its annual guidance. We will take the added step this onetime to provide further details on both our second half and full year guidance. 
For the full year 2016, we now expect revenue on a constant currency basis to be in the range of a 1% decline to 3% decline when compared to 2015. Adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.82, which excludes the year-to-date charge of $0.13 related to restructuring, asset impairment, dispositions expense and discontinued operations; free cash flow to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. We are also narrowing the range of our annual tax rate on adjusted earnings, and now expect it to be in the range of 33% to 35%. 
For the second half of the year, we expect constant currency revenue to be in a range of 2% growth to 2% decline compared to the constant currency decline of 4% experienced in the first half of the year. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $1.03 to $1.10, and free cash flow to be in the range of $254 million to $304 million. 
To achieve improvement in the second half as compared to the first half of the year, we expect the North America Mailing business to return to a more normalized level as we progress throughout the second half. Our Enterprise Solutions Group is expected to perform similar to the first half. 
And Digital Commerce Solutions performance levels subject to no material changes in key currency valuations or any new material impacts from the Brexit decision or Canada Post labor negotiation are expected to improve from the first half performance levels. We expect Software license revenue growth to improve as a result of the progress we are making in channel efficiency and channel partner engagement. 
For Global Ecommerce, we expect constant currency revenue in the second half to grow double digits post the anniversary of the Borderfree acquisition. This will be driven by the continued transaction volume growth as well as the acquisition of new and expansion of existing retail clients. Adjusted earnings per share in the second half when compared to the first half will benefit from the expected revenue improvements, reduced marketing and ERP spend and particularly in the fourth quarter, the early benefits from the infrastructure cost savings. Free cash flow in the second half as compared to the first half will benefit from the recovery of delayed billing and collections activity related to the systems cutover. 
I would also like to provide an update on our overall ERP project. With the U.S. launch, we now have the majority of our revenue, profit and transactional activity on our new platform. In the second half of 2016, in North America, we will focus on optimization of the platform, driving revenue from our new Commerce Cloud solutions enabled by the platform and delivering the savings opportunity related to the program. 
In addition, we've begun the implementation, planning and integration for our international rollout in 2017. We are still on track to achieve the targeted levels of expense and benefits in 2016. 
To date, in 2016, we have expensed about $20 million and have recognized some early benefits. We expect some benefits to come in during the third quarter, but the majority to materialize in the fourth quarter. 
Additionally, we will spend incremental CapEx in 2016 related to the ERP program to enhance automation of manual processes, increase web commodities for clients self-service and add new functionality. This added capital is not expected to increase the company's overall CapEx spending for the year due to lower spending in other areas. We will provide a more detailed update on the overall program performance and benefit realization at our Analyst Day later this year. 
That concludes my remarks. Operator, please open the line for questions."

If you look at -- and again, given the change in the value of the pound in the last several weeks, given the Brexit vote, it's early days to know exactly what the pluses and minus will be. But the weakening of the British pound has actually made purchases from U.K. grow because of the less -- the lower cost to buy from the U.K. The flip side of that is U.K. is an important outbound market from the U.S, and that's made the goods from the U.S. a little more expensive into the U.K. So it's actually early days, a slight negative given the amount of volume outbound from the U.S. But as the U.K. grows, that obviously diminishes."

So we've gone from basically flat to a little bit positive in the first quarter in that business, we think the leverage and the growth and the volumes is ultimately what drives the margin. We still have some synergies left to go through the balance of the year to get. So we see margin upside. The 15% margin is a long-term objective for the Digital Commerce Solutions business. I would say we're where we expect to be with the acquisition in terms of sort of the rate and pace of achieving the synergies as well as beginning to see the growth in the volume in the business."

So this is something that we'll roll out over years, not months or quarters. But early indications are investments in the brand have paid off. So we'll contemplate how we move forward with investments given the realities of our business in the second half, but there's no doubt that this is something that our focus is going to continue to be on enhancing our brand."

Mike will take you through the specifics of the quarter. As it's been the case for the last several years, there were a lot of moving parts to the quarter. From my perspective, th",1291,"Good morning, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Mike will take you through the specifics of the quarter. As it's been the case for the last several years, there were a lot of moving parts to the quarter. 
From my perspective, there were 4 themes, so let me discuss each of them. First, our e-commerce business continued to gain momentum, and the business is positioned for a strong second half. We continue to add new clients and new geographies. I'll come back to this in a moment. However, this business is well positioned in a rapidly growing market. 
Second, in our Software business, we still have work to do. In previous communications, I have pointed to the importance of building channel partnerships with systems integrators and other technology companies, and we did make substantial progress on that score in the second quarter. We signed with 11 systems integrators, 2 global and 9 regional. 
Let me give you an example of a relationship with a global systems integrator. In June, we joined forces with Accenture Digital, a world-class leader in digital customer experience. Pitney Bowes EngageOne Video solution will be offered to Accenture Digital clients who are in the midst of their digital transformation strategy. Clients across verticals and public service industries can deploy EngageOne Video to boost customer loyalty, improve new customer on-boarding process, spur content development and scale video production. The scale that a partner like Accenture brings to Pitney Bowes gives us an opportunity for meaningful progress. 
On a related point, according to the second quarter Forrester Wave communications management report and I quote, ""Video support through Pitney Bowes interactive and personalized EngageOne Video solution is best in class."" 
Also in June, we entered into an OEM agreement with IBM. This agreement helps strengthen our position as a Location Intelligence supplier to a market leader in business intelligence and analytics markets. These relationships and accolades are important for 2 reasons: first, they confirm that we have good products; second, getting good products to market requires the right channels. All these partners are best in class in their respective markets, and I'm confident they'll be important partners in bringing our products to market. 
So let me lay out how I see the Software business moving forward. You should see improved license performance as the first step in this business improvement, and we are starting the second half with a much improved pipeline. That will lead to improvements in subsequent quarters and their related streams. As I mentioned in the last quarter, I expect this business to improve throughout the course of the year. While overall business investment in technology is soft, I still believe we can turn in better performance. 
Third, as we discussed on our last call, we deployed our new enterprise business platform in April in the United States. Although we often call this an ERP project, that really does not do justice to the scale of this initiative. The platform affects every aspect of our business, including how sales opportunities are managed, products are configured, leases and bills calculated, financials produced, customer service delivered and client satisfaction managed. It is a substantial business process and technology reengineering project and now extends to approximately 80% of our revenue base. 
It is already producing benefits to our business and will deliver substantial benefits to our business over time. It is worth noting that some of the significant products announcements we had made in the last 90 days have been enabled by our new business platform. 
All that said, the implementation of this platform caused some short-term interruptions to our business, particularly in the high-volume portion of our meter business in April. Mike will elaborate on this more in his comments, but here's the bottom line. The platform now covers the preponderance of our business, and the business case is still intact. In some cases, we can already see that the business benefits will be beyond what we had originally contemplated. 
Fourth, and most importantly, we have been focused from the beginning on creating long-term shareholder value. I said to my team this last April that I believe the second quarter of 2016 will be one of the most pivotal quarters in our company's history in our transformation efforts to establish those fundamentals that enable long-term success. Let me explain what I mean based on our strategic pillars: the reinvention of mail, operational excellence and growth of our Digital Commerce business. 
We made substantial progress in the reinvention of our mail business during the second quarter. A big part of this, as you all know, was the launch of the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud in April. The response from clients has been very encouraging. We've already attracted more than 1 million unique visitors to the Commerce Cloud portal. The number of clients using the web to purchase supplies has increased by 25%, and we are seeing incremental demand for our shipping products, particularly our SendPro solution and our APIs. 
API is providing new opportunity to monetize our Software assets as developers and ISVs embed our capabilities in their products. While it will take time for demand to drive recurring revenue streams in these new areas, this initiative is integral to create new value for the small and medium business market and all of our existing clients. 
Last month, we announced SmartLink, a digital technology solution that connects our existing installed base of process meters to the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud to streamline the client experience, enable services from the Commerce Cloud. We will continue to innovate in this area. 
Next, operational excellence. In one of my very early earnings calls as a CEO, I said that I thought CEOs are sometimes guilty of blaming execution without looking more deeply at root causes. Things like do you have the right channels, the right skills? Is the brand positioned correctly? Do you have the right systems to enable execution? Over the last 3 years, we are slowly, sometimes more slowly than I wanted, but methodically addressed these items. I also said over time, you'll see the benefits of these endeavors in the income statement and balance sheet. I still believe that. The benefits never come fast enough, but there's no doubt in my mind that investing in channels, brands, systems, products and our people is the best way for us to build long-term shareholder value. 
Finally, growing Digital Commerce. We've already covered Software, so I won't rehash it beyond saying that while we still need to improve, we can deliver results, and we've made real progress in the second quarter building channels and pipeline for the second half. 
In our e-commerce business, we added 15 new retail storefronts in the second quarter, bringing our total to almost 240 worldwide. Last week, we added an additional 5 stores and announced that we were adding outbound capabilities in Australia to our existing outbound businesses in the United States and U.K. In addition to growing our existing relationships, these new storefronts have positioned this business for sustainable growth going forward. 
One opportunity that has become particularly hot is helping U.S. and U.K. retailers sell into Asia, particularly China. Over the last several months, I've had the opportunity to visit potential clients in India and China, and demand for our cross-brand capabilities is one of the most impressive things I've ever seen. 
Bottom line, while I thought we had the opportunity to do better in the second quarter, we cannot be more pleased with the progress we've made on our strategic agenda, and we have set ourselves up for improved second half. 
I will make a few final remarks after Mike, but at this point, let me turn the call to Mike."
297018,377726043,1021450,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Marc, and good morning. Marc outlined how our actions in the quarter are in line with our transformation objectives. I want to focus my comments on 3 things: first, the impact of our enterprise business platform launch in the U.S. on our result",3508,"Thank you, Marc, and good morning. Marc outlined how our actions in the quarter are in line with our transformation objectives. I want to focus my comments on 3 things: first, the impact of our enterprise business platform launch in the U.S. on our results in the quarter and forward; second, the specifics of the second quarter; and third, our outlook for the remainder of 2016. 
Let me begin with what we have been calling our ERP program but is actually a remake of our enterprise business platform, including IT systems, web capability and new product enablement. In fact, at the same time we went live with this new platform, we also brought online new web store capability, client self-service functionality and our new SaaS-based SendPro product, which leverages new subscription billing capability. The new platform we put in place was critical to us launching each of these items. 
As we look to the future, the long-term benefits of our new systems far outweigh the impact on results in the second quarter. In April, we launched the new enterprise business platform in the U.S. The U.S. represents 75% of our consolidated revenue, generates 90% of consolidated business segment EBIT and covers every one of our business models. As a result, we developed and implemented a robust cutover plan. The results from the second quarter reflect the temporary impacts of that transition. 
Our enterprise-based businesses, including Production Mail, Presort, Software and Cross-Border Ecommerce were not materially impacted by the transition. However, given the scale and run rate nature of selling to a large installed base in our SMB and shipping businesses, there were impacts to revenue and profit resulting from the transition. This manifested itself principally in 2 areas: first, in sales productivity, particularly inside sales and supply sales where selling days were lost to conversion, training and early productivity; and second, in financing-related fees as a result of proactive waivers to compensate for delayed billing associated with the system cutover and client acclimation to new billing formats. 
To give you some sense of the work needed to do this transformation, we had to take down multiple older legacy systems; do a phased ramp-up of new functionality; train across our sales, service, customer care and back-office teams; and then validate the new processes. All of these efforts had an impact on sales productivity. Our inside sales and supply sales groups initiate and make sales on the same day whilst still in a single call. So time off the phone is lost sales productivity. So while it's not our practice to provide comments on monthly activity, we felt it would be instructive to provide insight in this case, given the unique circumstances related to the systems go live. 
The impact on our results from this change was most pronounced in the month of April. We began to see productivity improvements in May as teams adapted to new processes, but we were not yet at pre-go live levels. By June, sales and supplies performance began to normalize closer in line with pre-go live levels. Late June and early July results suggest a return to pre-go live levels, and we will continue to drive further automation and process enhancements throughout the second half. 
It is our estimate when comparing monthly activity in the second quarter to pre-go live activity levels in the first quarter of this year and second quarter of last year that total revenue was reduced in the second quarter by an estimated $15 million to $20 million or 2 percentage points related to our systems go-live activities. Based on the mix of revenue impacted, we estimate the EBIT margin impact to be about 100 basis points. Overall, earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, is estimated to have been negatively impacted by about $9 million to $12 million or an estimated $0.03 per share. Earnings results for the quarter also included cost of development and deployment of our business platform. 
While we continue to make refinements and enhancements to the system and have opportunities for further improvements in productivity, we believe material impacts to revenue related to the U.S. go live are behind us as we enter the second half of the year. We are pleased that with the cutover in both Canada and the U.S., we now have approximately 80% of our revenue and the vast majority of our profit for the company deployed on our new infrastructure. 
Turning to the quarter. We did see some improving trends in several parts of the business this quarter as compared to our first quarter results. But in addition to the impacts of our enterprise business platform, Software continued to underperform as Marc mentioned. Within Global Ecommerce, our Cross-Border Ecommerce business grew organically at a double-digit rate over prior year and improved its EBIT margin from first quarter performance. The shipping solutions business was down year-over-year, in part as a result of the enterprise business platform cutover. International Mailing's revenue comparison continues to improve from prior trends. Production Mail saw an improvement in its revenue comparison and EBIT margin. Presort Services also continued to show revenue growth, though at a lower rate than the prior quarters. Our Software business continued to experience lower license sales year-over-year as we take actions to improve our channel effectiveness. 
As Marc outlined, we are improving sales efficiency and are making good progress expanding indirect channels to improve our market access. As we noted, we added a total of 11 new and regional systems integrators. These actions will take time to be fully reflected in the results, but we've already increased our pipeline of deals during the second quarter. 
I also wanted to highlight that the work we have done thus far to invest in and change our business operating infrastructure continues to be balanced with our commitment to managing total return to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $66 million in shares of our common stock and continued to pay a competitive dividend. This brings our year-to-date total share repurchase to about $195 million or a little over 10 million shares. And at the end of the quarter, we have about $20 million remaining on our authorization of $150 million. 
Let me now take you through the high-level second quarter financial results, and then I'll provide details on each of the segment's results and provide an update on our 2016 guidance. Please note that a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the financial schedules appended to our earnings press release and earnings slides, which are posted on the pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
Turning to the results. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $836 million, which was a decline of 4% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and a decline of 5% on a reported basis. The revenue impact of the systems cutover reduced consolidated revenues by an estimated $15 million to $20 million or about 2 percentage points of growth. 
Revenue in our SMB segment group declined 7% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and declined 8% on a reported basis. Within SMB, North American Mailing's revenue comparison to prior year was adversely impacted by an estimated 5 percentage point due to the temporary business impact of the cutover to the new enterprise business platform in the U.S. 
Revenue in our Enterprise Business Solutions group grew 1% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and was flat on a reported basis. Digital Commerce Solutions revenue grew 12% on a constant currency basis and 11% on a reported basis. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.39. When compared to the prior year, our adjusted earnings per share results this quarter were impacted by the estimated $0.03 impact that I discussed earlier related to the disruption caused by the system integration cutover, $0.02 of incremental ERP expense and $0.02 of income recorded in the second quarter 2015 for our Imagitas business that was subsequently divested last May. 
GAAP earnings per share were $0.28, which included $0.09 in restructuring charges recorded in the quarter and $0.01 loss from discontinued operations. Free cash flow was $86 million, and we generated $95 million on a GAAP basis in cash from operations. Free cash flow was slightly favorable to prior year as favorable working capital and lower capital expenditures were partly offset by lower net income. Free cash flow was also impacted by delayed billing and collections activity associated with the systems cutover. These impacts are expected to normalize in the second half of the year. 
During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We spent $66 million on the repurchase of our common stock, buying 3.5 million shares in the quarter. We also paid $35 million in dividends to our common shareholders. Additionally, we made $12 million in restructuring payments. The company also received $18 million of cash from investing activities related to the sale of a building in Troy, New York. 
Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, was $154 million this quarter, which was $26 million lower than the prior year as a result of the reduced revenue related to systems cutover as well as incremental ERP and R&D expenses, the sale of Imagitas and the Software revenue decline. Adjusted EBIT margin was 18.4%. 
Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA was $199 million for the quarter. SG&A for the quarter was $289 million, which was $17 million or 5% lower than the prior year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 34.5%, which was nearly flat to last year. SG&A declined in absolute terms year-to-year, primarily driven by lower employee-related costs. This quarter included incremental ERP and marketing expenses. Also, when compared to the prior year, current year SG&A includes a full quarter of amortization expense associated with the acquisition of Borderfree. 
In support of the savings objectives related to our enterprise business platform rollout, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $17 million at the end of the quarter for actions taken to improve operational efficiency and productivity across our business portfolio. In addition, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $8 million in the quarter. 
Also, R&D expense increased from prior year by $6 million as a result of bringing new solution like SendPro, SmartLink and the Commerce Cloud to market concurrent with our infrastructure rollout. In addition, investments in e-commerce R&D were up from prior year due to the integration of our technology platforms. 
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $34 million, which was a decline of about $5 million compared to the prior year, which is the result of the actions we have taken to manage our debt portfolio. Outstanding borrowings during the quarter were about $200 million higher than the prior year. 
The average interest rate this quarter was 4.46%, which was about 80 basis points lower than the prior year. The effective tax rate and adjusted earnings for the quarter was 35.7%, which was 320 basis points higher than the prior year's tax rate. This reflects increased tax attributable to a change in the mix of earnings. 
Now I'd like to discuss our second quarter results for each of our business segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we post to the pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
For SMB Solutions in North America Mailing, revenue was $322 million, and EBIT was $142 million. As I discussed earlier, we have estimated this quarter's revenue comparison to prior year was negatively impacted in the range of $15 million to $20 million or about 5% due to the revenue reduction related to the enterprise business platform implementation and its impact on equipment sales and recurring revenue streams. Of the estimated revenue reduction, the split is roughly 2/3 equipment sales and 1/3 for the recurring revenue streams. 
I should note these temporary impacts related to the system cutover in the quarter are not ongoing changes in the end market. Therefore, on a reported basis, equipment sales and recurring revenue streams declined from prior years at a greater rate versus prior quarter trends. 
EBIT margin was 44.2%, which was 50 basis points lower than prior year, mostly the result of the lower revenue. In International Mailing, revenue was $106 million, and EBIT was $13 million. The segment's year-over-year revenue performance continues to improve. Equipment sales grew from prior year, most notably in France, Italy and Japan, in part due to improved sales productivity from the go-to-market changes, especially in France. 
The decline in recurring revenue streams was also the lowest we saw in 7 quarters. Overall, constant currency revenue adjusted for market exits was flat to the prior year. EBIT margin was 12%, which was 80 basis points lower from prior year, primarily due to the equipment sales mix of business. 
Turning to Enterprise Business Solutions. Our overall segment group's revenue was flat on a reported basis and grew 1.5% when adjusting for Production Mail market exits, which is in line with our long-term outlook for the segment. In Production Mail, revenue was $96 million, and EBIT was $13 million. Equipment sales grew over prior year due to higher sorter equipment installations. Support services and supplies revenue declined in part as a result of some in-house mailers shifting their mail processing to third-party outsourcers and the recent market exits. 
EBIT margin was 13.5%, which was an improvement of 320 basis points from prior year and mostly driven by service delivery cost management initiatives. In Presort Services, revenue was $116 million, and EBIT was $21 million. Revenue benefited from the higher volume of first-class mail processed as well as expansion into the St. Louis, Chicago and Portland markets but was partly offset by lower volumes of Standard Mail process. EBIT margin was 18.3%, which was a decline of about 240 basis points versus prior year, primarily as a result of the USPS rate change and increased labor costs. 
For Digital Commerce Solutions, in Software Solutions, revenue was $90 million, and EBIT was $10 million. Revenue declined from prior year due to lower licensing revenues and lower data-related revenue. As Marc outlined and I noted earlier, we are actively signing up new systems integrators and reseller partners as part of our continued focus on expanding the indirect channel and improving sales efficiency to improve the pipeline of deals. 
EBIT margin was 11.2%, which was a decline of 510 basis points versus prior year, mostly due to the lower licensing revenue, which has a high margin. We are taking actions to further improve our Software margins. 
In Global Ecommerce, revenue was $105 million, and EBIT was $4 million. Results this quarter included a full quarter of Borderfree revenue as compared to 1 month of revenue in the prior year. Revenue benefited from strong growth in the U.K. marketplace business and the launch of new retail storefronts. Outbound U.S. marketplace package shipments grew in the quarter despite the stronger U.S. dollar versus prior year. 
When adding pre-acquisition Borderfree revenue back to the prior year, for comparative purposes, organic growth in our cross-border business was 11%. This compares favorably with the first quarter, which was slightly down from prior year. 
The improved second quarter performance is due to the growth in outbound volumes in both the U.K. and the U.S. Shipping revenue declined from prior year, in part as a result of the enterprise business platform cutover and lower license sales. EBIT margin was 3.5%, which was a slight decline of 40 basis points versus the prior year. This was due to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, investments for growth in the business and a lower mix of our higher-margin domestic shipping business, which more than offset synergy savings. This business remains on track to achieve its synergy run rate objective by year-end. 
One thing of note I'd like to also address is the impact of Brexit on our Global Ecommerce business. Due to the vote passing late in June, we did not see any material impact on our results in the second quarter. It is still early days and difficult to determine the longer-term impact to the business. However, in the short term, the weakened British pound has created additional opportunity for our U.K. outbound business but has an opposite impact for U.S. goods into the U.K. as the goods have now become more expensive. We'll continue to monitor this situation. 
Early July results suggest that the U.K. outbound growth is being more than offset by the decline in U.S. outbound to the U.K. Over time, expansion and globalization of our Cross-Border Ecommerce business will create natural hedges that should moderate the impacts of currency movements. 
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter. Now I'd like to discuss our updated annual guidance and provide some insights for the second half of 2016. Based on year-to-date results, particularly in Software along with the second quarter temporary impact in North America Mailing as a result of the new enterprise business platform cutover, the company is adjusting its annual guidance. We will take the added step this onetime to provide further details on both our second half and full year guidance. 
For the full year 2016, we now expect revenue on a constant currency basis to be in the range of a 1% decline to 3% decline when compared to 2015. Adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.82, which excludes the year-to-date charge of $0.13 related to restructuring, asset impairment, dispositions expense and discontinued operations; free cash flow to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. We are also narrowing the range of our annual tax rate on adjusted earnings and now expect it to be in the range of 33% to 35%. 
For the second half of the year, we expect constant currency revenue to be in the range of 2% growth to 2% decline compared to the constant currency decline of 4% experienced in the first half of the year. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.10 and free cash flow to be in the range of $254 million to $304 million. 
To achieve improvement in the second half as compared to the first half of the year, we expect the North America Mailing business to return to a more normalized level as we progress throughout the second half. Our Enterprise Solutions Group is expected to perform similar to the first half. 
And Digital Commerce Solutions performance levels, subject to no material changes in key currency valuations or any new material impacts from the Brexit decision or Canada Post labor negotiations, are expected to improve from the first half performance levels. We expect Software license revenue growth to improve as a result of the progress we are making in channel efficiency and channel partner engagement. 
For Global Ecommerce, we expect constant currency revenue in the second half to grow double digits post the anniversary of the Borderfree acquisition. This will be driven by continued transaction volume growth as well as the acquisition of new and expansion of existing retail clients. Adjusted earnings per share in the second half, when compared to the first half, will benefit from the expected revenue improvements, reduced marketing and ERP spend and particularly in the fourth quarter, the early benefits from the infrastructure cost savings. Free cash flow in the second half as compared to the first half will benefit from the recovery of delayed billing and collections activity related to the systems cutover. 
I would also like to provide an update on our overall ERP project. With the U.S. launch, we now have the majority of our revenue, profit and transactional activity on our new platform. In the second half of 2016, in North America, we will focus on optimization of the platform, driving revenue from our new Commerce Cloud solutions enabled by the platform and delivering the savings opportunity related to the program. 
In addition, we've begun the implementation, planning and integration for our international rollout in 2017. We are still on track to achieve the targeted levels of expense and benefits in 2016. 
To date, in 2016, we have expensed about $20 million and have recognized some early benefits. We expect some benefits to come in during the third quarter, but the majority to materialize in the fourth quarter. 
Additionally, we will spend incremental CapEx in 2016 related to the ERP program to enhance automation of manual processes, increase web capabilities for client self-service and add new functionality. This added capital is not expected to increase the company's overall CapEx spending for the year due to lower spending in other areas. We will provide a more detailed update on the overall program performance and benefit realization at our Analyst Day later this year. 
That concludes my remarks. Operator, please open the line for questions."

So we've seen that improve in terms of growth in outbound volumes from both markets. So we feel good about the direction of that now that we have a better currency comparison."

So we've gone from basically flat to a little bit positive in the first quarter in that business. We think the leverage and the growth and the volumes is ultimately what drives the margin. We still have some synergies left to go through the balance of the year to get. So we see margin upside. The 15% margin is a long-term objective for the Digital Commerce Solutions business. I would say we're where we expect to be with the acquisition in terms of sort of the rate and pace of achieving the synergies as well as beginning to see the growth in the volume in the business."

That certainly had a lot of different contributors to it, but our Digital Commerce business, including Software, was an aspect of that. And we're working what I would say is tuck-in type of acquisitions. So we made an acquisition in the second quarter of a company called Maponics.

I'd like to build off of Allen's question because I think it's an opportune segue. To a degree, for the last several years, I feel like we've been slogging uphill between market exits, channel shifts, the deployment of new systems, and you're all very familiar with the list. With the deployment of our business platform in the United States, I feel like we've got some clear water in front of us and we're anxious to take advantage of that. So from my perspective, we'll make a judgment about when we roll out the rest of the business platform, but my priority is moving towards having some clear water so we can begin to yield on the investments that we've made. So I'm not particularly pleased with our results financially in the first half. That being said, if you look at this transformation in the context that I always have, and that is what we are doing to improve the long-term ability of this business to create value, I couldn't be more pleased. So that's kind of where we are. As we move into the second half, I believe we're poised to begin to yield on some of the investments that we've made over the last quarters, the last several years, whether it be the investments in the brand, investments in our systems, investments in our channels, and we're anxious to take advantage of that. So we'll certainly update you more as the year goes on, but I think that's kind of a synopsis of where we are right now. So I look forward to speaking with you again in 90 days."

From my perspective, the",1289,"Good morning, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Mike will take you through the specifics of the quarter. As has been the case for the last several years, there were a lot of moving parts to the quarter. 
From my perspective, there were 4 themes. Let me discuss each of them. First, our e-commerce business continued to gain momentum, and the business is positioned for a strong second half. We continue to add new clients and new geographies. I'll come back to this in a moment. However, this business is well positioned in a rapidly growing market. 
Second, in our Software business, we still have work to do. In previous communications, I have pointed to the importance of building channel partnerships with systems integrators and other technology companies, and we did make substantial progress on that score in the second quarter. We signed with 11 systems integrators, 2 global and 9 regional. 
Let me give you an example of a relationship with a global systems integrator. In June, we joined forces with Accenture Digital, a world-class leader in digital customer experience. Pitney Bowes EngageOne Video solution will be offered to Accenture Digital clients who are in the midst of their digital transformation strategy. Clients across verticals and public service industries can deploy EngageOne Video to boost customer loyalty, improve new customer on-boarding process, spur content development and scale video production. The scale that a partner like Accenture brings to Pitney Bowes gives us an opportunity for meaningful progress. 
On a related point, according to the second quarter Forrester Wave communications management report and I quote, ""Video support through Pitney Bowes interactive and personalized EngageOne Video solution is best in class."" 
Also in June, we entered into an OEM agreement with IBM. This agreement helps strengthen our position as a Location Intelligence supplier to a market leader in business intelligence and analytics markets. These relationships and accolades are important for 2 reasons: first, they confirm that we have good products; second, getting good products to market requires the right channels. All these partners are best in class in their respective markets, and I'm confident they'll be important partners in bringing our products to market. 
Let me lay out how I see the Software business moving forward. You should see improved license performance as the first step in this business improvement, and we are starting the second half with a much-improved pipeline. That will lead to improvements in subsequent quarters and their related streams. As I mentioned in the last quarter, I expect this business to improve throughout the course of the year. While overall business investment in technology is soft, I still believe we can turn in better performance. 
Third, as we discussed on our last call, we deployed our new enterprise business platform in April in the United States. Although we often call this an ERP project, that really does not do justice to the scale of this initiative. The platform affects every aspect of our business, including how sales opportunities are managed, products are configured, leases and bills calculated, financials produced, customer service delivered and client satisfaction managed. It is a substantial business process and technology reengineering project and now extends to approximately 80% of our revenue base. 
It is already producing benefits to our business and will deliver substantial benefits to our business over time. It is worth noting that some of the significant products announcements we had made in the last 90 days have been enabled by our new business platform. 
All that said, the implementation of this platform caused some short-term interruptions to our business, particularly in the high-volume portion of our meter business in April. Mike will elaborate on this more in his comments, but here's the bottom line. The platform now covers the preponderance of our business, and the business case is still intact. In some cases, we can already see that the business benefits will be beyond what we had originally contemplated. 
Fourth, and most importantly, we have been focused from the beginning on creating long-term shareholder value. I said to my team this last April that I believe the second quarter of 2016 will be one of the most pivotal quarters in our company's history in our transformation efforts to establish those fundamentals that enable long-term success. Let me explain what I mean based on our strategic pillars: the reinvention of mail, operational excellence and growth of our Digital Commerce business. 
We made substantial progress in the reinvention of our mail business during the second quarter. A big part of this, as you all know, was the launch of the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud in April. The response from clients has been very encouraging. We've already attracted more than 1 million unique visitors to the Commerce Cloud portal. The number of clients using the web to purchase supplies has increased by 25%, and we are seeing incremental demand for our shipping products, particularly our SendPro solution and our APIs. 
API is providing new opportunity to monetize our Software assets, as developers and ISVs embed our capabilities in their products. While it will take time for demand to drive recurring revenue streams in these new areas, this initiative is integral to create new value for the small and medium business market and all of our existing clients. 
Last month, we announced SmartLink, a digital technology solution that connects our existing installed base of postage meters to the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud to streamline the client experience, enable services from the Commerce Cloud. We will continue to innovate in this area. 
Next, operational excellence. In one of my very early earnings calls as a CEO, I said that I thought CEOs are sometimes guilty of blaming execution without looking more deeply at root causes. Things like do you have the right channels, the right skills? Is the brand positioned correctly? Do you have the right systems to enable execution? Over the last 3 years, we have slowly, sometimes more slowly than I wanted, but methodically addressed these items. I also said over time you will see the benefits of these endeavors in the income statement and balance sheet. I still believe that. The benefits never come fast enough, but there's no doubt in my mind that investing in channels, brands, systems, products and our people is the best way for us to build long-term shareholder value. 
Finally, growing Digital Commerce. We've already covered Software, so I won't rehash it beyond saying that while we still need to improve, we can deliver results, and we've made real progress in the second quarter building channels and pipeline for the second half. 
In our e-commerce business, we added 15 new retail storefronts in the second quarter, bringing our total to almost 240 worldwide. Last week, we added an additional 5 stores and announced that we were adding outbound capabilities in Australia to our existing outbound businesses in the United States and U.K. In addition to growing our existing relationships, these new storefronts have positioned this business for sustainable growth going forward. 
One opportunity that has become particularly hot is helping U.S. and U.K. retailers sell into Asia, particularly China. Over the last several months, I've had the opportunity to visit potential clients in India and China, and demand for our cross-brand capabilities is one of the most impressive things I've ever seen. 
Bottom line, while I thought we had the opportunity to do better in the second quarter, we cannot be more pleased with the progress we've made on our strategic agenda, and we have set ourselves up for improved second half. 
I will make a few final remarks after Mike, but at this point, let me turn the call to Mike."
297018,377726043,1021675,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Marc, and good morning. Marc outlined how our actions in the quarter are in line with our transformation objectives. I want to focus my comments on 3 things: first, the impact of our enterprise business platform launch in the U.S. on our result",3504,"Thank you, Marc, and good morning. Marc outlined how our actions in the quarter are in line with our transformation objectives. I want to focus my comments on 3 things: first, the impact of our enterprise business platform launch in the U.S. on our results in the quarter and forward; second, the specifics of the second quarter; and third, our outlook for the remainder of 2016. 
Let me begin with what we have been calling our ERP program but is actually a remake of our enterprise business platform, including IT systems, web capability and new product enablement. In fact, at the same time we went live with this new platform, we also brought online new web store capability, client self-service functionality and our new SaaS-based SendPro product, which leverages new subscription billing capability. The new platform we put in place was critical to us launching each of these items. 
As we look to the future, the long-term benefits of our new systems far outweigh the impact on results in the second quarter. In April, we launched the new enterprise business platform in the U.S. The U.S. represents 75% of our consolidated revenue, generates 90% of consolidated business segment EBIT and covers every one of our business models. As a result, we developed and implemented a robust cutover plan. The results from the second quarter reflect the temporary impacts of that transition. 
Our enterprise-based businesses, including Production Mail, Presort, Software and Cross-Border Ecommerce were not materially impacted by the transition. However, given the scale and run rate nature of selling to a large installed base in our SMB and shipping businesses, there were impacts to revenue and profit resulting from the transition. This manifested itself principally in 2 areas: first, in sales productivity, particularly inside sales and supply sales where selling days were lost to conversion, training and early productivity; and second, in financing-related fees as a result of proactive waivers to compensate for delayed billing associated with the system cutover and client acclimation to new billing formats. 
To give you some sense of the work needed to do this transformation, we had to take down multiple older legacy systems; do a phased ramp-up of new functionality; train across our sales, service, customer care and back-office teams; and then validate the new processes. All of these efforts had an impact on sales productivity. Our inside sales and supply sales groups initiate and make sales on the same day, often in a single call. So time off the phone is lost sales productivity. So while it's not our practice to provide comments on monthly activity, we felt it'd be instructive to provide insight in this case, given the unique circumstances related to the systems go live. 
The impact on our results from this change was most pronounced in the month of April. We began to see productivity improvements in May as teams adapted to new processes, but we were not yet at pre-go-live levels. By June, sales and supplies performance began to normalize closer in line with pre-go-live levels. Late June and early July results suggest a return to pre-go-live levels, and we will continue to drive further automation and process enhancements throughout the second half. 
It is our estimate when comparing monthly activity in the second quarter to pre-go-live activity levels in the first quarter of this year and second quarter of last year that total revenue was reduced in the second quarter by an estimated $15 million to $20 million or 2 percentage points related to our systems go-live activities. Based on the mix of revenue impacted, we estimate the EBIT margin impact to be about 100 basis points. Overall, earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, is estimated to have been negatively impacted by about $9 million to $12 million or an estimated $0.03 per share. Earnings results for the quarter also included cost of development and deployment of our business platform. 
While we continue to make refinements and enhancements to the system and have opportunities for further improvements in productivity, we believe material impacts to revenue related to the U.S. go live are behind us as we enter the second half of the year. We are pleased that with the cutover in both Canada and the U.S. we now have approximately 80% of our revenue and the vast majority of our profit for the company deployed on our new infrastructure. 
Turning to the quarter. We did see some improving trends in several parts of the business this quarter as compared to our first quarter results. But in addition to the impacts of our enterprise business platform, Software continued to underperform, as Marc mentioned. Within Global Ecommerce, our Cross-Border Ecommerce business grew organically at a double-digit rate over prior year and improved its EBIT margin from first quarter performance. The shipping solutions business was down year-over-year, in part as a result of the enterprise business platform cutover. International Mailing's revenue comparison continues to improve from prior trends. Production Mail saw an improvement in its revenue comparison and EBIT margin. Presort Services also continued to show revenue growth, though at a lower rate than the prior quarters. Our Software business continued to experience lower license sales year-over-year, as we take actions to improve our channel effectiveness. 
As Marc outlined, we are improving sales efficiency and are making good progress expanding indirect channels to improve our market access. As he noted, we added a total of 11 new and regional systems integrators. These actions will take time to be fully reflected in the results, but we've already increased our pipeline of deals during the second quarter. 
I also wanted to highlight that the work we have done thus far to invest in and change our business operating infrastructure continues to be balanced with our commitment to managing total return to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $66 million in shares of our common stock and continued to pay a competitive dividend. This brings our year-to-date total share repurchase to about $195 million or a little over 10 million shares. And at the end of the quarter, we have about $20 million remaining on our authorization of $150 million. 
Let me now take you through the high-level second quarter financial results, and then I'll provide details on each of the segment's results and provide an update on our 2016 guidance. Please note that a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the financial schedules appended to our earnings press release and earnings slides, which are posted on the pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
Turning to the results. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $836 million, which was a decline of 4% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and a decline of 5% on a reported basis. The revenue impact of the systems cutover reduced consolidated revenues by an estimated $15 million to $20 million or about 2 percentage points of growth. 
Revenue in our SMB segment group declined 7% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and declined 8% on a reported basis. Within SMB, North American Mailing's revenue comparison to prior year was adversely impacted by an estimated 5 percentage point due to the temporary business impact of the cutover to the new enterprise business platform in the U.S. 
Revenue in our Enterprise Business Solutions group grew 1% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and was flat on a reported basis. Digital Commerce Solutions revenue grew 12% on a constant currency basis and 11% on a reported basis. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.39. When compared to the prior year, our adjusted earnings per share results this quarter were impacted by the estimated $0.03 impact that I discussed earlier related to the disruption caused by the system integration cutover, $0.02 of incremental ERP expense and $0.02 of income recorded in the second quarter 2015 for our Imagitas business that was subsequently divested last May. 
GAAP earnings per share were $0.28, which included $0.09 in restructuring charges recorded in the quarter and $0.01 loss from discontinued operations. Free cash flow was $86 million, and we generated $95 million on a GAAP basis in cash from operations. Free cash flow was slightly favorable to prior year, as favorable working capital and lower capital expenditures were partly offset by lower net income. Free cash flow was also impacted by delayed billing and collections activity associated with the systems cutover. These impacts are expected to normalize in the second half of the year. 
During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We spent $66 million on the repurchase of our common stock, buying 3.5 million shares in the quarter. We also paid $35 million in dividends to our common shareholders. Additionally, we made $12 million in restructuring payments. The company also received $18 million of cash from investing activities related to the sale of a building in Troy, New York. 
Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, was $154 million this quarter, which was $26 million lower than the prior year as a result of the reduced revenue related to systems cutover as well as incremental ERP and R&D expenses, the sale of Imagitas and the Software revenue decline. Adjusted EBIT margin was 18.4%. 
Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA was $199 million for the quarter. SG&A for the quarter was $289 million, which was $17 million or 5% lower than the prior year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 34.5%, which was nearly flat to last year. SG&A declined in absolute terms year-to-year, primarily driven by lower employee-related costs. This quarter included incremental ERP and marketing expenses. Also, when compared to the prior year, current year SG&A includes a full quarter of amortization expense associated with the acquisition of Borderfree. 
In support of the savings objectives related to our enterprise business platform rollout, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $17 million at the end of the quarter for actions taken to improve operational efficiency and productivity across our business portfolio. In addition, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $8 million in the quarter. 
Also, R&D expense increased from prior year by $6 million as a result of bringing new solution like SendPro, SmartLink and the Commerce Cloud to market concurrent with our infrastructure rollout. In addition, investments in e-commerce R&D were up from prior year due to the integration of our technology platforms. 
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $34 million, which was a decline of about $5 million when compared to the prior year, which is the result of the actions we have taken to manage our debt portfolio. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were about $200 million higher than the prior year. 
The average interest rate this quarter was 4.46%, which was about 80 basis points lower than the prior year. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter was 35.7%, which was 320 basis points higher than the prior year's tax rate. This reflects increased tax attributable to a change in the mix of earnings. 
Now I'd like to discuss our second quarter results for each of our business segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we post to the pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
For SMB Solutions in North America Mailing, revenue was $322 million, and EBIT was $142 million. As I discussed earlier, we have estimated this quarter's revenue comparison to prior year was negatively impacted in the range of $15 million to $20 million or about 5% due to the revenue reduction related to the enterprise business platform implementation and its impact on equipment sales and recurring revenue streams. Of the estimated revenue reduction, the split is roughly 2/3 equipment sales and 1/3 for the recurring revenue streams. 
I should note these temporary impacts related to the system cutover in the quarter are not ongoing changes in the end market. Therefore, on a reported basis, equipment sales and recurring revenue streams declined from prior years at a greater rate versus prior quarter trends. 
EBIT margin was 44.2%, which was 50 basis points lower than prior year, mostly the result of the lower revenue. In International Mailing, revenue was $106 million, and EBIT was $13 million. The segment's year-over-year revenue performance continues to improve. Equipment sales grew from prior year, most notably in France, Italy and Japan, in part due to improved sales productivity from the go-to-market changes, especially in France. 
The decline in recurring revenue streams was also the lowest we saw in 7 quarters. Overall, constant currency revenue adjusted for market exits was flat to the prior year. EBIT margin was 12%, which was 80 basis points lower from prior year, primarily due to the equipment sales mix of business. 
Turning to Enterprise Business Solutions. Our overall segment group's revenue was flat on a reported basis and grew 1.5% when adjusting for Production Mail market exits, which is in line with our long-term outlook for the segment. In Production Mail, revenue was $96 million, and EBIT was $13 million. Equipment sales grew over prior year due to higher sorter equipment installations. Support services and supplies revenue declined in part as a result of some in-house mailers shifting their mail processing to third-party outsourcers and the recent market exits. 
EBIT margin was 13.5%, which was an improvement of 320 basis points from prior year and mostly driven by service delivery cost management initiatives. In Presort Services, revenue was $116 million, and EBIT was $21 million. Revenue benefited from the higher volume of first-class mail processed as well as expansion into the St. Louis, Chicago and Portland markets but was partly offset by lower volumes of Standard Mail process. EBIT margin was 18.3%, which was a decline of about 240 basis points versus prior year, primarily as a result of the USPS rate change and increased labor costs. 
For Digital Commerce Solutions, in Software Solutions, revenue was $90 million, and EBIT was $10 million. Revenue declined from prior year due to lower licensing revenues and lower data-related revenue. As Marc outlined and I noted earlier, we are actively signing up new systems integrators and reseller partners as part of our continued focus on expanding the indirect channel and improving sales efficiency to improve the pipeline of deals. 
EBIT margin was 11.2%, which was a decline of 510 basis points versus prior year, mostly due to the lower licensing revenue, which has a high margin. We are taking actions to further improve our Software margins. 
In Global Ecommerce, revenue was $105 million, and EBIT was $4 million. Results this quarter included a full quarter of Borderfree revenue as compared to 1 month of revenue in the prior year. Revenue benefited from strong growth in the U.K. marketplace business and the launch of new retail storefronts. Outbound U.S. marketplace package shipments grew in the quarter despite the stronger U.S. dollar versus prior year. 
When adding pre-acquisition Borderfree revenue back to the prior year, for comparative purposes, organic growth in our cross-border business was 11%. This compares favorably with the first quarter, which was slightly down from prior year. 
The improved second quarter performance is due to the growth in outbound volumes in both the U.K. and the U.S. Shipping revenue declined from prior year, in part as a result of the enterprise business platform cutover and lower license sales. EBIT margin was 3.5%, which was a slight decline of 40 basis points versus the prior year. This was due to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, investments for growth in the business and a lower mix of our higher-margin domestic shipping business, which more than offset synergy savings. This business remains on track to achieve its synergy run rate objective by year-end. 
One thing of note I'd like to also address is the impact of Brexit on our Global Ecommerce business. Due to the vote passing late in June, we did not see any material impact on our results in the second quarter. It is still early days and difficult to determine the longer-term impact to the business. However, in the short term, the weakened British pound has created additional opportunity for our U.K. outbound business but has an opposite impact for U.S. goods into the U.K., as the goods have now become more expensive. We'll continue to monitor this situation. 
Early July results suggest that the U.K. outbound growth is being more than offset by the decline in U.S. outbound to the U.K. Over time, expansion and globalization of our Cross-Border Ecommerce business will create natural hedges that should moderate the impacts of currency movements. 
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter. Now I'd like to discuss our updated annual guidance and provide some insights for the second half of 2016. Based on year-to-date results, particularly in Software along with the second quarter temporary impact in North America Mailing as a result of the new enterprise business platform cutover, the company is adjusting its annual guidance. We will take the added step this onetime to provide further details on both our second half and full year guidance. 
For the full year 2016, we now expect revenue on a constant currency basis to be in the range of a 1% decline to 3% decline when compared to 2015; adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.82, which excludes the year-to-date charge of $0.13 related to restructuring, asset impairment, dispositions expense and discontinued operations; free cash flow to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. We are also narrowing the range of our annual tax rate on adjusted earnings and now expect it to be in the range of 33% to 35%. 
For the second half of the year, we expect constant currency revenue to be in the range of 2% growth to 2% decline compared to the constant currency decline of 4% experienced in the first half of the year. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.10 and free cash flow to be in the range of $254 million to $304 million. 
To achieve improvement in the second half as compared to the first half of the year, we expect the North America Mailing business to return to a more normalized level as we progress throughout the second half. Our Enterprise Solutions Group is expected to perform similar to the first half. 
And Digital Commerce Solutions performance levels, subject to no material changes in key currency valuations or any new material impacts from the Brexit decision or Canada Post labor negotiations, are expected to improve from the first half performance levels. We expect Software license revenue growth to improve as a result of the progress we are making in channel efficiency and channel partner engagement. 
For Global Ecommerce, we expect constant currency revenue in the second half to grow double digits post the anniversary of the Borderfree acquisition. This will be driven by continued transaction volume growth as well as the acquisition of new and expansion of existing retail clients. Adjusted earnings per share in the second half, when compared to the first half, will benefit from the expected revenue improvements, reduced marketing and ERP spend and, particularly in the fourth quarter, the early benefits from the infrastructure cost savings. Free cash flow in the second half as compared to the first half will benefit from the recovery of delayed billing and collections activity related to the systems cutover. 
I would also like to provide an update on our overall ERP project. With the U.S. launch, we now have the majority of our revenue, profit and transactional activity on our new platform. In the second half of 2016, in North America, we will focus on optimization of the platform, driving revenue from our new Commerce Cloud solutions enabled by the platform and delivering the savings opportunity related to the program. 
In addition, we've begun the implementation, planning and integration for our international rollout in 2017. We are still on track to achieve the targeted levels of expense and benefits in 2016. 
To date in 2016, we have expensed about $20 million and have recognized some early benefits. We expect some benefits to come in during the third quarter but the majority to materialize in the fourth quarter. 
Additionally, we will spend incremental CapEx in 2016 related to the ERP program to enhance automation of manual processes, increase web capabilities for client self-service and add new functionality. This added capital is not expected to increase the company's overall CapEx spending for the year due to lower spending in other areas. We will provide a more detailed update on the overall program performance and benefit realization at our Analyst Day later this year. 
That concludes my remarks. Operator, please open the line for questions."

So we've gone from basically flat to a little bit positive in the first quarter in that business. We think the leverage and the growth and the volumes is ultimately what drives the margin. We still have some synergies left to go through the balance of the year to get. So we see margin upside. The 15% margin is a long-term objective for the Digital Commerce Solutions business.

And so if you think about the way our balance sheet's evolving, finance receivables as the Mailing business stabilizes, should stabilize more, that's one of the drivers of free cash flow coming down over the last few years. We have less inventory dependency on the businesses that grow. The cash cycles for those businesses are shorter. So we should see a fairly stable contribution of working capital and other balance sheet-driven items, and the big variable will be earnings growth."

Mike will take you through the specifics of the quarter. As has been the case for the last several years, there were a lot of moving parts to the quarter. From my perspective, the",1289,"Good morning, and thank you for joining our second quarter earnings call. Mike will take you through the specifics of the quarter. As has been the case for the last several years, there were a lot of moving parts to the quarter. 
From my perspective, there were 4 themes. Let me discuss each of them. First, our e-commerce business continued to gain momentum, and the business is positioned for a strong second half. We continue to add new clients and new geographies. I'll come back to this in a moment. However, this business is well positioned in a rapidly growing market. 
Second, in our Software business, we still have work to do. In previous communications, I have pointed to the importance of building channel partnerships with systems integrators and other technology companies, and we did make substantial progress on that score in the second quarter. We signed with 11 systems integrators, 2 global and 9 regional. 
Let me give you an example of a relationship with a global systems integrator. In June, we joined forces with Accenture Digital, a world-class leader in digital customer experience. Pitney Bowes EngageOne Video solution will be offered to Accenture Digital clients who are in the midst of their digital transformation strategy. Clients across verticals and public service industries can deploy EngageOne Video to boost customer loyalty, improve new customer on-boarding process, spur content development and scale video production. The scale that a partner like Accenture brings to Pitney Bowes gives us an opportunity for meaningful progress. 
On a related point, according to the second quarter Forrester Wave communications management report and I quote, ""Video support through Pitney Bowes interactive and personalized EngageOne Video solution is best in class."" 
Also in June, we entered into an OEM agreement with IBM. This agreement helps strengthen our position as a Location Intelligence supplier to a market leader in business intelligence and analytics markets. These relationships and accolades are important for 2 reasons: first, they confirm that we have good products; second, getting good products to market requires the right channels. All these partners are best in class in their respective markets, and I'm confident they'll be important partners in bringing our products to market. 
Let me lay out how I see the Software business moving forward. You should see improved license performance as the first step in this business improvement, and we are starting the second half with a much-improved pipeline. That will lead to improvements in subsequent quarters and their related streams. As I mentioned in the last quarter, I expect this business to improve throughout the course of the year. While overall business investment in technology is soft, I still believe we can turn in better performance. 
Third, as we discussed on our last call, we deployed our new enterprise business platform in April in the United States. Although we often call this an ERP project, that really does not do justice to the scale of this initiative. The platform affects every aspect of our business, including how sales opportunities are managed, products are configured, leases and bills calculated, financials produced, customer service delivered and client satisfaction managed. It is a substantial business process and technology reengineering project and now extends to approximately 80% of our revenue base. 
It is already producing benefits to our business and will deliver substantial benefits to our business over time. It is worth noting that some of the significant products announcements we had made in the last 90 days have been enabled by our new business platform. 
All that said, the implementation of this platform caused some short-term interruptions to our business, particularly in the high-volume portion of our meter business in April. Mike will elaborate on this more in his comments, but here's the bottom line. The platform now covers the preponderance of our business, and the business case is still intact. In some cases, we can already see that the business benefits will be beyond what we had originally contemplated. 
Fourth, and most importantly, we have been focused from the beginning on creating long-term shareholder value. I said to my team this last April that I believe the second quarter of 2016 will be one of the most pivotal quarters in our company's history in our transformation efforts to establish those fundamentals that enable long-term success. Let me explain what I mean based on our strategic pillars: the reinvention of mail, operational excellence and growth of our Digital Commerce business. 
We made substantial progress in the reinvention of our mail business during the second quarter. A big part of this, as you all know, was the launch of the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud in April. The response from clients has been very encouraging. We've already attracted more than 1 million unique visitors to the Commerce Cloud portal. The number of clients using the web to purchase supplies has increased by 25%, and we are seeing incremental demand for our shipping products, particularly our SendPro solution and our APIs. 
API is providing new opportunity to monetize our Software assets, as developers and ISVs embed our capabilities in their products. While it will take time for demand to drive recurring revenue streams in these new areas, this initiative is integral to create new value for the small and medium business market and all of our existing clients. 
Last month, we announced SmartLink, a digital technology solution that connects our existing installed base of postage meters to the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud to streamline the client experience, enable services from the Commerce Cloud. We will continue to innovate in this area. 
Next, operational excellence. In one of my very early earnings calls as a CEO, I said that I thought CEOs are sometimes guilty of blaming execution without looking more deeply at root causes. Things like do you have the right channels, the right skills? Is the brand positioned correctly? Do you have the right systems to enable execution? Over the last 3 years, we have slowly, sometimes more slowly than I wanted, but methodically addressed these items. I also said over time you will see the benefits of these endeavors in the income statement and balance sheet. I still believe that. The benefits never come fast enough, but there's no doubt in my mind that investing in channels, brands, systems, products and our people is the best way for us to build long-term shareholder value. 
Finally, growing Digital Commerce. We've already covered Software, so I won't rehash it beyond saying that while we still need to improve, we can deliver results, and we've made real progress in the second quarter building channels and pipeline for the second half. 
In our e-commerce business, we added 15 new retail storefronts in the second quarter, bringing our total to almost 240 worldwide. Last week, we added an additional 5 stores and announced that we were adding outbound capabilities in Australia to our existing outbound businesses in the United States and U.K. In addition to growing our existing relationships, these new storefronts have positioned this business for sustainable growth going forward. 
One opportunity that has become particularly hot is helping U.S. and U.K. retailers sell into Asia, particularly China. Over the last several months, I've had the opportunity to visit potential clients in India and China, and demand for our cross-brand capabilities is one of the most impressive things I've ever seen. 
Bottom line, while I thought we had the opportunity to do better in the second quarter, we cannot be more pleased with the progress we've made on our strategic agenda, and we have set ourselves up for improved second half. 
I will make a few final remarks after Mike, but at this point, let me turn the call to Mike."

Marc outlined how our actions in the quarter are in line with our transformation objectives. I want to focus my comments on 3 things: first, the impact of our enterprise business platform launch in the U.S. on our result",3504,"Thank you, Marc, and good morning. Marc outlined how our actions in the quarter are in line with our transformation objectives. I want to focus my comments on 3 things: first, the impact of our enterprise business platform launch in the U.S. on our results in the quarter and forward; second, the specifics of the second quarter; and third, our outlook for the remainder of 2016. 
Let me begin with what we have been calling our ERP program but is actually a remake of our enterprise business platform, including IT systems, web capability and new product enablement. In fact, at the same time we went live with this new platform, we also brought online new web store capability, client self-service functionality and our new SaaS-based SendPro product, which leverages new subscription billing capability. The new platform we put in place was critical to us launching each of these items. 
As we look to the future, the long-term benefits of our new systems far outweigh the impact on results in the second quarter. In April, we launched the new enterprise business platform in the U.S. The U.S. represents 75% of our consolidated revenue, generates 90% of consolidated business segment EBIT and covers every one of our business models. As a result, we developed and implemented a robust cutover plan. The results from the second quarter reflect the temporary impacts of that transition. 
Our enterprise-based businesses, including Production Mail, Presort, Software and Cross-Border Ecommerce were not materially impacted by the transition. However, given the scale and run rate nature of selling to a large installed base in our SMB and shipping businesses, there were impacts to revenue and profit resulting from the transition. This manifested itself principally in 2 areas: first, in sales productivity, particularly inside sales and supply sales where selling days were lost to conversion, training and early productivity; and second, in financing-related fees as a result of proactive waivers to compensate for delayed billing associated with the system cutover and client acclimation to new billing formats. 
To give you some sense of the work needed to do this transformation, we had to take down multiple older legacy systems; do a phased ramp-up of new functionality; train across our sales, service, customer care and back-office teams; and then validate the new processes. All of these efforts had an impact on sales productivity. Our inside sales and supply sales groups initiate and make sales on the same day, often in a single call. So time off the phone is lost sales productivity. So while it's not our practice to provide comments on monthly activity, we felt it'd be instructive to provide insight in this case, given the unique circumstances related to the systems go live. 
The impact on our results from this change was most pronounced in the month of April. We began to see productivity improvements in May as teams adapted to new processes, but we were not yet at pre-go-live levels. By June, sales and supplies performance began to normalize closer in line with pre-go-live levels. Late June and early July results suggest a return to pre-go-live levels, and we will continue to drive further automation and process enhancements throughout the second half. 
It is our estimate when comparing monthly activity in the second quarter to pre-go-live activity levels in the first quarter of this year and second quarter of last year that total revenue was reduced in the second quarter by an estimated $15 million to $20 million or 2 percentage points related to our systems go-live activities. Based on the mix of revenue impacted, we estimate the EBIT margin impact to be about 100 basis points. Overall, earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, is estimated to have been negatively impacted by about $9 million to $12 million or an estimated $0.03 per share. Earnings results for the quarter also included cost of development and deployment of our business platform. 
While we continue to make refinements and enhancements to the system and have opportunities for further improvements in productivity, we believe material impacts to revenue related to the U.S. go live are behind us as we enter the second half of the year. We are pleased that with the cutover in both Canada and the U.S. we now have approximately 80% of our revenue and the vast majority of our profit for the company deployed on our new infrastructure. 
Turning to the quarter. We did see some improving trends in several parts of the business this quarter as compared to our first quarter results. But in addition to the impacts of our enterprise business platform, Software continued to underperform, as Marc mentioned. Within Global Ecommerce, our Cross-Border Ecommerce business grew organically at a double-digit rate over prior year and improved its EBIT margin from first quarter performance. The shipping solutions business was down year-over-year, in part as a result of the enterprise business platform cutover. International Mailing's revenue comparison continues to improve from prior trends. Production Mail saw an improvement in its revenue comparison and EBIT margin. Presort Services also continued to show revenue growth, though at a lower rate than the prior quarters. Our Software business continued to experience lower license sales year-over-year, as we take actions to improve our channel effectiveness. 
As Marc outlined, we are improving sales efficiency and are making good progress expanding indirect channels to improve our market access. As he noted, we added a total of 11 new and regional systems integrators. These actions will take time to be fully reflected in the results, but we've already increased our pipeline of deals during the second quarter. 
I also wanted to highlight that the work we have done thus far to invest in and change our business operating infrastructure continues to be balanced with our commitment to managing total return to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $66 million in shares of our common stock and continued to pay a competitive dividend. This brings our year-to-date total share repurchase to about $195 million or a little over 10 million shares. And at the end of the quarter, we have about $20 million remaining on our authorization of $150 million. 
Let me now take you through the high-level second quarter financial results, and then I'll provide details on each of the segment's results and provide an update on our 2016 guidance. Please note that a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the financial schedules appended to our earnings press release and earnings slides, which are posted on the pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
Turning to the results. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $836 million, which was a decline of 4% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and a decline of 5% on a reported basis. The revenue impact of the systems cutover reduced consolidated revenues by an estimated $15 million to $20 million or about 2 percentage points of growth. 
Revenue in our SMB segment group declined 7% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and declined 8% on a reported basis. Within SMB, North American Mailing's revenue comparison to prior year was adversely impacted by an estimated 5 percentage point due to the temporary business impact of the cutover to the new enterprise business platform in the U.S. 
Revenue in our Enterprise Business Solutions group grew 1% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and was flat on a reported basis. Digital Commerce Solutions revenue grew 12% on a constant currency basis and 11% on a reported basis. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.39. When compared to the prior year, our adjusted earnings per share results this quarter were impacted by the estimated $0.03 impact that I discussed earlier related to the disruption caused by the system integration cutover, $0.02 of incremental ERP expense and $0.02 of income recorded in the second quarter 2015 for our Imagitas business that was subsequently divested last May. 
GAAP earnings per share were $0.28, which included $0.09 in restructuring charges recorded in the quarter and $0.01 loss from discontinued operations. Free cash flow was $86 million, and we generated $95 million on a GAAP basis in cash from operations. Free cash flow was slightly favorable to prior year, as favorable working capital and lower capital expenditures were partly offset by lower net income. Free cash flow was also impacted by delayed billing and collections activity associated with the systems cutover. These impacts are expected to normalize in the second half of the year. 
During the quarter, we returned cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. We spent $66 million on the repurchase of our common stock, buying 3.5 million shares in the quarter. We also paid $35 million in dividends to our common shareholders. Additionally, we made $12 million in restructuring payments. The company also received $18 million of cash from investing activities related to the sale of a building in Troy, New York. 
Turning to the income statement. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, was $154 million this quarter, which was $26 million lower than the prior year as a result of the reduced revenue related to systems cutover as well as incremental ERP and R&D expenses, the sale of Imagitas and the Software revenue decline. Adjusted EBIT margin was 18.4%. 
Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA was $199 million for the quarter. SG&A for the quarter was $289 million, which was $17 million or 5% lower than the prior year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 34.5%, which was nearly flat to last year. SG&A declined in absolute terms year-to-year, primarily driven by lower employee-related costs. This quarter included incremental ERP and marketing expenses. Also, when compared to the prior year, current year SG&A includes a full quarter of amortization expense associated with the acquisition of Borderfree. 
In support of the savings objectives related to our enterprise business platform rollout, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $17 million at the end of the quarter for actions taken to improve operational efficiency and productivity across our business portfolio. In addition, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $8 million in the quarter. 
Also, R&D expense increased from prior year by $6 million as a result of bringing new solution like SendPro, SmartLink and the Commerce Cloud to market concurrent with our infrastructure rollout. In addition, investments in e-commerce R&D were up from prior year due to the integration of our technology platforms. 
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $34 million, which was a decline of about $5 million when compared to the prior year, which is the result of the actions we have taken to manage our debt portfolio. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were about $200 million higher than the prior year. 
The average interest rate this quarter was 4.46%, which was about 80 basis points lower than the prior year. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter was 35.7%, which was 320 basis points higher than the prior year's tax rate. This reflects increased tax attributable to a change in the mix of earnings. 
Now I'd like to discuss our second quarter results for each of our business segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we post to the pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
For SMB Solutions in North America Mailing, revenue was $322 million, and EBIT was $142 million. As I discussed earlier, we have estimated this quarter's revenue comparison to prior year was negatively impacted in the range of $15 million to $20 million or about 5% due to the revenue reduction related to the enterprise business platform implementation and its impact on equipment sales and recurring revenue streams. Of the estimated revenue reduction, the split is roughly 2/3 equipment sales and 1/3 for the recurring revenue streams. 
I should note these temporary impacts related to the system cutover in the quarter are not ongoing changes in the end market. Therefore, on a reported basis, equipment sales and recurring revenue streams declined from prior years at a greater rate versus prior quarter trends. 
EBIT margin was 44.2%, which was 50 basis points lower than prior year, mostly the result of the lower revenue. In International Mailing, revenue was $106 million, and EBIT was $13 million. The segment's year-over-year revenue performance continues to improve. Equipment sales grew from prior year, most notably in France, Italy and Japan, in part due to improved sales productivity from the go-to-market changes, especially in France. 
The decline in recurring revenue streams was also the lowest we saw in 7 quarters. Overall, constant currency revenue adjusted for market exits was flat to the prior year. EBIT margin was 12%, which was 80 basis points lower from prior year, primarily due to the equipment sales mix of business. 
Turning to Enterprise Business Solutions. Our overall segment group's revenue was flat on a reported basis and grew 1.5% when adjusting for Production Mail market exits, which is in line with our long-term outlook for the segment. In Production Mail, revenue was $96 million, and EBIT was $13 million. Equipment sales grew over prior year due to higher sorter equipment installations. Support services and supplies revenue declined in part as a result of some in-house mailers shifting their mail processing to third-party outsourcers and the recent market exits. 
EBIT margin was 13.5%, which was an improvement of 320 basis points from prior year and mostly driven by service delivery cost management initiatives. In Presort Services, revenue was $116 million, and EBIT was $21 million. Revenue benefited from the higher volume of first-class mail processed as well as expansion into the St. Louis, Chicago and Portland markets but was partly offset by lower volumes of Standard Mail process. EBIT margin was 18.3%, which was a decline of about 240 basis points versus prior year, primarily as a result of the USPS rate change and increased labor costs. 
For Digital Commerce Solutions, in Software Solutions, revenue was $90 million, and EBIT was $10 million. Revenue declined from prior year due to lower licensing revenues and lower data-related revenue. As Marc outlined and I noted earlier, we are actively signing up new systems integrators and reseller partners as part of our continued focus on expanding the indirect channel and improving sales efficiency to improve the pipeline of deals. 
EBIT margin was 11.2%, which was a decline of 510 basis points versus prior year, mostly due to the lower licensing revenue, which has a high margin. We are taking actions to further improve our Software margins. 
In Global Ecommerce, revenue was $105 million, and EBIT was $4 million. Results this quarter included a full quarter of Borderfree revenue as compared to 1 month of revenue in the prior year. Revenue benefited from strong growth in the U.K. marketplace business and the launch of new retail storefronts. Outbound U.S. marketplace package shipments grew in the quarter despite the stronger U.S. dollar versus prior year. 
When adding pre-acquisition Borderfree revenue back to the prior year, for comparative purposes, organic growth in our cross-border business was 11%. This compares favorably with the first quarter, which was slightly down from prior year. 
The improved second quarter performance is due to the growth in outbound volumes in both the U.K. and the U.S. Shipping revenue declined from prior year, in part as a result of the enterprise business platform cutover and lower license sales. EBIT margin was 3.5%, which was a slight decline of 40 basis points versus the prior year. This was due to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, investments for growth in the business and a lower mix of our higher-margin domestic shipping business, which more than offset synergy savings. This business remains on track to achieve its synergy run rate objective by year-end. 
One thing of note I'd like to also address is the impact of Brexit on our Global Ecommerce business. Due to the vote passing late in June, we did not see any material impact on our results in the second quarter. It is still early days and difficult to determine the longer-term impact to the business. However, in the short term, the weakened British pound has created additional opportunity for our U.K. outbound business but has an opposite impact for U.S. goods into the U.K., as the goods have now become more expensive. We'll continue to monitor this situation. 
Early July results suggest that the U.K. outbound growth is being more than offset by the decline in U.S. outbound to the U.K. Over time, expansion and globalization of our Cross-Border Ecommerce business will create natural hedges that should moderate the impacts of currency movements. 
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter. Now I'd like to discuss our updated annual guidance and provide some insights for the second half of 2016. Based on year-to-date results, particularly in Software along with the second quarter temporary impact in North America Mailing as a result of the new enterprise business platform cutover, the company is adjusting its annual guidance. We will take the added step this onetime to provide further details on both our second half and full year guidance. 
For the full year 2016, we now expect revenue on a constant currency basis to be in the range of a 1% decline to 3% decline when compared to 2015; adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.75 to $1.82, which excludes the year-to-date charge of $0.13 related to restructuring, asset impairment, dispositions expense and discontinued operations; free cash flow to be in the range of $400 million to $450 million. We are also narrowing the range of our annual tax rate on adjusted earnings and now expect it to be in the range of 33% to 35%. 
For the second half of the year, we expect constant currency revenue to be in the range of 2% growth to 2% decline compared to the constant currency decline of 4% experienced in the first half of the year. We expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.03 to $1.10 and free cash flow to be in the range of $254 million to $304 million. 
To achieve improvement in the second half as compared to the first half of the year, we expect the North America Mailing business to return to a more normalized level as we progress throughout the second half. Our Enterprise Solutions Group is expected to perform similar to the first half. 
And Digital Commerce Solutions performance levels, subject to no material changes in key currency valuations or any new material impacts from the Brexit decision or Canada Post labor negotiations, are expected to improve from the first half performance levels. We expect Software license revenue growth to improve as a result of the progress we are making in channel efficiency and channel partner engagement. 
For Global Ecommerce, we expect constant currency revenue in the second half to grow double digits post the anniversary of the Borderfree acquisition. This will be driven by continued transaction volume growth as well as the acquisition of new and expansion of existing retail clients. Adjusted earnings per share in the second half, when compared to the first half, will benefit from the expected revenue improvements, reduced marketing and ERP spend and, particularly in the fourth quarter, the early benefits from the infrastructure cost savings. Free cash flow in the second half as compared to the first half will benefit from the recovery of delayed billing and collections activity related to the systems cutover. 
I would also like to provide an update on our overall ERP project. With the U.S. launch, we now have the majority of our revenue, profit and transactional activity on our new platform. In the second half of 2016, in North America, we will focus on optimization of the platform, driving revenue from our new Commerce Cloud solutions enabled by the platform and delivering the savings opportunity related to the program. 
In addition, we've begun the implementation, planning and integration for our international rollout in 2017. We are still on track to achieve the targeted levels of expense and benefits in 2016. 
To date in 2016, we have expensed about $20 million and have recognized some early benefits. We expect some benefits to come in during the third quarter but the majority to materialize in the fourth quarter. 
Additionally, we will spend incremental CapEx in 2016 related to the ERP program to enhance automation of manual processes, increase web capabilities for client self-service and add new functionality. This added capital is not expected to increase the company's overall CapEx spending for the year due to lower spending in other areas. We will provide a more detailed update on the overall program performance and benefit realization at our Analyst Day later this year. 
That concludes my remarks. Operator, please open the line for questions."

So we've seen that improve in terms of growth in outbound volumes from both markets. So we feel good about the direction of that now that we have a better currency comparison."

So we've gone from basically flat to a little bit positive in the first quarter in that business. We think the leverage and the growth and the volumes is ultimately what drives the margin. We still have some synergies left to go through the balance of the year to get. So we see margin upside. The 15% margin is a long-term objective for the Digital Commerce Solutions business. I would say we're where we expect to be with the acquisition in terms of sort of the rate and pace of achieving the synergies as well as beginning to see the growth in the volume in the business."

Australia is one of the top 10 markets but, obviously, smaller than the U.S. and U.K. As we've seen",225,"So in terms of Australia, when you think about the largest outbound markets, obviously, the U.S. and U.K. are either the largest or top 5 types of markets. Australia is one of the top 10 markets but, obviously, smaller than the U.S. and U.K. As we've seen in both the U.S. and U.K., there's a ramping process that takes some time to roll itself out. And once you get the first few retailers out there, then we look to add around that. We've been very pleased with the ramp up of the U.K., and so we'll expect over time Australia to grow. I don't expect it to be a huge contributor in the second half of the year but certainly begin to lay the groundwork for some sustainable revenue over time. In terms of expansions into other markets, I think, as Marc mentioned, we're obviously going to go where our partners and all see opportunity and want us to go where we think we can create a reasonable footprint and a profitable business. But we're going to balance that with the opportunities to really optimize the outbound opportunity around the world. I'd add that both in the U.K. and the U.S. we've expanded the number of countries we're outbound to. In the U.K., it's now over 80 markets. In the U.S., it's over 100 markets."

I'd like to build off of Allen's question because I think it's an opportune segue. To a degree, for the last several years, I feel like we've been slogging uphill between market exits, channel shifts, the deployment of new systems, and you're all very familiar with the list. With the deployment of our business platform in the United States, I feel like we've got some clear water in front of us and we're anxious to take advantage of that. So from my perspective, we'll make a judgment about when we roll out the rest of the business platform, but my priority is moving towards having some clear water so we can begin to yield on the investments that we've made. So I'm not particularly pleased with our results financially in the first half. That being said, if you look at this transformation in the context that I always have, and that is what we are doing to improve the long-term ability of this business to create value, I couldn't be more pleased. So that's kind of where we are. As we move into the second half, I believe we're poised to begin to yield on some of the investments that we've made over the last quarters, the last several years, whether it be the investments in the brand, investments in our systems, investments in our channels, and we're anxious to take advantage of that.

While we continue to make",1284,"Good morning. Thank you for joining our third quarter conference call. Similar to last quarter, there were several moving parts and puts and takes during the third quarter that affected our performance and our financial results. While we continue to make progress against our strategic initiatives to unlock value and transform our company, we have more work to do. That said, we are confident that the actions we have put in place this year will continue to yield improved results in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017.
On the positive side of the ledger, our new enterprise business platform, which was deployed in the second quarter, continues to provide operational benefits. Our new products and solutions introduced in the second and third quarter and tied to the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud are resonating well with our clients and gaining traction. And our go-to-market strategy is yielding solid results.
Turning to the third quarter results. Global Ecommerce posted another strong performance and our Production Mail business grew and delivered impressive equipment sales results. Overall, equipment sales grew 6% this quarter. While we continue to make progress building out our partner channel in our software business, license revenue in the third quarter fell short of our expectations. Clearly, we are not satisfied with our software performance and have taken a number of actions around improving our sales channel efforts and continuing to focus on growing the pipeline for license revenue deals. We are making progress, but there's much more to do. In our Small and Medium Business, equipment sales rebounded after the initial deployment of our enterprise business platform in the second quarter. While there are some lingering issues, we continue to enhance the platform and expect to see improvements in the end of the year and into the first half of 2017.
Now let me update you on the progress we are making on our strategic initiatives: the reinvention of our mail business, operational excellence and growing our Digital Commerce business by leveraging our client base. First, reinvention of our mail business. We introduced the notion of reinventing our mail business back in September of 2015. We understand that today's SMB clients require the reliability, security and predictability of our traditional mailing systems as well as the need to simplify the increasing volumes of shipping parcels. But we also know that clients want the ease of use and rich features that our digital capabilities provide. 
For Pitney Bowes, reinventing mail is all about combining the strength of both physical mail and shipping with our digital capabilities to deliver more value for our Small and Medium Business clients. In the past 6 months, we have doubled down our efforts to deliver new and innovative products that leverage our considerable digital capabilities. We have delivered the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud; added new online web store capabilities, making it easier for clients to do business with us; provided clients with video capability through our EngageOne solutions; developed shipping APIs that provide new ways to monetize our software assets; and introduced into the market several Software as a Service-based products and solutions, including SendPro and SmartLink. 
In fact, we have more than 15,000 clients enrolled to use our SendPro solutions and we have shipped over 25,000 SmartLink devices since they were first introduced. In early October, we announced SendPro 300, an example of what we mean when we talk about reinventing our mail. The SendPro 300 streamlines multi-carrier office shipping and mailing for SMBs, allowing clients to manage their mail and shipping with USPS, FedEx and UPS while reducing costs. When connected to the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud, the SendPro 300 links business and shipping vendors with analytics and APIs and provides automatic postal updates, low ink alerts, service warnings and diagnostic notifications.
Next, operational excellence. Driving operational excellence in our business remains a significant ongoing focus for our company each and every day. A critical component for driving operational excellence is our new enterprise business platform, which was deployed in the U.S. in the second quarter. While we have not yet realized the full operational benefits from the platform, we know what needs our focus and attention and expect to see increasing improvements in the platform and the benefits through the remainder of the year and throughout 2017. 
As a reminder, this is not just an ERP implementation. The new platform touches every part of our business, including how sales opportunities are managed, products are configured, enabled and tracked, financials produced, customer service delivered and client satisfaction managed. As I mentioned last quarter, and it's worth repeating, our new enterprise platform is an essential component to our overall transformation. The substantial long-term benefits we derive from this platform outweigh any short-term challenges that we may face. In the third quarter, SG&A improved 3%. In terms of servicing our debt, we issued $600 million of 5-year notes. The transaction was oversubscribed, which is an indication of the continued interest and confidence by the capital markets in our transformation story.
Finally, growing our Digital Commerce business by leveraging our client base. Global Ecommerce business continued to perform very well, growing its retail and marketplace organic revenue 17%, excluding the impact of currency. During the quarter, we continued to add new storefronts, including Soludos, Evolue and The New York Times Store. Additionally, our Global Ecommerce segment had an 11% EBITDA margin this quarter, driven by revenue growth and synergy savings. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that demand for our cross-border capabilities is one of the most impressive things I have seen. To that end, in the quarter, we announced that we expanded our business in Australia to provide Global Ecommerce solutions to retailers looking to sell their goods across international borders. With the Pitney Bowes' Borderfree retail solution, Australian retailers will reach consumers in 220 countries and territories. Since launch, we have brought 3 Australian retailers on to our platform and signed more than 10 storefronts. 
We are also working on expanding opportunities for our U.S. retailers in key consumer markets, like China and India. For example, eBay has recently announced that Pitney Bowes is helping them launch their products on Tmall in China. We are in the early stages but are pleased about this opportunity. Also during the quarter, we announced that our shipping APIs for USPS postage are now part of the multichannel order platform offered by Ordoro, a multichannel e-commerce order and management solutions provider.
Now let me briefly discuss our software business. As I mentioned earlier, license revenue in our software business was disappointing. However, during the quarter, we signed a number of new partners, including Regional System Integrators and Location Intelligence partners. The response from our partners, Regional System Integrators and Global System Integrators, has been very positive and we're encouraged by the progress we are making attracting world-class partners to help sell our products and solutions. Importantly, more than 200 partner sales and technical resources have been trained so far. And we are now shifting our focus from recruitment of partners to enablement and pipeline building to drive the sales results we are looking for. We are making good progress in all areas and expect revenue from partners to be a strong contributor in 2017.
As I said at the outset of my prepared remarks, there are a lot of puts and takes during the third quarter. But I like where we are in this phase of our transformation. And I am confident that the actions we have put in place this year will continue to yield improved results in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017.
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike, who will take you through our third quarter results. Mike?"

As Marc discussed, we continue to make progress against our long-term strategy and achieve some additional milestones during the quarter. But we recognize that we have more work to do. Let me provide an overview of the quarter",2343,"Thank you, and good morning. As Marc discussed, we continue to make progress against our long-term strategy and achieve some additional milestones during the quarter. But we recognize that we have more work to do. Let me provide an overview of the quarter and drill down into some of the details. I'll then give an update on our expectation for the remainder of the year. 
For the third quarter, there are some significant highlights worth noting. Ecommerce marketplace and retail grew revenue organically 17%, excluding the impacts of currency this quarter. As a reminder, this is the first quarter of reporting Borderfree fully in both periods and now represents a clean comparison. This cross-border revenue growth is particularly encouraging because it reflects both a stronger U.S. dollar versus the prior year as well as some temporary disruption on demand for parcel shipments from the U.S. to Canada prior to the resolution of the Canada Post labor dispute. 
Additionally, our Global Ecommerce segment had an 11% EBITDA margin this quarter, driven by revenue growth in synergy savings from the Borderfree integration. The Enterprise Business Solutions Group in total continues to perform within the long-term market rates for both revenue and EBIT margin. Production Mail grew revenue this quarter by 5%, driven by 27% growth in equipment sales. Excluding the impact of currency and market exits, revenue grew 11% in Production Mail. As we have noted in the past, equipment sales are subject to fluctuations from the impacts of big installations. For SMB, equipment sales declined 1% both globally and in North America Mailing. The North America Mailing segment improved its overall revenue performance from last quarter, but we are not yet fully back to the stream revenue run rate established prior to the implementation of our new enterprise business platform. 
Also in the third quarter, we continue to address and focus our efforts on areas that need to improve. While Software Solutions did not see improvement in year-over-year license revenue in the quarter, the business continues to make progress in its direct channel strategy. As Marc mentioned, we continued to sign new Regional Systems Integrators and Location Intelligence partners. Although it will take time to ramp up the indirect pipeline and see a positive impact to our results from the new agreements we have signed, we are pleased with the progress we've made in building out this new channel. 
In the meantime, the company is focused on improving its direct sales channel efforts and growing the license revenue pipeline. In SMB, recurring revenue streams declined at a greater rate than in recent periods, largely due to lower financing and supplies revenue. In North America Mailing, our financing-related fees were not fully normalized due to proactively waiving some fees to allow clients to adjust to new billing formats and based on the timing of when some invoices were sent.
Additionally, supplies revenue declined on lower demand and supplies sales resource mix during the quarter. Given the high-margin nature of these recurring revenue streams, EBIT margin was impacted this quarter. We expect stream revenue, particularly financing revenue, to continue to improve from current levels as a result of financing fees normalizing and supplies sales productivity. Presort revenue growth was muted by the rate change earlier in the year and some lower-margin deals signed recently.
Let me now take you through the third quarter overall financial results. Please note that a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the financial schedules appended to our earnings press release and earnings slides, which are posted on the pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section.
Turning to the results. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $839 million, which was a decline of 2% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and a decline of 2.5% constant currency and 3.5% on a reported basis. Revenue in our SMB segment group declined 6% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and declined 7% on a reported basis. Revenue in our Enterprise Business Solutions Group grew 4% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and grew 2% on a constant currency and 1% on a reported basis. Digital Commerce Solutions revenue grew 2% on a constant currency basis and declined 1% on a reported basis. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.44. Adjusted earnings per share results include a positive tax adjustment of $0.07 per share, principally driven by the resolution of tax examinations. GAAP earnings per share were $0.35, which includes $0.06 per share of restructuring charges and a $0.03 per share charge from the announced redemption of the preferred stock of our Pitney Bowes International Holdings or PBIH subsidiary. Free cash flow was $119 million and we generated $137 million in cash from operations on a GAAP basis. In comparison to prior year, free cash flow was lower mostly due to the timing of accounts payable. 
During the quarter, the company used its cash to pay $35 million in dividends to common shareholders, $25 million for the Maponics acquisition and $17 million for restructuring payments. From a debt perspective, the company issued new 5-year 3 3/8% notes for $600 million. This will be a debt-neutral transaction as a portion was used to pay down our commercial paper balance during the quarter and the remaining $300 million is being used to redeem our PBIH preferred securities.
Turning to the income statement. As a reminder, this information is on an adjusted basis and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures can be founded in the financial schedules appended to our earnings press release and earnings slides, which are posted on the pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT was $146 million this quarter, which was $27 million lower than the prior year as a result of reduced revenue, particularly in North American Mailing and software. Adjusted EBIT margin was 17.4%. Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA was $197 million for the quarter. 
SG&A for the quarter was $300 million, which was $9 million or 3% lower than the prior year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 35.8%, which was 20 basis points higher than the prior year. SG&A declined in absolute terms when compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower employee-related costs. In support of our savings objectives around operational excellence, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $16 million at the end of the quarter for actions taken to improve operational efficiency and productivity across our business portfolio.
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $35 million, a decline of $2 million when compared to the prior year. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were $246 million higher than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 4.45%, which was about 77 basis points lower than the prior year. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter was 21.9%. The lower tax rate this quarter is principally related to the favorable resolution of tax examinations. You may recall that we had a higher tax rate in both the first and second quarters of this year. On a year-to-date basis and including this quarter's tax benefits, our tax rate on adjusted earnings is 31.5%. We, therefore, expect our annual tax rate to be at the low end of our stated range of 33% to 35%.
Now I'd like to discuss the third quarter results for each of our business segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we posted to the pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section.
In North American Mailing, revenue was $330 million and EBIT was $139 million. The revenue decline rate this quarter was an improvement from second quarter, which was impacted by the new enterprise business platform cutover. Equipment sales declined 1% compared to prior year, returning to levels similar to pre-go-live of the new platform. As Marc noted earlier, in October, we added the SendPro 300 to the growing family of connected mailing and shipping devices and apps. 
As I mentioned earlier, recurring revenue streams declined at a high single-digit rate, largely driven by lower financing-related fees and supplies revenues. The level of financing-related fees were not fully normalized due to proactively waiving some fees to allow clients to adjust to new billing formats and based on the timing of when some invoices were sent. Additionally, supplies revenue declined on lower demand and supplies sales resource mix during the quarter. We expect stream revenue, particularly financing revenue, to continue to improve from current levels as a result of financing fees normalizing and supplies sales productivity. EBIT margin was 42%, which was 310 basis points lower than prior year and mostly the result of the decline in higher-margin recurring revenue streams. 
In International Mailing, revenue was $96 million and EBIT was $10 million. Excluding the effects of currency movements and market exits, revenue declined 3.5% compared to prior year and equipment sales were flat. Equipment sales benefited from growth, most notably in France, Italy and Japan, but were mostly offset by a decline in the U.K. Recurring revenue streams declined, driven by lower supplies and rental revenues. EBIT margin was 10.2%, which was relatively flat to prior year as a decline in high-margin recurring revenue streams was offset by lower operating expenses. 
Turning to Enterprise Business Solutions. Overall, this segment group's revenue grew 2% on a constant currency basis, which is in line with our long-term expectations. Revenue grew 4% when adjusting for currency and Production Mail market exits. In Production Mail, revenue was $106 million and EBIT was $16 million. Equipment sales grew 27% over prior year due to higher sorter, inserter and print equipment placements as a result of a number of large client installations in the quarter. Support services revenue declined as a result of the continuing shift from in-house mail production to third-party service bureaus who tend to self-service as well as reduced service revenue associated with the market exits. EBIT margin was 14.8%, which was an improvement of 260 basis points from prior year due to service delivery cost management initiatives and lower sales and marketing costs.
In Presort Services, revenue was $114 million, and EBIT was $19 million. Revenue and EBIT margin were impacted this quarter by a decline in the average revenue per piece of mail processed as a result of the rate change earlier in the year and some recently signed lower-margin deals. EBIT margin was 16.8%, which was a decline of about 560 basis points versus prior year, primarily due to the revenue decline and increased labor costs.
For the Digital Commerce Solutions Group, in Software Solutions, revenue was $89 million and EBIT was $10 million. Revenue declined from prior year due to lower Customer Information Management and Location Intelligence licensing revenues but benefited from growth in Customer Engagement Software licenses. As Marc outlined and I noted earlier, we are actively signing up new systems integrators and other partners as part of our continued focus on expanding the indirect channel. And while we continue to make good progress in expanding the indirect channel and training partner sales and technical resources, it will take time before results reflect substantial revenue from partner-led deals. The business also continues to improve its direct sales efficiency to grow the pipeline of license deals. EBIT margin was 11.6%, which was a decline of 340 basis points versus prior year, mostly due to the lower licensing revenue. 
In Global Ecommerce, revenue was $104 million and EBIT was $4 million. As I mentioned earlier, this quarter included a full quarter of Borderfree results in both periods. Excluding the impacts of currency, our marketplace and retail revenues grew 17% from prior year on strong growth in the U.K. outbound shipments. U.S. outbound marketplace grew despite a stronger U.S. dollar versus prior year as well as some temporary disruption on demand for parcel shipments from the U.S. to Canada prior to the resolution of the Canada Post labor dispute. Domestic office shipping revenue declined from prior year, which reduced overall revenue growth for the Global Ecommerce segment this quarter. 
EBIT margin was 4.2%, which was an increase of 550 basis points versus the prior year. However, as I noted earlier, the Global Ecommerce segment had an 11% EBITDA margin this quarter. This better reflects the profit and cash improvements post the Borderfree acquisition. The EBITDA margin improvement is due to the revenue growth as well as the synergy savings from the Borderfree integration, which more than offset continued investment in the business.
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter. Now I'd like to discuss our annual guidance. The company expects improving trends in the business in the fourth quarter as a result of actions taken to achieve its long-term strategic initiatives. These initiatives include the initial benefits of the implementation of our enterprise business platform, new product introductions and continued enhancements of our channel strategy, which will benefit the fourth quarter with increasing contribution into 2017. 
For 2016, the company expects to be at the low end of its annual guidance range for revenue and adjusted earnings per share. For the full year 2016, we expect revenue on a constant currency basis to be in the range of a 1% decline to 3% decline when compared to 2015. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.75 to $1.82, adjusted earnings per share guidance excludes the year-to-date charges of $0.22 per share primarily related to restructuring and asset impairments. And we expect free cash flow to be in a range of $400 million to $450 million.

We did do some resource mix shift during the quarter. That probably cost us a little bit. What I mean by that is we had more resources were focused on digital access and digital selling for supplies versus direct selling or inside sales selling supplies. We also had a small impact related to the cutover because of some resources supporting other customer activities other than supplies, in particular the sale of our SmartLink product, which accrues to equipment but is a new product we had to offer. With respect to financing income, there was about $4 million that we would relate to fees that we [indiscernible] in the quarter in the interest of getting our clients up to speed in new invoicing and those types of things. So if you were to adjust for those fees, we would have been down to the mid-single digits, more around 7% on the financing line, which is not out of line with where we've seen that line item over the last several quarters. So I think it's less of a market share issue, more sort of some of these transitional issues around both the implementation of our ERP program as well as in the case of supplies, a combination of resource shift an some lower demand that we did see in the quarter."

I would say in Production Mail as Mike point out, we had good performance but we also benefited from large deals. So I would not want to leave you with the expectation that 27% equipment sales is the new normal for DNT. It is a lumpy business, we've been on both sides of that growth. That said, as we look at how we're positioned for the fourth quarter between backlog and written business, we're encouraged, I'll say it that way. The second dynamic is that I think some of the new product stuff is starting to make a positive difference. This will be a slow ramp because these are businesses that have a big base and annuity base, and so this can take a while for them to impact on the bottom line. But it's clear that the new products are making a difference. And then the third dynamic is as we get through the business platform implementation, we're starting to see sales productivity back to normal levels. If you would unlayer the United States from Canada, we saw what I would say is more what we would have expected productivity in the United States 6 months into the deployment of the platform. On the other side of it, Canada, where we're a year in, we've seen improved productivity, which is a very pleasant benefit. It wasn't part of our business case when we contemplated the new business platform. So we would expect to see that same dynamics in the United States and the rest of world over time. How do we all that up? I'm not sure I'm smart enough to give you advice on how to add all that up, but I would say that as we think about equipment sales in SMB, I think flattish is kind of my interpretation of what stabilization looks like as it relates to DMT, and DMT is going to continue to be lumpy and average of those dynamics. I'll turn to Mike and see if he wants to add stuff."

If you look at April and May, which is one set; and then June through now is the next; and then finally how we go forward. As it relates to the issues that we had in the third quarter and I hesitate to call them issues, the customers were seeing building a fundamentally different way. That caused a lot of questions, understandably. So out of an abundance of caution as it relates to client satisfaction, we made some adjustment in terms of when we sent out bills and also how we thought about the fees as related to late charges. So I would tell just kind of normal stuff and they're different layers as we move forward.

So as we look forward to the fourth quarter, we still have the U.S. dollar that's a bit stronger than last year, but what we've seen is as the currency sort of normalize year-to-year, we don't see rapid or significant movements during the periods then we tend to see some of that come back.

I appreciate your question on the new channel because it's important that we're clear about this. So if you look at the life cycle of bringing on the new channel, there's inevitably of advance up front in terms of how it characterize. Starting to get to know each other, few deals here and then you move into a more substantial relationship, where they actually train their people. And I just want to double click on that because it's perhaps not as obvious how important that is. So I made the comment that we trained 200 individuals from these principally Regional Systems Integrators and global systems integrators. As you all know, this business is run on an hourly meter. So the fact that they're taking people away from billable work and dedicated them to building their skills tells you a lot. So it's one of the reasons why we continue to think we got good prospects for our business. But all that being said, you get the relationship, you train the people and then you start selling. So that takes quarters, not weeks or months. So -- and I would say in the short term, we've continued to be dependent on what our direct sales force can do. As you all know, that's performed, I would say, unevenly over the last couple of years. But we believe we got better line of sight in the fourth quarter.

First, we know exactly what is required to finish the year strong and remain confident in our ability to meet our financial commitments. Cumulative actions we have put in place are improving our business performance, and we have a good line of sight to incrementally take out more costs and expense and become even more efficient without sacrificing our long-term objectives.
Second, and I understand this, [indiscernible] in the numbers and lose sight of how far we have come in order to improve our ability to create value in this business, especially as in the case of software where we fall short of our expectations. It's only when you step back and look at all the things we've done that you get to point that you begin to realize how much has been accomplished and how much value we're poised to create. If you think about it in terms of our strategic initiatives, stabilization of mail, our go-to-market initiatives are yielding improved results, and equipment sales are stabilizing. We are reinventing mail by delivering new products solutions like shipping APIs, SendPro, SmartLink and SendPro 300 that are linked to Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud and leverage our assets to drive incremental value.
Operational excellence. We've made substantial improvements in our expense structure and are far more productive today that we were a few short years ago. We've improved our balance sheet, and we cut our inventory nearly in half. Critical to our transformation, we're continuing to see operational benefits from a new enterprise business platform, which now covers 80% of our business. We expect to realize increased operational benefits from this platform in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017.
Finally, growing Digital Commerce. in The third quarter, Global Ecommerce grew 17% organically, excluding the impact of currency and margins improved. 4 years ago, this was a fledgling business. Today, this business is on track to become a substantial part of our portfolio and is growing significantly in the years ahead. The opportunities in the space are significant, and we're just getting started. In our Software business, we've introduced a number of world-class products in the marketplace and world-class clients, and we're building a robust partner channel that includes global systems integrators, Regional Systems integrators and Location Intelligence partners. We've [indiscernible] more than 200 partner sales and technical resources that will help drive our business. We have much more work to do in software, but we made significant improvements already this year.
And finally, that I described last quarter will begin to see investments we've made over the years. We've spent the last 3.5 years building a strong foundation. I would argue, in many ways, the hard part of the work is behind us. We've invested in areas to secure our future growth and taken the necessary steps to acquire or unlock value. We have the right vision, the right strategy and the right products and solutions. As with everything, it's now coming down to execution. And that's on us.
With that, I'm looking forward to speaking with you again Analyst Day in New York City on December 6. Thank you"

Similar to last quarter, there were several moving parts and puts and takes during the third quarter that affected our performance and our financial results. While we continue to make progress against our strategic initiatives to unlock value and transform our company, we have more work to do. That said, we are confident that the actions we have put in place this year will continue to yield improved results in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017.
On the positive side of the ledger, our new enterprise business platform, which was deployed in the second quarter, continues to provide operational benefits. Our new products and solutions introduced in the second and third quarter and tied to the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud are resonating well with our clients and gaining traction. And our go-to-market strategy is yielding solid results.
Turning to the third quarter results. Global Ecommerce posted another strong performance and our Production Mail business grew and delivered impressive equipment sales results. Overall, equipment sales grew 6% this quarter. While we continue to make progress building out our partner channel in our software business, license revenue in the third quarter fell short of our expectations. Clearly, we are not satisfied with our software performance and have taken a number of actions around improving our sales channel efforts and continuing to focus on growing the pipeline for license revenue deals. We are making progress, but there's much more to do. In our Small and Medium Business, equipment sales rebounded after the initial deployment of our enterprise business platform in the second quarter. While there are some lingering issues, we continue to enhance the platform and expect to see improvements in the end of the year and into the first half of 2017.
Now let me update you on the progress we are making on our strategic initiatives: the reinvention of our mail business, operational excellence and growing our Digital Commerce business by leveraging our client base. First, reinvention of our mail business. We introduced the notion of reinventing our mail business back in September of 2015. We understand that today's SMB clients require the reliability, security and predictability of our traditional mailing systems as well as the need to simplify the increasing volumes of shipping parcels. But we also know that clients want the ease of use and rich features that our digital capabilities provide. 
For Pitney Bowes, reinventing mail is all about combining the strength of both physical mail and shipping with our digital capabilities to deliver more value for our Small and Medium Business clients. In the past 6 months, we have doubled down our efforts to deliver new and innovative products that leverage our considerable digital capabilities. We have delivered the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud; added new online web store capabilities, making it easier for clients to do business with us; provided clients with video capability through our EngageOne solutions; developed shipping APIs that provide new ways to monetize our software assets; and introduced into the market several Software as a Service-based products and solutions, including SendPro and SmartLink. 
In fact, we have more than 15,000 clients enrolled to use our SendPro solutions and we have shipped over 25,000 SmartLink devices since they were first introduced. In early October, we announced SendPro 300, an example of what we mean when we talk about reinventing our mail. The SendPro 300 streamlines multi-carrier office shipping and mailing for SMBs, allowing clients to manage their mail and shipping with USPS, FedEx and UPS while reducing costs. When connected to the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud, the SendPro 300 links business and shipping vendors with analytics and APIs and provides automatic postal updates, low ink alerts, service warnings and diagnostic notifications.
Next, operational excellence. Driving operational excellence in our business remains a significant ongoing focus for our company each and every day. A critical component for driving operational excellence is our new enterprise business platform, which was deployed in the U.S. in the second quarter. While we have not yet realized the full operational benefits from the platform, we know what needs our focus and attention and expect to see increasing improvements in the platform and the benefits through the remainder of the year and throughout 2017. 
As a reminder, this is not just an ERP implementation. The new platform touches every part of our business, including how sales opportunities are managed, products are configured, enabled and tracked, financials produced, customer service delivered and client satisfaction managed. As I mentioned last quarter, and it's worth repeating, our new enterprise platform is an essential component to our overall transformation. The substantial long-term benefits we derive from this platform outweigh any short-term challenges that we may face. In the third quarter, SG&A improved 3%. In terms of servicing our debt, we issued $600 million of 5-year notes. The transaction was oversubscribed, which is an indication of the continued interest and confidence by the capital markets in our transformation story.
Finally, growing our Digital Commerce business by leveraging our client base. Global Ecommerce business continued to perform very well, growing its retail and marketplace organic revenue 17%, excluding the impact of currency. During the quarter, we continued to add new storefronts, including Soludos, Evolue and The New York Times Store. Additionally, our Global Ecommerce segment had an 11% EBITDA margin this quarter, driven by revenue growth and synergy savings. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that demand for our cross-border capabilities is one of the most impressive things I have seen. To that end, in the quarter, we announced that we expanded our business in Australia to provide Global Ecommerce solutions to retailers looking to sell their goods across international borders. With the Pitney Bowes' Borderfree retail solution, Australian retailers will reach consumers in 220 countries and territories. Since launch, we have brought 3 Australian retailers on to our platform and signed more than 10 storefronts. 
We are also working on expanding opportunities for our U.S. retailers in key consumer markets, like China and India. For example, eBay has recently announced that Pitney Bowes is helping them launch their products on Tmall in China. We are in the early stages but are pleased about this opportunity. Also during the quarter, we announced that our shipping APIs for USPS postage are now part of the multichannel order platform offered by Ordoro, a multichannel e-commerce order and management solutions provider.
Now let me briefly discuss our software business. As I mentioned earlier, license revenue in our software business was disappointing. However, during the quarter, we signed a number of new partners, including Regional System Integrators and Location Intelligence partners. The response from our partners, Regional System Integrators and Global System Integrators, has been very positive and we're encouraged by the progress we are making attracting world-class partners to help sell our products and solutions. Importantly, more than 200 partner sales and technical resources have been trained so far. And we are now shifting our focus from recruitment of partners to enablement and pipeline building to drive the sales results we are looking for. We are making good progress in all areas and expect revenue from partners to be a strong contributor in 2017.
As I said at the outset of my prepared remarks, there are a lot of puts and takes during the third quarter. But I like where we are in this phase of our transformation. And I am confident that the actions we have put in place this year will continue to yield improved results in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017.
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike, who will take you through our third quarter results. Mike?"

As Marc discussed, we continue to make progress against our long-term strategy and achieve some additional milestones during the quarter. But we recognize that we have more work to do. Let me provide an overview of the quarter and drill down into some of the details. I'll then give an update on our expectation for the remainder of the year. 
For the third quarter, there are some significant highlights worth noting. Ecommerce marketplace and retail grew revenue organically 17%, excluding the impacts of currency this quarter. As a reminder, this is the first quarter of reporting Borderfree fully in both periods and now represents a clean comparison. This cross-border revenue growth is particularly encouraging because it reflects both a stronger U.S. dollar versus the prior year as well as some temporary disruption on demand for parcel shipments from the U.S. to Canada prior to the resolution of the Canada Post labor dispute. 
Additionally, our Global Ecommerce segment had an 11% EBITDA margin this quarter, driven by revenue growth in synergy savings from the Borderfree integration. The Enterprise Business Solutions Group in total continues to perform within the long-term market rates for both revenue and EBIT margin. Production Mail grew revenue this quarter by 5%, driven by 27% growth in equipment sales. Excluding the impact of currency and market exits, revenue grew 11% in Production Mail. As we have noted in the past, equipment sales are subject to fluctuations from the impacts of big installations. For SMB, equipment sales declined 1% both globally and in North America Mailing. The North America Mailing segment improved its overall revenue performance from last quarter, but we are not yet fully back to the stream revenue run rate established prior to the implementation of our new enterprise business platform. 
Also in the third quarter, we continue to address and focus our efforts on areas that need to improve. While Software Solutions did not see improvement in year-over-year license revenue in the quarter, the business continues to make progress in its direct channel strategy. As Marc mentioned, we continued to sign new Regional Systems Integrators and Location Intelligence partners. Although it will take time to ramp up the indirect pipeline and see a positive impact to our results from the new agreements we have signed, we are pleased with the progress we've made in building out this new channel. 
In the meantime, the company is focused on improving its direct sales channel efforts and growing the license revenue pipeline. In SMB, recurring revenue streams declined at a greater rate than in recent periods, largely due to lower financing and supplies revenue. In North America Mailing, our financing-related fees were not fully normalized due to proactively waiving some fees to allow clients to adjust to new billing formats and based on the timing of when some invoices were sent.
Additionally, supplies revenue declined on lower demand and supplies sales resource mix during the quarter. Given the high-margin nature of these recurring revenue streams, EBIT margin was impacted this quarter. We expect stream revenue, particularly financing revenue, to continue to improve from current levels as a result of financing fees normalizing and supplies sales productivity. Presort revenue growth was muted by the rate change earlier in the year and some lower-margin deals signed recently.
Let me now take you through the third quarter overall financial results. Please note that a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the financial schedules appended to our earnings press release and earnings slides, which are posted on the pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section.
Turning to the results. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $839 million, which was a decline of 2% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and a decline of 2.5% constant currency and 3.5% on a reported basis. Revenue in our SMB segment group declined 6% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and declined 7% on a reported basis. Revenue in our Enterprise Business Solutions Group grew 4% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and grew 2% on a constant currency and 1% on a reported basis. Digital Commerce Solutions revenue grew 2% on a constant currency basis and declined 1% on a reported basis. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.44. Adjusted earnings per share results include a positive tax adjustment of $0.07 per share, principally driven by the resolution of tax examinations. GAAP earnings per share were $0.35, which includes $0.06 per share of restructuring charges and a $0.03 per share charge from the announced redemption of the preferred stock of our Pitney Bowes International Holdings or PBIH subsidiary. Free cash flow was $119 million and we generated $137 million in cash from operations on a GAAP basis. In comparison to prior year, free cash flow was lower mostly due to the timing of accounts payable. 
During the quarter, the company used its cash to pay $35 million in dividends to common shareholders, $25 million for the Maponics acquisition and $17 million for restructuring payments. From a debt perspective, the company issued new 5-year 3 3/8% notes for $600 million. This will be a debt-neutral transaction as a portion was used to pay down our commercial paper balance during the quarter and the remaining $300 million is being used to redeem our PBIH preferred securities.
Turning to the income statement. As a reminder, this information is on an adjusted basis and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures can be founded in the financial schedules appended to our earnings press release and earnings slides, which are posted on the pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT was $146 million this quarter, which was $27 million lower than the prior year as a result of reduced revenue, particularly in North American Mailing and software. Adjusted EBIT margin was 17.4%. Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA was $197 million for the quarter. 
SG&A for the quarter was $300 million, which was $9 million or 3% lower than the prior year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 35.8%, which was 20 basis points higher than the prior year. SG&A declined in absolute terms when compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower employee-related costs. In support of our savings objectives around operational excellence, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $16 million at the end of the quarter for actions taken to improve operational efficiency and productivity across our business portfolio.
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $35 million, a decline of $2 million when compared to the prior year. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were $246 million higher than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 4.45%, which was about 77 basis points lower than the prior year. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter was 21.9%. The lower tax rate this quarter is principally related to the favorable resolution of tax examinations. You may recall that we had a higher tax rate in both the first and second quarters of this year. On a year-to-date basis and including this quarter's tax benefits, our tax rate on adjusted earnings is 31.5%. We, therefore, expect our annual tax rate to be at the low end of our stated range of 33% to 35%.
Now I'd like to discuss the third quarter results for each of our business segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we posted to the pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section.
In North American Mailing, revenue was $330 million and EBIT was $139 million. The revenue decline rate this quarter was an improvement from second quarter, which was impacted by the new enterprise business platform cutover. Equipment sales declined 1% compared to prior year, returning to levels similar to pre-go-live of the new platform. As Marc noted earlier, in October, we added the SendPro 300 to the growing family of connected mailing and shipping devices and apps. 
As I mentioned earlier, recurring revenue streams declined at a high single-digit rate, largely driven by lower financing-related fees and supplies revenues. The level of financing-related fees were not fully normalized due to proactively waiving some fees to allow clients to adjust to new billing formats and based on the timing of when some invoices were sent. Additionally, supplies revenue declined on lower demand and supplies sales resource mix during the quarter. We expect stream revenue, particularly financing revenue, to continue to improve from current levels as a result of financing fees normalizing and supplies sales productivity. EBIT margin was 42%, which was 310 basis points lower than prior year and mostly the result of the decline in higher-margin recurring revenue streams. 
In International Mailing, revenue was $96 million and EBIT was $10 million. Excluding the effects of currency movements and market exits, revenue declined 3.5% compared to prior year and equipment sales were flat. Equipment sales benefited from growth, most notably in France, Italy and Japan, but were mostly offset by a decline in the U.K. Recurring revenue streams declined, driven by lower supplies and rental revenues. EBIT margin was 10.2%, which was relatively flat to prior year as a decline in high-margin recurring revenue streams was offset by lower operating expenses. 
Turning to Enterprise Business Solutions. Overall, this segment group's revenue grew 2% on a constant currency basis, which is in line with our long-term expectations. Revenue grew 4% when adjusting for currency and Production Mail market exits. In Production Mail, revenue was $106 million and EBIT was $16 million. Equipment sales grew 27% over prior year due to higher sorter, inserter and print equipment placements as a result of a number of large client installations in the quarter. Support services revenue declined as a result of the continuing shift from in-house mail production to third-party service bureaus who tend to self-service as well as reduced service revenue associated with the market exits. EBIT margin was 14.8%, which was an improvement of 260 basis points from prior year due to service delivery cost management initiatives and lower sales and marketing costs.
In Presort Services, revenue was $114 million, and EBIT was $19 million. Revenue and EBIT margin were impacted this quarter by a decline in the average revenue per piece of mail processed as a result of the rate change earlier in the year and some recently signed lower-margin deals. EBIT margin was 16.8%, which was a decline of about 560 basis points versus prior year, primarily due to the revenue decline and increased labor costs.
For the Digital Commerce Solutions Group, in Software Solutions, revenue was $89 million and EBIT was $10 million. Revenue declined from prior year due to lower Customer Information Management and Location Intelligence licensing revenues but benefited from growth in Customer Engagement Software licenses. As Marc outlined and I noted earlier, we are actively signing up new systems integrators and other partners as part of our continued focus on expanding the indirect channel. And while we continue to make good progress in expanding the indirect channel and training partner sales and technical resources, it will take time before results reflect substantial revenue from partner-led deals. The business also continues to improve its direct sales efficiency to grow the pipeline of license deals. EBIT margin was 11.6%, which was a decline of 340 basis points versus prior year, mostly due to the lower licensing revenue. 
In Global Ecommerce, revenue was $104 million and EBIT was $4 million. As I mentioned earlier, this quarter included a full quarter of Borderfree results in both periods. Excluding the impacts of currency, our marketplace and retail revenues grew 17% from prior year on strong growth in the U.K. outbound shipments. U.S. outbound marketplace grew despite a stronger U.S. dollar versus prior year as well as some temporary disruption on demand for parcel shipments from the U.S. to Canada prior to the resolution of the Canada Post labor dispute. Domestic office shipping revenue declined from prior year, which reduced overall revenue growth for the Global Ecommerce segment this quarter. 
EBIT margin was 4.2%, which was an increase of 550 basis points versus the prior year. However, as I noted earlier, the Global Ecommerce segment had an 11% EBITDA margin this quarter. This better reflects the profit and cash improvements post the Borderfree acquisition. The EBITDA margin improvement is due to the revenue growth as well as the synergy savings from the Borderfree integration, which more than offset continued investment in the business.
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter. Now I'd like to discuss our annual guidance. The company expects improving trends in the business in the fourth quarter as a result of actions taken to achieve its long-term strategic initiatives. These initiatives include the initial benefits of the implementation of our enterprise business platform, new product introductions and continued enhancements of our channel strategy, which will benefit the fourth quarter with increasing contribution into 2017. 
For 2016, the company expects to be at the low end of its annual guidance range for revenue and adjusted earnings per share. For the full year 2016, we expect revenue on a constant currency basis to be in the range of a 1% decline to 3% decline when compared to 2015. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.75 to $1.82, adjusted earnings per share guidance excludes the year-to-date charges of $0.22 per share primarily related to restructuring and asset impairments. And we expect free cash flow to be in a range of $400 million to $450 million. 
Also as a reminder, the company is hosting its annual Analyst Day on December 6 in New York City, at which time, we'll provide an update on our strategy. Please visit our Investor Relations website for further we details on registering to attend or viewing the webcast online for this event.

We did do some resource mix shift during the quarter. That probably cost us a little bit. What I mean by that is we had more resources were focused on digital access and digital selling for supplies versus direct selling or inside sales selling supplies. We also had a small impact related to the cutover because of some resources supporting other customer activities other than supplies, in particular the sale of our SmartLink product, which accrues to equipment but is a new product we had to offer. With respect to financing income, there was about $4 million that we would relate to fees that we forewent in the quarter in the interest of getting our clients up to speed in the new invoicing and those types of things. So if you were to adjust for those fees, we would have been down more than mid-single digits, more around 7% on the financing line, which is not out of line with where we've seen that line item over the last several quarters. So I think it's less of a market share issue, more sort of some of these transitional issues around both the implementation of our ERP program as well as in the case of supplies, a combination of resource shift and some lower demand that we did see in the quarter."

I would say in Production Mail, as Mike pointed out, we had good performance, but we also benefited from some large deals. So I would not want to leave you with the expectation that 27% equipment sales is the new normal for DMT. It is a lumpy business, we've been on both sides of that curve since I've here. That said, as we look at how we're positioned for the fourth quarter between backlog and written business, we're encouraged, I'll say it that way. The second dynamic is that I think some of the new product stuff is starting to make a positive difference. This will be a slow ramp because these are businesses that have a big base in their annuity base. So this can take a while for them to have a meaningful impact on the bottom line. But it's clear that the new products are making a difference. And then the third dynamic is as we get through the business platform implementation, we're starting to see sales productivity back to normal levels. If you would unlayer the United States from Canada, we saw, what I would say is, more what we would have expected productivity in the United States 6 months into the deployment of the platform. On the other side of it, Canada, where we're a year in, we've seen improved productivity, which is a very pleasant benefit. It wasn't part of our business case when we contemplated the new business platform. So we would expect to see those same dynamics in the United States and the rest of world over time. How do we add all that up? I'm not sure I'm smart enough to give you advice on how to add all that up. But I would say that as we think about equipment sales in SMB, I think flattish is kind of my interpretation of what stabilization looks like as it relates to DMT. And DMT is going to continue to be lumpy, and then average those dynamics. So I'll turn to Mike to see if he wants to add anything to that."

So I think there's 3 different kind of timestamps as you unlayer that question, Shannon. I think if you have to look at April and May, which is one set, and then June through now is the next, and then finally how we go forward. As it relates to the issues that we had in the third quarter, and I hesitate to call them issues, the customers we're seeing billed in a fundamentally different way. That caused a lot of questions, understandably. So out of an abundance of caution as it relates to client satisfaction, we made some adjustments in terms of when we send out bills and also how we thought about fees as related to late charges. So I would tell it's kind of normal stuff. And there's different layers as we move forward. As Mike said, as we got into late in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, the billing stuff just normalized. So we expect that, as we had indicated, to get back to normal levels in the fourth quarter."

On the flip side, given the weaker pound, the U.K. outbound has grown very nicely. And I would say the direct relationship between U.S. and U.K. was kind of a net neutral because the growth in demand from the U.S. for U.K. products pretty much offset the reverse of that. So as we look forward to the fourth quarter, we still have a U.S. dollar that's a bit stronger than last year. But what we've seen is as the currency sort of normalize year-to-year, we don't see rapid or significant movements. During the periods, then we tend to see some of that buying come back. The others, we have expanded the number of markets outbound from the U.K. by another 6. And as you know, we've added Australia, although that we are early innings in Australia, have about 7 storefronts opened in Australia at this point."

We had hoped to realize a better yield on that pipe in the third quarter. We lost about a dozen deals at the end. We didn't lose any of -- we did lose about 1 or 2 to competition, most of them were timing from a client perspective. So we still think that pipeline is good for the second half. I appreciate your question on the new channel because it's important that we're clear about this. So if you look at the life cycle of bringing on a new channel, there's inevitably dance upfront in terms of how I'd characterize, dating, starting to get to know each other, a few deals here and there. And then you move into a more substantial relationship, where they actually train their people. And I want to just double-click on that because it's perhaps not as obvious how important that is. So I made the comment that we trained 200 individuals from these principally Regional System Integrators and Global System Integrators. As you all know, those businesses run on an hourly meter. So the fact that they're taking people away from billable work and dedicating them to building their skills tells you a lot. So it's one of the reasons why we continue to think we've got good prospects for that business. But all that being said, you get the relationships, you train the people, and then you start selling. So that takes quarters, not weeks or months. And I would say in the short term, we have continued to be dependent on what our direct sales force can do. As you all know, that's performed, I would say, unevenly over the last couple of years. But we believe we've got better line of sight in the fourth quarter. I think the new channels will begin to come in earnest -- I think we'll see a little bit in the fourth quarter, and then it will continue to build into 2017."

Second, and I understand this, it is easy to get lost in the numbers and lose sight of how far we have come in order to improve our ability to create value in this business, especially as is the case of software, when we fall short of our expectations. It's only when you step back and look at all the things we've done that you get to the point you begin to realize how much has been accomplished and how much value we're poised to create. 
If you think about it in terms of our strategic initiatives, the stabilization of mail, our go-to-market initiatives are yielding improved results and equipment sales are stabilizing. We are reinventing mail by delivering new products and solutions, like shipping APIs, SendPro, SmartLink and SendPro 300, that are linked to Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud and leverage our digital assets and capabilities to drive incremental value.
Operational excellence. We've made substantial improvements in our expense structure and are far more productive today that we were a few short years ago. We've improved our balance sheet and we've cut our inventory nearly in half. Critical to our transformation, we're continuing to see operational benefits from our new enterprise business platform, which now covers 80% of our business. We expect to realize increased operational benefits from this platform in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017.
Finally, growing Digital Commerce. In the third quarter, Global Ecommerce grew 17% organically, excluding the impact of currency, and margins improved. 4 years ago, this was a fledgling business. Today, this business is on track to become a substantial part of our portfolio and is growing significantly in the years ahead. The opportunities in the space are significant, and we're just getting started. 
In our software business, we've introduced a number of world-class products in the marketplace, have world-class clients and we're building a robust partner channel that includes Global System Integrators, Regional System Integrators and Location Intelligence partners. We've trained more than 200 partner sales and technical resources that will help drive our business. We have much more work to do in software, but we've made significant improvements already this year.
And finally, that clear water [ph] that I described last quarter, we'll begin to see the investments we've made over the years. We've spent the last 3.5 years building a strong foundation. I would argue, in many ways, the hard part of the work is behind us. We've invested in areas to secure our future growth and taken the necessary steps to acquire or unlock value. We have the right vision, the right strategy, the right products and solutions. As with everything, it's now coming down to execution. And that's on us. With that, I'm looking forward to speaking with you again at Analyst Day in New York City on December 6. Thank you."

Similar to last quarter, there were several moving parts and puts and takes during the third quarter that affected our performance and our financial results. While we continue to make progress against our strategic initiatives to unlock value and transform our company, we have more work to do. That said, we are confident that the actions we have put in place this year will continue to yield improved results in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017.
On the positive side of the ledger, our new enterprise business platform, which was deployed in the second quarter, continues to provide operational benefits. Our new products and solutions introduced in the second and third quarter and tied to the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud are resonating well with our clients and gaining traction. And our go-to-market strategy is yielding solid results.
Turning to the third quarter results. Global Ecommerce posted another strong performance and our Production Mail business grew and delivered impressive equipment sales results. Overall, equipment sales grew 6% this quarter. While we continue to make progress building out our partner channel in our software business, license revenue in the third quarter fell short of our expectations. Clearly, we are not satisfied with our software performance and have taken a number of actions around improving our sales channel efforts and continuing to focus on growing the pipeline for license revenue deals. We are making progress, but there's much more to do. In our Small and Medium Business, equipment sales rebounded after the initial deployment of our enterprise business platform in the second quarter. While there are some lingering issues, we continue to enhance the platform and expect to see improvements in the end of the year and into the first half of 2017.
Now let me update you on the progress we are making on our strategic initiatives: the reinvention of our mail business, operational excellence and growing our Digital Commerce business by leveraging our client base. First, reinvention of our mail business. We introduced the notion of reinventing our mail business back in September of 2015. We understand that today's SMB clients require the reliability, security and predictability of our traditional mailing systems as well as the need to simplify the increasing volumes of shipping parcels. But we also know that clients want the ease of use and rich features that our digital capabilities provide. 
For Pitney Bowes, reinventing mail is all about combining the strength of both physical mail and shipping with our digital capabilities to deliver more value for our Small and Medium Business clients. In the past 6 months, we have doubled down our efforts to deliver new and innovative products that leverage our considerable digital capabilities. We have delivered the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud; added new online web store capabilities, making it easier for clients to do business with us; provided clients with video capability through our EngageOne solutions; developed shipping APIs that provide new ways to monetize our software assets; and introduced into the market several Software as a Service-based products and solutions, including SendPro and SmartLink. 
In fact, we have more than 15,000 clients enrolled to use our SendPro solutions and we have shipped over 25,000 SmartLink devices since they were first introduced. In early October, we announced SendPro 300, an example of what we mean when we talk about reinventing our mail. The SendPro 300 streamlines multi-carrier office shipping and mailing for SMBs, allowing clients to manage their mail and shipping with USPS, FedEx and UPS while reducing costs. When connected to the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud, the SendPro 300 links business and shipping vendors with analytics and APIs and provides automatic postal updates, low ink alerts, service warnings and diagnostic notifications.
Next, operational excellence. Driving operational excellence in our business remains a significant ongoing focus for our company each and every day. A critical component for driving operational excellence is our new enterprise business platform, which was deployed in the U.S. in the second quarter. While we have not yet realized the full operational benefits from the platform, we know what needs our focus and attention and expect to see increasing improvements in the platform and the benefits through the remainder of the year and throughout 2017. 
As a reminder, this is not just an ERP implementation. The new platform touches every part of our business, including how sales opportunities are managed, products are configured, enabled and tracked, financials produced, customer service delivered and client satisfaction managed. As I mentioned last quarter, and it's worth repeating, our new enterprise platform is an essential component to our overall transformation. The substantial long-term benefits we derive from this platform outweigh any short-term challenges that we may face. In the third quarter, SG&A improved 3%. In terms of servicing our debt, we issued $600 million of 5-year notes. The transaction was oversubscribed, which is an indication of the continued interest and confidence by the capital markets in our transformation story.
Finally, growing our Digital Commerce business by leveraging our client base. Global Ecommerce business continued to perform very well, growing its retail and marketplace organic revenue 17%, excluding the impact of currency. During the quarter, we continued to add new storefronts, including Soludos, Evolue and The New York Times Store. Additionally, our Global Ecommerce segment had an 11% EBITDA margin this quarter, driven by revenue growth and synergy savings. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that demand for our cross-border capabilities is one of the most impressive things I have seen. To that end, in the quarter, we announced that we expanded our business in Australia to provide Global Ecommerce solutions to retailers looking to sell their goods across international borders. With the Pitney Bowes' Borderfree retail solution, Australian retailers will reach consumers in 220 countries and territories. Since launch, we have brought 3 Australian retailers on to our platform and signed more than 10 storefronts. 
We are also working on expanding opportunities for our U.S. retailers in key consumer markets, like China and India. For example, eBay has recently announced that Pitney Bowes is helping them launch their products on Tmall in China. We are in the early stages but are pleased about this opportunity. Also during the quarter, we announced that our shipping APIs for USPS postage are now part of the multichannel order platform offered by Ordoro, a multichannel e-commerce order and management solutions provider.
Now let me briefly discuss our software business. As I mentioned earlier, license revenue in our software business was disappointing. However, during the quarter, we signed a number of new partners, including Regional System Integrators and Location Intelligence partners. The response from our partners, Regional System Integrators and Global System Integrators, has been very positive and we're encouraged by the progress we are making attracting world-class partners to help sell our products and solutions. Importantly, more than 200 partner sales and technical resources have been trained so far. And we are now shifting our focus from recruitment of partners to enablement and pipeline building to drive the sales results we are looking for. We are making good progress in all areas and expect revenue from partners to be a strong contributor in 2017.
As I said at the outset of my prepared remarks, there are a lot of puts and takes during the third quarter. But I like where we are in this phase of our transformation. And I'm confident that the actions we have put in place this year will continue to yield improved results in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017.
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike, who will take you through our third quarter results. Mike?"
297018,407117210,1068368,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, and good morning. As Marc discussed, we continue to make progress against our long-term strategy and achieve some additional milestones during the quarter. But we recognize that we have more work to do. Let me provide an overview of the quarter",2342,"Thank you, and good morning. As Marc discussed, we continue to make progress against our long-term strategy and achieve some additional milestones during the quarter. But we recognize that we have more work to do. Let me provide an overview of the quarter and drill down into some of the details. I'll then give an update on our expectation for the remainder of the year. 
For the third quarter, there are some significant highlights worth noting. Ecommerce marketplace and retail grew revenue organically 17%, excluding the impacts of currency this quarter. As a reminder, this is the first quarter of reporting Borderfree fully in both periods and now represents a clean comparison. This cross-border revenue growth is particularly encouraging because it reflects both a stronger U.S. dollar versus the prior year as well as some temporary disruption on demand for parcel shipments from the U.S. to Canada prior to the resolution of the Canada Post labor dispute. 
Additionally, our Global Ecommerce segment had an 11% EBITDA margin this quarter, driven by revenue growth in synergy savings from the Borderfree integration. The Enterprise Business Solutions Group in total continues to perform within the long-term market rates for both revenue and EBIT margin. Production Mail grew revenue this quarter by 5%, driven by 27% growth in equipment sales. Excluding the impact of currency and market exits, revenue grew 11% in Production Mail. As we have noted in the past, equipment sales are subject to fluctuations from the impacts of big installations. For SMB, equipment sales declined 1% both globally and in North America Mailing. The North America Mailing segment improved its overall revenue performance from last quarter, but we are not yet fully back to the stream revenue run rate established prior to the implementation of our new enterprise business platform. 
Also in the third quarter, we continue to address and focus our efforts on areas that need to improve. While Software Solutions did not see improvement in year-over-year license revenue in the quarter, the business continues to make progress in its indirect channel strategy. As Marc mentioned, we continue to sign new Regional Systems Integrators and Location Intelligence partners. Although it will take time to ramp up the indirect pipeline and see a positive impact to our results from the new agreements we have signed, we are pleased with the progress we've made in building out this new channel. 
In the meantime, the company is focused on improving its direct sales channel efforts and growing the license revenue pipeline. In SMB, recurring revenue streams declined at a greater rate than in recent periods, largely due to lower financing and supplies revenue. In North America Mailing, our financing-related fees were not fully normalized due to proactively waiving some fees to allow clients to adjust to new billing formats and based on the timing of when some invoices were sent.
Additionally, supplies revenue declined on lower demand and supplies sales resource mix during the quarter. Given the high-margin nature of these recurring revenue streams, EBIT margin was impacted this quarter. We expect stream revenue, particularly financing revenue, to continue to improve from current levels as a result of financing fees normalizing and supplies sales productivity. Presort revenue growth was muted by the rate change earlier in the year and some lower-margin deals signed recently.
Let me now take you through the third quarter overall financial results. Please note that a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the financial schedules appended to our earnings press release and earnings slides, which are posted on the pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section.
Turning to the results. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $839 million, which was a decline of 2% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and a decline of 2.5% constant currency and 3.5% on a reported basis. Revenue in our SMB segment group declined 6% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and declined 7% on a reported basis. Revenue in our Enterprise Business Solutions Group grew 4% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and grew 2% on a constant currency and 1% on a reported basis. Digital Commerce Solutions revenue grew 2% on a constant currency basis and declined 1% on a reported basis. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.44. Adjusted earnings per share results include a positive tax adjustment of $0.07 per share, principally driven by the resolution of tax examinations. GAAP earnings per share were $0.35, which includes $0.06 per share of restructuring charges and a $0.03 per share charge from the announced redemption of the preferred stock of our Pitney Bowes International Holdings or PBIH subsidiary. Free cash flow was $119 million and we generated $137 million in cash from operations on a GAAP basis. In comparison to prior year, free cash flow was lower mostly due to the timing of accounts payable. 
During the quarter, the company used its cash to pay $35 million in dividends to common shareholders, $25 million for the Maponics acquisition and $17 million for restructuring payments. From a debt perspective, the company issued new 5-year 3 3/8% notes for $600 million. This will be a debt-neutral transaction as a portion was used to pay down our commercial paper balance during the quarter and the remaining $300 million is being used to redeem our PBIH preferred securities.
Turning to the income statement. As a reminder, this information is on an adjusted basis and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the financial schedules appended to our earnings press release and earnings slides, which are posted on the pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT was $146 million this quarter, which was $27 million lower than the prior year as a result of reduced revenue, particularly in North American Mailing and software. Adjusted EBIT margin was 17.4%. Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA was $197 million for the quarter. 
SG&A for the quarter was $300 million, which was $9 million or 3% lower than the prior year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 35.8%, which was 20 basis points higher than the prior year. SG&A declined in absolute terms when compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower employee-related costs. In support of our savings objectives around operational excellence, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $16 million at the end of the quarter for actions taken to improve operational efficiency and productivity across our business portfolio.
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $35 million, a decline of $2 million when compared to the prior year. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were $246 million higher than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 4.45%, which was about 77 basis points lower than the prior year. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter was 21.9%. The lower tax rate this quarter is principally related to the favorable resolution of tax examinations. You may recall that we had a higher tax rate in both the first and second quarters of this year. On a year-to-date basis and including this quarter's tax benefits, our tax rate on adjusted earnings is 31.5%. We, therefore, expect our annual tax rate to be at the low end of our stated range of 33% to 35%.
Now I'd like to discuss the third quarter results for each of our business segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we posted to the pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section.
In North American Mailing, revenue was $330 million and EBIT was $139 million. The revenue decline rate this quarter was an improvement from second quarter, which was impacted by the new enterprise business platform cutover. Equipment sales declined 1% compared to prior year, returning to levels similar to pre-go-live of the new platform. As Marc noted earlier, in October, we added the SendPro 300 to the growing family of connected mailing and shipping devices and apps. 
As I mentioned earlier, recurring revenue streams declined at a high single-digit rate, largely driven by lower financing-related fees and supplies revenues. The level of financing-related fees were not fully normalized due to proactively waiving some fees to allow clients to adjust to new billing formats and based on the timing of when some invoices were sent. Additionally, supplies revenue declined on lower demand and supplies sales resource mix during the quarter. We expect stream revenue, particularly financing revenue, to continue to improve from current levels as a result of financing fees normalizing and supplies sales productivity. EBIT margin was 42%, which was 310 basis points lower than prior year and mostly the result of the decline in higher-margin recurring revenue streams. 
In International Mailing, revenue was $96 million and EBIT was $10 million. Excluding the effects of currency movements and market exits, revenue declined 3.5% compared to prior year and equipment sales were flat. Equipment sales benefited from growth, most notably in France, Italy and Japan, but were mostly offset by a decline in the U.K. Recurring revenue streams declined, driven by lower supplies and rental revenues. EBIT margin was 10.2%, which was relatively flat to prior year as a decline in high-margin recurring revenue streams was offset by lower operating expenses. 
Turning to Enterprise Business Solutions. Overall, this segment group's revenue grew 2% on a constant currency basis, which is in line with our long-term expectations. Revenue grew 4% when adjusting for currency and Production Mail market exits. In Production Mail, revenue was $106 million and EBIT was $16 million. Equipment sales grew 27% over prior year due to higher sorter, inserter and print equipment placements as a result of a number of large client installations in the quarter. Support services revenue declined as a result of the continuing shift from in-house mail production to third-party service bureaus who tend to self-service as well as reduced service revenue associated with the market exits. EBIT margin was 14.8%, which was an improvement of 260 basis points from prior year due to service delivery cost management initiatives and lower sales and marketing costs.
In Presort Services, revenue was $114 million, and EBIT was $19 million. Revenue and EBIT margin were impacted this quarter by a decline in the average revenue per piece of mail processed as a result of the rate change earlier in the year and some recently signed lower-margin deals. EBIT margin was 16.8%, which was a decline of about 560 basis points versus prior year, primarily due to the revenue decline and increased labor costs.
For the Digital Commerce Solutions Group, in Software Solutions, revenue was $89 million and EBIT was $10 million. Revenue declined from prior year due to lower Customer Information Management and Location Intelligence licensing revenues but benefited from growth in Customer Engagement Software licenses. As Marc outlined and I noted earlier, we are actively signing up new systems integrators and other partners as part of our continued focus on expanding the indirect channel. And while we continue to make good progress in expanding the indirect channel and training partner sales and technical resources, it will take time before results reflect substantial revenue from partner-led deals. The business also continues to improve its direct sales efficiency to grow the pipeline of license deals. EBIT margin was 11.6%, which was a decline of 340 basis points versus prior year, mostly due to the lower licensing revenue. 
In Global Ecommerce, revenue was $104 million and EBIT was $4 million. As I mentioned earlier, this quarter included a full quarter of Borderfree results in both periods. Excluding the impacts of currency, our marketplace and retail revenues grew 17% from prior year on strong growth in the U.K. outbound shipments. U.S. outbound marketplace grew despite a stronger U.S. dollar versus prior year as well as some temporary disruption on demand for parcel shipments from the U.S. to Canada prior to the resolution of the Canada Post labor dispute. Domestic office shipping revenue declined from prior year, which reduced overall revenue growth for the Global Ecommerce segment this quarter. 
EBIT margin was 4.2%, which was an increase of 550 basis points versus the prior year. However, as I noted earlier, the Global Ecommerce segment had an 11% EBITDA margin this quarter. This better reflects the profit and cash improvements post the Borderfree acquisition. The EBITDA margin improvement is due to the revenue growth as well as the synergy savings from the Borderfree integration, which more than offset continued investment in the business.
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter. Now I'd like to discuss our annual guidance. The company expects improving trends in the business in the fourth quarter as a result of actions taken to achieve its long-term strategic initiatives. These initiatives include the initial benefits of the implementation of our enterprise business platform, new product introductions and continued enhancements of our channel strategy, which will benefit the fourth quarter with increasing contribution into 2017. 
For 2016, the company expects to be at the low end of its annual guidance range for revenue and adjusted earnings per share. For the full year 2016, we expect revenue on a constant currency basis to be in the range of a 1% decline to 3% decline when compared to 2015. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.75 to $1.82, adjusted earnings per share guidance excludes the year-to-date charges of $0.22 per share primarily related to restructuring and asset impairments. And we expect free cash flow to be in a range of $400 million to $450 million. 
Also as a reminder, the company is hosting its annual Analyst Day on December 6 in New York City, at which time, we'll provide an update on our strategy. Please visit our Investor Relations website for further details on registering to attend or viewing the webcast online for this event.

We did do some resource mix shift during the quarter. That probably cost us a little bit. What I mean by that is we had more resources were focused on digital access and digital selling for supplies versus direct selling or inside sales selling supplies. We also had a small impact related to the cutover because of some resources supporting other customer activities other than supplies, in particular the sale of our SmartLink product, which accrues to equipment but is a new product we had to offer. With respect to financing income, there was about $4 million that we would relate to fees that we forewent in the quarter in the interest of getting our clients up to speed in the new invoicing and those types of things. So if you were to adjust for those fees, we would have been down more than mid-single digits, more around 7% on the financing line, which is not out of line with where we've seen that line item over the last several quarters. So I think it's less of a market share issue, more sort of some of these transitional issues around both the implementation of our ERP program as well as in the case of supplies, a combination of resource shift and some lower demand that we did see in the quarter."

But are you thinking any differently about that now that you had some nice quarters of growth put in?

I would say in Production Mail, as Mike pointed out, we had good performance, but we also benefited from some large deals. So I would not want to leave you with the expectation that 27% equipment sales is the new normal for DMT. It is a lumpy business, we've been on both sides of that curve since I've here. That said, as we look at how we're positioned for the fourth quarter between backlog and written business, we're encouraged, I'll say it that way. The second dynamic is that I think some of the new product stuff is starting to make a positive difference. This will be a slow ramp because these are businesses that have a big base in their annuity base. So this can take a while for them to have a meaningful impact on the bottom line. But it's clear that the new products are making a difference. And then the third dynamic is as we get through the business platform implementation, we're starting to see sales productivity back to normal levels. If you would unlayer the United States from Canada, we saw, what I would say is, more what we would have expected productivity in the United States 6 months into the deployment of the platform. On the other side of it, Canada, where we're a year in, we've seen improved productivity, which is a very pleasant benefit. It wasn't part of our business case when we contemplated the new business platform. So we would expect to see those same dynamics in the United States and the rest of world over time. How do we add all that up? I'm not sure I'm smart enough to give you advice on how to add all that up. But I would say that as we think about equipment sales in SMB, I think flattish is kind of my interpretation of what stabilization looks like. As it relates to DMT, DMT is going to continue to be lumpy, and then average those dynamics. So I'll turn to Mike to see if he wants to add anything to that."

So out of an abundance of caution as it relates to client satisfaction, we made some adjustments in terms of when we send out bills and also how we thought about fees as related to late charges.

So as we look forward to the fourth quarter, we still have a U.S. dollar that's a bit stronger than last year.

I appreciate your question on the new channel because it's important that we're clear about this. So if you look at the life cycle of bringing on a new channel, there's inevitably dance upfront in terms of how I'd characterize, dating, starting to get to know each other, a few deals here and there. And then you move into a more substantial relationship, where they actually train their people. And I want to just double-click on that because it's perhaps not as obvious how important that is. So I made the comment that we trained 200 individuals from these principally Regional System Integrators and Global System Integrators. As you all know, those businesses run on an hourly meter. So the fact that they're taking people away from billable work and dedicating them to building their skills tells you a lot. So it's one of the reasons why we continue to think we've got good prospects for that business. But all that being said, you get the relationships, you train the people, and then you start selling. So that takes quarters, not weeks or months. And I would say in the short term, we have continued to be dependent on what our direct sales force can do. As you all know, that's performed, I would say, unevenly over the last couple of years. But we believe we've got better line of sight in the fourth quarter.

That's not turned out to be the case. As we look into 2016 in the fourth quarter, as you always have in the software business, you have a couple of large lumpy deals and they will be binary. So we think we've got a good beat on them. We think we've assessed them in a prudent way. But that is the nature of software business, these things kind of flow one way or the other. So we'll know more and we'll tell you more as we get through the quarter. And Analyst Day is the [indiscernible] time to update you on some of these things."

First, we know exactly what is required to finish the year strong and remain confident in our ability to meet our financial commitments. The cumulative actions we have put in place are improving our business performance. And we have a good line of sight to incrementally take out more cost and expense and become even more efficient without sacrificing our long-term objectives.
Second, and I understand this, it is easy to get lost in the numbers and lose sight of how far we have come in order to improve our ability to create value in this business, especially as is the case of software, when we fall short of our expectations. It's only when you step back and look at all the things we've done that you get to the point you begin to realize how much has been accomplished and how much value we're poised to create. 
If you think about it in terms of our strategic initiatives, the stabilization of mail, our go-to-market initiatives are yielding improved results and equipment sales are stabilizing. We are reinventing mail by delivering new products and solutions, like shipping APIs, SendPro, SmartLink and SendPro 300, that are linked to Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud and leverage our digital assets and capabilities to drive incremental value.
Operational excellence. We've made substantial improvements in our expense structure and are far more productive today that we were a few short years ago. We've improved our balance sheet and we've cut our inventory nearly in half. Critical to our transformation, we're continuing to see operational benefits from our new enterprise business platform, which now covers 80% of our business. We expect to realize increased operational benefits from this platform in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017.
Finally, growing Digital Commerce. In the third quarter, Global Ecommerce grew 17% organically, excluding the impact of currency, and margins improved. 4 years ago, this was a fledgling business. Today, this business is on track to become a substantial part of our portfolio and is growing significantly in the years ahead. The opportunities in the space are significant, and we're just getting started. 
In our software business, we've introduced a number of world-class products in the marketplace, have world-class clients and we're building a robust partner channel that includes Global System Integrators, Regional System Integrators and Location Intelligence partners. We've trained more than 200 partner sales and technical resources that will help drive our business. We have much more work to do in software, but we've made significant improvements already this year.
And finally, that clear water [ph] that I described last quarter, we'll begin to see the investments we've made over the years. We've spent the last 3.5 years building a strong foundation. I would argue, in many ways, the hard part of the work is behind us. We've invested in areas to secure our future growth and taken the necessary steps to acquire or unlock value. We have the right vision, the right strategy, the right products and solutions. As with everything, it's now coming down to execution. And that's on us. With that, I'm looking forward to speaking with you again at Analyst Day in New York City on December 6. Thank you."

Similar to last quarter, there were several moving parts and puts and takes during the third quarter that affected our performance and our financial results. While we continue to make progress against our strategic initiatives to unlock value and transform our company, we have more work to do. That said, we are confident that the actions we have put in place this year will continue to yield improved results in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017.
On the positive side of the ledger, our new enterprise business platform, which was deployed in the second quarter, continues to provide operational benefits. Our new products and solutions introduced in the second and third quarter and tied to the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud are resonating well with our clients and gaining traction. And our go-to-market strategy is yielding solid results.
Turning to the third quarter results. Global Ecommerce posted another strong performance and our Production Mail business grew and delivered impressive equipment sales results. Overall, equipment sales grew 6% this quarter. While we continue to make progress building out our partner channel in our software business, license revenue in the third quarter fell short of our expectations. Clearly, we are not satisfied with our software performance and have taken a number of actions around improving our sales channel efforts and continuing to focus on growing the pipeline for license revenue deals. We are making progress, but there's much more to do. In our Small and Medium Business, equipment sales rebounded after the initial deployment of our enterprise business platform in the second quarter. While there are some lingering issues, we continue to enhance the platform and expect to see improvements in the end of the year and into the first half of 2017.
Now let me update you on the progress we are making on our strategic initiatives: the reinvention of our mail business, operational excellence and growing our Digital Commerce business by leveraging our client base. First, reinvention of our mail business. We introduced the notion of reinventing our mail business back in September of 2015. We understand that today's SMB clients require the reliability, security and predictability of our traditional mailing systems as well as the need to simplify the increasing volumes of shipping parcels. But we also know that clients want the ease of use and rich features that our digital capabilities provide. 
For Pitney Bowes, reinventing mail is all about combining the strength of both physical mail and shipping with our digital capabilities to deliver more value for our Small and Medium Business clients. In the past 6 months, we have doubled down our efforts to deliver new and innovative products that leverage our considerable digital capabilities. We have delivered the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud; added new online web store capabilities, making it easier for clients to do business with us; provided clients with video capability through our EngageOne solutions; developed shipping APIs that provide new ways to monetize our software assets; and introduced into the market several Software as a Service-based products and solutions, including SendPro and SmartLink. 
In fact, we have more than 15,000 clients enrolled to use our SendPro solutions and we have shipped over 25,000 SmartLink devices since they were first introduced. In early October, we announced SendPro 300, an example of what we mean when we talk about reinventing our mail. The SendPro 300 streamlines multi-carrier office shipping and mailing for SMBs, allowing clients to manage their mail and shipping with USPS, FedEx and UPS while reducing costs. When connected to the Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud, the SendPro 300 links business and shipping vendors with analytics and APIs and provides automatic postal updates, low ink alerts, service warnings and diagnostic notifications.
Next, operational excellence. Driving operational excellence in our business remains a significant ongoing focus for our company each and every day. A critical component for driving operational excellence is our new enterprise business platform, which was deployed in the U.S. in the second quarter. While we have not yet realized the full operational benefits from the platform, we know what needs our focus and attention and expect to see increasing improvements in the platform and the benefits through the remainder of the year and throughout 2017. 
As a reminder, this is not just an ERP implementation. The new platform touches every part of our business, including how sales opportunities are managed, products are configured, enabled and tracked, financials produced, customer service delivered and client satisfaction managed. As I mentioned last quarter, and it's worth repeating, our new enterprise platform is an essential component to our overall transformation. The substantial long-term benefits we derive from this platform outweigh any short-term challenges that we may face. In the third quarter, SG&A improved 3%. In terms of servicing our debt, we issued $600 million of 5-year notes. The transaction was oversubscribed, which is an indication of the continued interest and confidence by the capital markets in our transformation story.
Finally, growing our Digital Commerce business by leveraging our client base. Global Ecommerce business continued to perform very well, growing its retail and marketplace organic revenue 17%, excluding the impact of currency. During the quarter, we continued to add new storefronts, including Soludos, Evolue and The New York Times Store. Additionally, our Global Ecommerce segment had an 11% EBITDA margin this quarter, driven by revenue growth and synergy savings. 
Last quarter, I mentioned that demand for our cross-border capabilities is one of the most impressive things I have seen. To that end, in the quarter, we announced that we expanded our business in Australia to provide Global Ecommerce solutions to retailers looking to sell their goods across international borders. With the Pitney Bowes' Borderfree retail solution, Australian retailers will reach consumers in 220 countries and territories. Since launch, we have brought 3 Australian retailers on to our platform and signed more than 10 storefronts. 
We are also working on expanding opportunities for our U.S. retailers in key consumer markets, like China and India. For example, eBay has recently announced that Pitney Bowes is helping them launch their products on Tmall in China. We are in the early stages but are pleased about this opportunity. Also during the quarter, we announced that our shipping APIs for USPS postage are now part of the multichannel order platform offered by Ordoro, a multichannel e-commerce order and management solutions provider.
Now let me briefly discuss our software business. As I mentioned earlier, license revenue in our software business was disappointing. However, during the quarter, we signed a number of new partners, including Regional System Integrators and Location Intelligence partners. The response from our partners, Regional System Integrators and Global System Integrators, has been very positive and we're encouraged by the progress we are making attracting world-class partners to help sell our products and solutions. Importantly, more than 200 partner sales and technical resources have been trained so far. And we are now shifting our focus from recruitment of partners to enablement and pipeline building to drive the sales results we are looking for. We are making good progress in all areas and expect revenue from partners to be a strong contributor in 2017.
As I said at the outset of my prepared remarks, there are a lot of puts and takes during the third quarter. But I like where we are in this phase of our transformation. And I'm confident that the actions we have put in place this year will continue to yield improved results in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017.
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike, who will take you through our third quarter results. Mike?"
297018,407117210,1069354,"Pitney Bowes Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Pitney Bowes Inc.","Executives","Thank you, and good morning. As Marc discussed, we continue to make progress against our long-term strategy and achieve some additional milestones during the quarter. But we recognize that we have more work to do. Let me provide an overview of the quarter",2342,"Thank you, and good morning. As Marc discussed, we continue to make progress against our long-term strategy and achieve some additional milestones during the quarter. But we recognize that we have more work to do. Let me provide an overview of the quarter and drill down into some of the details. I'll then give an update on our expectation for the remainder of the year. 
For the third quarter, there are some significant highlights worth noting. Ecommerce marketplace and retail grew revenue organically 17%, excluding the impacts of currency this quarter. As a reminder, this is the first quarter of reporting Borderfree fully in both periods and now represents a clean comparison. This cross-border revenue growth is particularly encouraging because it reflects both a stronger U.S. dollar versus the prior year as well as some temporary disruption on demand for parcel shipments from the U.S. to Canada prior to the resolution of the Canada Post labor dispute. 
Additionally, our Global Ecommerce segment had an 11% EBITDA margin this quarter, driven by revenue growth in synergy savings from the Borderfree integration. The Enterprise Business Solutions Group in total continues to perform within the long-term market rates for both revenue and EBIT margin. Production Mail grew revenue this quarter by 5%, driven by 27% growth in equipment sales. Excluding the impact of currency and market exits, revenue grew 11% in Production Mail. As we have noted in the past, equipment sales are subject to fluctuations from the impacts of big installations. For SMB, equipment sales declined 1% both globally and in North America Mailing. The North America Mailing segment improved its overall revenue performance from last quarter, but we are not yet fully back to the stream revenue run rate established prior to the implementation of our new enterprise business platform. 
Also in the third quarter, we continue to address and focus our efforts on areas that need to improve. While Software Solutions did not see improvement in year-over-year license revenue in the quarter, the business continues to make progress in its indirect channel strategy. As Marc mentioned, we continue to sign new Regional Systems Integrators and Location Intelligence partners. Although it will take time to ramp up the indirect pipeline and see a positive impact to our results from the new agreements we have signed, we are pleased with the progress we've made in building out this new channel. 
In the meantime, the company is focused on improving its direct sales channel efforts and growing the license revenue pipeline. In SMB, recurring revenue streams declined at a greater rate than in recent periods, largely due to lower financing and supplies revenue. In North America Mailing, our financing-related fees were not fully normalized due to proactively waiving some fees to allow clients to adjust to new billing formats and based on the timing of when some invoices were sent.
Additionally, supplies revenue declined on lower demand and supplies sales resource mix during the quarter. Given the high-margin nature of these recurring revenue streams, EBIT margin was impacted this quarter. We expect stream revenue, particularly financing revenue, to continue to improve from current levels as a result of financing fees normalizing and supplies sales productivity. Presort revenue growth was muted by the rate change earlier in the year and some lower-margin deals signed recently.
Let me now take you through the third quarter overall financial results. Please note that a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the financial schedules appended to our earnings press release and earnings slides, which are posted on the pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section.
Turning to the results. Revenue for the third quarter totaled $839 million, which was a decline of 2% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and a decline of 2.5% constant currency and 3.5% on a reported basis. Revenue in our SMB segment group declined 6% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and declined 7% on a reported basis. Revenue in our Enterprise Business Solutions Group grew 4% on a constant currency basis adjusted for market exits and grew 2% on a constant currency and 1% on a reported basis. Digital Commerce Solutions revenue grew 2% on a constant currency basis and declined 1% on a reported basis. 
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.44. Adjusted earnings per share results include a positive tax adjustment of $0.07 per share, principally driven by the resolution of tax examinations. GAAP earnings per share were $0.35, which includes $0.06 per share of restructuring charges and a $0.03 per share charge from the announced redemption of the preferred stock of our Pitney Bowes International Holdings or PBIH subsidiary. Free cash flow was $119 million and we generated $137 million in cash from operations on a GAAP basis. In comparison to prior year, free cash flow was lower mostly due to the timing of accounts payable. 
During the quarter, the company used its cash to pay $35 million in dividends to common shareholders, $25 million for the Maponics acquisition and $17 million for restructuring payments. From a debt perspective, the company issued new 5-year 3 3/8% notes for $600 million. This will be a debt-neutral transaction as a portion was used to pay down our commercial paper balance during the quarter and the remaining $300 million is being used to redeem our PBIH preferred securities.
Turning to the income statement. As a reminder, this information is on an adjusted basis and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the financial schedules appended to our earnings press release and earnings slides, which are posted on the pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section. 
Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT was $146 million this quarter, which was $27 million lower than the prior year as a result of reduced revenue, particularly in North American Mailing and software. Adjusted EBIT margin was 17.4%. Adding back depreciation and amortization, adjusted EBITDA was $197 million for the quarter. 
SG&A for the quarter was $300 million, which was $9 million or 3% lower than the prior year. As a percent of revenue, SG&A was 35.8%, which was 20 basis points higher than the prior year. SG&A declined in absolute terms when compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower employee-related costs. In support of our savings objectives around operational excellence, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $16 million at the end of the quarter for actions taken to improve operational efficiency and productivity across our business portfolio.
Net interest expense, which includes financing interest, was $35 million, a decline of $2 million when compared to the prior year. Average outstanding borrowings during the quarter were $246 million higher than the prior year. The average interest rate this quarter was 4.45%, which was about 77 basis points lower than the prior year. The effective tax rate on adjusted earnings for the quarter was 21.9%. The lower tax rate this quarter is principally related to the favorable resolution of tax examinations. You may recall that we had a higher tax rate in both the first and second quarters of this year. On a year-to-date basis and including this quarter's tax benefits, our tax rate on adjusted earnings is 31.5%. We, therefore, expect our annual tax rate to be at the low end of our stated range of 33% to 35%.
Now I'd like to discuss the third quarter results for each of our business segments. This information can also be found in our earnings press release and the slides that we posted to the pitneybowes.com website under the Investor Relations section.
In North American Mailing, revenue was $330 million and EBIT was $139 million. The revenue decline rate this quarter was an improvement from second quarter, which was impacted by the new enterprise business platform cutover. Equipment sales declined 1% compared to prior year, returning to levels similar to pre-go-live of the new platform. As Marc noted earlier, in October, we added the SendPro 300 to the growing family of connected mailing and shipping devices and apps. 
As I mentioned earlier, recurring revenue streams declined at a high single-digit rate, largely driven by lower financing-related fees and supplies revenues. The level of financing-related fees were not fully normalized due to proactively waiving some fees to allow clients to adjust to new billing formats and based on the timing of when some invoices were sent. Additionally, supplies revenue declined on lower demand and supplies sales resource mix during the quarter. We expect stream revenue, particularly financing revenue, to continue to improve from current levels as a result of financing fees normalizing and supplies sales productivity. EBIT margin was 42%, which was 310 basis points lower than prior year and mostly the result of the decline in higher-margin recurring revenue streams. 
In International Mailing, revenue was $96 million and EBIT was $10 million. Excluding the effects of currency movements and market exits, revenue declined 3.5% compared to prior year and equipment sales were flat. Equipment sales benefited from growth, most notably in France, Italy and Japan, but were mostly offset by a decline in the U.K. Recurring revenue streams declined, driven by lower supplies and rental revenues. EBIT margin was 10.2%, which was relatively flat to prior year as a decline in high-margin recurring revenue streams was offset by lower operating expenses. 
Turning to Enterprise Business Solutions. Overall, this segment group's revenue grew 2% on a constant currency basis, which is in line with our long-term expectations. Revenue grew 4% when adjusting for currency and Production Mail market exits. In Production Mail, revenue was $106 million and EBIT was $16 million. Equipment sales grew 27% over prior year due to higher sorter, inserter and print equipment placements as a result of a number of large client installations in the quarter. Support services revenue declined as a result of the continuing shift from in-house mail production to third-party service bureaus who tend to self-service as well as reduced service revenue associated with the market exits. EBIT margin was 14.8%, which was an improvement of 260 basis points from prior year due to service delivery cost management initiatives and lower sales and marketing costs.
In Presort Services, revenue was $114 million, and EBIT was $19 million. Revenue and EBIT margin were impacted this quarter by a decline in the average revenue per piece of mail processed as a result of the rate change earlier in the year and some recently signed lower-margin deals. EBIT margin was 16.8%, which was a decline of about 560 basis points versus prior year, primarily due to the revenue decline and increased labor costs.
For the Digital Commerce Solutions Group, in Software Solutions, revenue was $89 million and EBIT was $10 million. Revenue declined from prior year due to lower Customer Information Management and Location Intelligence licensing revenues but benefited from growth in Customer Engagement Software licenses. As Marc outlined and I noted earlier, we are actively signing up new systems integrators and other partners as part of our continued focus on expanding the indirect channel. And while we continue to make good progress in expanding the indirect channel and training partner sales and technical resources, it will take time before results reflect substantial revenue from partner-led deals. The business also continues to improve its direct sales efficiency to grow the pipeline of license deals. EBIT margin was 11.6%, which was a decline of 340 basis points versus prior year, mostly due to the lower licensing revenue. 
In Global Ecommerce, revenue was $104 million and EBIT was $4 million. As I mentioned earlier, this quarter included a full quarter of Borderfree results in both periods. Excluding the impacts of currency, our marketplace and retail revenues grew 17% from prior year on strong growth in the U.K. outbound shipments. U.S. outbound marketplace grew despite a stronger U.S. dollar versus prior year as well as some temporary disruption on demand for parcel shipments from the U.S. to Canada prior to the resolution of the Canada Post labor dispute. Domestic office shipping revenue declined from prior year, which reduced overall revenue growth for the Global Ecommerce segment this quarter. 
EBIT margin was 4.2%, which was an increase of 550 basis points versus the prior year. However, as I noted earlier, the Global Ecommerce segment had an 11% EBITDA margin this quarter. This better reflects the profit and cash improvements post the Borderfree acquisition. The EBITDA margin improvement is due to the revenue growth as well as the synergy savings from the Borderfree integration, which more than offset continued investment in the business.
That concludes my comments on our financial performance for the quarter. Now I'd like to discuss our annual guidance. The company expects improving trends in the business in the fourth quarter as a result of actions taken to achieve its long-term strategic initiatives. These initiatives include the initial benefits of the implementation of our enterprise business platform, new product introductions and continued enhancements of our channel strategy, which will benefit the fourth quarter with increasing contribution into 2017. 
For 2016, the company expects to be at the low end of its annual guidance range for revenue and adjusted earnings per share. For the full year 2016, we expect revenue on a constant currency basis to be in the range of a 1% decline to 3% decline when compared to 2015. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.75 to $1.82, adjusted earnings per share guidance excludes the year-to-date charges of $0.22 per share primarily related to restructuring and asset impairments. And we expect free cash flow to be in a range of $400 million to $450 million. 
Also as a reminder, the company is hosting its annual Analyst Day on December 6 in New York City, at which time, we'll provide an update on our strategy. Please visit our Investor Relations website for further details on registering to attend or viewing the webcast online for this event.
Operator, that concludes my remarks. Please open the line for questions."

We did do some resource mix shift during the quarter. That probably cost us a little bit. What I mean by that is we had more resources were focused on digital access and digital selling for supplies versus direct selling or inside sales selling supplies. We also had a small impact related to the cutover because of some resources supporting other customer activities other than supplies, in particular the sale of our SmartLink product, which accrues to equipment but is a new product we had to offer. With respect to financing income, there was about $4 million that we would relate to fees that we forewent in the quarter in the interest of getting our clients up to speed in the new invoicing and those types of things. So if you were to adjust for those fees, we would have been down more than mid-single digits, more around 7% on the financing line, which is not out of line with where we've seen that line item over the last several quarters. So I think it's less of a market share issue, more sort of some of these transitional issues around both the implementation of our ERP program as well as in the case of supplies, a combination of resource shift and some lower demand that we did see in the quarter."

I would say in Production Mail, as Mike pointed out, we had good performance, but we also benefited from some large deals. So I would not want to leave you with the expectation that 27% equipment sales is the new normal for DMT. It is a lumpy business, we've been on both sides of that curve since I've here. That said, as we look at how we're positioned for the fourth quarter between backlog and written business, we're encouraged, I'll say it that way. The second dynamic is that I think some of the new product stuff is starting to make a positive difference. This will be a slow ramp because these are businesses that have a big base in their annuity base. So this can take a while for them to have a meaningful impact on the bottom line. But it's clear that the new products are making a difference. And then the third dynamic is as we get through the business platform implementation, we're starting to see sales productivity back to normal levels. If you would unlayer the United States from Canada, we saw, what I would say is, more what we would have expected productivity in the United States 6 months into the deployment of the platform. On the other side of it, Canada, where we're a year in, we've seen improved productivity, which is a very pleasant benefit. It wasn't part of our business case when we contemplated the new business platform. So we would expect to see those same dynamics in the United States and the rest of world over time. How do we add all that up? I'm not sure I'm smart enough to give you advice on how to add all that up. But I would say that as we think about equipment sales in SMB, I think flattish is kind of my interpretation of what stabilization looks like. As it relates to DMT, DMT is going to continue to be lumpy, and then average those dynamics. So I'll turn to Mike to see if he wants to add anything to that."

On the flip side, given the weaker pound, the U.K. outbound has grown very nicely. And I would say the direct relationship between U.S. and U.K. was kind of a net neutral because the growth in demand from the U.S. for U.K. products pretty much offset the reverse of that. So as we look forward to the fourth quarter, we still have a U.S. dollar that's a bit stronger than last year. But what we're seeing is as the currency sort of normalize year-to-year, we don't see rapid or significant movements during the periods, then we tend to see some of that buying come back. The others, we've expanded the number of markets outbound from the U.K. by another 6. And as you know, we've added Australia, although that we are early innings in Australia, have about 7 storefronts opened in Australia at this point."

We had hoped to realize a better yield on that pipe in the third quarter. We lost about a dozen deals at the end. We didn't lose any of -- we did lose about 1 or 2 to competition, most of them were timing from a client perspective. So we still think that pipeline is good for the second half. I appreciate your question on the new channel because it's important that we're clear about this. So if you look at the life cycle of bringing on a new channel, there's inevitably dance upfront in terms of how I'd characterize, dating, starting to get to know each other, a few deals here and there. And then you move into a more substantial relationship, where they actually train their people. And I want to just double-click on that because it's perhaps not as obvious how important that is. So I made the comment that we trained 200 individuals from these principally Regional System Integrators and Global System Integrators. As you all know, those businesses run on an hourly meter. So the fact that they're taking people away from billable work and dedicating them to building their skills tells you a lot. So it's one of the reasons why we continue to think we've got good prospects for that business. But all that being said, you get the relationships, you train the people, and then you start selling. So that takes quarters, not weeks or months. And I would say in the short term, we have continued to be dependent on what our direct sales force can do. As you all know, that's performed, I would say, unevenly over the last couple of years. But we believe we've got better line of sight in the fourth quarter. I think the new channels will begin to come in earnest -- I think we'll see a little bit in the fourth quarter, and then it will continue to build into 2017."

First, we know exactly what is required to finish the year strong and remain confident in our ability to meet our financial commitments. The cumulative actions we have put in place are improving our business performance. And we have a good line of sight to incrementally take out more cost and expense and become even more efficient without sacrificing our long-term objectives.
Second, and I understand this, it is easy to get lost in the numbers and lose sight of how far we have come in order to improve our ability to create value in this business, especially as is the case of software, when we fall short of our expectations. It's only when you step back and look at all the things we've done that you get to the point you begin to realize how much has been accomplished and how much value we're poised to create. 
If you think about it in terms of our strategic initiatives, the stabilization of mail, our go-to-market initiatives are yielding improved results and equipment sales are stabilizing. We are reinventing mail by delivering new products and solutions, like shipping APIs, SendPro, SmartLink and SendPro 300, that are linked to Pitney Bowes Commerce Cloud and leverage our digital assets and capabilities to drive incremental value.
Operational excellence. We've made substantial improvements in our expense structure and are far more productive today that we were a few short years ago. We've improved our balance sheet and we've cut our inventory nearly in half. Critical to our transformation, we're continuing to see operational benefits from our new enterprise business platform, which now covers 80% of our business. We expect to realize increased operational benefits from this platform in the fourth quarter and throughout 2017.
Finally, growing Digital Commerce. In the third quarter, Global Ecommerce grew 17% organically, excluding the impact of currency, and margins improved. 4 years ago, this was a fledgling business. Today, this business is on track to become a substantial part of our portfolio and is growing significantly in the years ahead. The opportunities in the space are significant, and we're just getting started. 
In our software business, we've introduced a number of world-class products in the marketplace, have world-class clients and we're building a robust partner channel that includes Global System Integrators, Regional System Integrators and Location Intelligence partners. We've trained more than 200 partner sales and technical resources that will help drive our business. We have much more work to do in software, but we've made significant improvements already this year.
And finally, that clear water [ph] that I described last quarter, we'll begin to see the investments we've made over the years. We've spent the last 3.5 years building a strong foundation. I would argue, in many ways, the hard part of the work is behind us. We've invested in areas to secure our future growth and taken the necessary steps to acquire or unlock value. We have the right vision, the right strategy, the right products and solutions. As with everything, it's now coming down to execution. And that's on us. With that, I'm looking forward to speaking with you again at Analyst Day in New York City on December 6. Thank you."
