Last night, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings per share of $1.23, which compares to $1.38 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year decline in operating EPS was primarily explai",1034,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings per share of $1.23, which compares to $1.38 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year decline in operating EPS was primarily explained by variable investment income, or VII, which contributed $0.06 per share to operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus $0.18 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Variable investment income can be volatile, largely because it's driven by returns on alternative asset classes. These asset classes have provided strong returns to MetLife shareholders over time. 
In addition to a challenging quarter for VII, broad-based strength in the U.S. dollar remained an earnings headwind. Foreign exchange rates hurt operating earnings from our international businesses by $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter versus the prior-year period. 
MetLife repurchased $822 million of shares in the fourth quarter. With an additional $70 million of buybacks in early January and the $107 million repurchases in the third quarter, we have completed our latest $1 billion repurchase program. 
As you know, on January 12, we announced a plan to pursue the separation of a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business. Until we are in a position to disclose details of the separation plan, we are not able to repurchase shares. While the separation plan has a negative impact on capital management in the near term, we are confident it positions MetLife to be a more compelling capital management story over the long term. Exiting a business that has been central to the company since its founding in 1868 highlights our willingness to take bold actions to maximize shareholder value. Two factors drove our decision to pursue this plan: our strategic focus on businesses with capital requirements in higher cash generation and the potential impact of capital requirements on the variable annuity business. It remained part of a systemically important financial institution or SIFI. 
On the first point, as I have said on prior calls, we have learned a great deal about the cash and capital characteristics of our major business lines as a result of our accelerating value-strategic initiatives. One of the key early learnings from this effort was that the capital requirements and potential volatility of cash flows from VA businesses do not fit well with our overall goal to deliver predictable, recurring free cash flow. Following the separation, we anticipate that MetLife will generate a free cash flow to operating earnings ratio above our current target of 55% to 65% and with less volatility. In our view, the market does not give us appropriate credit for our higher multiple businesses because of concern about the potential risk profile of VA's. By separating out a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail operation, we are addressing this valuation overhang on MetLife. 
On the second point, we believe that regulatory risk is significantly diminished as a result of this plan. The Federal Reserve has made encouraging comments on capital rules for so-called traditional insurance lines, but we are concerned that the Fed could view Variable Annuities as nontraditional, which is how this product is currently categorized by international regulators. Since we believe the stand-alone U.S. Retail business will not be a SIFI, separation mitigates the risk of owners capital rules for the VA business. 
MetLife continues to challenge its SIFI designation core and does not believe any part of our business poses systemic risk. However, we also recognize that the judicial process could take a considerable period of time, especially if either party appeals the district court's decision. In the meantime, adverse capital rules for VAs could put MetLife at a competitive disadvantage. 
Finally, as we said in a press release announcing the separation plan, we believe a stand-alone U.S. Retail business will be more nimble and competitive, benefiting from greater focus, more flexibility in products and operations and a reduced capital and compliance burden. We know you want more information on what the new company will look like, including specifics on strategy and capital. However, we are able to provide only limited information prior to finalizing the form of the separation.
Turning to regulatory matters. I would like to report on 2 developments in New York that will improve MetLife's ability to return excess capital to shareholders. First, in late December 2015, New York changed the law for calculating ordinary dividend capacity for life insurers, creating more level playing field with other states. Previously, an ordinary shareholder dividend could be distributed annually if it do not exceed the lesser of either 10% of statutory surplus or the statutory net gain from operations in the prior year. The legislation adds a greater of tests, which is consistent with existing standard in the majority of states. We had assumed that our New York subsidiary, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, would distribute meaningful capital to the holding company under the old law. However, that assumption was heavily dependent upon extraordinary dividends, which are subject to regulatory approval. While the new law means more predictable, less volatile dividends, it  does not change MetLife's commitment to keeping our businesses very well-capitalized.
Second, the New York Department of Financial Services is unique among state regulators in mandating certain actual assumptions and reserve requirements through an annual special consideration letter. For year-end 2015 financial statements, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company has permitted to aggregate all 3 lines of business, life, annuity and health, to meet the requirements. Previously, health insurance was excluded. Largely because of this change, we anticipate a reserve release of approximately $1 billion based on current capital market conditions. While New York standards remain very conservative relative to other regulatory regimes, the change will make us more competitive with insurers domiciled in other states.
In conclusion, we are committed to making the right decisions to produce substantial and sustainable shareholder value and we are willing to execute bold moves to achieve this goal. Our separation plan will allow MetLife to focus on businesses that have lower capital requirements and greater cash flow generation potential while creating a more nimble and competitive U.S. Retail franchise. 
I will now turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?"

Today, I'll cover our fourth quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. 
Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion or $1.23 per share. This quarter included 3 notable items, which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement, or QFS. First, variable investment income was $71 million after DAC and taxes, which was $137 million or $0.12 per share below the bottom end of our 2015 quarterly planned range. Second, we had higher-than-budgeted catastrophe losses, partially offset by favorable prior year reserve development, which, in total, decreased operating earnings by $9 million or $0.01 per share after tax. Third, we had a onetime tax benefit in Argentina, which increased operating earnings by $31 million or $0.03 per share after tax. This tax benefit was a result of Argentina's currency being devalued by 40% in December, which required the remanagement of U.S. dollar-based reserves into pesos and resulted in an increased tax deduction.
Turning to our bottom line results. Fourth quarter net income was $785 million or $0.70 per share. Net income was $591 million lower than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative net losses and losses related to certain variable annuity guarantees where the hedged assets are more sensitive to market fluctuations than the GAAP treatment for guarantee liabilities. The derivative net losses were primarily driven by higher interest rates. The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included an unfavorable impact of $305 million after tax related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting. Book value per share excluding AOCI other than FCTA was $51.15 as of December 31, up 3% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $42.22 as of December 31, up 5% year-over-year.
With respect to fourth quarter margins, underwriting, primarily in the U.S., was less favorable than the prior year quarter by $0.06 per share after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Property & Casualty, Corporate Benefit Funding and Retail Life were the primary drivers of the year-over-year results. 
In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio including catastrophes was 96.1% in Retail and 99.8% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 89.4% in Retail and 96.4% in group. Overall, P&C underwriting was unfavorable versus the prior-year quarter.
We experienced higher noncatastrophe claim costs primarily due to elevated frequency and severity in our auto business as well as higher catastrophes and homeowners. We continue to increase prices in auto, which should drive improvement in our loss ratios over the next several quarters. 
In Corporate Benefit Funding, or CBF, the less favorable underwriting results versus a strong 4Q '14 was due to lower mortality experience in our payout annuity business and higher claims in our life products. Fourth quarter underwriting results was in the expected range and CBS full year 2015 underwriting margins were in line with our expectations. 
Retail Life's interest adjusted benefit ratio was 54.9%, which is less favorable than the prior year quarter of 53.9% and 53.0% in 4Q '14 after adjusting for a onetime notable item. The year-over-year variance was due to higher average net claims. The fourth quarter benefit ratio is higher relative to our full year 2015 target of 50% to 55% because of seasonally high premiums and the related increase in reserves. 
Finally, the Group Life mortality ratio was 86.8% and the Non-Medical Health benefit ratio was 77.7%, both within their respective ranges.
Turning to investment margins. The average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 170 basis points in the quarter, down 42 basis points year-over-year. Of this decline, 27 basis points was the result of lower variable investment income. 
Pretax variable investment income, or VII, was $109 million, down $216 million versus the prior year quarter due to weak private equity and hedge fund performance. For the full year, pretax VII was $1.2 billion, which was below the bottom end of our 2015 targeted range of $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion. 
Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 168 basis points this quarter, down 15 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline. 
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 24.4%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 23.7% after adjusting for notable items in the prior year quarter. The higher operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily due to lower pension risk transfer sales as well as higher expenses related to onetime items and timing.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $582 million, down 19% versus the prior year quarter and down 10% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Life & Other reported operating earnings of $195 million, down 41% versus the prior year quarter and down 26% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were less favorable underwriting, primarily in P&C and higher expenses. 
Life & Other PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year as growth in the open block was more than offset by runoff of the closed block. Retail Life sales were up 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by term, Whole Life and universal life. 
Annuities reported operating earnings of $387 million, up 1% versus the prior year quarter and up 3% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were improved investment margins as well as favorable experience, which were partially offset by higher expenses and negative fund flows. 
Total annuity sales were $2.5 billion in the quarter, up 23% year-over-year. We continue to see good momentum in our index link annuity shield level selector. Shield sales were $361 million in the quarter, which were almost triple the sales in the prior-year period. Also, our VA guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, continues to gain acceptance in the market and drove VA sales of $1.8 billion this quarter, an increase of 13% year-over-year.
Group voluntary/worksite benefits, or GVWB, reported operating earnings of $214 million, down 10% versus the prior year quarter and down 5% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were less favorable underwriting in auto and lower investment margins. GVWB PFOs were $4.3 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Sales were up 14% year-over-year with growth in core and voluntary products. 
Corporate Benefit Funding, or CBF, reported operating earnings of $286 million, down 21% versus the prior year quarter and down 18% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers are low investment and underwriting margins. CBF PFOs were $886 million, down 39% year-over-year due to strong pension risk transfer, or PRT, sales in the prior year quarter. Excluding PRT sales, PFOs were up 39% due to strong sales in structured settlements and institutional income annuities. 
Latin America reported operating earnings of $115 million, down 1% from the prior year quarter but up 24% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, Latin American operating earnings were up 14% on a constant currency basis. The key driver was business growth.
U.S. Direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $8 million versus the $22 million loss in the prior-year quarter reflecting lower expenses. Latin America PFOs were $1 billion, down 2%, but up 17% on a constant currency basis, with growth across the region despite the challenging environment. Total Latin America sales increased 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to direct marketing in the region.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $290 million, down 15% from the prior year quarter and down 9% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 6% on a constant currency basis driven by favorable business growth and lower taxes, primarily due to change in the Japan tax rate from 31% to 29%. Asia PFOs were $2 billion, down 11% from the prior-year quarter and down 3% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for the withdrawal of single premium A&H products in Japan, which did not meet our hurdle rates in the current interest rate environment, premium fees and other revenues increased 2% on a constant currency basis. Discontinuing of sales single premium A&H products is a good example of our focus on cash, return on capital and payback periods more so than GAAP metrics. We estimate the statutory IRR on single premium A&H is 7% with a 14-year payback period, assuming mean reversion for interest rates. The product looks even worse if we assume current low rates persist. While these products could contribute meaningful revenue and operating earnings on a GAAP basis, the economic returns are unattractive. 
For full year 2015, Asia PFOs were up 4% on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were down 1% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, representing the net impact of management actions taken across the product portfolio to improve value creation and growth in targeted markets.
In Japan, 2015 third sector sales were up 11% versus 2014. Our expectation is for Japan third sector sales to be down 10% to 15% in 2016 as a result of actions to improve value, including the impact from suspension of our single premium A&H products. Excluding the impact of these actions, our expectation is underlying growth in Japan third sector sales will be consistent with our prior guidance of mid to high single digits.
EMEA operating earnings were $54 million, down 16% year-over-year and down 2% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for onetime tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2014, operating earnings were up 32% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by business growth, particularly in the U.K. and the Middle East. EMEA PFOs were $625 million, down 7% from the prior-year period, but up 3% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact from the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year quarter, PFOs were up 10% driven by Gulf, Turkey and the U.K. Total EMEA sales declined 11% on a constant currency basis due to strong employee benefit sales in the Middle East and the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior-year quarter. 
In Corporate & Other, I would like to remind you the timing of our preferred dividend payments. With our refinancing discussed on our second quarter 2015 call, we now paid dividends on our $1.5 billion series C preferred stock on a semiannual basis. As a result, you will see preferred dividends paid in the second and fourth quarters of approximately $40 million related to the security. On an annualized basis, the lower dividend would generate a net savings of approximately $20 million during the first 5-year fixed term of the security.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.4 billion at December 31, up from $5.5 billion at September 30. This amount includes inflows from our subsidiary dividends and the issuance of senior debt offset by share repurchases, the payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses. In addition, our 2015 free cash flow ratio was 63% of operating earnings after adjusting for the third quarter noncash charges of $792 million after tax. 
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. While we have not completed our risk-based capital calculations for 2015, we estimate our combined U.S. RBC ratio will be above 450%. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 936% as of the third quarter 2015, which is the latest public data. 
In conclusion, fourth quarter operating earnings were below expectations as a result of lower investment margins, primarily due to VII, ongoing pressure from foreign currency, less favorable underwriting and higher expenses. While the current environment remains challenging, we are confident that our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.

Just recapping the fourth quarter, I mean certainly we were disappointed in the performance of the alternative portfolio, both private equity and hedge funds materially underperformed our plan, and that's been somewhat unusual. But anyway, that's really what happened. Prepayments were still very strong in the fourth quarter. And as we look forward to this year, you talked about first quarter, obviously the markets sort of came out again on the wrong foot perhaps, a lot more volatility than expected. We don't see any reason to change the plan yet. We'll see how it unfolds. Obviously, there's a lag in the portfolios, one quarter on PE, one month on hedge funds. So you can sort of look what has transpired. But I'd also remind you that when we look at correlation, others kind of a directional correlation, correlation isn't really that high in trying to compare exactly. So we're sort of sticking with the plan for now. I would also say that we've engaged in some repositioning in the portfolio. During the course of the latter half of last year, we reduced the alternative portfolio by about $1 billion, split between the hedge fund and private equity portfolios, really concentrating on the managers and strategies that have been the longer-term stronger performers for us, and that we feel are confident are going to deliver that performance going forward. Like Steve said in his opening remarks, this is a portfolio that has provided strong returns for us and for our shareholders over some period of time. We expect that will continue to do so.

Certainly, short term the falling interest rate had a negative also had a positive impact on the SMR as the asset values would appreciate but have potential negative impact on our U.S. GAAP earnings due to lower investment income, and that's very manageable. It's immaterial in the bigger picture of things. Over the long term, a continued lower rate situation can accredit drag on earnings impacted by reductions to NII, earnings and distributable cash. But as those Japanese yen yields reduced, foreign currency products may become more popular, supporting our existing strategy to move away from the yen products to foreign currency products. On the yen products themselves, we've taken significant action on our portfolio well in advance of the recent BOJ announcement. So what we've done is to derisk or to reduce the focus on our yen life portfolio by reducing commissions in that area, doubling the ticket size, continuing to focus on packaging of A&H products to enhance the returns and also to incentivize some of the FX life products. And we took that action at the back end of the third quarter. And if you see from the sales results in terms of the life business in Japan for the fourth quarter, it was up 2% year on year for the fourth quarter and the mix of that underneath that is quite interesting because the foreign currency life is up and the yen life is down, which is exactly what we wanted to happen.

Last night, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings per share of $1.23, which compares to $1.38 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year decline in operating EPS was primarily explai",1042,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings per share of $1.23, which compares to $1.38 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year decline in operating EPS was primarily explained by variable investment income, or VII, which contributed $0.06 per share to operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus $0.18 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Variable investment income can be volatile, largely because it's driven by returns on alternative asset classes. These asset classes have provided strong returns to MetLife shareholders over time. 
In addition to a challenging quarter for VII, broad-based strength in the U.S. dollar remained an earnings headwind. Foreign exchange rates hurt operating earnings from our international businesses by $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter versus the prior year period. 
MetLife repurchased $822 million of shares in the fourth quarter. With an additional $70 million of buybacks in early January and the $107 million of repurchases in the third quarter, we have completed our latest $1 billion repurchase program. 
As you know, on January 12, we announced a plan to pursue the separation of a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business. Until we are in a position to disclose details of the separation plan, we are not able to repurchase shares. While the separation plan has a negative impact on capital management in the near term, we are confident it positions MetLife to be a more compelling capital management story over the long term. Exiting a business that has been central to the company since its founding in 1868 highlights our willingness to take bold actions to maximize shareholder value. Two factors drove our decision to pursue this plan: our strategic focus on businesses with capital requirements in higher cash generation and the potential impact of capital requirements on the variable annuity business if it remained part of a systemically important financial institution, or SIFI. 
On the first point, as I have said on prior calls, we have learned a great deal about the cash and capital characteristics of our major business lines as a result of our accelerating value-strategic initiatives. One of the key early learnings from this effort was that the capital requirements and potential volatility of cash flows from the VA businesses do not fit well with our overall goal to deliver predictable, recurring free cash flow. Following the separation, we anticipate that MetLife will generate a free cash flow to operating earnings ratio above our current target of 55% to 65% and with less volatility. In our view, the market does not give us appropriate credit for our higher-multiple businesses because of concern about the potential risk profile of VAs. By separating out a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail operation, we are addressing this valuation overhang on MetLife. 
On the second point, we believe that regulatory risk is significantly diminished as a result of this plan. The Federal Reserve has made encouraging comments on capital rules for so-called traditional insurance lines, but we are concerned that the Fed could view variable annuities as nontraditional, which is how this product is currently categorized by international regulators. Since we believe the stand-alone U.S. Retail business would not be a SIFI, separation mitigates the risk of onerous capital rules for the VA business. 
MetLife continues to challenge its SIFI designation in court, and does not believe any part of our business poses systemic risk. However, we also recognize that the judicial process could take a considerable period of time, especially if either party appeals the district court's decision. In the meantime, adverse capital rules for VAs could put MetLife at a competitive disadvantage. 
Finally, as we said in a press release announcing the separation plan, we believe a stand-alone U.S. Retail business will be more nimble and competitive, benefiting from greater focus, more flexibility in products and operations and a reduced capital and compliance burden. We know you want more information on what the new company will look like, including specifics on strategy and capital. However, we are able to provide only limited information prior to finalizing the form of the separation.
Turning to regulatory matters. I would like to report on 2 developments in New York that will improve MetLife's ability to return excess capital to shareholders. First, in late December 2015, New York changed the law for calculating ordinary dividend capacity for life insurers, creating a more level playing field with other states. Previously, an ordinary shareholder dividend could be distributed annually if it did not exceed the lesser of either 10% of statutory surplus or the statutory net gain from operations in the prior year. The legislation adds a greater of test [ph], which is consistent with the existing standard in the majority of states. We had assumed that our New York subsidiary, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, would distribute meaningful capital to the holding company under the old law. However, that assumption was heavily dependent upon extraordinary dividends, which are subject to regulatory approval. While the new law means more predictable, less volatile dividends, it  does not change MetLife's commitment to keeping our businesses very well capitalized.
Second, the New York Department of Financial Services is unique among state regulators in mandating certain actuarial assumptions and reserve requirements through an annual special consideration letter. For year-end 2015 financial statements, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company has permitted to aggregate all 3 lines of business, life, annuity and health, to meet the requirements. Previously, health insurance was excluded. Largely because of this change, we anticipate a reserve release of approximately $1 billion based on current capital market conditions. While New York standards remain very conservative relative to other regulatory regimes, the change will make us more competitive with insurers domiciled in other states.
In conclusion, we are committed to making the right decisions to produce substantial and sustainable shareholder value, and we are willing to execute bold moves to achieve this goal. Our separation plan will allow MetLife to focus on businesses that have lower capital requirements and greater cash flow generation potential while creating a more nimble and competitive U.S. Retail franchise. 
I will now turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?"

I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. 
Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion or $1.23 per share. This quarter included 3 notable items, which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement, or QFS. First, variable investment income was $71 million after DAC and taxes, which was $137 million or $0.12 per share below the bottom end of our 2015 quarterly plan range. Second, we had higher-than-budgeted catastrophe losses, partially offset by favorable prior year reserve development which, in total, decreased operating earnings by $9 million or $0.01 per share after tax. Third, we had a onetime tax benefit in Argentina, which increased operating earnings by $31 million or $0.03 per share after tax. This tax benefit was a result of Argentina's currency being devalued by 40% in December, which required the remeasurement of U.S. dollar-based reserves into pesos and resulted in an increased tax deduction.
Turning to our bottom line results. Fourth quarter net income was $785 million or $0.70 per share. Net income was $591 million lower than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative net losses and losses related to certain variable annuity guarantees where the hedged assets are more sensitive to market fluctuations than the GAAP treatment for guarantee liabilities. The derivative net losses were primarily driven by higher interest rates. The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included an unfavorable impact of $305 million after tax related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $51.15 as of December 31, up 3% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $42.22 as of December 31, up 5% year-over-year.
With respect to fourth quarter margins, underwriting, primarily in the U.S., was less favorable than the prior year quarter by $0.06 per share after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Property & Casualty, Corporate Benefit Funding and Retail Life were the primary drivers of the year-over-year results. 
In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 96.1% in Retail and 99.8% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 89.4% in Retail and 96.4% in group. Overall, P&C underwriting was unfavorable versus the prior year quarter.
We experienced higher noncatastrophe claim costs primarily due to elevated frequency and severity in our auto business as well as higher catastrophes in homeowners. We continue to increase prices in auto, which should drive improvement in our loss ratios over the next several quarters. 
In Corporate Benefit Funding, or CBF, the less favorable underwriting results versus a strong 4Q '14 was due to lower mortality experience in our payout annuity business and higher claims in our Life products. Fourth quarter underwriting results was in the expected range and CBF full year 2015 underwriting margins were in line with our expectations. 
Retail Life's interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 54.9%, which is less favorable than the prior year quarter of 53.9% and 53.0% in 4Q '14 after adjusting for a onetime notable item. The year-over-year variance was due to higher average net claims. The fourth quarter benefit ratio is higher relative to our full year 2015 target of 50% to 55% because of seasonally high premiums and the related increase in reserves. 
Finally, the Group Life mortality ratio was 86.8% and the Non-Medical Health benefit ratio was 77.7%, both within their respective ranges.
Turning to investment margins. The average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 170 basis points in the quarter, down 42 basis points year-over-year. Of this decline, 27 basis points was the result of lower variable investment income. 
Pretax variable investment income, or VII, was $109 million, down $216 million versus the prior year quarter due to weak private equity and hedge fund performance. For the full year, pretax VII was $1.2 billion, which was below the bottom end of our 2015 targeted range of $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion. 
Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 168 basis points this quarter, down 15 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline. 
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 24.4%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 23.7% after adjusting for notable items in the prior year quarter. The higher operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily due to lower pension risk transfer sales as well as higher expenses related to onetime items and timing.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $582 million, down 19% versus the prior year quarter and down 10% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Life & Other reported operating earnings of $195 million, down 41% versus the prior year quarter and down 26% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were less favorable underwriting, primarily in P&C, and higher expenses. 
Life & Other PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year, as growth in the open block was more than offset by runoff of the closed block. Retail Life sales were up 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by Term, Whole Life and universal life. 
Annuities reported operating earnings of $387 million, up 1% versus the prior year quarter and up 3% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were improved investment margins as well as favorable lapse experience, which were partially offset by higher expenses and negative fund flows. 
Total annuity sales were $2.5 billion in the quarter, up 23% year-over-year. We continue to see good momentum in our index-linked annuity, Shield Level Selector. Shield sales were $361 million in the quarter, which were almost triple the sales in the prior year period. Also, our VA guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, continues to gain acceptance in the market and drove VA sales of $1.8 billion this quarter, an increase of 13% year-over-year.
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, or GVWB, reported operating earnings of $214 million, down 10% versus the prior year quarter and down 5% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were less favorable underwriting in auto and lower investment margins. GVWB PFOs were $4.3 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Sales were up 14% year-over-year, with growth in core and voluntary products. 
Corporate Benefit Funding, or CBF, reported operating earnings of $286 million, down 21% versus the prior year quarter and down 18% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were low investment and underwriting margins. CBF PFOs were $886 million, down 39% year-over-year due to strong pension risk transfer, or PRT, sales in the prior year quarter. Excluding PRT sales, PFOs were up 39% due to strong sales in structured settlements and institutional income annuities. 
Latin America reported operating earnings of $115 million, down 1% from the prior year quarter, but up 24% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, Latin American operating earnings were up 14% on a constant currency basis. The key driver was business growth.
U.S. Direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $8 million versus the $22 million loss in the prior year quarter reflecting lower expenses. Latin America PFOs were $1 billion, down 2%, but up 17% on a constant currency basis, with growth across the region despite the challenging environment. Total Latin America sales increased 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to direct marketing in the region.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $290 million, down 15% from the prior year quarter and down 9% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by favorable business growth and lower taxes, primarily due to change in the Japan tax rate from 31% to 29%. Asia PFOs were $2 billion, down 11% from the prior year quarter and down 3% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for the withdrawal of single premium A&H products in Japan, which did not meet our hurdle rates in the current interest rate environment, premium fees and other revenues increased 2% on a constant currency basis. Discontinuing the sale of single premium A&H products is a good example of our focus on cash, return on capital and payback periods, more so than GAAP metrics. We estimate the statutory IRR on single premium A&H is 7% with a 14-year payback period, assuming mean reversion for interest rates. The product looks even worse if we assume current low rates persist. While these products could contribute meaningful revenue and operating earnings on a GAAP basis, the economic returns are unattractive. 
For full year 2015, Asia PFOs were up 4% on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were down 1% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, representing the net impact of management actions taken across the product portfolio to improve value creation and growth in targeted markets.
In Japan, 2015 third sector sales were up 11% versus 2014. Our expectation is for Japan third sector sales to be down 10% to 15% in 2016 as a result of actions to improve value, including the impact from suspension of our single premium A&H products. Excluding the impact of these actions, our expectation of underlying growth in Japan third sector sales will be consistent with our prior guidance of mid to high single digits.
EMEA operating earnings were $54 million, down 16% year-over-year and down 2% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for a onetime tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2014, operating earnings were up 32% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by business growth, particularly in the U.K. and the Middle East. EMEA PFOs were $625 million, down 7% from the prior year period, but up 3% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact from the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year quarter, PFOs were up 10%, driven by Gulf, Turkey and the U.K. Total EMEA sales declined 11% on a constant currency basis due to strong employee benefit sales in the Middle East and the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year quarter. 
In Corporate & Other, I would like to remind you of the timing of our preferred dividend payments. With our refinancing discussed on our second quarter 2015 call, we now pay dividends on our $1.5 billion Series C preferred stock on a semiannual basis. As a result, you will see preferred dividends paid in the second and fourth quarters of approximately $40 million related to the security. On an annualized basis, the lower dividend will generate a net savings of approximately $20 million during the first 5-year fixed term of the security.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.4 billion at December 31, up from $5.5 billion at September 30. This amount includes inflows from our subsidiary dividend and the issuance of senior debt offset by share repurchases, the payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses. In addition, our 2015 free cash flow ratio was 63% of operating earnings after adjusting for the third quarter noncash charge of $792 million after tax. 
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. While we have not completed our risk-based capital calculations for 2015, we estimate our combined U.S. RBC ratio will be above 450%. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 936% as of the third quarter of 2015, which is the latest public data. 
In conclusion, fourth quarter operating earnings were below expectations as a result of lower investment margins, primarily due to VII, ongoing pressure from foreign currency, less favorable underwriting and higher expenses. While the current environment remains challenging, we are confident that our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions."

Just recapping the fourth quarter, I mean, certainly, we were disappointed in the performance of the alternatives portfolio. Both private equity and hedge funds materially underperformed our plan, and that's been somewhat unusual. But anyway, that's really what happened. Prepayments were still very strong in the fourth quarter. And as we look forward to this year, you talked about first quarter, obviously, the market sort of came out of the gate on the wrong foot, perhaps, a lot more volatility than expected. We don't see any reason to change the plan yet. We'll see how it unfolds. Obviously, there's a lag in the portfolios, 1 quarter on PE, 1 month on hedge funds. So you can sort of look at what has transpired. But I'd also remind you that when we look at correlation, while there's kind of a directional correlation, the correlation isn't really that high in trying to compare it exactly. So we're sort of sticking with the plan for now. I would also say, though, that we've engaged in some repositioning in the portfolio. During the course of the latter half of last year, we reduced the alternative portfolio by about $1 billion, split between the hedge fund and private equity portfolios, really concentrating on the managers and strategies that have been the longer-term stronger performers for us and -- that we feel, are confident are going to deliver that performance going forward. Like Steve said in his opening remarks, this is a portfolio that has provided strong returns for us and for our shareholders over some period of time. We expect it will continue to do so. Obviously, we're managing it and monitoring it very closely, just given what we did late last year. And then particularly the hedge funds, they're a little bit in the spotlight, just given last couple of years of underperformance there. So we're monitoring [ph] it very closely."

Obviously, you guys have taken some action around product offerings, given the interest rate environment. I'm wondering, given Bank of Japan's actions last week and the significant shift in JGB yields across the curve, whether there's something more specifically that has to be done now in response to those actions. I mean, I think there's negative yields all the way up to 9 years on the JGB at this point."

So in the short term, the falling interest rates can have a negative -- or sorry, have a positive impact on the SMR, as the asset values would appreciate; but have potential negative impact on our U.S. GAAP earnings due to lower investment income. And that's very manageable. It's immaterial in the bigger picture of things. Over the long term, a continued lower rate situation is going to create a drag on earnings, impacted by reductions to NII, earnings and distributable cash. But as those Japanese yen yields reduce, foreign currency products may become more popular, supporting our existing strategy to move away from the yen products to foreign currency products. On the yen products themselves, we've taken significant action on our portfolio, well in advance of the recent BoJ announcement. So what we've done is to derisk or to reduce the focus on our yen life portfolio by reducing commissions in that area, doubling the ticket size, continuing to focus on packaging of A&H products to enhance the returns and also to incentivize some of the FX life products. And we took that action at the back end of the third quarter. And if you see from the sales results in terms of the life business in Japan for the fourth quarter, it was up 2% year on year for the fourth quarter. And the mix of that, underneath that, is quite interesting because the foreign currency life is up and the yen life is down, which is exactly what we wanted to happen. And I think you'll see that play out as we go into the rest of 2016."

Last night, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings per share of $1.23, which compares to $1.38 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year decline in operating EPS was primarily explai",1043,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported fourth quarter operating earnings per share of $1.23, which compares to $1.38 per share in the fourth quarter of last year. The year-over-year decline in operating EPS was primarily explained by variable investment income, or VII, which contributes $0.06 per share to operating earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 versus $0.18 in the fourth quarter of 2014. Variable investment income can be volatile, largely because it is driven by returns on alternative asset classes. These asset classes have provided strong returns to MetLife shareholders over time. 
In addition to a challenging quarter for VII, broad-based strength in the U.S. dollar remained an earnings headwind. Foreign exchange rates hurt operating earnings from our international businesses by $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter versus the prior year period. 
MetLife repurchased $822 million of shares in the fourth quarter. With an additional $70 million of buybacks in early January and the $107 million of repurchases in the third quarter, we have completed our latest $1 billion repurchase program. 
As you know, on January 12, we announced a plan to pursue the separation of a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business. Until we are in a position to disclose details of the separation plan, we are not able to repurchase shares. While the separation plan has a negative impact on capital management in the near term, we are confident it positions MetLife to be a more compelling capital management story over the long term. Exiting a business that has been central to the company since its founding in 1868 highlights our willingness to take bold actions to maximize shareholder value. Two factors drove our decision to pursue this plan: our strategic focus on businesses with capital requirements in higher cash generation and the potential impact of capital requirements on the variable annuity business if it remained part of a systemically important financial institution, or SIFI. 
On the first point, as I have said on prior calls, we have learned a great deal about the cash and capital characteristics of our major business lines as a result of our accelerating value strategic initiative. One of the key early learnings from this effort was that the capital requirements and potential volatility of cash flows from the VA businesses do not fit well with our overall goal to deliver predictable, recurring free cash flow. Following the separation, we anticipate that MetLife will generate a free cash flow to operating earnings ratio above our current target of 55% to 65% and with less volatility. In our view, the market does not give us appropriate credit for our higher-multiple businesses because of concern about the potential risk profile of VAs. By separating out a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail operation, we are addressing this valuation overhang on MetLife. 
On the second point, we believe that regulatory risk is significantly diminished as a result of this plan. The Federal Reserve has made encouraging comments on capital rules for so-called traditional insurance lines, but we are concerned that the Fed could view variable annuities as nontraditional, which is how this product is currently categorized by international regulators. Since we believe the stand-alone U.S. Retail business would not be a SIFI, separation mitigates the risk of onerous capital rules for the VA business. 
MetLife continues to challenge its SIFI designation in court, and does not believe any part of our business poses systemic risk. However, we also recognize that the judicial process could take a considerable period of time, especially if either party appeals the district court's decision. In the meantime, adverse capital rules for VAs could put MetLife at a competitive disadvantage. 
Finally, as we said in the press release announcing the separation plan, we believe a stand-alone U.S. Retail business will be more nimble and competitive, benefiting from greater focus, more flexibility in products and operations and a reduced capital and compliance burden. We know you want more information on what the new company will look like, including specifics on strategy and capital. However, we are able to provide only limited information prior to finalizing the form of the separation.
Turning to regulatory matters. I would like to report on 2 developments in New York that will improve MetLife's ability to return excess capital to shareholders. First, in late December 2015, New York changed the law for calculating ordinary dividend capacity for life insurers, creating a more level playing field with other states. Previously, an ordinary shareholder dividend could be distributed annually if it did not exceed the lesser of either 10% of statutory surplus or the statutory net gain from operations in the prior year. The legislation adds a greater of test, which is consistent with the existing standard in the majority of states. We had assumed that our New York subsidiary, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, would distribute meaningful capital to the holding company under the old law. However, that assumption was heavily dependent upon extraordinary dividends, which are subject to regulatory approval. While the new law means more predictable, less volatile dividends, it has not changed MetLife's commitment to keeping our businesses very well capitalized.
Second, the New York Department of Financial Services is unique among state regulators in mandating certain actuarial assumptions and reserve requirements through an annual special consideration letter. For year-end 2015 financial statements, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company is permitted to aggregate all 3 lines of business, life, annuity and health, to meet the requirements. Previously, health insurance was excluded. Largely because of this change, we anticipate a reserve release of approximately $1 billion based on current capital market conditions. While New York standards remain very conservative relative to other regulatory regimes, the change will make us more competitive with insurers domiciled in other states.
In conclusion, we are committed to making the right decisions to produce substantial and sustainable shareholder value, and we are willing to execute bold moves to achieve this goal. Our separation plan will allow MetLife to focus on businesses that have lower capital requirements and greater cash flow generation potential while creating a more nimble and competitive U.S. Retail franchise. 
I will now turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?"

Today, I'll cover our fourth quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. 
Operating earnings in the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion or $1.23 per share. This quarter included 3 notable items, which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement, or QFS. First, variable investment income was $71 million after DAC and taxes, which was $137 million or $0.12 per share below the bottom end of our 2015 quarterly plan range. Second, we had higher-than-budgeted catastrophe losses, partially offset by favorable prior year reserve development which, in total, decreased operating earnings by $9 million or $0.01 per share after tax. Third, we had a onetime tax benefit in Argentina, which increased operating earnings by $31 million or $0.03 per share after tax. This tax benefit was a result of Argentina's currency being devalued by 40% in December, which required the remeasurement of U.S. dollar-based reserves into pesos and resulted in an increased tax deduction.
Turning to our bottom line results. Fourth quarter net income was $785 million or $0.70 per share. Net income was $591 million lower than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative net losses and losses related to certain variable annuity guarantees where the hedged assets are more sensitive to market fluctuations than the GAAP treatment for guaranteed liabilities. The derivative net losses were primarily driven by higher interest rates. The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included an unfavorable impact of $305 million after tax related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $51.15 as of December 31, up 3% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $42.22 as of December 31, up 5% year-over-year.
With respect to fourth quarter margins, underwriting, primarily in the U.S., was less favorable than the prior year quarter by $0.06 per share after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Property & Casualty, Corporate Benefit Funding and Retail Life were the primary drivers of the year-over-year results. 
In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 96.1% in Retail and 99.8% in Group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 89.4% in Retail and 96.4% in Group. Overall, P&C underwriting was unfavorable versus the prior year quarter.
We experienced higher noncatastrophe claim costs primarily due to elevated frequency and severity in our auto business as well as higher catastrophes in homeowners. We continue to increase prices in auto, which should drive improvement in our loss ratios over the next several quarters. 
In Corporate Benefit Funding, or CBF, the less favorable underwriting results versus a strong 4Q '14 was due to lower mortality experience in our payout annuity business and higher claims in our life products. Fourth quarter underwriting results were within the expected range, and CBF's full year 2015 underwriting margins were in line with our expectations. 
Retail life's interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 54.9%, which is less favorable than the prior year quarter of 53.9% and 53.0% in 4Q '14 after adjusting for a onetime notable item. The year-over-year variance was due to higher average net claims. The fourth quarter benefit ratio is higher relative to our full year 2015 target of 50% to 55% because of seasonally high premiums and the related increase in reserves. 
Finally, the Group Life mortality ratio was 86.8% and the Non-Medical Health benefit ratio was 77.7%, both within their respective ranges.
Turning to investment margins. The average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 170 basis points in the quarter, down 42 basis points year-over-year. Of this decline, 27 basis points was the result of lower variable investment income. 
Pretax variable investment income, or VII, was $109 million, down $216 million versus the prior year quarter due to weak private equity and hedge fund performance. For the full year, pretax VII was $1.2 billion, which was below the bottom end of our 2015 targeted range of $1.3 billion to $1.7 billion. 
Product spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 168 basis points this quarter, down 15 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline. 
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 24.4%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 23.7% after adjusting for notable items in the prior year quarter. The higher operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily due to lower pension risk transfer sales as well as higher expenses related to onetime items and timing.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $582 million, down 19% versus the prior year quarter and down 10% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Life & Other reported operating earnings of $195 million, down 41% versus the prior year quarter and down 26% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were less favorable underwriting, primarily in P&C, and higher expenses. 
Life & Other PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year, as growth in the open block was more than offset by runoff of the closed block. Retail Life sales were up 9% year-over-year, primarily driven by Term, Whole Life and universal life. 
Annuities reported operating earnings of $387 million, up 1% versus the prior year quarter and up 3% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were improved investment margins as well as favorable lapse experience, which were partially offset by higher expenses and negative fund flows. 
Total annuity sales were $2.5 billion in the quarter, up 23% year-over-year. We continue to see good momentum in our index-linked annuity, Shield Level Selector. Shield sales were $361 million in the quarter, which were almost triple the sales in the prior year period. Also, our VA guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, FlexChoice, continues to gain acceptance in the market and drove VA sales of $1.8 billion this quarter, an increase of 13% year-over-year.
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, or GVWB, reported operating earnings of $214 million, down 10% versus the prior year quarter and down 5% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were less favorable underwriting in auto and lower investment margins. GVWB PFOs were $4.3 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Sales were up 14% year-over-year, with growth in core and voluntary products. 
Corporate Benefit Funding, or CBF, reported operating earnings of $286 million, down 21% versus the prior year quarter and down 18% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were low investment and underwriting margins. CBF PFOs were $886 million, down 39% year-over-year due to strong pension risk transfer, or PRT, sales in the prior year quarter. Excluding PRT sales, PFOs were up 39% due to strong sales in structured settlements and institutional income annuities. 
Latin America reported operating earnings of $115 million, down 1% from the prior year quarter, but up 24% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, Latin American operating earnings were up 14% on a constant currency basis. The key driver was business growth.
U.S. Direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $8 million versus a $22 million loss in the prior year quarter, reflecting lower expenses. Latin America PFOs were $1 billion, down 2%, but up 17% on a constant currency basis, with growth across the region despite the challenging environment. Total Latin America sales increased 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily due to direct marketing in the region.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $290 million, down 15% from the prior year quarter and down 9% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 6% on a constant currency basis, driven by favorable business growth and lower taxes, primarily due to a change in the Japan tax rate from 31% to 29%. Asia PFOs were $2 billion, down 11% from the prior year quarter and down 3% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for the withdrawal of single premium A&H products in Japan, which do not meet our hurdle rates in the current interest rate environment, premium fees and other revenues increased 2% on a constant currency basis. Discontinuing the sale of single premium A&H products is a good example of our focus on cash, return on capital and payback periods, more so than GAAP metrics. We estimate the statutory IRR on single premium A&H is 7% with a 14-year payback period, assuming mean reversion for interest rates. The product looks even worse if we assume current low rates persist. While these products could contribute meaningful revenue and operating earnings on a GAAP basis, the economic returns are unattractive. 
For full year 2015, Asia PFOs were up 4% on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were down 1% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, representing the net impact of management actions taken across the product portfolio to improve value creation and growth in targeted markets.
In Japan, 2015 third sector sales were up 11% versus 2014. Our expectation is for Japan's third sector sales to be down 10% to 15% in 2016 as a result of actions to improve values, including the impact from suspension of our single premium A&H products. Excluding the impact of these actions, our expectation of underlying growth in Japan third sector sales will be consistent with our prior guidance of mid- to high single digits.
EMEA operating earnings were $54 million, down 16% year-over-year and down 2% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for a onetime tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 2014, operating earnings were up 32% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by business growth, particularly in the U.K. and the Middle East. EMEA PFOs were $625 million, down 7% from the prior year period, but up 3% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact from the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year quarter, PFOs were up 10%, driven by Gulf, Turkey and the U.K. Total EMEA sales declined 11% on a constant currency basis due to strong employee benefit sales in the Middle East and the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year quarter. 
In Corporate & Other, I would like to remind you of the timing of our preferred dividend payments. With our refinancing discussed on our second quarter 2015 call, we now pay dividends on our $1.5 billion Series C preferred stock on a semiannual basis. As a result, you will see preferred dividends paid in the second and fourth quarters of approximately $40 million related to this security. On an annualized basis, the lower dividend will generate a net savings of approximately $20 million during the first 5-year fixed term of the security.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $6.4 billion at December 31, up from $5.5 billion at September 30. This amount includes inflows from our subsidiary dividends and the issuance of senior debt offset by share repurchases, the payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses. In addition, our 2015 free cash flow ratio was 63% of operating earnings after adjusting for the third quarter noncash charge of $792 million after tax. 
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. While we have not completed our risk-based capital calculations for 2015, we estimate our combined U.S. RBC ratio will be above 450%. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 936% as of the third quarter of 2015, which is the latest public data. 
In conclusion, fourth quarter operating earnings were below expectations as a result of lower investment margins, primarily due to VII, ongoing pressure from foreign currency, less favorable underwriting and higher expenses. While the current environment remains challenging, we are confident that our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.

Just in recapping the fourth quarter, I mean, certainly, we were disappointed in the performance of the alternatives portfolio. Both private equity and hedge funds materially underperformed our plan, and that's been somewhat unusual. But anyway, that's really what happened. Prepayments were still very strong in the fourth quarter. And as we look forward to this year, you talked about first quarter, obviously, the market sort of came out of the gate on the wrong foot, perhaps. A lot more volatility than expected. We don't see any reason to change the plan yet. We'll see how it unfolds. Obviously, there's a lag in the portfolios, 1 quarter on PE, 1 month on hedge funds, so you can sort of look at what has transpired. But I'd also remind you that when we look at correlation, while there's kind of a directional correlation, the correlation isn't really that high in trying to compare it exactly. So we're sort of sticking with the plan for now. I would also say, though, that we've engaged in some repositioning in the portfolio. During the course of the latter half of last year, we reduced the alternatives portfolio by about $1 billion, split between the hedge fund and private equity portfolios, really concentrating on the managers and strategies that have been the longer-term stronger performers for us, and that we feel are competent and are going to deliver that performance going forward. Like Steve said in his opening remarks, this is a portfolio that has provided strong returns for us and for our shareholders over some period of time. We expect it will continue to do so. Obviously, we're managing it and monitoring it very closely, just given what we did late last year. And then particularly the hedge funds, they're a little bit in the spotlight, just given the last couple of years of underperformance there. So we're monitoring it very closely."

So in the short term, the falling interest rates are going to have a negative -- or sorry, have a positive impact on the SMR, as the asset values will appreciate; but have potential negative impact on our U.S. GAAP earnings due to lower investment income. And that's very manageable. It's immaterial in the bigger picture of things. Over the long term, a continued lower rate situation is going to create a drag on earnings, impacted by reductions to NII, earnings and distributable cash. But as those Japanese yen yields reduce, foreign currency products may become more popular, supporting our existing strategy to move away from the yen products to foreign currency products. On the yen products themselves, we've taken significant action on our portfolio well in advance of the recent BoJ announcement. So what we've done is to derisk or to reduce the focus on our yen life portfolio by reducing commissions in that area, doubling the ticket size, continuing to focus on packaging of A&H product to enhance their returns and also to incentivize some of the FX life products. And we took that action at the back end of the third quarter. And if you see from the sales results in terms of the life business in Japan for the fourth quarter, it was up 2% year on year for the fourth quarter. And the mix of that, underneath that, is quite interesting because the foreign currency life is up and the yen life is down, which is exactly what we wanted to happen. And I think you'll see that play out as we go into the rest of 2016."

So first of all, there was no change to the guidance we provided in December across all of the key metrics for Asia. And we gave you some, I think, fairly clear guidance in terms of earnings and revenue in the medium term. And we're sticking by that guidance overall. In terms of Japan, we're doing the right thing in terms of creating value for our shareholders in terms of the product portfolio, and those items I responded to one of the prior questions on, in terms of yen life will definitely increase the value of our business. If you look at A&H and the third sector, where we make some very solid margins, we gave earlier guidance of mid- to high single digits. We updated that guidance to a range of 10% to 12%, and we came in at 11%. So I think we've delivered well in terms of that business for this year. And John gave some fairly clear guidance in terms of his prepared remarks as to what's happening with that portfolio overall. So I actually think we've had a fairly solid year in the Asia region overall, with our normalized constant rate earnings of 15% or 16%, which is, again, ahead of guidance. So in conclusion, we're sticking with the prior guidance we've given."

In the third quarter, I had mentioned, and I think so did some of our peers, that miles driven is up. I would also add, and I may have mentioned it in the third quarter as well, that claim costs are up as well, which shouldn't be surprising.

Last night, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $1.20, which compares to $1.44 per share in the first quarter of 2015.

Last night, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $1.20, which compares to $1.44 per share in the first quarter of 2015. The negative impact from market factors more than offset benefit from volume growth. The combination of weak equity markets for most of the quarter, continued strength in the U.S. dollar and low interest rates reduced operating earnings by $0.16 per share versus the prior year period.
In addition, variable investment income, or VII, declined by $0.12 per share. Variable investment income can be volatile, largely because it's driven by the performance of alternative asset classes. We believe some earnings variability is an acceptable risk as these asset classes have provided strong returns to MetLife shareholders over time.
To illustrate, VII was better than planned in 7 of the past 10 years, with a cumulative positive variance of $505 million after tax. This favorable performance to plan is noteworthy given that the time period includes the financial crisis.
Despite the sluggish global economy, we estimate overall volume growth was 3% year-over-year, driven by 11% growth in our non-U.S. businesses. In addition, the value generated from new business written has improved, as a result of our accelerating value strategic initiative.
For example, in Japan, our second largest market, foreign currency denominated product sales were up more than 50% in the first quarter. We are focused on growth in this area because non-Yen projects have very attractive cash return characteristics.
In contrast, Yen Whole Life sales were down 60% in the quarter. This sales decline was intentional as it is difficult for this product to generate attractive returns and acceptable cash payback periods in a negative interest rate environment.
Overall, top line growth of the challenge in the current low rate environment. However, as I often tell my team, external factors are beyond our control so we must focus on what we can control.
In this instance, to combat the pressures of growth from low rates in a weak macroeconomic environment, we must address our cost structure. It is critical that we achieve a sustained reduction in unit costs and our top priority is addressing elevated overhead expenses that will result in the separation of the U.S. Retail business. It is too early to provide specifics on expense reduction, but we believe that the separated business and the remaining company combined will have a lower cost base than MetLife does today.
Now, I would like to provide an update on regulatory matters. On March 30, Judge Rosemary Collier of the U.S. District Court from the District of Columbia, rescinded MetLife's designation as a systemically important financial institution, or SIFI. In a carefully reasoned decision, Judd Collier found that the Financial Stability Oversight Council's designation of MetLife was arbitrary and capricious. Her ruling said that FSOC had failed to: One, conduct the vulnerability assessment of MetLife as required by FSOC own regulations and guidance; two, adhere to any discernible standard in determining that material financial distress at MetLife could threaten U.S. financial stability; and three, consider the consequences and cost of designation as required by Supreme Court precedent.
None of these is purely a procedural matter. For example, the judge noted that FSOC defined a threat to financial stability as one that would ""sufficiently be severe to conflict significant damage on the broader economy."" yet rather than apply its own standards, the judge found that FSOC ""hardly adhere to any standard when it came to assessing MetLife's threat to U.S. financial stability."" She said she could not uphold a finding for MetLife's distress -- finding that MetLife's distress that would damage the broader economy when, ""FSOC refused to undertake that analysis itself.""
On a April 8, FSOC appealed the judge's ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In MetLife's initial legal complaint filed last year, we offered 10 reasons or accounts as to why our SIFI designation should be lifted. Judge Collier ruled in favor of MetLife on 3 of those 10 counts. She rejected our argument on 1 count, a technical question of whether MetLife qualifies as a U.S. nonbank financial company. She's not rule on the other 6 counts, including those based on constitutional grounds. On appeal, all 10 counts may be brought before the D.C. Circuit.
Some of the commentary on our SIFI case has portraited as an effort to undermine the Dodd-Frank Act. We strongly disagree with this characterization. The right to seek judicial review of an FSOC designation is part of the Dodd-Frank Act itself as enacted by Congress.
In seeking judicial review of FSOC's designation of MetLife, we are upholding the process established by Dodd-Frank, not undermining it. Let me be clear, MetLife supports prudent regulation of U.S. life insurance industry. We make long-term promises and consumer confidence depends on the ability of the life insurance industry to honor its commitments.
In MetLife's case, we have been keeping our promise since 1868 through wars, boon times, panics and recessions. It's worth remembering that we came through the 2008 financial crisis in such strong shape, then 2010 we're able to buy alnico from AIG for $16 billion, money that AIG used to help repay U.S. taxpayers.
One of the crisis that we received most frequently since judge Collier's decision, is whether we still plan to pursue the separation of a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business. The answer is yes.
As we explained, we announced the planned separation in January, the decision was driven by both strategic and regulatory factors. Strategically, the imperative of cash generation is stronger than ever, especially in light of a lower for longer interest rate environment. And from a regulatory perspective, while we are pleased that our SIFI status has been rescinded, FSOC could attempt to redesignate MetLife at a later date.
We are keeping open our options with regard to what form and separation could take, including an initial public offering, a spin off or a sale. To prepare for the possibility of a separation in the form of a public offering, we expect to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission sometime this summer.
Regardless of the form, the separated business will be leaner and more focused. With the sale of the MetLife premier client group to MassMutual, U.S. Retail will be only a manufacturer of annuity and life insurance products, not a distributor.
As I noted in my annual letter to shareholders last week, expense of the advisory force was preventing us from clearing MetLife's hurdle rate on much of the new business written through that channel. By existing proprietary retail distribution in the U.S., we anticipate run rate savings -- expense savings of approximately $250 million per year after tax, which will be split about evenly between the separated business and the rest of MetLife.
I am confident that MetLife is taking the right steps to generate long-term shareholder value. We are changing our product mix to adapt to the external environment. We are separating the business on which the company was founded to strengthen the amount and timing of cash generation. And we are focusing on expenses to ensure both the separated business and MetLife have a competitive cost structure.
Finally this morning, I would like to discuss some changes to our finance statement. As we announced in news release a short while ago, Marlene Debel, our treasure, is becoming CFO for the U.S. This is a much deserved opportunity for Marlene. Mike Walsh, our CFO for the Americas, will be retiring after 28 years at MetLife. Mike has been a trusted business partner to many of us. We thank Mike for his many valuable contributions and wish him all the best in his retirement.
John McAllen, who is well known to many of you as our former Head of Investor Relations, will become our new Treasurer; and Ed Spehar, our current head of Investor Relations will assume John's role as CFO of EMEA. I told John he has done such a good job that he gets to come home from Europe. And I told Ed, he has done such a good job, he gets to go to Europe. Congratulations, Marlene, Mike, John and Ed as you embark on the next chapters on your careers and lives.
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?"

I'm very proud of my finance leadership team.
Today, I'll cover first quarter results, including the discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.
Operating earnings in the first quarter were $1.3 billion or $1.20 per share. This quarter included 3 notable items, which are highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement, or QFS.
First, variable investment income was $109 million after DAC and taxes, which was $86 million or $0.08 per share below the bottom end of our 2016 quarterly plan range.
Second, we have higher than expected catastrophe losses, which decreased operating earnings by $45 million or $0.04 per share after tax. Third, we had a onetime tax benefit in Japan, partially offset by a tax charge in Chile, which increased operating earnings by $10 million or $0.01 per share after tax. The tax rate in Japan decreased 60 basis points, resulting in a $20 million onetime benefit, partially offset by a $10 million charge from a 200-basis-point increase in MetLife's tax rate in Chile.
Turning to our bottom line results. First quarter net income was $2.2 billion or $1.98 per share. Net income was $866 million, higher than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative net gains driven by lower interest rates and the financial impact of converting Japan operations to calendar year reporting. Japan's results, including operating earnings for the month of December 2015, were reflected below the line in order to eliminate the accounting lag.
The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included a favorable impact of $824 million after tax, related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $53.31 as of March 31, up 6% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $44.17 as of March 31, up 7% year-over-year.
With respect to first quarter margins, underwriting in the Americas was favorable versus the prior year quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Favorable results in Group Life, Retail Life and Latin America were offset by less favorable results in Non-Medical Health and Property & Casualty.
Total company underwriting margins were essentially in line with the prior year quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio was 85.9%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 90.7%, and the low end of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. We experienced lower claim severity versus the prior year quarter, while frequency was in line with our expectations.
Retail Life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 54.8%, favorable to the prior-year quarter of 59.3%, and within the annual target range of 51% to 56%. The year-over-year improvement was driven by a return to more normal average net claims. As we have highlighted, 1Q '15 had higher than normal accidental death, particularly accident and falls, which we believe were related to adverse winter weather.
In Latin America, underwriting was favorable to the prior year quarter and relative to expectations, primarily driven by lower loss ratios in Mexico. The Non-Medical Health interest adjusted loss ratio was 83.2%, unfavorable to a strong prior year quarter of 77.0%, and above the top end of the annual target range of 77% to 82%. The key drivers were higher seasonal utilization in dental and higher claim severity in disability as well as favorable LTC underwriting in the prior year quarter.
The first quarter did in the seasonally weak quarter for dental and disability. This seasonality was not apparent in the Non-Medical Health interest adjusted loss ratio during the past 2 years, largely because dental utilization was low due to adverse winter weather.
In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio, including catastrophe, was 104.4% of retail and 102.9% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 86.3% in retail and 93.0% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was in line with expectations, but above a strong prior year quarter of 79.4% of retail and 89.7% in group. We experienced higher catastrophe losses in our homeowners business and modestly higher severity in our auto business. However, auto results strengthened this quarter, and we expect further improvements throughout 2016 as a result of rate increases.
Turning to investment margins. The average of our 4 U.S. products spreads in our QFS was 170 basis points in the quarter, down 41 basis points year-over-year. Approximately 1/2 of this decline, or 20 basis points, was a result of lower variable investment income.
Pretax variable investment income, or VII, was $165 million, down $206 million versus the prior quarter, mostly due to weak hedge fund performance. Our allocation to hedge fund is approximately 40 basis points of the total investment portfolio, and we plan to further reduce our exposure.
Products spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 161 basis points this quarter, down 21 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields account for most of this decline.
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.8%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 23.5%. The higher operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily driven to the write-off of a net reinsurance receivable.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $532 million, down 19% versus the prior year quarter and down 11% after adjusting for notable items in both periods.
Life & Other reported operating earnings of $172 million, down 15% versus the prior year quarter, but up 7% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary driver was net favorable underwriting, as life mortality rebounded from unfavorable prior year quarter and property and casualty non-catastrophe results returned to more normal levels. Underwriting improvement was partially offset by lower investment margins.
Life & Other PFOs were $2 billion, down 1% year-over-year as growth in the open block was more than offset by run-off of the closed block. Life & Other sales were up 1% year-over-year, as a 15% increase in P&C was mostly offset by a 5% decline in life sales, mainly in whole life.
Whole Life volumes were strong, but we sold this high face policies versus the prior year quarter. Annuities reported operating earnings of $360 million, down 20% versus the prior year quarter, and down 19% after adjusting for VII below planned this quarter.
The key drivers were less favorable market impact, negative fund flows and higher expenses. The initial impact -- the initial market impact reduced operating earnings by $5 million after tax, which compares to a $26 million benefit in the prior year quarter.
Total annuity sales were $2.3 billion in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year. We continued to see good momentum in our index linked annuity, Shield Level Selector. Shield sales were $411 million in the quarter, or triple the sales in the prior year period, and 14% sequentially. VA sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, essentially flat to the prior year quarter.
Group voluntary and worksite benefits, or GVWB, reported operating earnings of $174 million, down 24% versus the prior year quarter, and down 20% as adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were less favorable underwriting as compared to a strong prior year quarter and lower investment margins. GVWB PFOs were $4.6 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Sales were up 28% year-over-year, with growth in group and voluntary products.
I know this segment's earnings were below consensus estimates, which I believe relates to seasonality that was not evident during the past 2 years. In terms of the full-year outlook for GVWB, the near-term guidance on certain key items provided on our December outlook call still applies.
Corporate Benefits Funding, or CBF, reported operating earnings of $295 million, down 20% versus the prior year quarter and down 12% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key driver was lower investment margins.
CBF PFOs were $508 million, down 6% year-over-year, due to lower pension risk transfers, or PRT. As we have noted before, PRT sales can be lumpy, but we continued to see a good pipeline and remained optimistic about future growth opportunities.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $137 million, up 5% from the prior year quarter, and up 32% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, Latin America operating earnings were up 45% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were volume growth as well as favorable investment and underwriting margins.
U.S. Direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $14 million versus $18 million loss in the prior year quarter, reflecting growth and lower expenses. Latin America PFOs were $966 million, down 4%, but up 14% on a constant currency basis. Excluding U.S. Direct PFOs, which were up 35% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, Latin America PFOs were up 12% on a constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region.
Total Latin America sales were flat year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Excluding U.S. Direct sales, which were down 18% year-over-year, LatAm sales were up 3% on a constant currency basis. This growth was primarily driven by direct marketing, partially offset by lower foreign sales in Mexico in the current quarter, as well as a large group case sales in the prior quarter.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $305 million, down 7% from the prior year quarter, and 5% on a constant currency basis, after adjusting for notable items in the current quarter. Strong volume growth across the region was more than offset by lower fixed annuity surrender fees in Japan as well as higher project costs and other expenses in Japan -- in the region.
Asia PFOs were $2 billion, down 7% from the prior year quarter on both a reported and constant currency basis. There were 2 factors that reduced Asia PFOs this quarter. First, as a result of a regulatory change, we are now required to use the equity method of accounting for the 26% ownership interest in our India joint venture. As a result, beginning in 1Q '16, we are no longer reporting 100% of India PFOs in Asia PFOs. Instead, the financial results of our 26% interest will be reflected as net investment income in Asia. This accounting change is consistent with the treatment of MetLife's other joint ventures in Asia, which include China, Malaysia and Vietnam.
In addition, Asia PFOs were negatively impacted by the withdrawal of single premium A&H yen products in Japan. As previously noted, these products do not meet our hurdle rates in the current interest rate environment.
Excluding the impact of a de-consolidation of our India operations, and the withdrawal in Japan of single premium A&H product, PFOs were up 2% on a constant currency basis. Asia sales were down 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of management actions to improve value creation and growth in targeted markets.
In Japan, sales were down 1% year-over-year. We have seen a successful shift in sales to higher return foreign currency denominated life products, which were up 53% year-over-year, and away from lower return yen life products, which were down 35% year-over-year. Japan's third sector sales were down 39% versus the prior year as a result of exiting single premium A&H and the negative impact on package sales from a reduction in yen-denominated Whole Life products.
EMEA operating earnings were $63 million, down 10% year-over-year, and down 3% on a constant currency basis. Earnings in the prior-year quarter benefiting from favorable underwriting margins and lower expenses. Underlying volume growth in the first quarter of 2016 is consistent with our near-term outlook of high-teens on a constant currency basis.
EMEA PFOs was $615 million, down 1% from the prior year period, but up 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by the Middle East and the U.K. Total EMEA sales increased 3%, on a constant currency basis, and 7% as adjusting for the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year. The 7% growth was driven by employee benefit sales in the Middle East and A&H products across the region.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.3 billion at March 31, down from $6.4 billion at December 31. This amount reflects the capital contribution of $1.5 billion to MetLife Insurance Company USA, in contemplation of the proposed separation, as well as regular cash flows including subsidiary dividends, payment of our quarterly common dividends and other holding company expenses.
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. Our combined risk-based capital ratio for our principal U.S. insurance companies, excluding alnico, was 513% on a reported basis and 537% on an NIC basis at year end 2015. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio is 936%, as of December 31, which is the latest public data.
For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary first quarter statutory operating earnings and net earnings were approximately $700 million. Statutory operating earnings were down 38% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to low interest rates. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $30 billion as of March 31, up 1% from December 31.
In conclusion, first quarter operating earnings were below expectations, primarily due to market factors. While the current environment remains challenging, we are confident that our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

The Japan sales was flat, but the widow very different mix, both Steve and John referenced in their prepared remarks, the yen life platform is significantly down, driven by the economics and I think both reference a long payback period of that and the challenges the low interest rate environment. But this is offset by a significant increase in terms of the foreign currency life and foreign currency annuity products, both which are just highly attractive given to enhance yield they can get from the foreign currency play. The A&H business is still highly attractive for us. We generated very good margins it from that business. But there is a packaging issue there for us in terms from well resale yen in the left, they repackage that often with A&H, and as that Yen Whole Life came down by 60%, the A&H business came down as well, but we look to offset that going forward. So the rest of Asia, China was up 16% for the quarter, Hong Kong and Bangladesh had good sales and emerging markets overall were up 16% for the quarter. The 1 challenge for us in the rest of Asia was Korea. Korea was down sharply this quarter, but again, because of the management or accelerating value action we have been taken that, we basically changed commissions, predominantly in the general agency channel to reward consistency and better customer behavior or better behavior for our customers. And also we changed the credits in concerns at the macro environment there in terms of the lower interest rate environment. But we'll be launching new products there in the second quarter and we think will get the sales back on track for that business. So that's been really after the sale for Asia."

I think when you combine that with our capital and cash flow predictability objectives, we decided that we're going to continue reducing our hedge fund portfolio, as John alluded to in his comments, just to remind you have some numbers, the portfolio today is just over 1 billion 8, and recall we did reduce it during the course of last year also. So we actually ended up redeeming about $600 million worth of hedge fund last year. And then as we look at from where we are today, we expect that we're going to redeem, probably in the order of another $1.2 billion, so really take the portfolio down by another 2/3 from where it is today. Just given provision worked in the industry, it will take us a couple of years to do that, but I expect it will probably be 60% of those redemption come in this year and 40% next year, maybe even a little bit into 2018. I'll also put into context of our total portfolio. Remember this is actually a very small portion of our total portfolio. Our total portfolios is under 2%. As John mentioned, our hedge fund portfolio today is less than half of 1%. So this is going to become even smaller, but will be left with is a small portfolio of really are most consistently performing managers and hedge fund. So it will be a small portfolio left over, but we think overall, it doesn't need to do is decide it is today."

Last night, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $1.20, which compares to $1.44 per share in the first quarter of 2015.

Last night, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $1.20, which compares to $1.44 per share in the first quarter of 2015. The negative impact from market factors more than offset a benefit from volume growth. The combination of weak equity markets for most of the quarter, continued strength in the U.S. dollar and low interest rates reduced operating earnings by $0.16 per share versus the prior year period. In addition, variable investment income, or VII, declined by $0.12 per share. 
Variable investment income can be volatile, largely because it's driven by the performance of alternative asset classes. We believe some earnings variability is an acceptable risk as these asset classes have provided strong returns to MetLife shareholders over time. To illustrate, VII was better than planned in 7 of the past 10 years with a cumulative positive variance of $505 million after tax. This favorable performance to plan is noteworthy, given that the time period includes the financial crisis.
Despite the sluggish global economy, we estimate overall volume growth was 3% year-over-year driven by 11% growth in our non-U.S. businesses. In addition, the value generated from new business written has improved as a result of our accelerating value strategic initiative. 
For example, in Japan, our second-largest market, foreign currency-denominated product sales were up more than 50% in the first quarter. We're focused on growth in this area because non-yen products have very attractive cash return characteristics. In contrast, Yen Whole Life sales were down 60% in the quarter. This sales decline was intentional as it is difficult for this product to generate attractive returns and acceptable cash payback periods in a negative interest rate environment.
Overall, top line growth is a challenge in the current low rate environment. However, as I often tell my team, external factors are beyond our control so we must focus on what we can control. In this instance, to combat the pressures of growth from low rates in a weak macroeconomic environment, we must address our cost structure. It is critical that we achieve a sustained reduction in unit cost, and our top priority is addressing elevated overhead expenses that will result in the separation of the U.S. Retail business. It is too early to provide specifics on expense reduction, but we believe that the separated business and the remaining company combined will have a lower cost base than MetLife does today.
Now I would like to provide an update on regulatory matters. On March 30, Judge Rosemary Collyer of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, rescinded MetLife's designation as a systemically important financial institution, or SIFI. In a carefully reasoned decision, Judge Collyer found that the Financial Stability Oversight Council's designation MetLife was arbitrary and capricious. Her ruling said that FSOC had failed to: one, conduct a vulnerability assessment of MetLife as required by FSOC's own regulations and guidance; two, adhere to any discernible standard in determining that material financial distress at MetLife could threaten U.S. financial stability; and three, consider the consequences and cost of designation as required by Supreme Court precedent.
None of these is purely a procedural matter. For example, the judge noted that FSOC defined a threat to financial stability as one that would ""sufficiently be severe to conflict -- to inflict significant damage on the broader economy."" Yet rather than apply its own standard, the judge found that FSOC ""hardly adhere to any standard when it came to assessing MetLife's threat to U.S. financial stability."" She said she could not uphold a finding for MetLife's distress -- finding that MetLife's distress would damage the broader economy when, ""FSOC refused to undertake that analysis itself."" On April 8, FSOC appealed the judge's ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
In MetLife's initial legal complaint filed last year, we offered 10 reasons or accounts as to why our SIFI designation should be lifted. Judge Collyer ruled in favor of MetLife on 3 of those 10 counts. She rejected our argument on one count, the technical question of whether MetLife qualifies as a U.S. nonbank financial company. She has not rule on the other 6 counts, including those based on constitutional grounds. On appeal, all 10 counts may be brought before the D.C. Circuit.
Some of the commentary on our SIFI case has portraited as an effort to undermine Dodd -- the Dodd-Frank Act. We strongly disagree with this characterization. The right to seek judicial review of an FSOC designation is part of the Dodd-Frank Act itself, as enacted by Congress. In seeking judicial review of FSOC's designation of MetLife, we're upholding the process established by Dodd-Frank, not undermining it. Let me be clear, MetLife supports prudent regulation of U.S. life insurance industry. We make long-term promises, and consumer confidence depends on the ability of the life insurance industry to honor its commitments.
In MetLife's case, we have been keeping our promise since 1868 through wars, boom times, panics and recessions. It's worth remembering that we came through the 2008 financial crisis in such strong shape. Then 2010 we were able to buy ALICO from AIG for $16 billion, money that AIG used to help repay U.S. taxpayers.
One of the questions we received most frequently since judge Collyer's decision is whether we still plan to pursue the separation of a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business. The answer is yes. As we explained when we announced the planned separation in January, the decision was driven by both strategic and regulatory factors. Strategically, the imperative of cash generation is stronger than ever, especially in light of a lower-for-longer interest rate environment. And from a regulatory perspective, while we are pleased that our SIFI status has been rescinded, FSOC could attempt to redesignate MetLife at a later date.
We are keeping open our options with regard to what form a separation could take, including an initial public offering, a spin-off or a sale. To prepare for the possibility of a separation in the form of a public offering, we expect to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission sometime this summer. Regardless of the form, the separated business will be leaner and more focused. With the sale of the MetLife Premier Client Group to MassMutual, U.S. Retail will be only a manufacturer of annuity and life insurance products, not a distributor.
As I noted in my annual letter to shareholders last week, expense of the adviser force was preventing us from clearing MetLife's hurdle rate on much of the new business written through that channel. By exiting proprietary retail distribution in the U.S., we anticipate run rate savings -- expense savings of approximately $250 million per year after tax, which will be split about evenly between the separated business and the rest of MetLife.
I am confident that MetLife is taking the right steps to generate long-term shareholder value. We are changing our product mix to adapt to the external environment. We're separating the business on which the company was founded to strengthen the amount and timing of cash generation, and we are focusing on expenses to ensure both the separated business and MetLife have a competitive cost structure.
Finally this morning, I would like to discuss some changes to our finance team. As we announced in a news release a short while ago, Marlene Debel, our Treasurer, is becoming CFO for the U.S. This is a much-deserved opportunity for Marlene. Mike Walsh, our CFO for the Americas, will be retiring after 28 years at MetLife. Mike has been a trusted business partner to many of us. We thank Mike for his many valuable contributions and wish him all the best in his retirement. John McCallion, who is well known to many of you as our former Head of Investor Relations, will become our new Treasurer; and Ed Spehar, our current Head of Investor Relations, will assume John's role as CFO of EMEA. I told John he has done such a good job that he gets to come home from Europe, and I told Ed, he has done such a good job, he gets to go to Europe. Congratulations, Marlene, Mike, John and Ed as you embark on the next chapters of your careers and lives.
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?"

Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.
Operating earnings for the first quarter were $1.3 billion or $1.20 per share. This quarter included 3 notable items, which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement, or QFS. First, variable investment income was $109 million after DAC and taxes, which was $86 million or $0.08 per share below the bottom end of our 2016 quarterly plan range. Second, we had higher-than-expected catastrophe losses, which decreased operating earnings by $45 million or $0.04 per share after tax. Third, we had a onetime tax benefit in Japan partially offset by a tax charge in Chile, which increased operating earnings by $10 million or $0.01 per share after tax. The tax rate in Japan decreased 60 basis points, resulting in a $20 million onetime benefit partially offset by a $10 million charge from a 200 basis point increase in MetLife's tax rate in Chile.
Turning to our bottom line results. First quarter net income was $2.2 billion or $1.98 per share. Net income was $866 million, higher than operating earnings primarily because of derivative net gains driven by lower interest rates and the financial impact of converting Japan operations to calendar year reporting. Japan's results, including operating earnings for the month of December 2015, were reflected below the line in order to eliminate the accounting lag.
The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included a favorable impact of $824 million after tax related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $53.31 as of March 31, up 6% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $44.17 as of March 31, up 7% year-over-year.
With respect to first quarter margins, underwriting in the Americas was favorable versus the prior year quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Favorable results in Group Life, Retail Life and Latin America were offset by less favorable results in Non-Medical Health and Property & Casualty. Total company underwriting margins were essentially in line with the prior year quarter. 
The Group Life mortality ratio was 85.9%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 90.7% and the low end of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. We experienced lower claim severity versus the prior year quarter while frequency was in line with our expectations.
Retail Life interest adjusted benefit ratio was 54.8%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 59.3% and within the annual target range of 51% to 56%. The year-over-year improvement was driven by a return to more normal average net claims. As we have highlighted, 1Q '15 had higher-than-normal accidental death, particularly accidental falls, which we believe were related to adverse winter weather.
In Latin America, underwriting was favorable to the prior year quarter and relative to expectations, primarily driven by lower loss ratios in Mexico. 
The Non-Medical Health interest adjusted loss ratio was 83.2%, unfavorable to a strong prior year quarter of 77.0% and above the top end of the annual target range of 77% to 82%. The key drivers were higher seasonal utilization in dental and higher claim severity in disability as well as favorable LTC underwriting in the prior year quarter. The first quarter did a seasonally weak quarter for dental and disability. This seasonality was not apparent in the Non-Medical Health interest adjusted loss ratio during the past 2 years, largely because dental utilization was low due to adverse winter weather.
In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 100.4% in retail and 102.9% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 86.3% in retail and 93.0% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was in line with expectations but above a strong prior year quarter of 79.4% in retail and 89.7% in group. 
We experienced higher catastrophe losses in our homeowners business and modestly higher severity in our auto business. However, auto results strengthened this quarter, and we expect further improvements throughout 2016 as a result of rate increases.
Turning to investment margins. The average of our 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 170 basis points in the quarter, down 41 basis points year-over-year. Approximately half of this decline or 20 basis points was a result of lower variable investment income. 
Pretax variable investment income, or VII, was $165 million, down $206 million versus the prior year quarter, mostly due to weak hedge fund performance. Our allocation to hedge funds is approximately 40 basis points of the total investment portfolio, and we plan to further reduce our exposure. 
Products spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 161 basis points this quarter, down 21 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields account for most of this decline.
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.8%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 23.5%. The higher operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily driven to the write-off of a net reinsurance receivable.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $532 million, down 19% versus the prior year quarter and down 11% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. 
Life & Other reported operating earnings of $172 million, down 15% versus the prior year quarter but up 7% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary driver was net favorable underwriting as life mortality rebounded from an unfavorable prior year quarter and Property & Casualty non-catastrophe results returned to more normal levels. Underwriting improvement was partially offset by lower investment margins.
Life & Other PFOs were $2 billion, down 1% year-over-year as growth in the open block was more than offset by run-off of the closed block. Life & Other sales were up 1% year-over-year as a 15% increase in P&C was mostly offset by a 5% decline in life sales, mainly in whole life. Whole Life volumes were strong, but we've sold less high-face policies versus the prior year quarter. 
Annuities reported operating earnings of $360 million, down 20% versus the prior year quarter and down 19% after adjusting for VII below plan this quarter. The key drivers were less favorable market impact, negative fund flows and higher expenses. The initial impact -- the initial market impact reduced operating earnings by $5 million after tax, which compares to a $26 million benefit in the prior year quarter.
Total annuity sales were $2.3 billion in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year. We continue to see good momentum in our index-linked annuity, Shield Level Selector. Shield sales were $411 million in the quarter or triple the sales in the prior year period and of 14% sequentially. VA sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, essentially flat to the prior year quarter.
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, or GVWB, reported operating earnings of $174 million, down 24% versus the prior year quarter and down 20% if adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were less favorable underwriting as compared to a strong prior year quarter and lower investment margins. GVWB PFOs were $4.6 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Sales were up 28% year-over-year with growth in group and voluntary products.
I know this segment's earnings were below consensus estimates, which I believe relates to seasonality that was not evident during the past 2 years. In terms of the full year outlook for GVWB, the near-term guidance on certain key items provided on our December outlook call still applies.
Corporate Benefits Funding, or CBF, reported operating earnings of $295 million, down 20% versus the prior year quarter and down 12% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key driver was lower investment margins. CBF PFOs were $508 million, down 6% year-over-year due to lower pension risk transfers, or PRT. As we have noted before, PRT sales can be lumpy but we continue to see a good pipeline and remain optimistic about future growth opportunities.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $137 million, up 5% from the prior year quarter and up 32% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, Latin America operating earnings were up 45% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were volume growth as well as favorable investment and underwriting margins. U.S. Direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $14 million versus an $18 million loss in the prior year quarter, reflecting growth and lower expenses. 
Latin America PFOs were $966 million, down 4% but up 14% on a constant currency basis. Excluding U.S. Direct PFOs, which were up 35% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, Latin America PFOs were up 12% on a constant currency basis driven by growth across the region.
Total Latin America sales were flat year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Excluding U.S. Direct sales, which were down 18% year-over-year, LatAm sales were up 3% on a constant currency basis. This growth was primarily driven by direct marketing partially offset by lower Afore sales in Mexico in the current quarter as well as a large group case sales in the prior year quarter.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $305 million, down 7% from the prior year quarter and 5% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in the current quarter. Strong volume growth across the region was more than offset by lower fixed annuity surrender fees in Japan as well as higher project costs and other expenses in Japan -- in the region.
Asia PFOs were $2 billion, down 7% from the prior year quarter on both the reported and constant currency basis. There were 2 factors that reduced Asia PFOs this quarter. First, as a result of a regulatory change, we are now required to use the equity method of accounting for the 26% ownership interest in our India joint venture. As a result, beginning in 1Q '16, we are no longer reporting 100% of India PFOs in Asia PFOs. Instead, the financial results of our 26% interest will be reflected as net investment income in Asia. This accounting change is consistent with the treatment of MetLife's other joint ventures in Asia, which include China, Malaysia and Vietnam. In addition, Asia PFOs were negatively impacted by the withdrawal of single-premium A&H yen products in Japan. As previously noted, these products do not meet our hurdle rates in the current interest rate environment. Excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of our India operations and the withdrawal in Japan of single-premium A&H product, PFOs were up 2% on a constant currency basis. 
Asia sales were down 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of management actions to improve value creation and growth in targeted markets. In Japan, sales were down 1% year-over-year. We have seen a successful shift in sales to high-return, foreign currency-denominated life product, which were up 53% year-over-year and away from low-return yen life product, which were down 35% year-over-year. Japan third-sector sales were down 39% versus the prior year as a result of exiting single-premium A&H and the negative impact on package sales from a reduction in yen-denominated Whole Life products.
EMEA operating earnings were $63 million, down 10% year-over-year and down 3% on a constant currency basis. Earnings in the prior year quarter benefited from favorable underwriting margins and lower expenses. Underlying volume growth in the first quarter of 2016 is consistent with our near-term outlook of high-teens on a constant currency basis. 
EMEA PFOs was $615 million, down 1% from the prior year period but up 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by the Middle East and the U.K. Total EMEA sales increased 3%, on a constant currency basis and 7% if adjusting for the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year. The 7% growth was driven by employee benefit sales in the Middle East and Accident & Health products across the region.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.3 billion at March 31, down from $6.4 billion at December 31. This amount reflects the capital contribution of $1.5 billion to MetLife Insurance Company U.S.A. in contemplation of the proposed separation as well as regular cash flows, including subsidiary dividend, payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses.
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. Our combined risk-based capital ratio for our principal U.S. insurance companies, excluding ALICO, was 513% on a reported basis and 537% on a NAIC basis at year-end 2015. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 936% as of December 31, which is the latest public data.
For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary first quarter statutory operating earnings and net earnings were approximately $700 million. Statutory operating earnings were down 38% from the prior year quarter primarily due to low interest rates. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $30 billion as of March 31, up 1% from December 31.
In conclusion, first quarter operating earnings were below expectations primarily due to market factors. While the current environment remains challenging, we're confident that our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

So overall, the headline number is down 10%. The Japan sales are flat but with a very different mix. As both Steve and John referenced in their prepared remarks, the yen life portfolio is significantly down driven by the economics, and I think both referenced the long payback period of that and the challenges of the low interest rate environment. But this is offset by a significant increase in terms of the foreign currency life and foreign currency annuity products, both which are customers find highly attractive, given the enhanced yield they can get from a foreign currency play. The A&H business is still highly attractive for us. We generated very good margins from that business. But there is a packaging issue there for us in terms of when we sell Yen Whole Life. We packaged that often with A&H. And as that Yen Whole Life came down by 60%, the A&H business came down as well. But we'll look to offset that going forward. For the rest of Asia, China was up 16% for the quarter. Hong Kong and Bangladesh had good sales, and emerging markets overall were up 16% for the quarter. The one challenge for us in the rest of Asia was Korea. Korea was down sharply this quarter. But again, because of the management or accelerating value action work that we've been taking there, we basically changed commissions, predominantly in the general agency channel, to reward persistency and better customer behavior or better behavior for our customers, and also we changed the crediting rate in terms of the macro environment there, in terms of the lower interest rate environment. But we'll be launching new products there in the second quarter, and we think will get the sales back on track for that business. So that's been really a roundup of the sales for Asia."

I think when you combine that with our capital and cash flow predictability objectives, we've decided that we're going to continue reducing our hedge fund portfolio, as John alluded to in his comments. Just to remind you of some numbers. The portfolio today is just over $1.8 billion, and recall, we did reduce it during the course of last year also. We actually ended up redeeming about $600 million worth of hedge funds last year. And as we look out from where we are today, we expect that we're going to redeem probably on the order of another $1.2 billion. So it really take the portfolio down by another 2/3 from where it is today. Just given the way redemption provisions work in the industry, it'll take us a couple of years to do that. But I expect that we'll probably see 60% of those redemptions come in this year and 40% next year, maybe even leaking a little bit into 2008 (sic) [ 2018 ]. Now also put into context of our total portfolio though, remember, this is actually a very small portion of our total portfolio. Our total [indiscernible] portfolio is under 2%. As John mentioned, our hedge fund portfolio today is less than half of 1%. So obviously, it's going to become even smaller. But we'll be left with a small portfolio of really our most consistently performing managers in hedge fund. So there'll be a small portfolio left over, but we think, overall, it doesn't need to be the size it is today."

Last night, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $1.20, which compares to $1.44 per share in the first quarter of 2015.

Last night, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $1.20, which compares to $1.44 per share in the first quarter of 2015. The negative impact from market factors more than offset a benefit from volume growth. The combination of weak equity markets for most of the quarter, continued strength in the U.S. dollar and low interest rates reduced operating earnings by $0.16 per share versus the prior year period. In addition, variable investment income, or VII, declined by $0.12 per share. 
Variable investment income can be volatile, largely because it's driven by the performance of alternative asset classes. We believe some earnings variability is an acceptable risk as these asset classes have provided strong returns to MetLife shareholders over time. To illustrate, VII was better than planned in 7 of the past 10 years with a cumulative positive variance of $505 million after tax. This favorable performance to plan is noteworthy, given that the time period includes the financial crisis.
Despite the sluggish global economy, we estimate overall volume growth was 3% year-over-year driven by 11% growth in our non-U.S. businesses. In addition, the value generated from new business written has improved as a result of our accelerating value strategic initiative. 
For example, in Japan, our second-largest market, foreign currency-denominated product sales were up more than 50% in the first quarter. We're focused on growth in this area because non-yen products have very attractive cash return characteristics. In contrast, Yen Whole Life sales were down 60% in the quarter. This sales decline was intentional as it is difficult for this product to generate attractive returns and acceptable cash payback periods in a negative interest rate environment.
Overall, top line growth is a challenge in the current low rate environment. However, as I often tell my team, external factors are beyond our control so we must focus on what we can control. In this instance, to combat the pressures of growth from low rates in a weak macroeconomic environment, we must address our cost structure. It is critical that we achieve a sustained reduction in unit cost, and our top priority is addressing elevated overhead expenses that will result in the separation of the U.S. Retail business. It is too early to provide specifics on expense reduction, but we believe that the separated business and the remaining company combined will have a lower cost base than MetLife does today.
Now I would like to provide an update on regulatory matters. On March 30, Judge Rosemary Collyer of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, rescinded MetLife's designation as a systemically important financial institution, or SIFI. In a carefully reasoned decision, Judge Collyer found that the Financial Stability Oversight Council's designation of MetLife was arbitrary and capricious. Her ruling said that FSOC had failed to: one, conduct a vulnerability assessment of MetLife as required by FSOC's own regulations and guidance; two, adhere to any discernible standard in determining that material financial distress at MetLife could threaten U.S. financial stability; and three, consider the consequences and cost of designation as required by Supreme Court precedent.
None of these is purely a procedural matter. For example, the judge noted that FSOC defined a threat to financial stability as one that would ""sufficiently be severe to conflict -- to inflict significant damage on the broader economy."" Yet rather than apply its own standard, the judge found that FSOC ""hardly adhere to any standard when it came to assessing MetLife's threat to U.S. financial stability."" She said she could not uphold a finding for MetLife's distress -- finding that MetLife's distress would damage the broader economy when, ""FSOC refused to undertake that analysis itself."" On April 8, FSOC appealed the judge's ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
In MetLife's initial legal complaint filed last year, we offered 10 reasons or accounts as to why our SIFI designation should be lifted. Judge Collyer ruled in favor of MetLife on 3 of those 10 counts. She rejected our argument on one count, the technical question of whether MetLife qualifies as a U.S. nonbank financial company. She has not ruled on the other 6 counts, including those based on constitutional grounds. On appeal, all 10 counts may be brought before the D.C. Circuit.
Some of the commentary on our SIFI case has portraited as an effort to undermine Dodd -- the Dodd-Frank Act. We strongly disagree with this characterization. The right to seek judicial review of an FSOC designation is part of the Dodd-Frank Act itself, as enacted by Congress. In seeking judicial review of FSOC's designation of MetLife, we're upholding the process established by Dodd-Frank, not undermining it. Let me be clear, MetLife supports prudent regulation of the U.S. life insurance industry. We make long-term promises, and consumer confidence depends on the ability of the life insurance industry to honor its commitments.
In MetLife's case, we have been keeping our promise since 1868 through wars, boom times, panics and recessions. It's worth remembering that we came through the 2008 financial crisis in such strong shape. Then 2010 we were able to buy ALICO from AIG for $16 billion, money that AIG used to help repay U.S. taxpayers.
One of the questions we received most frequently since judge Collyer's decision is whether we still plan to pursue the separation of a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business. The answer is yes. As we explained when we announced the planned separation in January, the decision was driven by both strategic and regulatory factors. Strategically, the imperative of cash generation is stronger than ever, especially in light of a lower-for-longer interest rate environment. And from a regulatory perspective, while we are pleased that our SIFI status has been rescinded, FSOC could attempt to redesignate MetLife at a later date.
We are keeping open our options with regard to what form a separation could take, including an initial public offering, a spin-off or a sale. To prepare for the possibility of a separation in the form of a public offering, we expect to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission sometime this summer. Regardless of the form, the separated business will be leaner and more focused. With the sale of the MetLife Premier Client Group to MassMutual, U.S. Retail will be only a manufacturer of annuity and life insurance products, not a distributor.
As I noted in my annual letter to shareholders last week, expense of the adviser force was preventing us from clearing MetLife's hurdle rate on much of the new business written through that channel. By exiting proprietary retail distribution in the U.S., we anticipate run rate savings -- expense savings of approximately $250 million per year after tax, which will be split about evenly between the separated business and the rest of MetLife.
I am confident that MetLife is taking the right steps to generate long-term shareholder value. We are changing our product mix to adapt to the external environment. We're separating the business on which the company was founded to strengthen the amount and timing of cash generation, and we are focusing on expenses to ensure both the separated business and MetLife have a competitive cost structure.
Finally this morning, I would like to discuss some changes to our finance team. As we announced in a news release a short while ago, Marlene Debel, our Treasurer, is becoming CFO for the U.S. This is a much-deserved opportunity for Marlene. Mike Walsh, our CFO for the Americas, will be retiring after 28 years at MetLife. Mike has been a trusted business partner to many of us. We thank Mike for his many valuable contributions and wish him all the best in his retirement. John McCallion, who is well known to many of you as our former Head of Investor Relations, will become our new Treasurer; and Ed Spehar, our current Head of Investor Relations, will assume John's role as CFO of EMEA. I told John he has done such a good job that he gets to come home from Europe, and I told Ed, he has done such a good job, he gets to go to Europe. Congratulations, Marlene, Mike, John and Ed as you embark on the next chapters of your careers and lives.
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?"

Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.
Operating earnings in the first quarter were $1.3 billion or $1.20 per share. This quarter included 3 notable items, which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement, or QFS. First, variable investment income was $109 million after DAC and taxes, which was $86 million or $0.08 per share below the bottom end of our 2016 quarterly plan range. Second, we had higher-than-expected catastrophe losses, which decreased operating earnings by $45 million or $0.04 per share after tax. Third, we had a onetime tax benefit in Japan partially offset by a tax charge in Chile, which increased operating earnings by $10 million or $0.01 per share after tax. The tax rate in Japan decreased 60 basis points, resulting in a $20 million onetime benefit partially offset by a $10 million charge from a 200 basis point increase in MetLife's tax rate in Chile.
Turning to our bottom line results. First quarter net income was $2.2 billion or $1.98 per share. Net income was $866 million, higher than operating earnings primarily because of derivative net gains driven by lower interest rates and the financial impact of converting Japan operations to calendar year reporting. Japan's results, including operating earnings for the month of December 2015, were reflected below the line in order to eliminate the accounting lag.
The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included a favorable impact of $824 million after tax related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $53.31 as of March 31, up 6% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $44.17 as of March 31, up 7% year-over-year.
With respect to first quarter margins, underwriting in the Americas was favorable versus the prior year quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Favorable results in Group Life, Retail Life and Latin America were offset by less favorable results in Non-Medical Health and Property & Casualty. Total company underwriting margins were essentially in line with the prior year quarter. 
The Group Life mortality ratio was 85.9%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 90.7% and the low end of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. We experienced lower claim severity versus the prior year quarter while frequency was in line with our expectations.
Retail Life's interest adjusted benefit ratio was 54.8%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 59.3% and within the annual target range of 51% to 56%. The year-over-year improvement was driven by a return to more normal average net claims. As we have highlighted, 1Q '15 had higher-than-normal accidental death, particularly accidental falls, which we believe were related to adverse winter weather.
In Latin America, underwriting was favorable to the prior year quarter and relative to expectations, primarily driven by lower loss ratios in Mexico. 
The Non-Medical Health interest adjusted loss ratio was 83.2%, unfavorable to a strong prior year quarter of 77.0% and above the top end of the annual target range of 77% to 82%. The key drivers were higher seasonal utilization in dental and higher claim severity in disability as well as favorable LTC underwriting in the prior year quarter. The first quarter was a seasonally weak quarter for dental and disability. This seasonality was not apparent in the Non-Medical Health interest adjusted loss ratio during the past 2 years, largely because dental utilization was low due to adverse winter weather.
In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 100.4% in retail and 102.9% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 86.3% in retail and 93.0% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was in line with expectations but above a strong prior year quarter of 79.4% in retail and 89.7% in group. 
We experienced higher catastrophe losses in our homeowners business and modestly higher severity in our auto business. However, auto results strengthened this quarter, and we expect further improvements throughout 2016 as a result of rate increases.
Turning to investment margins. The average of our 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 170 basis points in the quarter, down 41 basis points year-over-year. Approximately half of this decline or 20 basis points was a result of lower variable investment income. 
Pretax variable investment income, or VII, was $165 million, down $206 million versus the prior year quarter, mostly due to weak hedge fund performance. Our allocation to hedge funds is approximately 40 basis points of the total investment portfolio, and we plan to further reduce our exposure. 
Products spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 161 basis points this quarter, down 21 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields account for most of this decline.
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.8%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 23.5%. The higher operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily driven to the write-off of a net reinsurance receivable.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $532 million, down 19% versus the prior year quarter and down 11% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. 
Life & Other reported operating earnings of $172 million, down 15% versus the prior year quarter but up 7% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary driver was net favorable underwriting as life mortality rebounded from an unfavorable prior year quarter and Property & Casualty non-catastrophe results returned to more normal levels. Underwriting improvement was partially offset by lower investment margins.
Life & Other PFOs were $2 billion, down 1% year-over-year as growth in the open block was more than offset by run-off of the closed block. Life & Other sales were up 1% year-over-year as a 15% increase in P&C was mostly offset by a 5% decline in life sales, mainly in whole life. Whole Life volumes were strong, but we've sold less high-face policies versus the prior year quarter. 
Annuities reported operating earnings of $360 million, down 20% versus the prior year quarter and down 19% after adjusting for VII below plan this quarter. The key drivers were less favorable market impact, negative fund flows and higher expenses. The initial impact -- the initial market impact reduced operating earnings by $5 million after tax, which compares to a $26 million benefit in the prior year quarter.
Total annuity sales were $2.3 billion in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year. We continue to see good momentum in our index-linked annuity, Shield Level Selector. Shield sales were $411 million in the quarter or triple the sales in the prior year period and of 14% sequentially. VA sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, essentially flat to the prior year quarter.
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, or GVWB, reported operating earnings of $174 million, down 24% versus the prior year quarter and down 20% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were less favorable underwriting as compared to a strong prior year quarter and lower investment margins. GVWB PFOs were $4.6 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Sales were up 28% year-over-year with growth in group and voluntary products.
I know this segment's earnings were below consensus estimates, which I believe relates to seasonality that was not evident during the past 2 years. In terms of the full year outlook for GVWB, the near-term guidance on certain key items provided on our December outlook call still applies.
Corporate Benefit Funding, or CBF, reported operating earnings of $295 million, down 20% versus the prior year quarter and down 12% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key driver was lower investment margins. CBF PFOs were $508 million, down 6% year-over-year due to lower pension risk transfers, or PRT. As we have noted before, PRT sales can be lumpy but we continue to see a good pipeline and remain optimistic about future growth opportunities.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $137 million, up 5% from the prior year quarter and up 32% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, Latin America operating earnings were up 45% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were volume growth as well as favorable investment and underwriting margins. U.S. Direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $14 million versus an $18 million loss in the prior year quarter, reflecting growth and lower expenses. 
Latin America PFOs were $966 million, down 4% but up 14% on a constant currency basis. Excluding U.S. Direct PFOs, which were up 35% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, Latin America PFOs were up 12% on a constant currency basis driven by growth across the region.
Total Latin America sales were flat year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Excluding U.S. Direct sales, which were down 18% year-over-year, LatAm sales were up 3% on a constant currency basis. This growth was primarily driven by direct marketing partially offset by lower Afore sales in Mexico in the current quarter as well as a large group case sales in the prior year quarter.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $305 million, down 7% from the prior year quarter and 5% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in the current quarter. Strong volume growth across the region was more than offset by lower fixed annuity surrender fees in Japan as well as higher project costs and other expenses in Japan -- in the region.
Asia PFOs were $2 billion, down 7% from the prior year quarter on both the reported and constant currency basis. There were 2 factors that reduced Asia PFOs this quarter. First, as a result of a regulatory change, we are now required to use the equity method of accounting for the 26% ownership interest in our India joint venture. As a result, beginning in 1Q '16, we are no longer reporting 100% of India PFOs in Asia PFOs. Instead, the financial results of our 26% interest will be reflected as net investment income in Asia. This accounting change is consistent with the treatment of MetLife's other joint ventures in Asia, which include China, Malaysia and Vietnam. In addition, Asia PFOs were negatively impacted by the withdrawal of single-premium A&H yen products in Japan. As previously noted, these products do not meet our hurdle rates in the current interest rate environment. Excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of our India operation and the withdrawal in Japan of single-premium A&H product, PFOs were up 2% on a constant currency basis. 
Asia sales were down 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of management actions to improve value creation and growth in targeted markets. In Japan, sales were down 1% year-over-year. We have seen a successful shift in sales to high-return, foreign currency-denominated life product, which were up 53% year-over-year and away from low-return yen life product, which were down 35% year-over-year. Japan third-sector sales were down 29% versus the prior year as a result of exiting single-premium A&H and the negative impact on package sales from a reduction in yen-denominated Whole Life products.
EMEA operating earnings were $63 million, down 10% year-over-year and down 3% on a constant currency basis. Earnings in the prior year quarter benefited from favorable underwriting margins and lower expenses. Underlying volume growth in the first quarter of 2016 is consistent with our near-term outlook of high-teens on a constant currency basis. 
EMEA PFOs were $615 million, down 1% from the prior year period but up 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by the Middle East and the U.K. Total EMEA sales increased 3%, on a constant currency basis and 7% after adjusting for the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year. The 7% growth was driven by employee benefit sales in the Middle East and Accident & Health products across the region.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.3 billion at March 31, down from $6.4 billion at December 31. This amount reflects the capital contribution of $1.5 billion to MetLife Insurance Company U.S.A. in contemplation of the proposed separation as well as regular cash flows, including subsidiary dividend, payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses.
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. Our combined risk-based capital ratio for our principal U.S. insurance companies, excluding ALICO, was 513% on a reported basis and 537% on a NAIC basis at year-end 2015. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 936% as of December 31, which is the latest public data.
For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary first quarter statutory operating earnings and net earnings were approximately $700 million. Statutory operating earnings were down 38% from the prior year quarter primarily due to low interest rates. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $30 billion as of March 31, up 1% from December 31.
In conclusion, first quarter operating earnings were below expectations primarily due to market factors. While the current environment remains challenging, we're confident that our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

And after the filing of the S-1, we'll know more, and we'll figure out whether we know enough at that point in time to give greater clarity."

And if we get all this executed properly, which is our intent and our goal, as we've said before, the predictability and the amount of free cash flow as a percentage of our operating earnings, we believe, will go up.

So overall, the headline number is down 10%. The Japan sales are flat but with a very different mix. As both Steve and John referenced in their prepared remarks, the yen life portfolio is significantly down driven by the economics, and I think both referenced the long payback period of that and the challenges of the low interest rate environment. But this is offset by a significant increase in terms of the foreign currency life and foreign currency annuity products, both which our customers find highly attractive, given the enhanced yield they can get from a foreign currency play. The A&H business is still highly attractive for us. We generate very good margins from that business. But there is a packaging issue there for us in terms of when we sell Yen Whole Life. We packaged that often with A&H. And as that Yen Whole Life came down by 60%, the A&H business came down as well. But we'll look to offset that going forward. For the rest of Asia, China was up 16% for the quarter. Hong Kong and Bangladesh had good sales, and emerging markets overall were up 16% for the quarter. The one challenge for us in the rest of Asia was Korea. Korea was down sharply this quarter. But again, because of the management or accelerating value action work that we've been taking there, we basically changed commissions, predominantly in the general agency channel, to reward persistency and better customer behavior or better behavior for our customers, and also we changed the crediting rate in terms of the macro environment there, in terms of the lower interest rate environment. But we'll be launching new products there in the second quarter, and we think will get the sales back on track for that business. So that's been really a roundup of the sales for Asia."

I think when you combine that with our capital and cash flow predictability objectives, we've decided that we're going to continue reducing our hedge fund portfolio, as John alluded to in his comments. Just to remind you of some numbers. The portfolio today is just over $1.8 billion, and recall, we did reduce it during the course of last year also. We actually ended up redeeming about $600 million worth of hedge funds last year. And as we look out from where we are today, we expect that we're going to redeem probably on the order of another $1.2 billion. So it'll really take the portfolio down by another 2/3 from where it is today. Just given the way redemption provisions work in the industry, it'll take us a couple of years to do that. But I expect that we'll probably see 60% of those redemptions come in this year and 40% next year, maybe even leaking a little bit into 2008 (sic) [ 2018 ]. Now I'll also put into context of our total portfolio though, remember, this is actually a very small portion of our total portfolio. Our total alts[ph] portfolio is under 2%. As John mentioned, our hedge fund portfolio today is less than half of 1%. So obviously, it's going to become even smaller. But what we'll be left with a small portfolio of really our most consistently performing managers in hedge fund. So there'll be a small portfolio left over, but we think, overall, it doesn't need to be the size it is today."

Last night, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $1.20, which compares to $1.44 per share in the first quarter of 2015. The negative impact from market factors more than offset a benefit from",1407,"Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported first quarter operating earnings per share of $1.20, which compares to $1.44 per share in the first quarter of 2015. The negative impact from market factors more than offset a benefit from volume growth. The combination of weak equity markets for most of the quarter, continued strength in the U.S. dollar and low interest rates reduced operating earnings by $0.16 per share versus the prior year period. In addition, variable investment income, or VII, declined by $0.12 per share. 
Variable investment income can be volatile, largely because it's driven by the performance of alternative asset classes. We believe some earnings variability is an acceptable risk as these asset classes have provided strong returns to MetLife shareholders over time. To illustrate, VII was better than planned in 7 of the past 10 years with a cumulative positive variance of $505 million after tax. This favorable performance to plan is noteworthy, given that the time period includes the financial crisis.
Despite the sluggish global economy, we estimate overall volume growth was 3% year-over-year driven by 11% growth in our non-U.S. businesses. In addition, the value generated from new business written has improved as a result of our accelerating value strategic initiative. 
For example, in Japan, our second-largest market, foreign currency-denominated product sales were up more than 50% in the first quarter. We're focused on growth in this area because non-yen products have very attractive cash return characteristics. In contrast, Yen Whole Life sales were down 60% in the quarter. This sales decline was intentional as it is difficult for this product to generate attractive returns and acceptable cash payback periods in a negative interest rate environment.
Overall, top line growth is a challenge in the current low rate environment. However, as I often tell my team, external factors are beyond our control so we must focus on what we can control. In this instance, to combat the pressures of growth from low rates in a weak macroeconomic environment, we must address our cost structure. It is critical that we achieve a sustained reduction in unit cost, and our top priority is addressing elevated overhead expenses that will result in the separation of the U.S. Retail business. It is too early to provide specifics on expense reduction, but we believe that the separated business and the remaining company combined will have a lower cost base than MetLife does today.
Now I would like to provide an update on regulatory matters. On March 30, Judge Rosemary Collyer of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, rescinded MetLife's designation as a systemically important financial institution, or SIFI. In a carefully reasoned decision, Judge Collyer found that the Financial Stability Oversight Council's designation of MetLife was arbitrary and capricious. Her ruling said that FSOC had failed to: one, conduct a vulnerability assessment of MetLife as required by FSOC's own regulations and guidance; two, adhere to any discernible standard in determining that material financial distress at MetLife could threaten U.S. financial stability; and three, consider the consequences and cost of designation as required by Supreme Court precedent.
None of these is purely a procedural matter. For example, the judge noted that FSOC defined a threat to financial stability as one that would ""sufficiently be severe to conflict -- to inflict significant damage on the broader economy."" Yet rather than apply its own standard, the judge found that FSOC ""hardly adhere to any standard when it came to assessing MetLife's threat to U.S. financial stability."" She said she could not uphold a finding for MetLife's distress -- finding that MetLife's distress would damage the broader economy when, ""FSOC refused to undertake that analysis itself."" On April 8, FSOC appealed the judge's ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. 
In MetLife's initial legal complaint filed last year, we offered 10 reasons or accounts as to why our SIFI designation should be lifted. Judge Collyer ruled in favor of MetLife on 3 of those 10 counts. She rejected our argument on one count, the technical question of whether MetLife qualifies as a U.S. nonbank financial company. She has not ruled on the other 6 counts, including those based on constitutional grounds. On appeal, all 10 counts may be brought before the D.C. Circuit.
Some of the commentary on our SIFI case has portraited as an effort to undermine Dodd -- the Dodd-Frank Act. We strongly disagree with this characterization. The right to seek judicial review of an FSOC designation is part of the Dodd-Frank Act itself, as enacted by Congress. In seeking judicial review of FSOC's designation of MetLife, we're upholding the process established by Dodd-Frank, not undermining it. Let me be clear, MetLife supports prudent regulation of the U.S. life insurance industry. We make long-term promises, and consumer confidence depends on the ability of the life insurance industry to honor its commitments.
In MetLife's case, we have been keeping our promise since 1868 through wars, boom times, panics and recessions. It's worth remembering that we came through the 2008 financial crisis in such strong shape. Then 2010 we were able to buy ALICO from AIG for $16 billion, money that AIG used to help repay U.S. taxpayers.
One of the questions we received most frequently since judge Collyer's decision is whether we still plan to pursue the separation of a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business. The answer is yes. As we explained when we announced the planned separation in January, the decision was driven by both strategic and regulatory factors. Strategically, the imperative of cash generation is stronger than ever, especially in light of a lower-for-longer interest rate environment. And from a regulatory perspective, while we are pleased that our SIFI status has been rescinded, FSOC could attempt to redesignate MetLife at a later date.
We are keeping open our options with regard to what form a separation could take, including an initial public offering, a spin-off or a sale. To prepare for the possibility of a separation in the form of a public offering, we expect to file a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission sometime this summer. Regardless of the form, the separated business will be leaner and more focused. With the sale of the MetLife Premier Client Group to MassMutual, U.S. Retail will be only a manufacturer of annuity and life insurance products, not a distributor.
As I noted in my annual letter to shareholders last week, expense of the adviser force was preventing us from clearing MetLife's hurdle rate on much of the new business written through that channel. By exiting proprietary retail distribution in the U.S., we anticipate run rate savings -- expense savings of approximately $250 million per year after tax, which will be split about evenly between the separated business and the rest of MetLife.
I am confident that MetLife is taking the right steps to generate long-term shareholder value. We are changing our product mix to adapt to the external environment. We're separating the business on which the company was founded to strengthen the amount and timing of cash generation, and we are focusing on expenses to ensure both the separated business and MetLife have a competitive cost structure.
Finally this morning, I would like to discuss some changes to our finance team. As we announced in a news release a short while ago, Marlene Debel, our Treasurer, is becoming CFO for the U.S. This is a much-deserved opportunity for Marlene. Mike Walsh, our CFO for the Americas, will be retiring after 28 years at MetLife. Mike has been a trusted business partner to many of us. We thank Mike for his many valuable contributions and wish him all the best in his retirement. John McCallion, who is well known to many of you as our former Head of Investor Relations, will become our new Treasurer; and Ed Spehar, our current Head of Investor Relations, will assume John's role as CFO of EMEA. I told John he has done such a good job that he gets to come home from Europe, and I told Ed, he has done such a good job, he gets to go to Europe. Congratulations, Marlene, Mike, John and Ed as you embark on the next chapters of your careers and lives.
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?"

Today, I'll cover our first quarter results, including a discussion of insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.
Operating earnings in the first quarter were $1.3 billion or $1.20 per share. This quarter included 3 notable items, which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement, or QFS. First, variable investment income was $109 million after DAC and taxes, which was $86 million or $0.08 per share below the bottom end of our 2016 quarterly plan range. Second, we had higher-than-expected catastrophe losses, which decreased operating earnings by $45 million or $0.04 per share after tax. Third, we had a onetime tax benefit in Japan partially offset by a tax charge in Chile, which increased operating earnings by $10 million or $0.01 per share after tax. The tax rate in Japan decreased 60 basis points, resulting in a $20 million onetime benefit partially offset by a $10 million charge from a 200 basis point increase in MetLife's tax rate in Chile.
Turning to our bottom line results. First quarter net income was $2.2 billion or $1.98 per share. Net income was $866 million, higher than operating earnings primarily because of derivative net gains driven by lower interest rates and the financial impact of converting Japan operations to calendar year reporting. Japan's results, including operating earnings for the month of December 2015, were reflected below the line in order to eliminate the accounting lag.
The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included a favorable impact of $824 million after tax related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $53.31 as of March 31, up 6% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $44.17 as of March 31, up 7% year-over-year.
With respect to first quarter margins, underwriting in the Americas was favorable versus the prior year quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Favorable results in Group Life, Retail Life and Latin America were offset by less favorable results in Non-Medical Health and Property & Casualty. Total company underwriting margins were essentially in line with the prior year quarter. 
The Group Life mortality ratio was 85.9%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 90.7% and the low end of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. We experienced lower claim severity versus the prior year quarter while frequency was in line with our expectations.
Retail Life's interest adjusted benefit ratio was 54.8%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 59.3% and within the annual target range of 51% to 56%. The year-over-year improvement was driven by a return to more normal average net claims. As we have highlighted, 1Q '15 had higher-than-normal accidental death, particularly accidental falls, which we believe were related to adverse winter weather.
In Latin America, underwriting was favorable to the prior year quarter and relative to expectations, primarily driven by lower loss ratios in Mexico. 
The Non-Medical Health interest adjusted loss ratio was 83.2%, unfavorable to a strong prior year quarter of 77.0% and above the top end of the annual target range of 77% to 82%. The key drivers were higher seasonal utilization in dental and higher claim severity in disability as well as favorable LTC underwriting in the prior year quarter. The first quarter was a seasonally weak quarter for dental and disability. This seasonality was not apparent in the Non-Medical Health interest adjusted loss ratio during the past 2 years, largely because dental utilization was low due to adverse winter weather.
In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 100.4% in retail and 102.9% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 86.3% in retail and 93.0% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was in line with expectations but above a strong prior year quarter of 79.4% in retail and 89.7% in group. 
We experienced higher catastrophe losses in our homeowners business and modestly higher severity in our auto business. However, auto results strengthened this quarter, and we expect further improvements throughout 2016 as a result of rate increases.
Turning to investment margins. The average of our 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 170 basis points in the quarter, down 41 basis points year-over-year. Approximately half of this decline or 20 basis points was a result of lower variable investment income. 
Pretax variable investment income, or VII, was $165 million, down $206 million versus the prior year quarter, mostly due to weak hedge fund performance. Our allocation to hedge funds is approximately 40 basis points of the total investment portfolio, and we plan to further reduce our exposure. 
Products spreads, excluding variable investment income, were 161 basis points this quarter, down 21 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields account for most of this decline.
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 23.8%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 23.5%. The higher operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily driven to the write-off of a net reinsurance receivable.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $532 million, down 19% versus the prior year quarter and down 11% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. 
Life & Other reported operating earnings of $172 million, down 15% versus the prior year quarter but up 7% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary driver was net favorable underwriting as life mortality rebounded from an unfavorable prior year quarter and Property & Casualty non-catastrophe results returned to more normal levels. Underwriting improvement was partially offset by lower investment margins.
Life & Other PFOs were $2 billion, down 1% year-over-year as growth in the open block was more than offset by run-off of the closed block. Life & Other sales were up 1% year-over-year as a 15% increase in P&C was mostly offset by a 5% decline in life sales, mainly in whole life. Whole Life volumes were strong, but we've sold less high-face policies versus the prior year quarter. 
Annuities reported operating earnings of $360 million, down 20% versus the prior year quarter and down 19% after adjusting for VII below plan this quarter. The key drivers were less favorable market impact, negative fund flows and higher expenses. The initial impact -- the initial market impact reduced operating earnings by $5 million after tax, which compares to a $26 million benefit in the prior year quarter.
Total annuity sales were $2.3 billion in the quarter, up 14% year-over-year. We continue to see good momentum in our index-linked annuity, Shield Level Selector. Shield sales were $411 million in the quarter or triple the sales in the prior year period and of 14% sequentially. VA sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter, essentially flat to the prior year quarter.
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, or GVWB, reported operating earnings of $174 million, down 24% versus the prior year quarter and down 20% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were less favorable underwriting as compared to a strong prior year quarter and lower investment margins. GVWB PFOs were $4.6 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Sales were up 28% year-over-year with growth in group and voluntary products.
I know this segment's earnings were below consensus estimates, which I believe relates to seasonality that was not evident during the past 2 years. In terms of the full year outlook for GVWB, the near-term guidance on certain key items provided on our December outlook call still applies.
Corporate Benefit Funding, or CBF, reported operating earnings of $295 million, down 20% versus the prior year quarter and down 12% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key driver was lower investment margins. CBF PFOs were $508 million, down 6% year-over-year due to lower pension risk transfers, or PRT. As we have noted before, PRT sales can be lumpy but we continue to see a good pipeline and remain optimistic about future growth opportunities.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $137 million, up 5% from the prior year quarter and up 32% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, Latin America operating earnings were up 45% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were volume growth as well as favorable investment and underwriting margins. U.S. Direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $14 million versus an $18 million loss in the prior year quarter, reflecting growth and lower expenses. 
Latin America PFOs were $966 million, down 4% but up 14% on a constant currency basis. Excluding U.S. Direct PFOs, which were up 35% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, Latin America PFOs were up 12% on a constant currency basis driven by growth across the region.
Total Latin America sales were flat year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Excluding U.S. Direct sales, which were down 18% year-over-year, LatAm sales were up 3% on a constant currency basis. This growth was primarily driven by direct marketing partially offset by lower Afore sales in Mexico in the current quarter as well as a large group case sales in the prior year quarter.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $305 million, down 7% from the prior year quarter and 5% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in the current quarter. Strong volume growth across the region was more than offset by lower fixed annuity surrender fees in Japan as well as higher project costs and other expenses in Japan -- in the region.
Asia PFOs were $2 billion, down 7% from the prior year quarter on both the reported and constant currency basis. There were 2 factors that reduced Asia PFOs this quarter. First, as a result of a regulatory change, we are now required to use the equity method of accounting for the 26% ownership interest in our India joint venture. As a result, beginning in 1Q '16, we are no longer reporting 100% of India PFOs in Asia PFOs. Instead, the financial results of our 26% interest will be reflected as net investment income in Asia. This accounting change is consistent with the treatment of MetLife's other joint ventures in Asia, which include China, Malaysia and Vietnam. In addition, Asia PFOs were negatively impacted by the withdrawal of single-premium A&H yen products in Japan. As previously noted, these products do not meet our hurdle rates in the current interest rate environment. Excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of our India operation and the withdrawal in Japan of single-premium A&H product, PFOs were up 2% on a constant currency basis. 
Asia sales were down 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of management actions to improve value creation and growth in targeted markets. In Japan, sales were down 1% year-over-year. We have seen a successful shift in sales to high-return, foreign currency-denominated life product, which were up 53% year-over-year and away from low-return yen life product, which were down 35% year-over-year. Japan third-sector sales were down 29% versus the prior year as a result of exiting single-premium A&H and the negative impact on package sales from a reduction in yen-denominated Whole Life products.
EMEA operating earnings were $63 million, down 10% year-over-year and down 3% on a constant currency basis. Earnings in the prior year quarter benefited from favorable underwriting margins and lower expenses. Underlying volume growth in the first quarter of 2016 is consistent with our near-term outlook of high-teens on a constant currency basis. 
EMEA PFOs were $615 million, down 1% from the prior year period but up 3% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by the Middle East and the U.K. Total EMEA sales increased 3%, on a constant currency basis and 7% after adjusting for the conversion of certain operations to calendar year reporting in the prior year. The 7% growth was driven by employee benefit sales in the Middle East and Accident & Health products across the region.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.3 billion at March 31, down from $6.4 billion at December 31. This amount reflects the capital contribution of $1.5 billion to MetLife Insurance Company U.S.A. in contemplation of the proposed separation as well as regular cash flows, including subsidiary dividend, payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses.
Next, I would like to provide you with an update on our capital position. Our combined risk-based capital ratio for our principal U.S. insurance companies, excluding ALICO, was 513% on a reported basis and 537% on a NAIC basis at year-end 2015. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 936% as of December 31, which is the latest public data.
For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary first quarter statutory operating earnings and net earnings were approximately $700 million. Statutory operating earnings were down 38% from the prior year quarter primarily due to low interest rates. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $30 billion as of March 31, up 1% from December 31.
In conclusion, first quarter operating earnings were below expectations primarily due to market factors. While the current environment remains challenging, we're confident that our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

So overall, the headline number is down 10%. The Japan sales are flat but with a very different mix. As both Steve and John referenced in their prepared remarks, the yen life portfolio is significantly down driven by the economics, and I think both referenced the long payback period of that and the challenges of the low interest rate environment. But this is offset by a significant increase in terms of the foreign currency life and foreign currency annuity products, both which our customers find highly attractive, given the enhanced yield they can get from a foreign currency play. The A&H business is still highly attractive for us. We generate very good margins from that business. But there is a packaging issue there for us in terms of when we sell Yen Whole Life. We packaged that often with A&H. And as that Yen Whole Life came down by 60%, the A&H business came down as well. But we'll look to offset that going forward. For the rest of Asia, China was up 16% for the quarter. Hong Kong and Bangladesh had good sales, and emerging markets overall were up 16% for the quarter. The one challenge for us in the rest of Asia was Korea. Korea was down sharply this quarter. But again, because of the management or accelerating value action work that we've been taking there, we basically changed commissions, predominantly in the general agency channel, to reward persistency and better customer behavior or better behavior for our customers, and also we changed the crediting rate in terms of the macro environment there, in terms of the lower interest rate environment. But we'll be launching new products there in the second quarter, and we think will get the sales back on track for that business. So that's been really a roundup of the sales for Asia."

I think when you combine that with our capital and cash flow predictability objectives, we've decided that we're going to continue reducing our hedge fund portfolio, as John alluded to in his comments. Just to remind you of some numbers. The portfolio today is just over $1.8 billion, and recall, we did reduce it during the course of last year also. We actually ended up redeeming about $600 million worth of hedge funds last year. And as we look out from where we are today, we expect that we're going to redeem probably on the order of another $1.2 billion. So it'll really take the portfolio down by another 2/3 from where it is today. Just given the way redemption provisions work in the industry, it'll take us a couple of years to do that. But I expect that we'll probably see 60% of those redemptions come in this year and 40% next year, maybe even leaking a little bit into 2008 (sic) [ 2018 ]. Now I'll also put into context of our total portfolio though, remember, this is actually a very small portion of our total portfolio. Our total alts [ph] portfolio is under 2%. As John mentioned, our hedge fund portfolio today is less than half of 1%. So obviously, it's going to become even smaller. But what we'll be left with a small portfolio of really our most consistently performing managers in hedge fund. So there'll be a small portfolio left over, but we think, overall, it doesn't need to be the size it is today."

Last night, we reported second quarter operating earnings per share of $0.83. Adjusting for notable items, operating earnings were $1.27 per share, which compares to $1.51 per share on the same basis in the prior year period. 
Two reserve actions account for much of the operating earnings pressure. $161 million relating to our variable annuity actuarial assumption review and $257 million for modeling improvements in the reserving process, mostly for our book of universal life policies with secondary guarantees. 
Compared to a year ago, foreign currency, equity markets and interest rates were all headwinds in the quarter. As previously announced, we accelerated the VA policyholder behavior assumption review to the second quarter, in light of our plan to separate a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business. In addition, we completed our VA economic assumption review. The balance of our annual assumption reviews will take place in the third quarter as usual. 
Following these reviews, we have strengthened our VA reserves on a GAAP basis to reflect changes in our laps and benefit utilization assumptions, resulting in an after-tax nontax charge of $2 billion. This action clearly had a large impact on our reported GAAP net income of $64 million in the quarter. 
The reserve strengthening consists of several elements and is associated with our GMIB product. Adverse behavior changes, include lower lapses, lower elective annuitization and higher systematic withdrawals, resulting in increased annuitization under no lapse guarantees and increased utilization of enhanced death benefits, with a 10-year deferral period required to exercise many of the writers in our GMIB product, it was only in the past year that we accumulated sufficient credible data to update our underlying behavior assumptions. This process was further supported by independent industry study released in the second quarter of this year. 
Following these changes, a greater portion of our VA liabilities follow a fair value-based GAAP reserve methodology. Prior to the assumption review, more of our VA liabilities were subject to an insurance accounting model, which follows an accrual-based GAAP reserve methodology. 
In contrast to  GAAP, in his comments, John Hele will discuss the assumption review process results in greater detail. 
As I mentioned, we also adjusted reserves in the quarter to reflect modeling improvements and other refinements. The largest impact, $201 million of the $257 million of reserve strengthening, was for our book of universal life policies with secondary guarantees, where we refined the calculation of excess death benefit reserves based on a more granular approach, projecting policyholder premium payments. 
Turning to investment performance. Variable investment income totaled $285 million in the quarter, which is below our run rate quarterly guidance. Private equity and hedge fund returns were both below plan. Given the performance year to date, it's likely the full year VII will fall below the $1.2 billion low end of our guidance range. 
One of the most significant geopolitical developments in the quarter was the decision by British voters to exit the European Union. Operationally, MetLife's hub in Dublin largely inflates us from passporting issues. From an investment perspective, our U.K. exposure is limited to $17 billion, with nearly all of those assets currency matched with liabilities. Strategically, MetLife remains committed to U.K. as an attractive long-term market. 
More troubling is a referendums residual impact namely a global flight to safety that's put further downward pressure on interest rates with a 10-year treasury yield near record lows. In our view, lower for longer is not going away any time soon and life insurance companies will need to adapt to low rate environment. 
Turning to strategy. MetLife's Accelerating Value initiative, combined with macroeconomic factors, led us to pursue a plan to separate a substantial portion of U.S. Retail business. We continue to believe the separation will allow U.S. Retail to compete more effectively, while enabling MetLife to generate a higher free cash flow ratio with less volatility and lower capital intensity. We are working diligently on the separation plan with full engagement from our advisers and internal team. To that end, we've achieved several important milestones on the path to separation during the quarter. 
We announced the rebranding of the U.S. Retail business as Brighthouse Financial. We made key management appointments. We sharpened Brighthouse's business strategy. And we completed the variable annuity assumption review ahead of schedule, which provides key information to help establish Brighthouse's financial foundation. We expect to file an S-1 or Form 10 shortly after our September 27 board directors meeting. We believe a properly executed separation will create value for our shareholders, whether through an IPO, a spin or some combination thereof. This involves putting together the right strategy, structure, capital and people. Once who have certainty regarding the capital requirements and final execution plan for the separation, we will return our focus to deploying excess capital. The ultimate timing and form of the separation will be determined by a number of factors, including the capital markets environment. 
Turning to regulatory matters. I would like to provide a brief update on the government's appeal on the U.S. District Court decision rescinding our designation as a systemically important financial institution. On June 16, the government filed its opening brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. A brief in support of the government's position were filed on June 23. MetLife's brief will be filed with the court on August 15, and the amicus brief in support of our position are due by August 22. The government's deadline for filing its final reply brief is September 9. The clerk of the circuit court has discretion to set the time for all argument for any date after September 9. In the ordinary course, oral argument will be scheduled to take place 2 to 4 months after the filing of the final brief, and a 3-judge panel will be announced approximately 30 days prior to the date for oral argument. However, the government has requested expedited treatment of the appeal. At this time, we have no indication as to when the oral argument will be scheduled. A final decision case is likely to follow within a few months of oral argument. Throughout this process, MetLife will vigorously defend the U.S. District Court carefully recent decision. 
I would like to conclude this morning with an update on our ongoing focus on expenses, which I discussed in our Q1 earnings call. As a reminder, I said our goal was to ensure that even on a separated basis, MetLife would have a lower cost structure as it has in a combined basis today. As a result, we are announcing that MetLife is targeting $1 billion in pretax run rate expense savings by the end of 2019. This amount is well in excess of approximately $200 million of stranded overhead, resulting from our planned separation, and will improve the company's overall unit cost. Example of the kind of initiative that will drive these savings is our recent agreement with CSC, a leading provider of men services to Fortune 500 companies to administer nearly 7 million MetLife closed block life and annuity contracts. Our new expense target comes on top of the $1 billion in gross pretax expense saves that we announced as part of our 2012 strategy and achieved in 2015. On a net basis, our 2012 initiative generated $600 million in pretax savings, which has helped bring down our operating expense ratio over the past 4 years. However, in light of the significant headwinds our industry is facing, MetLife must do even more to avoid simply putting in place. With these actions, we expect to reduce MetLife's expenses by 11%. We know this will require us to reduce headcount, which is never an easy step for an organization to take. Our overall goal is to be more efficient, so that we can better serve our customers and provide a fair return to shareholders. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in greater detail."

Today, I'll cover our second quarter results, including a discussion of our annual variable annuity assumption review, insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. 
Operating earnings in the second quarter were $924 million or $0.83 per share. This quarter included 5 notable items, which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement, or QFS. 
First, reserve adjustments primarily resulting from modeling improvements in the reserving process for our book of universal life with secondary guarantees decreased operating earnings by $257 million or $0.23 per share after tax. The largest component of this adjustment was in Retail life and other. The new universal life model is a policy-by-policy projection of premiums and death claims, resulting in an immediate increase in future policy benefit reserves and a decrease in projected earnings. The immediate impact was a reserve increase of $201 million after-tax and an ongoing higher projected reserve increases of approximately $10 million per quarter after tax. 
Second, the annual Retail variable annuity assumption review decreased operating earnings by $161 million or $0.15 per share after tax. I will discuss the results of the assumption review in more detail shortly. 
Third, an adjustment to reinsurance receivables in Australia decreased operating earnings by $44 million or $0.04 per share after tax. 
Fourth, we had an unfavorable catastrophic -- sorry, catastrophe experience which decreased operating earnings by $15 million or $0.01 per share after tax. 
Finally, variable investment income was below the 2016 quarterly plan range by $9 million or $0.01 per share after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition cost. 
Turning to bottom line results. Second quarter net income was $64 million or $0.06 per share. Net income was $816 million lower than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative net losses of $1.5 billion, driven by the noncash charge resulting from the annual variable annuity assumption review. This was partially offset by derivative gains of $725 million, primarily related to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies. In addition, there was $330 million in after-tax derivative gains resulting from other variable annuity derivatives and hedging. 
The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included a favorable impact of $1.8 million after tax related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting. Book value per share, excluding AOCI and FCTA was $53.20 as of June 30, up 5% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $43.98 as of June 30, also up 5% year-over-year. 
Now let me discuss the results of the Retail variable annuity assumption review, which we accelerated in connection with the planned separation. As a result of this review, we made changes to policyholder behavior and economic assumptions, as well as the risk margin for the Retail variable annuity block of business. Given a 10-year waiting period for the exercise of certain options within our GMIB products, we have only recently begun to observe sufficient and credible evidence to support a shift in our underlying future behavior assumptions for key blocks of this business. Our study consisted of our own emerging experience, combined with recently available relevant industry data. As a result, we have strengthened our VA reserves, resulting in an after-tax GAAP charge of $2 billion to net income, including an after-tax GAAP charge to operating earnings of $161 million. This noncash charge consists of 3 significant components. First, changes in 4 policyholder behavior assumptions for the guaranteed writers of GMIB to reflect current company and industry experience. One, we've lowered the percentage of policyholders who would like to receive a fixed income annuity under the GMIB writer. Two, we lowered the percentage of policyholders who would like to reimbursement initial premiums paid when that amount exceeds their current account balance. Three, we increased the percentage of policyholders who would like dollar for dollar withdrawals, particularly those in qualified plans at higher ages. And four, we lowered the ultimate lapse rate on certain contracts. Where material we have differentiated these adjustments between Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and our Delaware company and now, U.S.A. The combination of these changes resulted in a partial shift in accounting for these guarantees from mainly an insurance accrual-based model to a more embedded derivatives under a fair value model, resulting in an after-tax charge of $1.5 billion to net income. 
Second, changes in economic assumptions resulted in an after-tax charge of $279 million. These changes included reducing the long-term separate account return assumptions for variable contracts with traditional mutual funds from 7.25% to 7.0% and managed volatility funds from 7.0% to 6.75%. We also reduced the projected ultimate 10-year treasury rate from 4.5% to 4.25%, which is reached in 2027. 
Third, the updates resulted in an after-tax charge of $222 million related to the risk margin required in reserves subject to fair value accounting. 
Let me explain the accounting a little more. GAAP accounting for living benefits is split between accrual and fair value accounting rules. If policy holders elect to annuitize or they die, then this risk is measured at an insurance accounting model, which uses an accrual method, reflecting best estimate assumptions. At MetLife, we assume 10-year U.S. Treasury interest rates start at June 30, 2016 levels and increase to 4.25% by 2027. And that long-term separate account returns are 6.75% to 7.0%. 
However, when policyholders like dollar for dollar withdrawals and exhaust their account values, they receive fixed income annuities. The guaranteed payout portions of those annuities, usually for 5 to 10 years, are considered embedded derivatives and are measured of fair value. The portion beyond the guarantee period is measured is an insurance accounting model. Under fair value accounting, the interest rates used for discounting and separate account returns, including equity fund returns, are calculated actuarially, but on average is set to current market rates. For example, at June 30, 2016, the 10-year swap rate was 1.36%. That means that all liabilities are discounted at 1.36%, and all separate account assets are assumed to grow at 1.36% before fees. 
Now contrast this. The modest impact on statutory reserves. Using the same change to policyholder behavior assumptions, the statutory impact is a reduction in reserves of $266 million after-tax. The majority of our statutory reserves are calculated using a series of actuarial methods and also assume that the yield curve as of June 30, 2016 slowly rises based on a mean reversion to a level of approximately consistent with the long-term 10-year Treasury interest rate of 4.25% in 2027 and an equity return assumption of 7.5%. As you can see, under either accounting system, the ultimate cost of these guarantees will be based not only an policyholder behavior but on future economic conditions. 
With respect to second quarter margins, total company underwriting was unfavorable by approximately $0.08 per share versus the prior year quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Retail, Life and Property & Casualty were the primary drivers of the less favorable experience this quarter. Retail life's interest adjusted benefit ratio was 56.7% after adjusting 21.3 points for the notable reserve adjustment discussed earlier. This was unfavorable to the prior year quarter on a 53.0% and modestly above the top end of the annual target range of 51% to 56%. The year-over-year shortfall was driven by a higher frequency and severity of claims. 
In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 108.9% of Retail and 103.1% in group. The combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 86.9% in Retail and 92.5% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was above the prior-year quarter of 80.2% in Retail and 85.5% in group. We experienced higher catastrophe losses in our homeowners business due to hail and wind storms in the Midwest. Elevated noncat losses and auto were due to higher frequency and severity. We continue to take pricing and underwriting actions in auto. We believe these actions will yield improved results in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and will bring results in line with our target combined ratios over the course of 2017. 
Underwriting results in Group Life and Non-Medical Health were generally in line with the prior-year quarter. The group life mortality ratio is 85.7%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 86.1% and at low end of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. We experienced lower claim severity versus the prior year quarter. 
The nonmedical health interest adjusted loss ratio was 80.7% [ph], modestly in favor to the prior year quarter of 80.5% and within the annual target range of 77% to 82%. 
Turning to investment margins. The simple average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 190 basis points in the quarter, down 37 basis points year-over-year. Lower variable investment income accounted for 16 basis points of this decline. Pretax variable investment income or VII was $285 million, down $142 million versus the prior year quarter, mostly due to lower returns on alternative investments. Product spreads, excluding VII, were 166 basis points this quarter, down 21 basis points year-over-year. core yields account for most of this decline. 
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 22.7% favorable to the prior year quarter of 24.3%. The lower operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily due to lower in play benefits, expense efficiencies and the timing of certain projects. 
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $184 million, down 73% versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to the reserve adjustments discussed earlier. Excluding these and notable items in both periods, operating earnings were down 17% due to unfavorable underwriting and lower investment margins. 
Retail's operating premium fees and other revenues or PFOs were $3.1 billion, down 6% year-over-year, primarily due to annuities. Annuities PFOs were $1.1 billion, down 12% year-over-year due to lower fees as a result of negative fund flows and lower premiums due to decline in SPIA sales. 
Retail sales were down 21% year-over-year, primarily due to lower variable annuity sales. VA sales were down 39% year-over-year, primarily due to the sales suspension by a major distributor this year. 
Conversely, we continue to see strong growth from shield level selector, which more than doubled its sales year-over-year. 
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits or GVWB reported operating earnings of $221 million down 4% versus the prior quarter, but essentially flat adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were higher auto claims and lower investment margins, mostly offset by volume growth. 
GVWB PFOs were $4.6 billion, a 4% year-over-year. Sales were up 25% year-over-year, with growth in most group and voluntary products, as well as across most markets. 
Corporate Benefit Funding or CBF reported operating earnings of $302 million, down 26% versus the prior year quarter and down 18% after adjusting for notable items. The key driver was lower investment margins. CBF PFOs were $650 million, up 43% year-over-year due to higher pension risk transfers or PRT. As we have noted before, PRT sales can be lumpy, but we continue to see a good pipeline and remain optimistic about future growth opportunities. 
Latin America reported operating earnings of $128 million, up 10% from the prior year quarter and up 36% on a constant currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, Latin America operating earnings were up 40% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were volume growth, lower expenses and improved underwriting margins. 
U.S. Direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $9 million versus a $20 million loss in the prior year quarter, reflecting volume growth and lower expenses. 
Latin America PFOs were $994 million, down 9%, but up 4% on a constant currency basis, excluding U.S. Direct and adjusting for SPIA sales in Chile which tend to be uneven, Latin America PFOs grew 7% on a constant currency basis. 
Total Latin America sales were up 29% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. Excluding U.S. Direct, Latin America sales were up 47% on a constant currency basis. This increase was primarily driven by a large group employee benefit sale in Mexico as well as growth in most markets. 
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $259 million, down 39% from the prior year quarter and 17% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were higher taxes and lower fixed annuity surrenders in Japan, partially offset by higher investment margins and volume growth. Asia PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 8% from the prior year quarter and 13% on a constant currency basis. 
I would highlight 2 items that negatively impacted Asia PFOs quarter. First, the de-consolidation of our India operations beginning in 2016 dampened growth by 2 points year-over-year. And second, the withdrawal in Japan of single premium A&H Yen products in 2015 reduced growth by 6.0 year-over-year. As noted previously, these products do not meet our hurdle rates in the current interest rate environment. Excluding the impact of the de-consolidation of India operations and the withdrawal in Japan and Singapore in A&H products PFOs were down 5% on a constant currency basis. The key driver for this decline is the shift from premium-based products to higher value fee-based products. 
Asia sales were down 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of management actions to improve value in targeted markets. In Japan, sales were down 13% year-over-year. We've seen a successful shift in sales to higher-return foreign currency denominated products, which were up 65% year-over-year and away from low return in life products, which were down 54% year-over-year. Japan [indiscernible] sales were down 31% versus the prior year, as a result of exiting single and the negative impact on a package sales from a reduction in yen denominated whole life product sales. 
Sales in Asia, excluding Japan, were up 19% versus the prior year. 
EMEA operating earnings were $64 million, up 28% year-over-year and 36% on a constant currency basis. The key drivers were lower expenses and volume growth. EMEA PFOs were $633 million, down 4% from the prior year period but 1% on a constant currency basis. Excluding certain onetime items, PFOs were up 3% on a constant currency basis. Top line performance was in line with expectations, and we continue to see a favorable shift towards high margin products. Total EMEA sales increased 10% on a constant currency basis, mainly driven by growth in employee benefits and accent health policies. 
In connection with separation, starting in 3Q, we will reflect the U.S. Retail business, now known as Brighthouse Financial, in a standalone operating segment. This will occur in concert with the resegmentation of the business units that will form the remaining business of MetLife. 
Among other changes, we will we reorganize and report our auto and home insurance business at a single separate segment known as Property & Casualty. We will have full details on the resegmentation and reformatted reported financials to you prior to reporting our third quarter earnings. A financial reporting impact of the resegmentation will be a GAAP charge to operating earnings in the third quarter of less than $300 million after tax, to reflect the loss of the aggregation benefit for GAAP reserve testing associated with the variable and universal life business. MetLife financial will be reported in a standalone operating segment that will no longer receive credit for the broader diversification of the consolidated U.S. Retail universal life business of MetLife. As a result, projected earnings for variable and universal life business within the new Brighthouse Financial segment will be adversely affected. Further details will be provided with the third quarter results. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets of the whole new companies were approximately $4.9 billion at June 30, which is down from $5.3 billion at March 31. This amount reflects a senior debt repayment upon maturity of $1.25 billion, as well as regular cash flows, including subsidiary dividend, payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses. We did not refinance the maturing debt in the second quarter as we prepare for the ultimate separation of Brighthouse Financial. 
Turning to our capital position. We report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the second quarter. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 870% as of the first quarter of 2016, which is a the latest public data. 
For our U.S. companies, preliminary year-to-date second quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.3 billion and net earnings were approximately $500 million. Statutory operating earnings were down 39% from the prior year, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates and reserves, larger variable annuities and lower net investment income. In addition, lower fees than separate balances contributed to the decline in operating earnings. Under statutory accounting, most of the impact of hedging is now reported in operating earnings or net income where the gain is recorded in statutory capital. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $31 billion as of June 30, up 6% from December 31, primarily from an increase of unrealized gains and derivatives of $3.5 billion. 
In conclusion, we recognized financial results well below expectations this quarter. Challenging market factors as well as updates to our reserves all contributed to this performance. However, we remain confident the steps we are taking to implement our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value to our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions."

So those will have to be, as we file our S-1 or Form 10, you'll see more details as to the capitalization of Brighthouse as a standalone company. In terms of the earnings power, the earnings power is operating earnings, and those are based on the fees of the base benefits. And we see fees sort of leveling off a bit here.

Now, how these things interact each other and upon the future fund performance in the interest rates are. So you get to see under GAAP which for dollar per dollar use the fair value accounting, which assumes much lower return for separate accounts and interest rates, there's a cost to that. Whereas in statutory, which assumes a mean reversion of interest rates and separate account returns that are reflecting equity markets us a call it, more normal, is actually a decrease in reserves. So the switch of a point here between what happens to economic assumptions between the ultimate cost of these. And why is that, when the dollar for dollar becomes a cost if you run out of money in your account and you trigger the guarantee, if you have okay investment performance, you may not trigger the guarantee. You'll have enough money in your account for long period of time. If you have -- if your separate accounts are earning 1.36%, you're going to run out of money and you have more people triggering the guarantees. So it's a combination of these 2 and where it all ends up will be someplace in between these, but dependent upon what policyholders do as well as what equity markets are and what interest rates are."

Last night, we reported second quarter operating earnings per share of $0.83. Adjusting for notable items, operating earnings were $1.27 per share, which compares to $1.51 per share on the same basis in the prior year period. 
Two reserve actions account for much of the operating earnings pressure: $161 million relating to our variable annuity actuarial assumption review; and $257 million for modeling improvements in the reserving process, mostly for our book of universal life policies with secondary guarantees. 
Compared to a year ago, foreign currency, equity markets and interest rates were all headwinds in the quarter. As previously announced, we accelerated the VA policyholder behavior assumption review to the second quarter, in light of our plan to separate a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business. In addition, we completed our VA economic assumption review. The balance of our annual assumption reviews will take place in the third quarter, as usual. 
Following these reviews, we have strengthened our VA reserves on a GAAP basis to reflect changes in our lapse and benefit utilization assumptions, resulting in the after-tax noncash charge of $2 billion. This action clearly had a large impact on our reported GAAP net income of $64 million in the quarter. 
The reserve strengthening consists of several elements and is associated with our GMIB product. Adverse behavior changes include lower lapses, lower elective annuitization and higher systematic withdrawals, resulting in increased annuitization under no lapse guarantees and increased utilization of enhanced death benefits. With a 10-year deferral period required to exercise many of the writers in our GMIB product, it was only in the past year that we accumulated sufficient credible data to update our underlying behavior assumptions. This process was further supported by independent industry study released in the second quarter of this year. 
Following these changes, a greater portion of our VA liabilities follow a fair value-based GAAP reserve methodology. Prior to the assumption review, more of our VA liabilities were subject to an insurance accounting model, which follows an accrual-based GAAP reserve methodology. In contrast to GAAP -- in his comments, John Hele will discuss the assumption review process results in greater detail. 
As I mentioned, we also adjusted reserves in the quarter to reflect modeling improvements and other refinements. The largest impact, $201 million of the $257 million of reserve strengthening, was for our book of universal life policies with secondary guarantees, where we refined the calculation of excess death benefit reserves based on a more granular approach, projecting policyholder premium payments. 
Turning to investment performance. Variable investment income totaled $285 million in the quarter, which is below our run rate quarterly guidance. Private equity and hedge fund returns were both below plan. Given the performance year to date, it is likely that full year VII will fall below the $1.2 billion low end of our guidance range. 
One of the most significant geopolitical developments in the quarter was the decision by British voters to exit the European Union. Operationally, MetLife's hub in Dublin largely insulates us from passporting issues. From an investment perspective, our U.K. exposure is limited to $17 billion, with nearly all of those assets currency-matched with liabilities. Strategically, MetLife remains committed to the U.K. as an attractive long-term market. 
More troubling is the referendum's residual impact, namely a global flight to safety that's put further downward pressure on interest rates, with the 10-year treasury yield near record lows. In our view, lower for longer is not going away any time soon, and life insurance companies will need to adapt to the low rate environment. 
Turning to strategy. MetLife's Accelerating Value initiative, combined with macroeconomic factors, led us to pursue a plan to separate a substantial portion of U.S. Retail business. We continue to believe the separation will allow U.S. Retail to compete more effectively, while enabling MetLife to generate a higher free cash flow ratio with less volatility and lower capital intensity. We are working diligently on the separation plan with full engagement from our advisers and internal team. To that end, we've achieved several important milestones on the path to separation during the quarter. 
We announced the rebranding of the U.S. Retail business as Brighthouse Financial. We made key management appointments. We sharpened Brighthouse's business strategy. And we completed the variable annuity assumption review ahead of schedule, which provides key information to help establish Brighthouse's financial foundation. We expect to file an S-1 or Form 10 shortly after our September 27 Board of Directors meeting.
We believe a properly executed separation will create value for our shareholders, whether through an IPO, a spin or some combination thereof. This involves putting together the right strategy, structure, capital and people. Once we have certainty regarding the capital requirements and final execution plan for the separation, we will return our focus to deploying excess capital. The ultimate timing and form of the separation will be determined by a number of factors, including the capital market's environment. 
Turning to regulatory matters. I would like to provide a brief update on the government's appeal of the U.S. District Court decision rescinding our designation as a systemically important financial institution. On June 16, the government filed its opening brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Amicus briefs in support of the government's position were filed on June 23. MetLife's brief will be filed with the court on August 15, and amicus briefs in support of our position are due by August 22. The government's deadline for filing its final reply brief is September 9. The clerk of the circuit court has discretion to set the time for all argument for any date after September 9.
In the ordinary course, oral argument will be scheduled to take place 2 to 4 months after the filing of the final brief, and a 3-judge panel will be announced approximately 30 days prior to the date for oral argument. However, the government has requested to expedite treatment of the appeal. At this time, we have no indication as to when the oral argument will be scheduled. A final decision of the case is likely to follow within a few months of oral argument. Throughout this process, MetLife will vigorously defend the U.S. District Court carefully recent decision. 
I would like to conclude this morning with an update on our ongoing focus on expenses, which I discussed in our Q1 earnings call. As a reminder, I said our goal was to ensure that even on a separated basis, MetLife would have a lower cost structure than it has in a combined basis today. As a result, we are announcing that MetLife is targeting $1 billion in pretax run rate expense savings by the end of 2019. This amount is well in excess of approximately $200 million of stranded overhead resulting from our planned separation and will improve the company's overall unit costs. 
Example of the kind of initiative that will drive these savings is our recent agreement with CSC, a leading provider of managed services to Fortune 500 companies, to administer nearly 7 million MetLife closed-block life and annuity contracts. Our new expense target comes on top of the $1 billion in gross pretax expense saves that we announced as part of our 2012 strategy and achieved in 2015. 
On a net basis, our 2012 initiative generated $600 million in pretax savings, which has helped bring down our operating expense ratio over the past 4 years. However, in light of the significant headwinds our industry is facing, MetLife must do even more to avoid simply running in place. With these actions, we expect to reduce MetLife's expenses by 11%. We know this will require us to reduce headcount, which is never an easy step for an organization to take. Our overall goal is to be more efficient so that we can better serve our customers and provide a fair return to shareholders. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in greater detail."

Today, I'll cover our second quarter results, including a discussion of our annual variable annuity assumption review, insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. 
Operating earnings in the second quarter were $924 million or $0.83 per share. This quarter included 5 notable items, which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement or QFS. 
First, reserve adjustments, primarily resulting from modeling improvements in the reserving process for our book of universal life with secondary guarantees, decreased operating earnings by $257 million or $0.23 per share after tax. The largest component of this adjustment was in Retail life and other. The new universal life model is a policy-by-policy projection of premiums and death claims, resulting in an immediate increase in future policy benefit reserves and a decrease in projected earnings. The immediate impact was a reserve increase of $201 million after tax and an ongoing higher projected reserve increases of approximately $10 million per quarter after tax. 
Second, the annual Retail variable annuity assumption review decreased operating earnings by $161 million or $0.15 per share after tax. I will discuss the results of the assumption review in more detail shortly. 
Third, an adjustment to reinsurance receivables in Australia decreased operating earnings by $44 million or $0.04 per share after tax. 
Fourth, we had unfavorable catastrophic -- sorry, catastrophe experience which decreased operating earnings by $15 million or $0.01 per share after tax. 
Finally, variable investment income was below the 2016 quarterly plan range by $9 million or $0.01 per share after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs. 
Turning to bottom line results. Second quarter net income was $64 million or $0.06 per share. Net income was $816 million lower than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative net losses of $1.5 billion, driven by the noncash charge resulting from the annual variable annuity assumption review. This was partially offset by derivative gains of $725 million, primarily related to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies. In addition, there was $330 million in after-tax derivative gains resulting from other variable annuity derivatives and hedging. 
The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included a favorable impact of $1.8 billion after tax related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $53.20 as of June 30, up 5% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $43.98 as of June 30, also up 5% year-over-year. 
Now let me discuss the results of the Retail variable annuity assumption review, which we accelerated in connection with the planned separation. As a result of this review, we made changes to policyholder behavior and economic assumptions as well as the risk margin for the Retail variable annuity block of business. Given a 10-year waiting period for the exercise of certain options within our GMIB products, we have only recently begun to observe sufficient and credible evidence to support a shift in our underlying future behavior assumptions for key blocks of this business.
Our study consisted of our own emerging experience, combined with recently available relevant industry data. As a result, we have strengthened our VA reserves, resulting in an after-tax GAAP charge of $2 billion to net income, including an after-tax GAAP charge to operating earnings of $161 million.
This noncash charge consists of 3 significant components. First, changes in 4 policyholder behavior assumptions for the guaranteed writers of GMIB to reflect current company and industry experience. One, we lowered the percentage of policyholders who would like to receive a fixed-income annuity under their GMIB writer. Two, we lowered the percentage of policyholders who would like reimbursement of the initial premiums paid when that amount exceeds their current account balance. Three, we increased the percentage of policyholders who would like dollar-for-dollar withdrawals, particularly those in qualified plans at higher ages. And four, we lowered the ultimate lapse rate on certain contracts.
Where material, we have differentiated these adjustments between Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and our Delaware company, ML USA. The combination of these changes resulted in a partial shift in accounting for these guarantees from mainly an insurance accrual-based model to a more embedded derivatives under a fair value model, resulting in an after-tax charge of $1.5 billion to net income. 
Second, changes in economic assumptions resulted in an after-tax charge of $279 million. These changes included reducing the long-term separate account return assumptions for variable contracts with traditional mutual funds from 7.25% to 7.0% and managed volatility funds from 7.0% to 6.75%. We also reduced the projected ultimate 10-year treasury rate from 4.5% to 4.25%, which is reached in 2027. 
Third, the updates resulted in an after-tax charge of $222 million related to the risk margin required in reserves subject to fair value accounting. 
Let me explain the accounting a little more. GAAP accounting for living benefits is split between accrual and fair value accounting rules. If policyholders elect to annuitize or they die, then this risk is measured at an insurance accounting model, which uses an accrual method reflecting best-estimate assumptions. At MetLife, we assume 10-year U.S. Treasury interest rates start at June 30, 2016, levels and increase to 4.25% by 2027, and that long-term separate account returns are 6.75% to 7.0%. 
However, when policyholders elect dollar-for-dollar withdrawals and exhaust their account values, they receive fixed-income annuities. The guaranteed payout portions of those annuities, usually for 5 to 10 years, are considered embedded derivatives and are measured at fair value. The portion beyond the guarantee period is measured using the insurance accounting model. Under fair value accounting, the interest rates used were discounted; and separate account returns, including equity fund returns, are calculated actuarially, but on average, is set to current market rates.
For example, at June 30, 2016, the 10-year swap rate was 1.36%. That means that all liabilities are discounted at 1.36%, and all separate account assets are assumed to grow at 1.36% before fees. 
Now contrast to this, the modest impact on statutory reserves. Using the same change to policyholder behavior assumptions, the statutory impact is a reduction in reserves of $266 million after tax. The majority of our statutory reserves are calculated using a series of actuarial methods and also assume that the yield curve as of June 30, 2016, slowly rises based on a mean reversion to a level approximately consistent with the long-term 10-year treasury interest rate of 4.25% in 2027 and an equity return assumption of 7.5%.
As you can see, on either accounting system, the ultimate cost of these guarantees will be based not only an policyholder behavior, but on future economic conditions. 
With respect to second quarter margins, total company underwriting was unfavorable by approximately $0.08 per share versus the prior year quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Retail Life and Property & Casualty were the primary drivers of the less favorable experience this quarter.
Retail Life's interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 56.7% after adjusting 21.3 points for the notable reserve adjustment discussed earlier. This was unfavorable to the prior year quarter on a 53.0% and modestly above the top end of the annual target range of 51% to 56%. The year-over-year shortfall was driven by higher frequency and severity of claims. 
In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 108.9% of Retail and 103.1% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 86.9% in Retail and 92.5% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was above the prior year quarter of 80.2% in Retail and 85.5% in group.
We experienced higher catastrophe losses in our homeowners business due to hail and wind storms in the Midwest. Elevated non-cat losses in auto were due to higher frequency and severity. We continue to take pricing and underwriting actions in auto. We believe these actions will yield improved results in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and will bring results in line with our target combined ratios over the course of 2017. 
Underwriting results in Group Life and Non-Medical Health were generally in line with the prior year quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio is 85.7%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 86.1% and at low end of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. We experienced lower claims severity versus the prior year quarter. 
The Non-Medical Health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 80.7%, modestly in favor to the prior year quarter of 80.5% and within the annual target range of 77% to 82%. 
Turning to investment margins. The simple average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 190 basis points in the quarter, down 37 basis points year-over-year. Lower variable investment income accounted for 16 basis points of this decline. Pretax variable investment income, or VII, was $285 million, down $142 million versus the prior year quarter, mostly due to lower returns on alternative investments. Product spreads, excluding VII, were 166 basis points this quarter, down 21 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline. 
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 22.7%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 24.3%. The lower operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily due to lower employee benefits, expense efficiencies and the timing of certain projects. 
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $184 million, down 73% versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to the reserve adjustments discussed earlier. Excluding these and all notable items in both periods, operating earnings were down 17% due to unfavorable underwriting and lower investment margins. 
Retail's operating premium fees and other revenues, or PFOs, were $3.1 billion, down 6% year-over-year, primarily due to annuities. Annuities PFOs were $1.1 billion, down 12% year-over-year due to lower fees as a result of negative fund flows and lower premiums due to a decline in SPIA sales. 
Retail sales were down 21% year-over-year, primarily due to lower variable annuity sales. VA sales were down 39% year-over-year, primarily due to the sales suspension by a major distributor this year. Conversely, we continue to see strong growth from Shield Level Selector, which more than doubled its sales year-over-year. 
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, or GVWB, reported operating earnings of $221 million, down 4% versus the prior quarter, but essentially flat adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were higher auto claims and lower investment margins, mostly offset by volume growth. GVWB PFOs were $4.6 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Sales were up 25% year-over-year, with growth in most group and voluntary products as well as across most markets. 
Corporate Benefit Funding, or CBF, reported operating earnings of $302 million, down 26% versus the prior year quarter and down 18% after adjusting for notable items. The key driver was lower investment margins. CBF PFOs were $650 million, up 43% year-over-year due to higher pension risk transfers or PRT. As we have noted before, PRT sales can be lumpy, but we continue to see a good pipeline and remain optimistic about future growth opportunities. 
Latin America reported operating earnings of $128 million, up 10% from the prior year quarter and up 36% on a constant-currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, Latin America operating earnings were up 40% on a constant-currency basis. The key drivers were volume growth, lower expenses and improved underwriting margins. 
U.S. Direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $9 million versus a $20 million loss in the prior year quarter, reflecting volume growth and lower expenses. Latin America PFOs were $994 million, down 9%, but up 4% on a constant-currency basis. Excluding U.S. Direct and adjusting for SPIA sales in Chile, which tend to be uneven, Latin America PFOs grew 7% on a constant-currency basis. 
Total Latin America sales were up 29% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Excluding U.S. Direct, Latin America sales were up 47% on a constant-currency basis. This increase was primarily driven by a large group employee benefit sale in Mexico as well as growth in most markets. 
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $259 million, down 39% from the prior year quarter and 17% on a constant-currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were higher taxes and lower fixed annuity surrenders in Japan, partially offset by higher investment margins and volume growth. Asia PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 8% from the prior year quarter and 13% on a constant-currency basis. 
I would highlight 2 items that negatively impacted Asia PFOs this quarter: first, the deconsolidation of our India operations, beginning in 2016, dampened growth by 2 points year-over-year; and second, the withdrawal in Japan of single-premium A&H yen products in 2015 reduced growth by 6 points year-over-year. As noted previously, these products do not meet our hurdle rates in the current interest rate environment. Excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of India operations and the withdrawal in Japan of single-premium A&H yen products, PFOs were down 5% on a constant-currency basis. The key driver for this decline is the shift from premium-based products to higher-value fee-based products. 
Asia sales were down 3% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, reflecting the impact of management actions to improve value in targeted markets. In Japan, sales were down 13% year-over-year. We've seen a successful shift in sales to higher-return foreign currency-denominated life products, which were up 65% year-over-year and away from low-return yen life products, which were down 54% year-over-year. Japan third-sector sales were down 31% versus the prior year as a result of exiting single-premium A&H and the negative impact on package sales from a reduction in yen-denominated Whole Life product sales. Sales in Asia, excluding Japan, were up 19% versus the prior year. 
EMEA operating earnings were $64 million, up 28% year-over-year and 36% on a constant-currency basis. The key drivers were lower expenses and volume growth. EMEA PFOs were $633 million, down 4% from the prior year period, but at 1% on a constant-currency basis. Excluding certain one-time items, PFOs were up 3% on a constant-currency basis. Top line performance was in line with expectations, and we continue to see a favorable shift towards high-margin products. Total EMEA sales increased 10% on a constant-currency basis, mainly driven by growth in employee benefits and accident and health policies. 
In connection with separation, starting in 3Q, we will reflect the U.S. Retail business, now known as Brighthouse Financial, in a standalone operating segment. This will occur in concert with the resegmentation of the business units that will form the remaining business of MetLife. 
Among other changes, we will reorganize and report our Auto & Home insurance business as a single separate segment known as Property & Casualty. We will have full details on the resegmentation and reformatted financials to you prior to reporting our third quarter earnings. A financial reporting impact of the resegmentation will be a GAAP charge to operating earnings in the third quarter of less than $300 million after tax to reflect the loss of the aggregation benefit for GAAP reserve testing associated with the Variable and Universal Life business.
Brighthouse Financial will be reported in a standalone operating segment that will no longer receive credit for the broader diversification of the consolidated U.S. Retail Universal Life business of MetLife. As a result, projected earnings for Variable and Universal Life business within the new Brighthouse Financial segment would be adversely affected. Further details will be provided with the third quarter results. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.9 billion at June 30, which is down from $5.3 billion at March 31. This amount reflects a senior debt repayment upon maturity of $1.25 billion as well as regular cash flows, including subsidiary dividend, payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses. We did not refinance the maturing debt in the second quarter as we prepare for the ultimate separation of Brighthouse Financial. 
Turning to our capital position. We report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the second quarter. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 870% as of the first quarter of 2016, which is the latest public data. 
For our U.S. companies, preliminary year-to-date second quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.3 billion, and net earnings were approximately $500 million. Statutory operating earnings were down 39% from the prior year, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates and reserves, largely variable annuities, and lower net investment income. In addition, lower fees earned and separate account balances contributed to the decline in operating earnings.
Under statutory accounting, most of the impact of hedging is now reported in operating earnings or net income, whereas the gain is recorded in statutory capital. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $31 billion as of June 30, up 6% from December 31, primarily from an increase of unrealized gains and derivatives of $3.5 billion. 
In conclusion, we recognize financial results are well below expectations this quarter. Challenging market factors as well as updates to our reserves all contributed to this performance. However, we remain confident the steps we are taking to implement our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value to our shareholders.
And with that, I would turn it back to the operator for your questions."

Now how these things interact with each other depend upon the future fund performance and where interest rates are. So you get to see under GAAP, which for a dollar-for-dollar use of the fair value accounting, which assumes much lower returns for separate accounts and interest rates, there's a cost to that. Whereas in statutory, which assumes a mean reversion of interest rates and separate account returns that are reflecting equity markets that are, say, call it, more normal, is actually a decrease in reserves. So there's switch of a point here between what happens to economic assumptions between the ultimate cost of these. And why is that? Well, the dollar for dollar becomes a cost if you run out of money in your account and then you trigger the guarantee. If you have okay investment performance, you may not trigger the guarantee. You'll have enough money in your account for a long period of time. If you have -- if your separate accounts are earning 1.36%, you're going to run out of money and you have more people triggering the guarantees. So it's a combination of these 2. And where all this ends up will be some place in between these. It will depend upon what policyholders do as well as what equity markets are and what interest rates are."

So less people annuitize, more people pick dollar for dollar. But the actual calculations are highly complex. We run tens of thousands of runs over a wide range of scenarios. So we're talking about these interest rates. These are the average interest rates, both even in stat and GAAP. It's just the mean of those interest rates in stat reverts to roughly this 4.25% in 2027. Whereas the GAAP piece, if you pick dollar for dollar, you -- a piece of your risk, the guaranteed piece, the certain period of your annuity has to be reserved under GAAP using like a mean reversion interest rate of 1.36%. It's a very wide difference, including your separate account returns. And I want to stress, that's the separate account return before fees. So you generally have a negative returns in your separate accounts. You can see how that can have a high cost of this. If interest rates migrate higher -- and you have to mark this every quarter to the current yield curve. So as interest rates go up, this charge becomes less as you go through time. So I also wanted to give you the wide range of the changes because what [indiscernible] the cause of these things will be -- will depend on interest rates and what policyholders do. I would also like to stress, this is over a long period of time. Our average age of these contracts is in the 60s, and people who elect these options are well into their 80s and higher. So these are long-term contracts. And how this works over time will be the element of cost. But we do mash this to our experience, and we do it on a regular basis as we get credible experience. And we now have a new industry study that we just got that had some good credible experience for GMIBs, and that's why we set our reserves appropriately."

Last night, we reported second quarter operating earnings per share of $0.83. Adjusting for notable items, operating earnings were $1.27 per share, which compares to $1.51 per share on the same basis in the prior year period. 
Two reserve actions account for much of the operating earnings pressure: $161 million relating to our variable annuity actuarial assumption review; and $257 million for modeling improvements in the reserving process, mostly for our book of universal life policies with secondary guarantees. 
Compared to a year ago, foreign currency, equity markets and interest rates were all headwinds in the quarter. As previously announced, we accelerated the VA policyholder behavior assumption review to the second quarter, in light of our plan to separate a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business. In addition, we completed our VA economic assumption review. The balance of our annual assumption reviews will take place in the third quarter, as usual. 
Following these reviews, we have strengthened our VA reserves on a GAAP basis to reflect changes in our lapse and benefit utilization assumptions, resulting in a after-tax noncash charge of $2 billion. This action clearly had a large impact on our reported GAAP net income of $64 million in the quarter. 
The reserve strengthening consists of several elements and is associated with our GMIB product. Adverse behavior changes include lower lapses, lower elective annuitization and higher systematic withdrawals, resulting in increased annuitization under no lapse guarantees and increased utilization of enhanced death benefits. With a 10-year deferral period required to exercise many of the riders in our GMIB product, it was only in the past year that we accumulated sufficient credible data to update our underlying behavior assumptions. This process was further supported by an independent industry study released in the second quarter of this year. 
Following these changes, a greater portion of our VA liabilities follow a fair value-based GAAP reserve methodology. Prior to the assumption review, more of our VA liabilities were subject to an insurance accounting model, which follows an accrual-based GAAP reserve methodology. In contrast to GAAP -- in his comments, John Hele will discuss the assumption review process results in greater detail. 
As I mentioned, we also adjusted reserves in the quarter to reflect modeling improvements and other refinements. The largest impact, $201 million of the $257 million of reserve strengthening, was for our book of universal life policies with secondary guarantees, where we refined the calculation of excess death benefit reserves based on a more granular approach to projecting policyholder premium payments. 
Turning to investment performance. Variable investment income totaled $285 million in the quarter, which is below our run rate quarterly guidance. Private equity and hedge fund returns were both below plan. Given the performance year to date, it is likely that full year VII will fall below the $1.2 billion low end of our guidance range. 
One of the most significant geopolitical developments in the quarter was the decision by British voters to exit the European Union. Operationally, MetLife's hub in Dublin largely insulates us from passporting issues. From an investment perspective, our U.K. exposure is limited to $17 billion, with nearly all of those assets currency-matched with liabilities. Strategically, MetLife remains committed to the U.K. as an attractive long-term market. 
More troubling is the referendum's residual impact, namely a global flight to safety that's put further downward pressure on interest rates, with the 10-year treasury yield near record lows. In our view, lower for longer is not going away anytime soon, and life insurance companies will need to adapt to the low rate environment. 
Turning to strategy. MetLife's Accelerating Value initiative, combined with macroeconomic factors, led us to pursue a plan to separate a substantial portion of U.S. Retail business. We continue to believe the separation will allow U.S. Retail to compete more effectively, while enabling MetLife to generate a higher free cash flow ratio with less volatility and lower capital intensity. We are working diligently on the separation plan with full engagement from our advisers and internal team. To that end, we've achieved several important milestones on the path to separation during the quarter. 
We announced the rebranding of the U.S. Retail business as Brighthouse Financial. We made key management appointments. We sharpened Brighthouse's business strategy. And we completed the variable annuity assumption review ahead of schedule, which provides key information to help establish Brighthouse's financial foundation. We expect to file an S-1 or Form 10 shortly after our September 27 Board of Directors meeting.
We believe a properly executed separation will create value for our shareholders, whether through an IPO, a spin or some combination thereof. This involves putting together the right strategy, structure, capital and people. Once we have certainty regarding the capital requirements and final execution plan for the separation, we will return our focus to deploying excess capital. The ultimate timing and form of the separation will be determined by a number of factors, including the capital markets environment. 
Turning to regulatory matters. I would like to provide a brief update on the government's appeal of the U.S. District Court decision rescinding our designation as a systemically important financial institution. On June 16, the government filed its opening brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Amicus briefs in support of the government's position were filed on June 23. MetLife's brief will be filed with the court on August 15, and amicus briefs in support of our position are due by August 22. The government's deadline for filing its final reply brief is September 9. The clerk of the circuit court has discretion to set the time for oral argument for any date after September 9.
In the ordinary course, oral argument will be scheduled to take place 2 to 4 months after the filing of the final brief, and a 3-judge panel will be announced approximately 30 days prior to the date for oral argument. However, the government has requested expedited treatment of the appeal. At this time, we have no indication as to when the oral argument will be scheduled. A final decision of the case is likely to follow within a few months of oral argument. Throughout this process, MetLife will vigorously defend the U.S. District Court’s carefully reasoned decision. 
I would like to conclude this morning with an update on our ongoing focus on expenses, which I discussed in our Q1 earnings call. As a reminder, I said our goal was to ensure that even on a separated basis, MetLife would have a lower cost structure than it has on a combined basis today. As a result, we are announcing that MetLife is targeting $1 billion in pretax run rate expense savings by the end of 2019. This amount is well in excess of approximately $200 million of stranded overhead resulting from our planned separation and will improve the company's overall unit costs. 
Example of the kind of initiative that will drive these savings is our recent agreement with CSC, a leading provider of managed services to Fortune 500 companies, to administer nearly 7 million MetLife closed-block life and annuity contracts. Our new expense target comes on top of the $1 billion in gross pretax expense saves that we announced as part of our 2012 strategy and achieved in 2015. 
On a net basis, our 2012 initiative generated $600 million in pretax savings, which has helped bring down our operating expense ratio over the past 4 years. However, in light of the significant headwinds our industry is facing, MetLife must do even more to avoid simply running in place. With these actions, we expect to reduce MetLife's expenses by 11%. We know this will require us to reduce headcount, which is never an easy step for an organization to take. Our overall goal is to be more efficient so that we can better serve our customers and provide a fair return to shareholders. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in greater detail."

Operating earnings in the second quarter were $924 million or $0.83 per share. This quarter included 5 notable items, which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement or QFS. 
First, reserve adjustments, primarily resulting from modeling improvements in the reserving process for our book of universal life with secondary guarantees decreased operating earnings by $257 million or $0.23 per share after tax. The largest component of this adjustment was in Retail life and other. The new universal life model is a policy-by-policy projection of premiums and death claims, resulting in an immediate increase in future policy benefit reserves and a decrease in projected earnings. The immediate impact was a reserve increase of $201 million after tax and an ongoing higher projected reserve increases of approximately $10 million per quarter after tax. 
Second, the annual Retail variable annuity assumption review decreased operating earnings by $161 million or $0.15 per share after tax. I will discuss the results of the assumption review in more detail shortly. 
Third, an adjustment to reinsurance receivables in Australia decreased operating earnings by $44 million or $0.04 per share after tax. 
Fourth, we had unfavorable catastrophic -- sorry, catastrophe experience which decreased operating earnings by $15 million or $0.01 per share after tax. 
Finally, variable investment income was below the 2016 quarterly plan range by $9 million or $0.01 per share after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs. 
Turning to bottom line results. Second quarter net income was $64 million or $0.06 per share. Net income was $816 million, lower than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative net losses of $1.5 billion, driven by the noncash charge resulting from the annual variable annuity assumption review. This was partially offset by derivative gains of $725 million, primarily related to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies. In addition, there was $330 million in after-tax derivative gains resulting from other variable annuity derivatives and hedging. 
The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included a favorable impact of $1.8 billion after tax related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $53.20 as of June 30, up 5% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $43.98 as of June 30, also up 5% year-over-year. 
Now let me discuss the results of the Retail variable annuity assumption review, which we accelerated in connection with the planned separation. As a result of this review, we made changes to policyholder behavior and economic assumptions as well as the risk margin for the Retail variable annuity block of business. Given a 10-year waiting period for the exercise of certain options within our GMIB products, we have only recently begun to observe sufficient and credible evidence to support a shift in our underlying future behavior assumptions for key blocks of this business.
Our study consisted of our own emerging experience, combined with recently available relevant industry data. As a result, we have strengthened our VA reserves, resulting in an after-tax GAAP charge of $2 billion to net income, including an after-tax GAAP charge to operating earnings of $161 million.
This noncash charge consists of 3 significant components. First, changes in 4 policyholder behavior assumptions for the guaranteed riders of GMIB to reflect current company and industry experience. One, we lowered the percentage of policyholders who would like to receive a fixed-income annuity under their GMIB rider. Two, we lowered the percentage of policyholders who would like reimbursement of the initial premiums paid when that amount exceeds their current account balance. Three, we increased the percentage of policyholders who would like dollar-for-dollar withdrawals, particularly those in qualified plans at higher ages. And four, we lowered the ultimate lapse rate on certain contracts.
Where material, we have differentiated these adjustments between Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and our Delaware company, ML USA. The combination of these changes resulted in a partial shift in accounting for these guarantees from mainly an insurance accrual-based model to a more embedded derivatives under a fair value model, resulting in an after-tax charge of $1.5 billion to net income. 
Second, changes in economic assumptions resulted in an after-tax charge of $279 million. These changes included reducing the long-term separate account return assumptions for variable contracts with traditional mutual funds from 7.25% to 7.0% and managed volatility funds from 7.0% to 6.75%. We also reduced the projected ultimate 10-year treasury rate from 4.5% to 4.25%, which is reached in 2027. 
Third, the updates resulted in an after-tax charge of $222 million related to the risk margin required in reserves subject to fair value accounting. 
Let me explain the accounting a little more. GAAP accounting for living benefits is split between accrual and fair value accounting rules. If policyholders elect to annuitize or they die, then this risk is measured under an insurance accounting model, which uses an accrual method reflecting best-estimate assumptions. At MetLife, we assume 10-year U.S. Treasury interest rates start at June 30, 2016, levels and increase to 4.25% by 2027, and that long-term separate account returns are 6.75% to 7.0%. 
However, when policyholders elect dollar-for-dollar withdrawals and exhaust their account values, they receive fixed-income annuities. The guaranteed payout portions of those annuities, usually for 5 to 10 years, are considered embedded derivatives and are measured at fair value. The portion beyond the guaranteed period is measured using the insurance accounting model. Under fair value accounting, the interest rates used for discounted; and separate account returns, including equity fund returns, are calculated actuarially, but on average, are set to current market rates.
For example, at June 30, 2016, the 10-year swap rate was 1.36%. That means that all liabilities are discounted at 1.36%, and all separate account assets are assumed to grow at 1.36% before fees. 
Now contrast to this to the modest impact on statutory reserves. Using the same change to policyholder behavior assumptions, the statutory impact is a reduction in reserves of $266 million after tax. The majority of our statutory reserves are calculated using a series of actuarial methods and also assume that the yield curve as of June 30, 2016, slowly rises based on a mean reversion to a level approximately consistent with the long-term 10-year treasury interest rate of 4.25% in 2027 and an equity return assumption of 7.5%.
As you can see, under either accounting system, the ultimate cost of these guarantees will be based not only on policyholder behavior, but on future economic conditions. 
With respect to second quarter margins, total company underwriting was unfavorable by approximately $0.08 per share versus the prior year quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Retail Life and Property & Casualty were the primary drivers of the less favorable experience this quarter.
Retail Life's interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 56.7% after adjusting 21.3 points for the notable reserve adjustment discussed earlier. This was unfavorable to the prior year quarter on a 53.0% and modestly above the top end of the annual target range of 51% to 56%. The year-over-year shortfall was driven by higher frequency and severity of claims. 
In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 108.9% of Retail and 103.1% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 86.9% in Retail and 92.5% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was above the prior year quarter of 80.2% in Retail and 85.5% in group.
We experienced higher catastrophe losses in our homeowners business due to hail and wind storms in the Midwest. Elevated non-cat losses in auto were due to higher frequency and severity. We continue to take pricing and underwriting actions in auto. We believe these actions will yield improved results in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and will bring results in line with our target combined ratios over the course of 2017. 
Underwriting results in Group Life and Non-Medical Health were generally in line with the prior year quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio was 85.7%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 86.1% and at low end of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. We experienced lower claims severity versus the prior year quarter. 
The Non-Medical Health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 80.7%, modestly unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 80.5% and within the annual target range of 77% to 82%. 
Turning to investment margins. The simple average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 190 basis points in the quarter, down 37 basis points year-over-year. Lower variable investment income accounted for 16 basis points of this decline. Pretax variable investment income, or VII, was $285 million, down $142 million versus the prior year quarter, mostly due to lower returns on alternative investments. Product spreads, excluding VII, were 166 basis points this quarter, down 21 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline. 
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 22.7%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 24.3%. The lower operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily due to lower employee benefits, expense efficiencies and the timing of certain projects. 
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $184 million, down 73% versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to the reserve adjustments discussed earlier. Excluding these and all notable items in both periods, operating earnings were down 17% due to unfavorable underwriting and lower investment margins. 
Retail's operating premium fees and other revenues, or PFOs, were $3.1 billion, down 6% year-over-year, primarily due to annuities. Annuities PFOs were $1.1 billion, down 12% year-over-year due to lower fees as a result of negative fund flows and lower premiums due to a decline in SPIA sales. 
Retail sales were down 21% year-over-year, primarily due to lower variable annuity sales. VA sales were down 39% year-over-year, primarily due to the sales suspension by a major distributor this year. Conversely, we continued to see strong growth from Shield Level Selector, which more than doubled its sales year-over-year. 
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, or GVWB, reported operating earnings of $221 million, down 4% versus the prior year quarter, but essentially flat adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were higher auto claims and lower investment margins, mostly offset by volume growth. GVWB PFOs were $4.6 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Sales were up 25% year-over-year, with growth in most group and voluntary products as well as across most markets. 
Corporate Benefit Funding, or CBF, reported operating earnings of $302 million, down 26% versus the prior year quarter and down 18% after adjusting for notable items. The key driver was lower investment margins. CBF PFOs were $650 million, up 43% year-over-year due to higher pension risk transfers or PRT. As we have noted before, PRT sales can be lumpy, but we continue to see a good pipeline and remain optimistic about future growth opportunities. 
Latin America reported operating earnings of $128 million, up 10% from the prior year quarter and up 36% on a constant-currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, Latin America operating earnings were up 40% on a constant-currency basis. The key drivers were volume growth, lower expenses and improved underwriting margins. 
U.S. Direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $9 million versus a $20 million loss in the prior year quarter, reflecting volume growth and lower expenses. Latin America PFOs were $994 million, down 9%, but up 4% on a constant-currency basis. Excluding U.S. Direct and adjusting for SPIA sales in Chile, which tend to be uneven, Latin America PFOs grew 7% on a constant-currency basis. 
Total Latin America sales were up 29% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Excluding U.S. Direct, Latin America sales were up 47% on a constant-currency basis. This increase was primarily driven by a large group employee benefit sale in Mexico as well as growth in most markets. 
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $259 million, down 39% from the prior year quarter and 17% on a constant-currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were higher taxes and lower fixed annuity surrenders in Japan, partially offset by higher investment margins and volume growth. Asia PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 8% from the prior year quarter and 13% on a constant-currency basis. 
I would highlight 2 items that negatively impacted Asia PFOs this quarter: first, the deconsolidation of our India operations, beginning in 2016, dampened growth by 2 points year-over-year; and second, the withdrawal in Japan of single-premium A&H yen products in 2015 reduced growth by 6 points year-over-year. As noted previously, these products do not meet our hurdle rates in the current interest rate environment. Excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of India operations and the withdrawal in Japan of single-premium A&H yen products, PFOs were down 5% on a constant-currency basis. The key driver for this decline is the shift from premium-based products to higher-value fee-based products. 
Asia sales were down 3% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, reflecting the impact of management actions to improve value in targeted markets. In Japan, sales were down 13% year-over-year. We've seen a successful shift in sales to higher-return foreign currency-denominated life products, which were up 65% year-over-year, and away from low-return yen life products, which were down 54% year-over-year. Japan third-sector sales were down 31% versus the prior year as a result of exiting single-premium A&H and the negative impact on package sales from a reduction in yen-denominated Whole Life product sales. Sales in Asia, excluding Japan, were up 19% versus the prior year. 
EMEA operating earnings were $64 million, up 28% year-over-year and 36% on a constant-currency basis. The key drivers were lower expenses and volume growth. EMEA PFOs were $633 million, down 4% from the prior year period, but up 1% on a constant-currency basis. Excluding certain one-time items, PFOs were up 3% on a constant-currency basis. Top line performance was in line with expectations, and we continue to see a favorable shift towards high-margin products. Total EMEA sales increased 10% on a constant-currency basis, mainly driven by growth in employee benefits and accident and health policies. 
In connection with separation, starting in 3Q, we will reflect the U.S. Retail business, now known as Brighthouse Financial, in a standalone operating segment. This will occur in concert with the resegmentation of the business units that will form the remaining business of MetLife. 
Among other changes, we will reorganize and report our Auto & Home insurance business as a single separate segment known as Property & Casualty. We will have full details on the resegmentation and reformatted financials to you prior to reporting our third quarter earnings. A financial reporting impact of the resegmentation will be a GAAP charge to operating earnings in the third quarter of less than $300 million after tax to reflect the loss of the aggregation benefit for GAAP reserve testing associated with the Variable and Universal Life business.
Brighthouse Financial will be reported in a standalone operating segment that will no longer receive credit for the broader diversification of the consolidated U.S. Retail Universal Life business of MetLife. As a result, projected earnings for Variable and Universal Life business within the new Brighthouse Financial segment would be adversely affected. Further details will be provided with the third quarter results. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.9 billion at June 30, which is down from $5.3 billion at March 31. This amount reflects a senior debt repayment upon maturity of $1.25 billion as well as regular cash flows, including subsidiary dividends, payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses. We did not refinance the maturing debt in the second quarter as we prepare for the ultimate separation of Brighthouse Financial. 
Turning to our capital position. We report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the second quarter. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 870% as of the first quarter of 2016, which is the latest public data. 
For our U.S. companies, preliminary year-to-date second quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.3 billion, and net earnings were approximately $500 million. Statutory operating earnings were down 39% from the prior year, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates and reserves, largely variable annuities, and lower net investment income. In addition, lower fees earned on separate account balances contributed to the decline in operating earnings.
Under statutory accounting, most of the impact of hedging is now reported in operating earnings or net income, but rather the gain is recorded in statutory capital. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $31 billion as of June 30, up 6% from December 31, primarily from an increase of unrealized gains and derivatives of $3.5 billion. 
In conclusion, we recognize financial results are well below expectations this quarter. Challenging market factors as well as updates to our reserves all contributed to this performance. However, we remain confident the steps we are taking to implement our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value to our shareholders.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

Now how these things interact with each other depend upon the future fund performance and where interest rates are. So you could see under GAAP, which for a dollar-for-dollar use of the fair value accounting, which assumes much lower returns for separate accounts and interest rates, there's a cost to that. Whereas in statutory, which assumes a mean reversion of interest rates and separate account returns that are reflecting equity markets that are, say, call it, more normal, is actually a decrease in reserves. So there's switchover point here between what happens to economic assumptions between the ultimate cost of these. And why is that? Well, the dollar for dollar becomes a cost if you run out of money in your account and then you trigger the guarantee. If you have okay investment performance, you may not trigger the guarantee. You'll have enough money in your account for a long period of time. If you have -- if your separate accounts are earning 1.36%, you're going to run out of money and you have more people triggering the guarantees. So it's a combination of these 2. And where all this ends up will be some place in between these. It will depend upon what policyholders do as well as what equity markets are and what interest rates are."

But you can also then, for many of the contracts, not take that option and instead elect dollar for dollar, which is almost like a WB benefit for life. And if you run out of your dollar-for-dollar money by taking up to your percentage allowed, if your account balance was 0, then you get an annuity for life. So that almost gives you the same thing. And we're seeing less people take annuitization options and more people elect dollar for dollar, particularly as they age and more in qualified plan. There's another feature that I spoke about that allows a sort of a refund of your initial premiums paid, the first I think, 120 days. We call it the Guaranteed Principal Option. You can surrender your rider and get this top-up of money to be your premiums paid, but you lose then your other benefits of the other rider features for it.

I need to -- I'm trying to understand better than I do why this matter of looking at things on a policy-by-policy basis would lead to a reserve increase in Universal Life.

So why is -- if you follow my question, it is, why is going with the -- I understand that going with a policy-by-policy approach is more precise than using an average.

So there were -- although there's an average amount of premiums paid within a group, there was a much bigger percentage of people paying the minimum versus people paying a higher amount. And so we were underestimating the number of policyholders that will trigger the guarantees, and they’ll trigger them sooner. So there's a wider dispersion by triggering in policy by policy, that came out to be a more precise calculation than the average way that was being done previously. In terms of -- to put the charge into perspective, the Universal Life piece of the charge, the $257 million, was about $200 million, and that's about 1.6% of the total reserves for Universal Life was secondary guarantees.

So less people annuitize, more people pick dollar for dollar. But the actual calculations are highly complex. We run tens of thousands of runs over a wide range of scenarios. So we're talking about these interest rates. These are the average interest rates, both even in stat and GAAP. It's just the mean of those interest rates in stat reverts to roughly this 4.25% in 2027. Whereas the GAAP piece, if you pick dollar for dollar, you -- a piece of your risk, the guaranteed piece, the certain period of your annuity has to be reserved under GAAP using like a mean reversion interest rate of 1.36%. It's a very wide difference, including your separate account returns. And I want to stress, that's the separate account return before fees. So you generally have a negative returns in your separate accounts. You can see how that can have a high cost of this. If interest rates migrate higher -- and you have to mark this every quarter to the current yield curve. So as interest rates go up, this charge becomes less as you go through time. So I also wanted to give you the wide range of the changes because what the ultimate cost of these things will be -- will depend on interest rates and what policyholders do. I would also like to stress, this is over a long period of time. Our average age of these contracts is in the 60s, and people will elect these options are well into their 80s and higher. So these are long-term contracts. And how this works out over time will be the ultimate cost. But we do mash this to our experience, and we do it on a regular basis as we get credible experience. And we now have a new industry study that we just got that had some good credible experience for GMIBs, and that's why we set our reserves appropriately."

Last night, we reported second quarter operating earnings per share of $0.83. Adjusting for notable items, operating earnings were $1.27 per share, which compares to $1.51 per share on the same basis in the pri",1346,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported second quarter operating earnings per share of $0.83. Adjusting for notable items, operating earnings were $1.27 per share, which compares to $1.51 per share on the same basis in the prior year period. 
Two reserve actions account for much of the operating earnings pressure: $161 million relating to our variable annuity actuarial assumption review; and $257 million for modeling improvements in the reserving process, mostly for our book of universal life policies with secondary guarantees. 
Compared to a year ago, foreign currency, equity markets and interest rates were all headwinds in the quarter. As previously announced, we accelerated the VA policyholder behavior assumption review to the second quarter, in light of our plan to separate a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business. In addition, we completed our VA economic assumption review. The balance of our annual assumption reviews will take place in the third quarter, as usual. 
Following these reviews, we have strengthened our VA reserves on a GAAP basis to reflect changes in our lapse and benefit utilization assumptions, resulting in a after-tax noncash charge of $2 billion. This action clearly had a large impact on our reported GAAP net income of $64 million in the quarter. 
The reserve strengthening consists of several elements and is associated with our GMIB product. Adverse behavior changes include lower lapses, lower elective annuitization and higher systematic withdrawals, resulting in increased annuitization under no lapse guarantees and increased utilization of enhanced death benefits. With a 10-year deferral period required to exercise many of the riders in our GMIB product, it was only in the past year that we accumulated sufficient credible data to update our underlying behavior assumptions. This process was further supported by an independent industry study released in the second quarter of this year. 
Following these changes, a greater portion of our VA liabilities follow a fair value-based GAAP reserve methodology. Prior to the assumption review, more of our VA liabilities were subject to an insurance accounting model, which follows an accrual-based GAAP reserve methodology. In contrast to GAAP -- in his comments, John Hele will discuss the assumption review process results in greater detail. 
As I mentioned, we also adjusted reserves in the quarter to reflect modeling improvements and other refinements. The largest impact, $201 million of the $257 million of reserve strengthening, was for our book of universal life policies with secondary guarantees, where we refined the calculation of excess death benefit reserves based on a more granular approach to projecting policyholder premium payments. 
Turning to investment performance. Variable investment income totaled $285 million in the quarter, which is below our run rate quarterly guidance. Private equity and hedge fund returns were both below plan. Given the performance year to date, it is likely that full year VII will fall below the $1.2 billion low end of our guidance range. 
One of the most significant geopolitical developments in the quarter was the decision by British voters to exit the European Union. Operationally, MetLife's hub in Dublin largely insulates us from passporting issues. From an investment perspective, our U.K. exposure is limited to $17 billion, with nearly all of those assets currency-matched with liabilities. Strategically, MetLife remains committed to the U.K. as an attractive long-term market. 
More troubling is the referendum's residual impact, namely a global flight to safety that's put further downward pressure on interest rates, with the 10-year treasury yield near record lows. In our view, lower for longer is not going away anytime soon, and life insurance companies will need to adapt to the low rate environment. 
Turning to strategy. MetLife's Accelerating Value initiative, combined with macroeconomic factors, led us to pursue a plan to separate a substantial portion of U.S. Retail business. We continue to believe the separation will allow U.S. Retail to compete more effectively, while enabling MetLife to generate a higher free cash flow ratio with less volatility and lower capital intensity. We are working diligently on the separation plan with full engagement from our advisers and internal team. To that end, we've achieved several important milestones on the path to separation during the quarter. 
We announced the rebranding of the U.S. Retail business as Brighthouse Financial. We made key management appointments. We sharpened Brighthouse's business strategy. And we completed the variable annuity assumption review ahead of schedule, which provides key information to help establish Brighthouse's financial foundation. We expect to file an S-1 or Form 10 shortly after our September 27 Board of Directors meeting.
We believe a properly executed separation will create value for our shareholders, whether through an IPO, a spin or some combination thereof. This involves putting together the right strategy, structure, capital and people. Once we have certainty regarding the capital requirements and final execution plan for the separation, we will return our focus to deploying excess capital. The ultimate timing and form of the separation will be determined by a number of factors, including the capital markets environment. 
Turning to regulatory matters. I would like to provide a brief update on the government's appeal of the U.S. District Court decision rescinding our designation as a systemically important financial institution. On June 16, the government filed its opening brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Amicus briefs in support of the government's position were filed on June 23. MetLife's brief will be filed with the court on August 15, and amicus briefs in support of our position are due by August 22. The government's deadline for filing its final reply brief is September 9. The clerk of the circuit court has discretion to set the time for oral argument for any date after September 9.
In the ordinary course, oral argument will be scheduled to take place 2 to 4 months after the filing of the final brief, and a 3-judge panel will be announced approximately 30 days prior to the date for oral argument. However, the government has requested expedited treatment of the appeal. At this time, we have no indication as to when the oral argument will be scheduled. A final decision of the case is likely to follow within a few months of oral argument. Throughout this process, MetLife will vigorously defend the U.S. District Court’s carefully reasoned decision. 
I would like to conclude this morning with an update on our ongoing focus on expenses, which I discussed in our Q1 earnings call. As a reminder, I said our goal was to ensure that even on a separated basis, MetLife would have a lower cost structure than it has on a combined basis today. As a result, we are announcing that MetLife is targeting $1 billion in pretax run rate expense savings by the end of 2019. This amount is well in excess of approximately $200 million of stranded overhead resulting from our planned separation and will improve the company's overall unit costs. 
Example of the kind of initiative that will drive these savings is our recent agreement with CSC, a leading provider of managed services to Fortune 500 companies, to administer nearly 7 million MetLife closed-block life and annuity contracts. Our new expense target comes on top of the $1 billion in gross pretax expense saves that we announced as part of our 2012 strategy and achieved in 2015. 
On a net basis, our 2012 initiative generated $600 million in pretax savings, which has helped bring down our operating expense ratio over the past 4 years. However, in light of the significant headwinds our industry is facing, MetLife must do even more to avoid simply running in place. With these actions, we expect to reduce MetLife's expenses by 11%. We know this will require us to reduce headcount, which is never an easy step for an organization to take. Our overall goal is to be more efficient so that we can better serve our customers and provide a fair return to shareholders. 
With that, I would like to turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in greater detail."
185648,371821185,1026373,"MetLife, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our second quarter results, including a discussion of our annual variable annuity assumption review, insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with s",2924,"Thank you, Steve, and good morning. Today, I'll cover our second quarter results, including a discussion of our annual variable annuity assumption review, insurance margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. 
Operating earnings in the second quarter were $924 million or $0.83 per share. This quarter included 5 notable items, which were highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our quarterly financial supplement or QFS. 
First, reserve adjustments, primarily resulting from modeling improvements in the reserving process for our book of universal life with secondary guarantees decreased operating earnings by $257 million or $0.23 per share after tax. The largest component of this adjustment was in Retail life and other. The new universal life model is a policy-by-policy projection of premiums and death claims, resulting in an immediate increase in future policy benefit reserves and a decrease in projected earnings. The immediate impact was a reserve increase of $201 million after tax and an ongoing higher projected reserve increases of approximately $10 million per quarter after tax. 
Second, the annual Retail variable annuity assumption review decreased operating earnings by $161 million or $0.15 per share after tax. I will discuss the results of the assumption review in more detail shortly. 
Third, an adjustment to reinsurance receivables in Australia decreased operating earnings by $44 million or $0.04 per share after tax. 
Fourth, we had unfavorable catastrophic -- sorry, catastrophe experience which decreased operating earnings by $15 million or $0.01 per share after tax. 
Finally, variable investment income was below the 2016 quarterly plan range by $9 million or $0.01 per share after tax and the impact of deferred acquisition costs. 
Turning to bottom line results. Second quarter net income was $64 million or $0.06 per share. Net income was $816 million, lower than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative net losses of $1.5 billion, driven by the noncash charge resulting from the annual variable annuity assumption review. This was partially offset by derivative gains of $725 million, primarily related to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies. In addition, there was $330 million in after-tax derivative gains resulting from other variable annuity derivatives and hedging. 
The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included a favorable impact of $1.8 billion after tax related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting. Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, was $53.20 as of June 30, up 5% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $43.98 as of June 30, also up 5% year-over-year. 
Now let me discuss the results of the Retail variable annuity assumption review, which we accelerated in connection with the planned separation. As a result of this review, we made changes to policyholder behavior and economic assumptions as well as the risk margin for the Retail variable annuity block of business. Given a 10-year waiting period for the exercise of certain options within our GMIB products, we have only recently begun to observe sufficient and credible evidence to support a shift in our underlying future behavior assumptions for key blocks of this business.
Our study consisted of our own emerging experience, combined with recently available relevant industry data. As a result, we have strengthened our VA reserves, resulting in an after-tax GAAP charge of $2 billion to net income, including an after-tax GAAP charge to operating earnings of $161 million.
This noncash charge consists of 3 significant components. First, changes in 4 policyholder behavior assumptions for the guaranteed riders of GMIB to reflect current company and industry experience. One, we lowered the percentage of policyholders who would like to receive a fixed-income annuity under their GMIB rider. Two, we lowered the percentage of policyholders who would like reimbursement of the initial premiums paid when that amount exceeds their current account balance. Three, we increased the percentage of policyholders who would like dollar-for-dollar withdrawals, particularly those in qualified plans at higher ages. And four, we lowered the ultimate lapse rate on certain contracts.
Where material, we have differentiated these adjustments between Metropolitan Life Insurance Company and our Delaware company, ML USA. The combination of these changes resulted in a partial shift in accounting for these guarantees from mainly an insurance accrual-based model to a more embedded derivatives under a fair value model, resulting in an after-tax charge of $1.5 billion to net income. 
Second, changes in economic assumptions resulted in an after-tax charge of $279 million. These changes included reducing the long-term separate account return assumptions for variable contracts with traditional mutual funds from 7.25% to 7.0% and managed volatility funds from 7.0% to 6.75%. We also reduced the projected ultimate 10-year treasury rate from 4.5% to 4.25%, which is reached in 2027. 
Third, the updates resulted in an after-tax charge of $222 million related to the risk margin required in reserves subject to fair value accounting. 
Let me explain the accounting a little more. GAAP accounting for living benefits is split between accrual and fair value accounting rules. If policyholders elect to annuitize or they die, then this risk is measured under an insurance accounting model, which uses an accrual method reflecting best-estimate assumptions. At MetLife, we assume 10-year U.S. Treasury interest rates start at June 30, 2016, levels and increase to 4.25% by 2027, and that long-term separate account returns are 6.75% to 7.0%. 
However, when policyholders elect dollar-for-dollar withdrawals and exhaust their account values, they receive fixed-income annuities. The guaranteed payout portions of those annuities, usually for 5 to 10 years, are considered embedded derivatives and are measured at fair value. The portion beyond the guaranteed period is measured using the insurance accounting model. Under fair value accounting, the interest rates used for discounted; and separate account returns, including equity fund returns, are calculated actuarially, but on average, are set to current market rates.
For example, at June 30, 2016, the 10-year swap rate was 1.36%. That means that all liabilities are discounted at 1.36%, and all separate account assets are assumed to grow at 1.36% before fees. 
Now contrast to this to the modest impact on statutory reserves. Using the same change to policyholder behavior assumptions, the statutory impact is a reduction in reserves of $266 million after tax. The majority of our statutory reserves are calculated using a series of actuarial methods and also assume that the yield curve as of June 30, 2016, slowly rises based on a mean reversion to a level approximately consistent with the long-term 10-year treasury interest rate of 4.25% in 2027 and an equity return assumption of 7.5%.
As you can see, under either accounting system, the ultimate cost of these guarantees will be based not only on policyholder behavior, but on future economic conditions. 
With respect to second quarter margins, total company underwriting was unfavorable by approximately $0.08 per share versus the prior year quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Retail Life and Property & Casualty were the primary drivers of the less favorable experience this quarter.
Retail Life's interest-adjusted benefit ratio was 56.7% after adjusting 21.3 points for the notable reserve adjustment discussed earlier. This was unfavorable to the prior year quarter on a 53.0% and modestly above the top end of the annual target range of 51% to 56%. The year-over-year shortfall was driven by higher frequency and severity of claims. 
In Property & Casualty, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 108.9% of Retail and 103.1% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 86.9% in Retail and 92.5% in group. The combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was above the prior year quarter of 80.2% in Retail and 85.5% in group.
We experienced higher catastrophe losses in our homeowners business due to hail and wind storms in the Midwest. Elevated non-cat losses in auto were due to higher frequency and severity. We continue to take pricing and underwriting actions in auto. We believe these actions will yield improved results in the third and fourth quarters of 2016 and will bring results in line with our target combined ratios over the course of 2017. 
Underwriting results in Group Life and Non-Medical Health were generally in line with the prior year quarter. The Group Life mortality ratio was 85.7%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 86.1% and at low end of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. We experienced lower claims severity versus the prior year quarter. 
The Non-Medical Health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 80.7%, modestly unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 80.5% and within the annual target range of 77% to 82%. 
Turning to investment margins. The simple average of the 4 U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 190 basis points in the quarter, down 37 basis points year-over-year. Lower variable investment income accounted for 16 basis points of this decline. Pretax variable investment income, or VII, was $285 million, down $142 million versus the prior year quarter, mostly due to lower returns on alternative investments. Product spreads, excluding VII, were 166 basis points this quarter, down 21 basis points year-over-year. Lower core yields accounted for most of this decline. 
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 22.7%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 24.3%. The lower operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily due to lower employee benefits, expense efficiencies and the timing of certain projects. 
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $184 million, down 73% versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to the reserve adjustments discussed earlier. Excluding these and all notable items in both periods, operating earnings were down 17% due to unfavorable underwriting and lower investment margins. 
Retail's operating premium fees and other revenues, or PFOs, were $3.1 billion, down 6% year-over-year, primarily due to annuities. Annuities PFOs were $1.1 billion, down 12% year-over-year due to lower fees as a result of negative fund flows and lower premiums due to a decline in SPIA sales. 
Retail sales were down 21% year-over-year, primarily due to lower variable annuity sales. VA sales were down 39% year-over-year, primarily due to the sales suspension by a major distributor this year. Conversely, we continued to see strong growth from Shield Level Selector, which more than doubled its sales year-over-year. 
Group, Voluntary & Worksite Benefits, or GVWB, reported operating earnings of $221 million, down 4% versus the prior year quarter, but essentially flat adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were higher auto claims and lower investment margins, mostly offset by volume growth. GVWB PFOs were $4.6 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Sales were up 25% year-over-year, with growth in most group and voluntary products as well as across most markets. 
Corporate Benefit Funding, or CBF, reported operating earnings of $302 million, down 26% versus the prior year quarter and down 18% after adjusting for notable items. The key driver was lower investment margins. CBF PFOs were $650 million, up 43% year-over-year due to higher pension risk transfers or PRT. As we have noted before, PRT sales can be lumpy, but we continue to see a good pipeline and remain optimistic about future growth opportunities. 
Latin America reported operating earnings of $128 million, up 10% from the prior year quarter and up 36% on a constant-currency basis. After adjusting for notable items in both periods, Latin America operating earnings were up 40% on a constant-currency basis. The key drivers were volume growth, lower expenses and improved underwriting margins. 
U.S. Direct, which is included in Latin America's results, had an operating loss of $9 million versus a $20 million loss in the prior year quarter, reflecting volume growth and lower expenses. Latin America PFOs were $994 million, down 9%, but up 4% on a constant-currency basis. Excluding U.S. Direct and adjusting for SPIA sales in Chile, which tend to be uneven, Latin America PFOs grew 7% on a constant-currency basis. 
Total Latin America sales were up 29% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. Excluding U.S. Direct, Latin America sales were up 47% on a constant-currency basis. This increase was primarily driven by a large group employee benefit sale in Mexico as well as growth in most markets. 
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $259 million, down 39% from the prior year quarter and 17% on a constant-currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were higher taxes and lower fixed annuity surrenders in Japan, partially offset by higher investment margins and volume growth. Asia PFOs were $2.1 billion, down 8% from the prior year quarter and 13% on a constant-currency basis. 
I would highlight 2 items that negatively impacted Asia PFOs this quarter: first, the deconsolidation of our India operations, beginning in 2016, dampened growth by 2 points year-over-year; and second, the withdrawal in Japan of single-premium A&H yen products in 2015 reduced growth by 6 points year-over-year. As noted previously, these products do not meet our hurdle rates in the current interest rate environment. Excluding the impact of the deconsolidation of India operations and the withdrawal in Japan of single-premium A&H yen products, PFOs were down 5% on a constant-currency basis. The key driver for this decline is the shift from premium-based products to higher-value fee-based products. 
Asia sales were down 3% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, reflecting the impact of management actions to improve value in targeted markets. In Japan, sales were down 13% year-over-year. We've seen a successful shift in sales to higher-return foreign currency-denominated life products, which were up 65% year-over-year, and away from low-return yen life products, which were down 54% year-over-year. Japan third-sector sales were down 31% versus the prior year as a result of exiting single-premium A&H and the negative impact on package sales from a reduction in yen-denominated Whole Life product sales. Sales in Asia, excluding Japan, were up 19% versus the prior year. 
EMEA operating earnings were $64 million, up 28% year-over-year and 36% on a constant-currency basis. The key drivers were lower expenses and volume growth. EMEA PFOs were $633 million, down 4% from the prior year period, but up 1% on a constant-currency basis. Excluding certain one-time items, PFOs were up 3% on a constant-currency basis. Top line performance was in line with expectations, and we continue to see a favorable shift towards high-margin products. Total EMEA sales increased 10% on a constant-currency basis, mainly driven by growth in employee benefits and accident and health policies. 
In connection with separation, starting in 3Q, we will reflect the U.S. Retail business, now known as Brighthouse Financial, in a standalone operating segment. This will occur in concert with the resegmentation of the business units that will form the remaining business of MetLife. 
Among other changes, we will reorganize and report our Auto & Home insurance business as a single separate segment known as Property & Casualty. We will have full details on the resegmentation and reformatted financials to you prior to reporting our third quarter earnings. A financial reporting impact of the resegmentation will be a GAAP charge to operating earnings in the third quarter of less than $300 million after tax to reflect the loss of the aggregation benefit for GAAP reserve testing associated with the Variable and Universal Life business.
Brighthouse Financial will be reported in a standalone operating segment that will no longer receive credit for the broader diversification of the consolidated U.S. Retail Universal Life business of MetLife. As a result, projected earnings for Variable and Universal Life business within the new Brighthouse Financial segment would be adversely affected. Further details will be provided with the third quarter results. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $4.9 billion at June 30, which is down from $5.3 billion at March 31. This amount reflects a senior debt repayment upon maturity of $1.25 billion as well as regular cash flows, including subsidiary dividends, payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses. We did not refinance the maturing debt in the second quarter as we prepare for the ultimate separation of Brighthouse Financial. 
Turning to our capital position. We report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the second quarter. For Japan, our solvency margin ratio was 870% as of the first quarter of 2016, which is the latest public data. 
For our U.S. companies, preliminary year-to-date second quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $1.3 billion, and net earnings were approximately $500 million. Statutory operating earnings were down 39% from the prior year, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates and reserves, largely variable annuities, and lower net investment income. In addition, lower fees earned on separate account balances contributed to the decline in operating earnings.
Under statutory accounting, most of the impact of hedging is now reported in operating earnings or net income, but rather the gain is recorded in statutory capital. We estimate that our total U.S. statutory adjusted capital was approximately $31 billion as of June 30, up 6% from December 31, primarily from an increase of unrealized gains and derivatives of $3.5 billion. 
In conclusion, we recognize financial results are well below expectations this quarter. Challenging market factors as well as updates to our reserves all contributed to this performance. However, we remain confident the steps we are taking to implement our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value to our shareholders.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

Now how these things interact with each other depend upon the future fund performance and where interest rates are. So you could see under GAAP, which for a dollar-for-dollar use of the fair value accounting, which assumes much lower returns for separate accounts and interest rates, there's a cost to that. Whereas in statutory, which assumes a mean reversion of interest rates and separate account returns that are reflecting equity markets that are, say, call it, more normal, is actually a decrease in reserves. So there's switchover point here between what happens to economic assumptions between the ultimate cost of these. And why is that? Well, the dollar for dollar becomes a cost if you run out of money in your account and then you trigger the guarantee. If you have okay investment performance, you may not trigger the guarantee. You'll have enough money in your account for a long period of time. If you have -- if your separate accounts are earning 1.36%, you're going to run out of money and you have more people triggering the guarantees. So it's a combination of these 2. And where all this ends up will be some place in between these. It will depend upon what policyholders do as well as what equity markets are and what interest rates are."

And you get the greater of current annuity rates or a guaranteed set of annuity rates that do a setback end. And that's with the benefit base or your current account balance had current annuity rates. But you can also then, for many of the contracts, not take that option and instead elect dollar for dollar, which is almost like a WB benefit for life. And if you run out of your dollar-for-dollar money by taking up to your percentage allowed, if your account balance was 0, then you get an annuity for life. So that almost gives you the same thing. And we're seeing less people take annuitization options and more people elect dollar for dollar, particularly as they age and more in qualified plan. There's another feature that I spoke about that allows a sort of a refund of your initial premiums paid, the first I think, 120 days. We call it the Guaranteed Principal Option. You can surrender your rider and get this top-up of money to be your premiums paid, but you lose then your other benefits of the other rider features for it. And then you can always surrender your contract for cash at any time. There's no waiting period, but you have a surrender charge for the first typically 7 -- 5 to 7 years, depending upon the contract."

I need to -- I'm trying to understand better than I do why this matter of looking at things on a policy-by-policy basis would lead to a reserve increase in Universal Life. And the reason I asked the question is life insurance companies are always dealing with groups of policies, cohorts, averages.

So why is -- if you follow my question, it is, why is going with the -- I understand that going with a policy-by-policy approach is more precise than using an average.

So there were -- although there's an average amount of premiums paid within a group, there was a much bigger percentage of people paying the minimum versus people paying a higher amount. And so we were underestimating the number of policyholders that will trigger the guarantees, and they’ll trigger them sooner. So there's a wider dispersion by triggering in policy by policy, that came out to be a more precise calculation than the average way that was being done previously. In terms of -- to put the charge into perspective, the Universal Life piece of the charge, the $257 million, was about $200 million, and that's about 1.6% of the total reserves for Universal Life was secondary guarantees. It's about $12.5 billion. So it is a true-up of reserves. It's a better method to calculate it, which we do from time to time.

So less people annuitize, more people pick dollar for dollar. But the actual calculations are highly complex. We run tens of thousands of runs over a wide range of scenarios. So we're talking about these interest rates. These are the average interest rates, both even in stat and GAAP. It's just the mean of those interest rates in stat reverts to roughly this 4.25% in 2027. Whereas the GAAP piece, if you pick dollar for dollar, you -- a piece of your risk, the guaranteed piece, the certain period of your annuity has to be reserved under GAAP using like a mean reversion interest rate of 1.36%. It's a very wide difference, including your separate account returns. And I want to stress, that's the separate account return before fees. So you generally have a negative returns in your separate accounts. You can see how that can have a high cost of this. If interest rates migrate higher -- and you have to mark this every quarter to the current yield curve. So as interest rates go up, this charge becomes less as you go through time. So I also wanted to give you the wide range of the changes because what the ultimate cost of these things will be -- will depend on interest rates and what policyholders do. I would also like to stress, this is over a long period of time. Our average age of these contracts is in the 60s, and people will elect these options are well into their 80s and higher. So these are long-term contracts. And how this works out over time will be the ultimate cost. But we do mash this to our experience, and we do it on a regular basis as we get credible experience. And we now have a new industry study that we just got that had some good credible experience for GMIBs, and that's why we set our reserves appropriately."

On this call, we will be discussing certain financial measures not based on Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so called non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found on the Investor Relations portion of metlife.com, in our earnings release and our quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is not accessible, because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of net investment and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a significant impact on GAAP net income. 
Now joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are other members of senior management. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] 
And finally, given the busy insurance earnings calendar this morning, we will end the call promptly at the top of the hour. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve."
185648,403307490,1071599,"MetLife, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone.

Adjusting for notable items, oper",1029,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $1.28. The quarter was characterized by a rebound in variable investment income and solid expense control. Adjusting for notable items, operating earnings were $1.53 per share, which compares to $1.36 per share on the same basis in the prior year period. Two actions account for most of the notable items: The resegmentation of our business and our annual actuarial assumption review. 
First, following resegmentation, the Brighthouse how segment will no longer receive an aggregation benefit associated with GAAP reserve testing of its variable and universal life policies. This previously announced charge lowered operating earnings by $254 million. 
Second, we completed our annual actuarial assumption review in the third quarter. This review covered all of our global businesses, with the exception of variable annuities, which we updated last quarter. The actuarial assumption review lowered operating earnings by $65 million. 
Compared to a year ago, equity markets, which were up 3.3% in the quarter as measured by the S&P 500, had a favorable impact of $80 million, while most other market factors had little impact. 
Among other earnings items, underwriting results were weaker in individual and group life as well as in Property & Casualty. John Hele will discuss underwriting in greater detail. 
In addition to generating more of our earnings in lower-tax jurisdictions, the settlement of several income tax audits benefited normalized results and reduced our quarterly effective tax rate to 20.6%. 
Finally, a below-the-line goodwill write-off served to eliminate Brighthouse's remaining goodwill. 
Moving to investments. Variable investment income totaled $409 million in the quarter, which is above the high end of our quarterly guidance range of $375 million. Higher returns associated with private equity and real estate joint ventures contributed to the outperformance. While we continue to face reinvestment rate pressure, recurring investment income benefited in the quarter from higher asset balances. 
In the quarter, our global new money yield stood at 2.89%. This compares to a roll-off rate of 4.78%. In the second quarter, our new money rate was 3.07%, while the roll-off rate was 4.95%. 
Declining yields continue to pressure the entire life insurance industry. A prolonged period of artificially low interest rates would be easier to accept if we were achieving the stated goal of boosting economic growth, but that is not the case. The U.S. economy continues to muddle along at a less than 2% growth rate and the global economy at around 3%. In our view, the world has become too dependent on monetary policy to solve these economic challenges. Fiscal policy must play a larger role in fueling growth as it has done historically. Pro-growth tax reform and targeted spending increases on infrastructure would accelerate economic expansion. Over the longer term, entitlement reform would reduce the nation's debt burden. And sensible regulatory release, combined with a more construction tone in Washington, would boost business confidence and spur greater economic activity and job growth. The alternative of continuing to rely exclusively on unconventional monetary policy will only prolong a massive transfer of wealth from savers to borrowers. Artificially low interest rates punish those unfixed incomes, including the elderly, and make the cost of financial protection more expensive at a time when social safety nets are under increasing pressure. 
Turning to regulatory matters. I would like to provide a brief update on the government's appeal of the U.S. District Court decision rescinding MetLife's designation as a systemically important financial institution or SIFI. On October 24, oral argument in the case was held before a 3-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. MetLife used the opportunity to vigorously defend the District Court's carefully reasoned opinion. We continue to believe we have a strong case on the merits and look forward to a final decision from the DC circuit court in the coming months. The losing party has the option of appealing to the full bench of the DC Circuit Court or to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Following the close of the quarter, we achieved several important milestones in conjunction with our planned separation of a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business. Shortly after our September Board of Directors meeting, we filed a Form-10 for Brighthouse Financial with the Securities and Exchange Commission. At the same time, we filed a companion 8-K, providing insight into how we expect the planned separation would affect MetLife. We also filed a resegmented quarterly financial supplement with historical information on the new segments. We are working through the regulatory approval process and do not foresee any issues that cannot be resolved. We believe the separation remains on track for the first half of 2017. 
Shifting to expenses. I would like to provide an update on our unit cost improvement program. As we explained on the Q2 earnings call, by 2020, the program will achieve pretax run rate savings of $800 million net of stranded overhead associated with the planned separation of Brighthouse Financial. In order to generate these annual savings, we plan to invest approximately $1 billion from 2016 to 2019 with these onetime investments spread out over the 4-year period. The unit cost program reflects one of the ways we are changing how we run our company. We are placing a strict cap on our expenses based on benchmarking against peers. If our peers improve their own expense ratios, our savings targets would need to move higher as well. 
Before I turn over the call to John to discuss our financial results in greater detail, I'd like to remind you that we are hosting an Investor Day on November 10. I know you have a lot of questions on capital management and return on equity. We will not be addressing those questions today, but we'll cover capital management and ROE comprehensively at next week's Investor Day. We will also highlight MetLife's new brand direction and provide a full overview of our refreshed enterprise strategy. Our accelerating value work has sharpened our focus on cash and capital efficiency, and we look forward to telling you more about our work in these areas. 
Now, to John."

Today, I'll cover our third quarter results, including a discussion of our insurance underwriting margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital. 
Operating earnings in the third quarter were $1.4 billion or $1.28 per share. This quarter included 4 notable items, which are highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement or QFS. 
First, the establishment of a Brighthouse financial segment resulted in the loss of an aggregation benefit associated with the GAAP reserve testing of variable and universal life or V&UL policies. This decreased operating earnings by $254 million or $0.23 per share after tax. 
Second, results of the actuarial assumption review completed in the third quarter for all products other than U.S. variable annuities resulted in a decrease to net income of $59 million, and along with other insurance adjustments, decreased operating earnings by $65 million or $0.06 per share after tax. This charge was primarily due to a change in the earned rate assumption for the traditional life close block in MetLife Holdings as well as Deferred Acquisition Costs, or DAC, unlocking in EMEA and Asia. These are partially offset by favorable DAC unlocking in Brighthouse and Latin America. For long-term care, the annual loss recognition testing continues to reflect positive margins. 
Third, variable investment income was above the 216 quarterly plan range by $22 million or $0.02 per share after-tax and the impact of ADAC. 
And fourth, favorable catastrophe experience and prior year development increased operating earnings by $16 million or $0.01 per share after tax. Adjusting for all notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 11% year-over-year and 10% on a constant currency basis. On a per-share basis, operating earnings were $1.53, up 13% and 12% on a constant currency basis. 
Turning to our bottom line results. Third quarter net income was $571 million or $0.51 per share. Net income was $850 million lower than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative net losses of $834 million related to changes in interest rates and equity markets. Additionally, the third quarter of 2016 includes a goodwill impairment of $223 million after tax, related to the new Brighthouse Financial segment driven by the separation. As part of the resegmentation, the goodwill associated with the previous segments were allocated to the new reporting units in the segments, including within Brighthouse, and tested at that level. As a result, we wrote off all of the goodwill allocated to the Brighthouse life and runoff units. 
The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included an unfavorable impact of $360 million after-tax related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting. 
Book value per share, excluding AOCI other [ph] FCTA was $52.40 [ph] as of September 30, up 4% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $44.40 as of September 30, up 5% year-over-year. 
With respect to third quarter underwriting margins, total company earnings were lower by approximately $0.12 per share versus the prior year quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting Brighthouse accounted for approximately $0.07 of the total, primarily due to the quarterly impact of the loss of the aggregation benefit in V&UL and unfavorable mortality. Excluding Brighthouse, underwriting earnings were lower by approximately $0.05 per share year-over-year due to less favorable mortality experienced in Group Benefits and MetLife Holdings as well as higher group disability claims in Mexico. The group life mortality ratio was 89.3%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 86.1% and at the high end of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. We experienced higher claim severity versus the prior year quarter, but remain in line with our expectations on a year-to-date basis. 
The nonmedical health interest adjusted loss ratio was 76.9%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 78.5% and modestly below the annual target range of 77% to 82%. For the year, Non-Medical Health results have been better than our expectations. 
MetLife Holdings interest adjusted benefit ratio for life products was 60.4% and 59.9% after adjusting for notable reserve items as a result of the actuarial assumption review. On a comparable basis, the 59.9% ratio was unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 55.5%, primarily due to higher claims severity. 
Turning to investment margins. The weighted average of the 3 product spreads in our QFS was 167 basis points in the quarter, up 8 basis points year-over-year. We believe a weighted average is the better measure for U.S. spreads provided now in our QFS, as Retirement & Income Solutions represents approximately 75% of the total asset base. 
Pretax Variable Investment Income or VII was $409 million, up $142 million versus the prior year quarter due to improved hedge fund performance, the sale of a real estate joint venture interest and stronger prepayments. 
Product spreads, excluding the VII were 138 basis points this quarter, up 4 basis points year-over-year. Higher asset balances and portfolio optimization accounted for most of this increase. 
Overall, higher investment margins in the quarter accounted for approximately $0.04 of VPS [ph] improvement  year-over-year. 
With regards to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 20.1%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 24.2% and 21.4% after adjusting for the interest-related component of the noncash charge in the third quarter of 2015. The lower operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily due to the sale of MetLife premier client group, lower employee benefits and other expense efficiencies. Overall, better expense margins contributed approximately $0.09 of EPS improvement versus the prior year quarter. 
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter based on the new operating segmentation as disclosed in our 8-K filed on October 20. 
The U.S. segment is comprised of Group Benefits, Retirement & Income Solutions and Property & Casualty. The remaining 5 segments are Asia, Latin America, EMEA, MetLife Holdings and Brighthouse Financial. 
Group Benefits reported operating earnings of $186 million, up 5% versus the prior year quarter and 2% adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were Non-Medical Health underwriting and higher investment margins. This was partially offset by less favorable mortality experience. 
Group Benefits operating PFOs were $4.1 billion, up 4% year-over-year driven by growth across all products. Sales were up 31% year-to-date, with strong growth across most products and markets. 
Retirement & Income Solutions, or R&IS, reported operating earnings of $308 million, up 15% versus the prior year quarter and 24% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key driver was higher investment margins. R&IS operating PFOs were $1.4 billion, down 13% year-over-year due to lower pension risk transfers or PRT versus a strong third quarter of 2015. As we have noted before, PRT sales can be lumpy, but we continue to see a good pipeline and remain optimistic about future growth opportunities. Excluding PRT, operating PFOs were up 8%. 
Property & Casualty, or P&C, operating earnings were $58 million, down 13% versus the prior year quarter and also down 13% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary driver was non-catastrophe homeowners losses, partially offset by an improvement in non-catastrophe auto results. 
In auto, we have been taking targeted rate increases over the last 12 months, and in the third quarter of 2016, the average premium increase on renewing customers was approximately 6%. These increases, along with other management actions, should increase an improving auto combined ratio in the upcoming quarters adjusting for seasonality. 
P&C operating PFOs were $882 million, up 1% year-over-year. P&C sales were down 5% due to pricing actions as well as a shift toward more profitable business segments and markets. 
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $324 million, down 4% from the prior year quarter and 5% on a constant-currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The prior year quarter had favorable volume growth and benefited from $21 million of investment income from a loan sale as well as one-time tax benefits. 
In the current quarter, Asia results benefited from strong volume growth and lower expenses. 
Asia operating PFOs were $2.2 billion, up 4% from the prior year quarter, but down 9% on a constant-currency basis due to the impact of the withdrawal in Japan of single premium accident products in 2015 and the de-consolidation of the company's India operations. 
Asia sales were down 11% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, reflecting the impact of management actions to improve value in targeted markets. In Japan, sales were down 10% year-over-year. We have seen a successful shift in sales to higher-return, foreign currency-dominated life products, which generally doubled year-over-year and away from low-return Yen life products, which were down 50% year-over-year. Continuing that trend, we expect over 90% of Japan sales in 2017 to come from higher-margin, foreign-denominated and protection products. 
Japan's third sector sales were down 31% versus the prior year as a result of exiting single premium NAH and the negative impact on packaged sales from production yen-denominated whole life product sales. Asia did have strong sales in emerging markets, which were up 24%. 
Latin America reported operating earnings of $133 million, down 27% from the prior year quarter, but up 12% on a constant-currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were market impacts and volume growth. 
Latin American operating PFOs were $891 million, up 4% and 12% on a constant-currency basis, driven by growth across the region. 
Latin America sales were down 6% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, primarily due to lower group and AFORE sales. 
EMEA operating earnings were $74 million, up 12% year-over-year and 61% on a constant-currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were favorable underwriting, lower expenses and several nonrecurring items as well as volume growth. 
EMEA operating PFOs were $621 million, essentially unchanged from the prior-year period, but up 3% on a constant-currency basis driven by growth and employee benefits and accident and health. We continue to see a favorable shift towards higher-margin products. 
Total EMEA sales increased 10% on a constant-currency basis. 
MetLife Holdings which primarily consists of our legacy retail and long-term care runoff businesses reported operating earnings of $266 million, up 9% versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were essentially flat as favorable markets and lower expenses were offset by weaker underwriting. 
MetLife Holdings operating PFOs were $1.6 billion, down 9% year-over-year, mostly due to the sale of the former MetLife Premier Client Group, which included the company's broker-dealer unit. 
Brighthouse Financial, or BHF, operating earnings were $68 million, down 80% versus the prior year quarter. The key driver was the previously discussed $254 million onetime loss related to the resegmentation of MetLife's business to establish a BHF segment as well as the current quarter impact of $42 million. The ongoing impact to BHF from the loss of the aggregation benefit is expected to be approximately $40 million per quarter after tax, gradually declining over time. 
Please note that the Brighthouse Financial segment results within MetLife's financial statements do not match Brighthouse Financial, Inc. and related company's financial statements shown in Form-10 due to accounting timing differences. 
Excluding the onetime loss of $254 million and all of the notable items in both periods, operating earnings were down 22% due to unfavorable underwriting and higher taxes. This was partially offset by favorable markets and lower expenses. 
BHF operating PFOs were $1.3 billion, down 13% year-over-year due to lower fees for annuities as a result of continued negative fund flows and lower premiums due to a decline in SPI sales. 
BHF annuity sales were down 34% and life sales were down 46%, mostly resulting from the suspension of sales to 1 distributor and lower sales from the former MetLife Premier Client Group. Conversely, BHF continues to see strong growth from shield level selector, which is up 54% year-over-year. 
In corporate and other, we had an operating gain of $4 million compared to an operating loss of $983 million in the third quarter of 2015. In 3Q15 corporate and other results included a noncash charge of $792 million related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of MLIC. In 3Q '16, the key driver for the operating gain is a lower effective tax rate, which included a true up to our projected tax run rate of 22.1% and a benefit related to the settlement of certain income tax audits. Adjusting for these items, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.6%. Despite the operating gain in the quarter, we expect corporate and others full year 2016 operating loss to be within the guidance range of $500 million to $700 million. 
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.6 billion at September 30, which is up from $4.9 billion at June 30. This increase reflects subsidiary dividends, proceeds from the sale of the former MetLife premier client group, payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses. 
Turning to our capital position. We report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the third quarter. For Japan, our core solvency margin ratio was 952% as of the second quarter 2016, which is the latest public data. For our U.S. companies, preliminary year-to-date third quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $3.4 billion. Our net earnings were approximately $2.2 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by $2.1 billion from the prior year, primarily due to the favorable impact of equity markets on certain variable annuity reserves and the impact of a prior year tax surge. We estimate that our U.S. statutory total adjusted capital was approximately $30 billion as of September 30, up 3% from December 31. 
In conclusion, MetLife had a solid third quarter. Investment margins, driven by improvement in variable investment income and lower expenses offset underwriting weakness in the quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remains strong, and we remain confident that the steps we are taking to implement our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

And you should think about that in terms of 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in terms of the shortfall. 1/3 being due to there were 2 other single premium A&H products. 1/3 in terms of the packaged yen life sale that we flipped life business effectively from Yen Whole Life to foreign currency. We lose some of the package sales. And 1/3 is also for reduction [indiscernible] response direct marketing business, where the economics weren't appropriate for us. On the life side, what you see a number of about minus 3%, you should note the comments that John made earlier and some already big shift made from yen life to end foreign currency, which have higher value overall. And the other shortfall with Korea, the whole market is down in Korea, economic situation in that market and we pulled back from some of the independent H2 business there again because the commission's too high and the value is too low. So that sort of the over all for Asia. I think you'll see that continue for the fourth quarter although A&H sales in Japan will recover slightly as compared to the prior 3 quarters."

The quarter was characterized by rebound in variable investment income and solid expense control. Adjusting for notable items, operating earnings were $1.53 per share, which compares to $1.36 per share on the same basis in the prior year period. Two actions account for most of the notable items: the resegmentation of our business and our annual actuarial assumption review. 
First, following resegmentation, the Brighthouse segment will no longer receive an aggregation benefit associated with GAAP reserve testing of its variable and universal life policies. This previously announced charge lowered operating earnings by $254 million.
Second, we completed our annual actuarial assumption review in the third quarter. This review covered all of our global businesses, with the exception of variable annuities, which we updated last quarter. The actuarial assumption review lowered operating earnings by $65 million.
Compared to a year ago, equity markets, which were up 3.3% in the quarter as measured by the S&P 500, had a favorable impact of $80 million, while most other market factors had little impact. Among other earnings items, underwriting results were weaker in individual and Group Life as well as in Property & Casualty. John Hele will discuss underwriting in greater detail.
In addition to generating more of our earnings in lower-tax jurisdictions, the settlement of several income tax audits benefited normalized results and reduced our quarterly effective tax rate to 20.6%.
Finally, a below-the-line goodwill write-off served to eliminate Brighthouse's remaining goodwill.
Moving to investments. Variable investment income totaled $409 million in the quarter, which is above the high end of our quarterly guidance range of $375 million. Higher returns associated with private equity and real estate joint ventures contributed to the outperformance. While we continue to face reinvestment rate pressure, recurring investment income benefited in the quarter from higher asset balances.
In the quarter, our global new money yield stood at 2.89%. This compares to a roll-off rate of 4.78%. In the second quarter, our new money rate was 3.07%, while the roll-off rate was 4.95%.
Declining yields continue to pressure the entire life insurance industry. A prolonged period of artificially low interest rates would be easier to accept if we were achieving the stated goal of boosting economic growth. But that is not the case. The U.S. economy continues to muddle along at a less than 2% growth rate and the global economy at around 3%. In our view, the world has become too dependent on monetary policy to solve these economic challenges. Fiscal policy must play a larger role in fueling growth as it has done historically. Pro-growth tax reform and targeted spending increases on infrastructure would accelerate economic expansion. Over the longer term, entitlement reform would reduce the nation's debt burden. And sensible regulatory release, combined with a more constructive tone in Washington would boost business confidence and spur greater economic activity and job growth. The alternative of continuing to rely exclusively on unconventional monetary policy will only prolong a massive transfer of wealth from savers to borrowers. Artificially low interest rates punish those unfixed incomes, including the elderly, and make the cost of financial protection more expensive at a time when social safety nets are under increasing pressure.
Turning to regulatory matters. I would like to provide a brief update on the government's appeal of the U.S. District Court decision rescinding MetLife's designation as a systemically important financial institution or SIFI. On October 24, oral argument in the case was held before a 3-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. MetLife used the opportunity to vigorously defend the District Court's carefully reasoned opinion. We continue to believe we have a strong case on the merits and look forward to a final decision from the DC Circuit Court in the coming months. The losing party has the option of appealing to the full bench of the DC Circuit Court or to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Following the close of the quarter, we achieved several important milestones in conjunction with our planned separation of a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business. Shortly after our September Board of Directors meeting, we filed a Form-10 for Brighthouse Financial with the Securities and Exchange Commission. At the same time, we filed a companion 8-K, providing insight into how we expect the planned separation would affect MetLife. We also filed a resegmented quarterly financial supplement with historical information on the new segments. We are working through the regulatory approval process and do not foresee any issues that cannot be resolved. We believe the separation remains on track for the first half of 2017.
Shifting to expenses. I would like to provide an update on our unit cost improvement program. As we explained on the Q2 earnings call, by 2020, the program will achieve pretax run rate savings of $800 million, net of stranded overhead associated with the planned separation of Brighthouse Financial. In order to generate these annual savings, we plan to invest approximately $1 billion from 2016 to 2019 with these onetime investments spread out over the 4-year period. The unit cost program reflects one of the ways we are changing how we run our company. We are placing a strict cap on our expenses based on benchmarking against peers. If our peers improve their own expense ratios, our savings targets would need to move higher as well. 
Before I turn over the call to John to discuss our financial results in greater detail, I would like to remind you that we are hosting an Investor Day on November 10. I know you have a lot of questions on capital management and return on equity. We will not be addressing those questions today, but we will cover capital management and ROE comprehensively at next week's Investor Day. We will also highlight MetLife's new brand direction and provide a full overview of our refreshed enterprise strategy. Our accelerating value work has sharpened our focus on cash and capital efficiency, and we look forward to telling you more about our work in these areas.
Now, to John."

Today, I will cover our third quarter results, including a discussion of our insurance underwriting margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.
Operating earnings in the third quarter were $1.4 billion or $1.28 per share. This quarter included 4 notable items, which are highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement or QFS. 
First, the establishment of a Brighthouse Financial segment resulted in the loss of an aggregation benefit associated with the GAAP reserve testing of variable and universal life or V&UL policies. This decreased operating earnings by $254 million or $0.23 per share after tax.
Second, results of the actuarial assumption review completed in the third quarter for all products other than U.S. variable annuities resulted in a decrease to net income of $59 million, and along with other insurance adjustments, decreased operating earnings by $65 million or $0.06 per share after tax. This charge was primarily due to a change in the earned rate assumption for the traditional life close block in MetLife Holdings as well as Deferred Acquisition Costs, or DAC, unlocking in EMEA and Asia. These are partially offset by favorable DAC unlocking in Brighthouse and Latin America. For long-term care, the annual loss recognition testing continues to reflect positive margins.
Third, variable investment income was above the 216 (sic) [ 2016 ] quarterly plan range by $22 million or $0.02 per share after tax and the impact of DAC.
And fourth, favorable catastrophe experience and prior year development increased operating earnings by $16 million or $0.01 per share after tax.
Adjusting for all notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 11% year-over-year and 10% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, operating earnings were $1.53, up 13% and 12% on a constant currency basis.
Turning to our bottom line results. Third quarter net income was $571 million or $0.51 per share. Net income was $850 million lower than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative net losses of $834 million related to changes in interest rates and equity markets. Additionally, the third quarter of 2016 includes a goodwill impairment of $223 million after tax, related to the new Brighthouse Financial segment driven by the separation. As part of the resegmentation, the goodwill associated with the previous segments were allocated to the new reporting units in the segments, including within Brighthouse, and tested at that level. As a result, we wrote off all of the goodwill allocated to the Brighthouse Life and runoff units. 
The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included an unfavorable impact of $360 million after tax, related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA was $53.40 as of September 30, up 4% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $44.40 as of September 30, up 5% year-over-year.
With respect to third quarter underwriting margins, total company earnings were lower by approximately $0.12 per share versus the prior year quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting Brighthouse accounted for approximately $0.07 of the total, primarily due to the quarterly impact of the loss of the aggregation benefit in V&UL and unfavorable mortality. Excluding Brighthouse, underwriting earnings were lower by approximately $0.05 per share year-over-year due to less favorable mortality experienced in Group Benefits and MetLife Holdings as well as higher group disability claims in Mexico. The Group Life mortality ratio was 89.3%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 86.1% and at the high end of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. We experienced higher claim severity versus the prior year quarter, but remain in line with our expectations on a year-to-date basis.
The Non-Medical Health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 76.9%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 78.5% and modestly below the annual target range of 77% to 82%. For the year, Non-Medical Health results have been better than our expectations.
MetLife Holdings interest adjusted benefit ratio for life products was 60.4% and 59.9% after adjusting for notable reserve item as a result of the actuarial assumption review. On a comparable basis, the 59.9% ratio was unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 55.5%, primarily due to higher claims severity.
Turning to investment margins. The weighted average of the 3 product spreads in our QFS was 167 basis points in the quarter, up 8 basis points year-over-year. We believe a weighted average is the better measure for U.S. spreads provided now in our QFS, as Retirement & Income Solutions represents approximately 75% of the total asset base.
Pretax Variable Investment Income, or VII, was $409 million, up $142 million versus the prior year quarter due to improved hedge fund performance, the sale of a real estate joint venture interest and stronger prepayments.
Product spreads, excluding VII, were 138 basis points this quarter, up 4 basis points year-over-year. Higher asset balances and portfolio optimization accounted for most of this increase.
Overall, higher investment margins in the quarter accounted for approximately $0.04 of EPS improvement year-over-year.
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 20.1%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 24.2% and 21.4% after adjusting for the interest-related component of the noncash charge in the third quarter of 2015. The lower operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily due to the sale of MetLife Premier Client Group, lower employee benefits and other expense efficiencies. Overall, better expense margins contributed approximately $0.09 of EPS improvement versus the prior year quarter.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter based on the new operating segmentation as disclosed in our 8-K filed on October 20.
The U.S. segment is comprised of Group Benefits, Retirement & Income Solutions and Property & Casualty. The remaining 5 segments are Asia, Latin America, EMEA, MetLife Holdings and Brighthouse Financial.
Group Benefits reported operating earnings of $186 million, up 5% versus the prior year quarter and 2% adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were Non-Medical Health underwriting and higher investment margins. This was partially offset by less favorable mortality experience.
Group Benefits operating PFOs were $4.1 billion, up 4% year-over-year driven by growth across all products. Sales were up 31% year-to-date, with strong growth across most products and markets.
Retirement & Income Solutions, or R&IS, reported operating earnings of $308 million, up 15% versus the prior year quarter and 24% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key driver was higher investment margins. R&IS operating PFOs were $1.4 billion, down 13% year-over-year due to lower pension risk transfers, or PRT, versus a strong third quarter of 2015. As we have noted before, PRT sales can be lumpy, but we continue to see a good pipeline and remain optimistic about future growth opportunities. Excluding PRT, operating PFOs were up 8%.
Property & Casualty, or P&C, operating earnings were $58 million, down 13% versus the prior year quarter and also down 13% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary driver was noncatastrophe homeowners losses, partially offset by an improvement in noncatastrophe auto results. 
In auto, we have been taking targeted rate increases over the last 12 months, and in the third quarter of 2016, the average premium increase on renewing customers was approximately 6%. These increases, along with other management actions, should increase an improving auto-combined ratio in the upcoming quarters adjusting for seasonality.
P&C operating PFOs were $882 million, up 1% year-over-year. P&C sales were down 5% due to pricing actions as well as a shift toward more profitable business segments and markets.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $324 million, down 4% from the prior year quarter and 5% on a constant-currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The prior year quarter had favorable volume growth and benefited from $21 million of investment income from a loan sale as well as onetime tax benefits. In the current quarter, Asia results benefited from strong volume growth and lower expenses.
Asia operating PFOs were $2.2 billion, up 4% from the prior year quarter, but down 9% on a constant-currency basis due to the impact of the withdrawal in Japan of single premium accident and health Yen products in 2015 and the deconsolidation of the company's India operations. Asia sales were down 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of management actions to improve value in targeted markets.
In Japan, sales were down 10% year-over-year. We have seen a successful shift in sales to higher-return, foreign-currency denominated life products, which generally doubled year-over-year and away from low-return Yen life products, which were down 50% year-over-year. Continuing that trend, we expect over 90% of Japan sales in 2017 to come from higher-margin, foreign-denominated and protection products. 
Japan's third sector sales were down 31% versus the prior year as a result of exiting single premium A&H and the negative impact on packaged sales from reduction yen-denominated Whole Life product sales. Asia did have strong sales in emerging markets, which were up 24%.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $133 million, down 27% from the prior year quarter, but up 12% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were market impacts and volume growth.
Latin American operating PFOs were $891 million, up 4% and 12% on constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region.
Latin America sales were down 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower group and AFORE sales. 
EMEA operating earnings were $74 million, up 12% year-over-year and 61% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were favorable underwriting, lower expenses and several nonrecurring items as well as volume growth.
EMEA operating PFOs were $621 million, essentially unchanged from the prior year period, but up 3% on a constant currency basis driven by growth and employee benefits and accident and health. We continue to see a favorable shift towards higher-margin products. Total EMEA sales increased 10% on a constant currency basis.
MetLife Holdings, which primarily consists of our legacy retail and long-term care runoff businesses, reported operating earnings of $266 million, up 9% versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were essentially flat as favorable markets and lower expenses were offset by weaker underwriting.
MetLife Holdings operating PFOs were $1.6 billion, down 9% year-over-year, mostly due to the sale of the former MetLife Premier Client Group, which included the company's broker-dealer unit.
Brighthouse Financial, or BHF, operating earnings were $68 million, down 80% versus the prior year quarter. The key driver was the previously discussed $254 million onetime loss related to the resegmentation of MetLife's business to establish a BHF segment as well as the current quarter impact of $42 million. The ongoing impact to BHF from the loss of the aggregation benefit is expected to be approximately $40 million per quarter after tax, gradually declining over time.
Please note that the Brighthouse Financial segment results within MetLife's financial statements do not match Brighthouse Financial, Inc. and related company's financial statements shown in the Form-10 due to accounting timing differences.
Excluding the onetime loss of $254 million and all of the notable items in both periods, operating earnings were down 22% due to unfavorable underwriting and higher taxes. This was partially offset by favorable markets and lower expenses.
BHF operating PFOs were $1.3 billion, down 13% year-over-year due to lower fees for annuities as a result of continued negative fund flows and lower premiums due to a decline in SPI sales.
BHF annuity sales were down 34% and life sales were down 46%, mostly resulting from the suspension of sales through one distributor and lower sales from the former MetLife Premier Client Group. Conversely, BHF continues to see strong growth from shield level selector, which is up 54% year-over-year.
In Corporate & Other, we had an operating gain of $4 million compared to an operating loss of $983 million in the third quarter of 2015. In 3Q '15 Corporate & Other results included a noncash charge of $792 million related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of MLIC. In 3Q '16, the key driver for the operating gain is a lower effective tax rate, which included a true-up to our projected tax run rate of 22.1% and a benefit related to the settlement of certain income tax audits. Adjusting for these items, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.6%. Despite the operating gain in the quarter, we expect Corporate & Other full year 2016 operating loss to be within the guidance range of $500 million to $700 million.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets of the holding companies were approximately $5.6 billion at September 30, which is up from $4.9 billion at June 30. This increase reflects subsidiary dividends, proceeds from the sale of the former MetLife Premier Client Group, payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses.
Turning to our capital position. We report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the third quarter. For Japan, our core solvency margin ratio was 952% as of the second quarter 2016, which is the latest public data.
For our U.S. companies, preliminary year-to-date third quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $3.4 billion. And net earnings were approximately $2.2 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by $2.1 billion from the prior year, primarily due to the favorable impact of equity markets and certain variable annuity reserves and the impact of a prior year tax charge. We estimate that our U.S. statutory total adjusted capital was approximately $30 billion as of September 30, up 3% from December 31.
In conclusion, MetLife had a solid third quarter. Investment margins, driven by an improvement in variable investment income and lower expenses offset underwriting weakness in the quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remain strong, and we remain confident that the steps we are taking to implement our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

And you should think about that in terms of 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in terms of the shortfall: 1/3 being due to the withdrawal of single premium A&H products; 1/3 in terms of the package Yen Life sales as we flipped life business effectively from Yen Whole Life to foreign currency, we lose some of the package sales; and 1/3 is also for reduction in terms of response direct-marketing business, where the economics weren't appropriate for us. On the Life side, well, if you see a number of about minus 3%, you should note the comments that John made earlier in terms of the already big shift we have made from yen life to foreign currency, which have higher value overall. And the other shortfall with Korea, the whole market is down in Korea with some -- due to economic situation in that market, and we pulled back from some of the independent H2 business there again because the commission is too high and the value is too low. So that's sort of the overall story for Asia. I think you'll see that continue for the fourth quarter, although A&H sales in Japan will recover slightly as compared to the prior 3 quarters."

The quarter was characterized by rebound in variable investment income and solid expense control. Adjusting for notable items, operating earnings were $1.53 per share, which compares to $1.36 per share on the same basis in the prior year period. Two actions account for most of the notable items: the resegmentation of our business and our annual actuarial assumption review. 
First, following resegmentation, the Brighthouse segment will no longer receive an aggregation benefit associated with GAAP reserve testing of its variable and universal life policies. This previously announced charge lowered operating earnings by $254 million.
Second, we completed our annual actuarial assumption review in the third quarter. This review covered all of our global businesses, with the exception of variable annuities, which we updated last quarter. The actuarial assumption review lowered operating earnings by $65 million.
Compared to a year ago, equity markets, which were up 3.3% in the quarter as measured by the S&P 500, had a favorable impact of $80 million, while most other market factors had little impact. Among other earnings items, underwriting results were weaker in individual and Group Life as well as in Property & Casualty. John Hele will discuss underwriting in greater detail.
In addition to generating more of our earnings in lower-tax jurisdictions, the settlement of several income tax audits benefited normalized results and reduced our quarterly effective tax rate to 20.6%.
Finally, a below-the-line goodwill write-off served to eliminate Brighthouse's remaining goodwill.
Moving to investments. Variable investment income totaled $409 million in the quarter, which is above the high end of our quarterly guidance range of $375 million. Higher returns associated with private equity and real estate joint ventures contributed to the outperformance. While we continued to face reinvestment rate pressure, recurring investment income benefited in the quarter from higher asset balances.
In the quarter, our global new money yield stood at 2.89%. This compares to a roll-off rate of 4.78%. In the second quarter, our new money rate was 3.07%, while the roll-off rate was 4.95%.
Declining yields continued to pressure the entire life insurance industry. A prolonged period of artificially low interest rates would be easier to accept if it were achieving the stated goal of boosting economic growth. But that is not the case. The U.S. economy continues to muddle along at a less than 2% growth rate and the global economy at around 3%. In our view, the world has become too dependent on monetary policy to solve its economic challenges. Fiscal policy must play a larger role in fueling growth as it has done historically. Pro-growth tax reform and targeted spending increases on infrastructure would accelerate economic expansion. Over the longer term, entitlement reform would reduce the nation's debt burden. And sensible regulatory relief, combined with a more constructive tone in Washington would boost business confidence and spur greater economic activity and job growth. The alternative of continuing to rely exclusively on unconventional monetary policy will only prolong a massive transfer of wealth from savers to borrowers. Artificially low interest rates punish those on fixed incomes, including the elderly, and make the cost of financial protection more expensive at a time when social safety nets are under increasing pressure.
Turning to regulatory matters. I would like to provide a brief update on the government's appeal of the U.S. District Court decision rescinding MetLife's designation as a systemically important financial institution or SIFI. On October 24, oral argument in the case was held before a 3-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. MetLife used the opportunity to vigorously defend the District Court's carefully reasoned opinion. We continue to believe we have a strong case on the merits and look forward to a final decision from the DC Circuit Court in the coming months. The losing party has the option of appealing to the full bench of the DC Circuit Court or to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Following the close of the quarter, we achieved several important milestones in conjunction with our planned separation of a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business. Shortly after our September Board Directors meeting, we filed a Form-10 for Brighthouse Financial with the Securities and Exchange Commission. At the same time, we filed a companion 8-K, providing insight into how we expect the planned separation would affect MetLife. We also filed a resegmented quarterly financial supplement with historical information on the new segments. We are working through the regulatory approval process and do not foresee any issues that cannot be resolved. We believe the separation remains on track for the first half of 2017.
Shifting to expenses. I would like to provide an update on our unit cost improvement program. As we explained on the Q2 earnings call, by 2020, the program will achieve pretax run rate savings of $800 million, net of stranded overhead associated with the planned separation of Brighthouse Financial. In order to generate these annual savings, we plan to invest approximately $1 billion from 2016 to 2019 with these onetime investments spread out over the 4-year period. The unit cost program reflects one of the ways we are changing how we run our company. We are placing a strict cap on our expenses based on benchmarking against peers. If our peers improve their own expense ratios, our savings targets would need to move higher as well. 
Before I turn over the call to John to discuss our financial results in greater detail, I would like to remind you that we are hosting an Investor Day on November 10. I know you have a lot of questions on capital management and return on equity. We will not be addressing those questions today, but we will cover capital management and ROE comprehensively at next week's Investor Day. We will also highlight MetLife's new brand direction and provide a full overview of our refreshed enterprise strategy. Our accelerating value work has sharpened our focus on cash and capital efficiency, and we look forward to telling you more about our work in these areas.
Now, to John."

Today, I will cover our third quarter results, including a discussion of our insurance underwriting margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.
Operating earnings in the third quarter were $1.4 billion or $1.28 per share. This quarter included 4 notable items, which are highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement or QFS. 
First, the establishment of a Brighthouse Financial segment resulted in the loss of an aggregation benefit associated with the GAAP reserve testing of variable and universal life or V&UL policies. This decreased operating earnings by $254 million or $0.23 per share after tax.
Second, results of the actuarial assumption review completed in the third quarter for all products other than U.S. variable annuities resulted in a decrease to net income of $59 million, and along with other insurance adjustments, decreased operating earnings by $65 million or $0.06 per share after tax. This charge was primarily due to a change in the earned rate assumption for the traditional life closed block in MetLife Holdings as well as Deferred Acquisition Costs, or DAC, unlockings in EMEA and Asia. These are partially offset by favorable DAC unlockings in Brighthouse and Latin America. For long-term care, the annual loss recognition testing continues to reflect positive margins.
Third, variable investment income was above the 216 (sic) [ 2016 ] quarterly plan range by $22 million or $0.02 per share after tax and the impact of DAC.
And fourth, favorable catastrophe experience and prior year development increased operating earnings by $16 million or $0.01 per share after tax.
Adjusting for all notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 11% year-over-year and 10% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, operating earnings were $1.53, up 13% and 12% on a constant currency basis.
Turning to our bottom line results. Third quarter net income was $571 million or $0.51 per share. Net income was $850 million lower than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative net losses of $834 million related to changes in interest rates and equity markets. Additionally, the third quarter of 2016 includes a goodwill impairment of $223 million after tax, related to the new Brighthouse Financial segment driven by the separation. As part of the resegmentation, the goodwill associated with the previous segments were allocated to the new reporting units in the segments, including within Brighthouse, and tested at that level. As a result, we wrote off all of the goodwill allocated to the Brighthouse Life and runoff units. 
The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included an unfavorable impact of $360 million after tax, related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA was $53.40 as of September 30, up 4% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $44.40 as of September 30, up 5% year-over-year.
With respect to third quarter underwriting margins, total company earnings were lower by approximately $0.12 per share versus the prior year quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting Brighthouse accounted for approximately $0.07 of the total, primarily due to the quarterly impact of the loss of the aggregation benefit in V&UL and unfavorable mortality. Excluding Brighthouse, underwriting earnings were lower by approximately $0.05 per share year-over-year due to less favorable mortality experienced in Group Benefits and MetLife Holdings as well as higher group disability claims in Mexico. The Group Life mortality ratio was 89.3%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 86.1% and at the high end of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. We experienced higher claim severity versus the prior year quarter, but remain in line with our expectations on a year-to-date basis.
The Non-Medical Health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 76.9%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 78.5% and modestly below the annual target range of 77% to 82%. For the year, Non-Medical Health results have been better than our expectations.
MetLife Holdings interest adjusted benefit ratio for life products was 60.4% and 59.9% after adjusting for a notable reserve item as a result of the actuarial assumption review. On comparable basis, the 59.9% ratio was unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 55.5%, primarily due to higher claims severity.
Turning to investment margins. The weighted average of the 3 product spreads in our QFS was 167 basis points in the quarter, up 8 basis points year-over-year. We believe a weighted average is the better measure for U.S. spreads provided now in our QFS, as Retirement & Income Solutions represents approximately 75% of the total asset base.
Pretax Variable Investment Income, or VII, was $409 million, up $142 million versus the prior year quarter due to improved hedge fund performance, the sale of a real estate joint venture interest and stronger prepayments.
Product spreads, excluding VII, were 138 basis points this quarter, up 4 basis points year-over-year. Higher asset balances and portfolio optimization accounted for most of this increase.
Overall, higher investment margins in the quarter accounted for approximately $0.04 of EPS improvement year-over-year.
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 20.1%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 24.2% and 21.4% after adjusting for the interest-related component of the noncash charge in the third quarter of 2015. The lower operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily due to the sale of MetLife Premier Client Group, lower employee benefits and other expense efficiencies. Overall, better expense margins contributed approximately $0.09 of EPS improvement versus the prior year quarter.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter based on the new operating segmentation as disclosed in our 8-K filed on October 20.
The U.S. segment is comprised of Group Benefits, Retirement & Income Solutions and Property & Casualty. The remaining 5 segments are Asia, Latin America, EMEA, MetLife Holdings and Brighthouse Financial.
Group Benefits reported operating earnings of $186 million, up 5% versus the prior year quarter and 2% adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were Non-Medical Health underwriting and higher investment margins. This was partially offset by less favorable mortality experience.
Group Benefits operating PFOs were $4.1 billion, up 4% year-over-year driven by growth across all products. Sales were up 31% year-to-date, with strong growth across most products and markets.
Retirement & Income Solutions, or R&IS, reported operating earnings of $308 million, up 15% versus the prior year quarter and 24% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key driver was higher investment margins. R&IS operating PFOs were $1.4 billion, down 13% year-over-year due to lower pension risk transfers, or PRT, versus a strong third quarter of 2015. As we have noted before, PRT sales can be lumpy, but we continue to see a good pipeline and remain optimistic about future growth opportunities. Excluding PRT, operating PFOs were up 8%.
Property & Casualty, or P&C, operating earnings were $58 million, down 13% versus the prior year quarter and also down 13% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary driver was noncatastrophe homeowners losses, partially offset by an improvement in noncatastrophe auto results. 
In auto, we have been taking targeted rate increases over the last 12 months, and in the third quarter of 2016, the average premium increase on renewing customers was approximately 6%. These increases, along with other management actions, should increase an improving auto-combined ratio in the upcoming quarters adjusting for seasonality.
P&C operating PFOs were $882 million, up 1% year-over-year. P&C sales were down 5% due to pricing actions as well as a shift toward more profitable business segments and markets.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $324 million, down 4% from the prior year quarter and 5% on a constant-currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The prior year quarter had favorable volume growth and benefited from $21 million of investment income from a loan sale as well as onetime tax benefits. In the current quarter, Asia results benefited from strong volume growth and lower expenses.
Asia operating PFOs were $2.2 billion, up 4% from the prior year quarter, but down 9% on a constant-currency basis due to the impact of the withdrawal in Japan of single premium Accident & Health Yen products in 2015 and the deconsolidation of the company's India operations. Asia sales were down 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of management actions to improve value in targeted markets.
In Japan, sales were down 10% year-over-year. We have seen a successful shift in sales to higher-return, foreign-currency denominated life products, which nearly doubled year-over-year, and away from low-return Yen life products, which were down 50% year-over-year. Continuing that trend, we expect over 90% of Japan sales in 2017 to come from higher-margin, foreign-denominated and protection products. 
Japan's third sector sales were down 31% versus the prior year as a result of exiting single premium A&H and the negative impact on packaged sales from a reduction in yen-denominated Whole Life product sales. Asia did have strong sales in emerging markets, which were up 24%.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $133 million, down 27% from the prior year quarter, but up 12% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were market impacts and volume growth.
Latin American operating PFOs were $891 million, up 4% and 12% on constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region.
Latin America sales were down 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower group and Afore sales. 
EMEA operating earnings were $74 million, up 12% year-over-year and 61% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were favorable underwriting, lower expenses and several nonrecurring items as well as volume growth.
EMEA operating PFOs were $621 million, essentially unchanged from the prior year period, but up 3% on a constant currency basis driven by growth in employee benefits and Accident & Health. We continue to see a favorable shift towards higher-margin products. Total EMEA sales increased 10% on a constant currency basis.
MetLife Holdings, which primarily consists of our legacy retail and long-term care runoff businesses, reported operating earnings of $266 million, up 9% versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were essentially flat as favorable markets and lower expenses were offset by weaker underwriting.
MetLife Holdings operating PFOs were $1.6 billion, down 9% year-over-year, mostly due to the sale of the former MetLife Premier Client Group, which included the company's broker-dealer unit.
Brighthouse Financial, or BHF, operating earnings were $68 million, down 80% versus the prior year quarter. The key driver was the previously discussed $254 million onetime loss related to the resegmentation of MetLife's business to establish a BHF segment as well as the current quarter impact of $42 million. The ongoing impact to BHF from the loss of the aggregation benefit is expected to be approximately $40 million per quarter after tax, gradually declining over time.
Please note that the Brighthouse Financial segment results within MetLife's financial statements do not match Brighthouse Financial, Inc. and related company's financial statements shown in the Form-10 due to accounting timing differences.
Excluding the onetime loss of $254 million and all other notable items in both periods, operating earnings were down 22% due to unfavorable underwriting and higher taxes. This was partially offset by favorable markets and lower expenses.
BHF operating PFOs were $1.3 billion, down 13% year-over-year due to lower fees for annuities as a result of continued negative fund flows and lower premiums due to a decline in SPI sales.
BHF annuity sales were down 34% and life sales were down 46%, mostly resulting from the suspension of sales through one distributor and lower sales from the former MetLife Premier Client Group. Conversely, BHF continues to see strong growth from Shield Level Selector, which is up 54% year-over-year.
In Corporate & Other, we had an operating gain of $4 million compared to an operating loss of $983 million in the third quarter of 2015. In 3Q '15 Corporate & Other results included a noncash charge of $792 million related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of MLIC. In 3Q '16, the key driver for the operating gain is a lower effective tax rate, which included a true-up to our projected tax run rate of 22.1% and a benefit related to the settlement of certain income tax audits. Adjusting for these items, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.6%. Despite the operating gain in the quarter, we expect Corporate & Other's full year 2016 operating loss to be within the guidance range of $500 million to $700 million.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.6 billion at September 30, which is up from $4.9 billion at June 30. This increase reflects subsidiary dividends, proceeds from the sale of the former MetLife Premier Client Group, payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses.
Turning to our capital position. We report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the third quarter. For Japan, our core solvency margin ratio was 952% as of the second quarter of 2016, which is the latest public data.
For our U.S. companies, preliminary year-to-date third quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $3.4 billion. And net earnings were approximately $2.2 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by $2.1 billion from the prior year, primarily due to the favorable impact of equity markets on certain variable annuity reserves and the impact of a prior year tax charge. We estimate that our U.S. statutory total adjusted capital was approximately $30 billion as of September 30, up 3% from December 31.
In conclusion, MetLife had a solid third quarter. Investment margins, driven by an improvement in variable investment income and lower expenses offset underwriting weakness in the quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remain strong, and we remain confident that the steps we are taking to implement our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

So the sort of the high-level number was minus 11% for the quarter. So the shortfall there really was all about Japan and Korea. The high point to our emerging markets were up 24%. And Asia, ex Japan and Korea, was up 10%. For Japan, all the sales shortfall really is around the A&H business, which was down 31%. And you should think about that in terms of 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in terms of the shortfall: 1/3 being due to the withdrawal of single premium A&H products; 1/3 in terms of the package Yen Life sales as we flip the life business effectively, from Yen Whole Life to foreign currency, we lose some of the package sales; and 1/3 is also for reduction in terms of response direct-marketing business, where the economics weren't appropriate for us. On the Life side, whilst you see a number of about minus 3%, you should note the comments that John made earlier in terms of the really big shift we've made from Yen Life to foreign currency, which have higher value overall. And the other shortfall was Korea. The whole market is down in Korea in terms of the economic situation in that market, and we pulled back from some of the independent agents who do business there again because the commissions are too high and the value is too low. So that's sort of the overall story for Asia. I think you'll see that continue for the fourth quarter, although A&H sales in Japan will recover slightly as compared to the prior 3 quarters."

185648,403307490,1074058,"MetLife, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $1.28. The quarter was characterized by rebound in variable investment income and solid expense control. Adjusting for notable items, operat",1029,"Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Last night, we reported third quarter operating earnings per share of $1.28. The quarter was characterized by rebound in variable investment income and solid expense control. Adjusting for notable items, operating earnings were $1.53 per share, which compares to $1.36 per share on the same basis in the prior year period. Two actions account for most of the notable items: the resegmentation of our business and our annual actuarial assumption review. 
First, following resegmentation, the Brighthouse segment will no longer receive an aggregation benefit associated with GAAP reserve testing of its variable and universal life policies. This previously announced charge lowered operating earnings by $254 million.
Second, we completed our annual actuarial assumption review in the third quarter. This review covered all of our global businesses, with the exception of variable annuities, which we updated last quarter. The actuarial assumption review lowered operating earnings by $65 million.
Compared to a year ago, equity markets, which were up 3.3% in the quarter as measured by the S&P 500, had a favorable impact of $80 million, while most other market factors had little impact. Among other earnings items, underwriting results were weaker in individual and Group Life as well as in Property & Casualty. John Hele will discuss underwriting in greater detail.
In addition to generating more of our earnings in lower-tax jurisdictions, the settlement of several income tax audits benefited normalized results and reduced our quarterly effective tax rate to 20.6%.
Finally, a below-the-line goodwill write-off served to eliminate Brighthouse's remaining goodwill.
Moving to investments. Variable investment income totaled $409 million in the quarter, which is above the high end of our quarterly guidance range of $375 million. Higher returns associated with private equity and real estate joint ventures contributed to the outperformance. While we continued to face reinvestment rate pressure, recurring investment income benefited in the quarter from higher asset balances.
In the quarter, our global new money yield stood at 2.89%. This compares to a roll-off rate of 4.78%. In the second quarter, our new money rate was 3.07%, while the roll-off rate was 4.95%.
Declining yields continued to pressure the entire life insurance industry. A prolonged period of artificially low interest rates would be easier to accept if it were achieving the stated goal of boosting economic growth. But that is not the case. The U.S. economy continues to muddle along at a less than 2% growth rate and the global economy at around 3%. In our view, the world has become too dependent on monetary policy to solve its economic challenges. Fiscal policy must play a larger role in fueling growth as it has done historically. Pro-growth tax reform and targeted spending increases on infrastructure would accelerate economic expansion. Over the longer term, entitlement reform would reduce the nation's debt burden. And sensible regulatory relief, combined with a more constructive tone in Washington would boost business confidence and spur greater economic activity and job growth. The alternative of continuing to rely exclusively on unconventional monetary policy will only prolong a massive transfer of wealth from savers to borrowers. Artificially low interest rates punish those on fixed incomes, including the elderly, and make the cost of financial protection more expensive at a time when social safety nets are under increasing pressure.
Turning to regulatory matters. I would like to provide a brief update on the government's appeal of the U.S. District Court decision rescinding MetLife's designation as a systemically important financial institution or SIFI. On October 24, oral argument in the case was held before a 3-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. MetLife used the opportunity to vigorously defend the District Court's carefully reasoned opinion. We continue to believe we have a strong case on the merits and look forward to a final decision from the DC Circuit Court in the coming months. The losing party has the option of appealing to the full bench of the DC Circuit Court or to the U.S. Supreme Court.
Following the close of the quarter, we achieved several important milestones in conjunction with our planned separation of a substantial portion of our U.S. Retail business. Shortly after our September Board Directors meeting, we filed a Form-10 for Brighthouse Financial with the Securities and Exchange Commission. At the same time, we filed a companion 8-K, providing insight into how we expect the planned separation would affect MetLife. We also filed a resegmented quarterly financial supplement with historical information on the new segments. We are working through the regulatory approval process and do not foresee any issues that cannot be resolved. We believe the separation remains on track for the first half of 2017.
Shifting to expenses. I would like to provide an update on our unit cost improvement program. As we explained on the Q2 earnings call, by 2020, the program will achieve pretax run rate savings of $800 million, net of stranded overhead associated with the planned separation of Brighthouse Financial. In order to generate these annual savings, we plan to invest approximately $1 billion from 2016 to 2019 with these onetime investments spread out over the 4-year period. The unit cost program reflects one of the ways we are changing how we run our company. We are placing a strict cap on our expenses based on benchmarking against peers. If our peers improve their own expense ratios, our savings targets would need to move higher as well. 
Before I turn over the call to John to discuss our financial results in greater detail, I would like to remind you that we are hosting an Investor Day on November 10. I know you have a lot of questions on capital management and return on equity. We will not be addressing those questions today, but we will cover capital management and ROE comprehensively at next week's Investor Day. We will also highlight MetLife's new brand direction and provide a full overview of our refreshed enterprise strategy. Our accelerating value work has sharpened our focus on cash and capital efficiency, and we look forward to telling you more about our work in these areas.
Now, to John."
185648,403307490,1074058,"MetLife, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","MetLife, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Steve, and good morning.

Today, I will cover our third quarter results, including a discussion of our insurance underwriting margins, investment spreads, expenses and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and capital.
Operating earnings in the third quarter were $1.4 billion or $1.28 per share. This quarter included 4 notable items, which are highlighted in our news release and disclosed by business segment in the appendix of our Quarterly Financial Supplement or QFS. 
First, the establishment of a Brighthouse Financial segment resulted in the loss of an aggregation benefit associated with the GAAP reserve testing of variable and universal life or V&UL policies. This decreased operating earnings by $254 million or $0.23 per share after tax.
Second, results of the actuarial assumption review completed in the third quarter for all products other than U.S. variable annuities resulted in a decrease to net income of $59 million, and along with other insurance adjustments, decreased operating earnings by $65 million or $0.06 per share after tax. This charge was primarily due to a change in the earned rate assumption for the traditional life closed block in MetLife Holdings as well as Deferred Acquisition Costs, or DAC, unlockings in EMEA and Asia. These are partially offset by favorable DAC unlockings in Brighthouse and Latin America. For long-term care, the annual loss recognition testing continues to reflect positive margins.
Third, variable investment income was above the 216 (sic) [ 2016 ] quarterly plan range by $22 million or $0.02 per share after tax and the impact of DAC.
And fourth, favorable catastrophe experience and prior year development increased operating earnings by $16 million or $0.01 per share after tax.
Adjusting for all notable items in both periods, operating earnings were up 11% year-over-year and 10% on a constant currency basis. On a per share basis, operating earnings were $1.53, up 13% and 12% on a constant currency basis.
Turning to our bottom line results. Third quarter net income was $571 million or $0.51 per share. Net income was $850 million lower than operating earnings, primarily because of derivative net losses of $834 million related to changes in interest rates and equity markets. Additionally, the third quarter of 2016 includes a goodwill impairment of $223 million after tax, related to the new Brighthouse Financial segment driven by the separation. As part of the resegmentation, the goodwill associated with the previous segments were allocated to the new reporting units in the segments, including within Brighthouse, and tested at that level. As a result, we wrote off all of the goodwill allocated to the Brighthouse Life and runoff units. 
The difference between net income and operating earnings in the quarter included an unfavorable impact of $360 million after tax, related to asymmetrical and noneconomic accounting.
Book value per share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA was $53.40 as of September 30, up 4% year-over-year. Tangible book value per share was $44.40 as of September 30, up 5% year-over-year.
With respect to third quarter underwriting margins, total company earnings were lower by approximately $0.12 per share versus the prior year quarter after adjusting for notable items in both periods. Underwriting Brighthouse accounted for approximately $0.07 of the total, primarily due to the quarterly impact of the loss of the aggregation benefit in V&UL and unfavorable mortality. Excluding Brighthouse, underwriting earnings were lower by approximately $0.05 per share year-over-year due to less favorable mortality experienced in Group Benefits and MetLife Holdings as well as higher group disability claims in Mexico. The Group Life mortality ratio was 89.3%, unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 86.1% and at the high end of the annual target range of 85% to 90%. We experienced higher claim severity versus the prior year quarter, but remain in line with our expectations on a year-to-date basis.
The Non-Medical Health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 76.9%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 78.5% and modestly below the annual target range of 77% to 82%. For the year, Non-Medical Health results have been better than our expectations.
MetLife Holdings interest adjusted benefit ratio for life products was 60.4% and 59.9% after adjusting for a notable reserve item as a result of the actuarial assumption review. On comparable basis, the 59.9% ratio was unfavorable to the prior year quarter of 55.5%, primarily due to higher claims severity.
Turning to investment margins. The weighted average of the 3 product spreads in our QFS was 167 basis points in the quarter, up 8 basis points year-over-year. We believe a weighted average is the better measure for U.S. spreads provided now in our QFS, as Retirement & Income Solutions represents approximately 75% of the total asset base.
Pretax Variable Investment Income, or VII, was $409 million, up $142 million versus the prior year quarter due to improved hedge fund performance, the sale of a real estate joint venture interest and stronger prepayments.
Product spreads, excluding VII, were 138 basis points this quarter, up 4 basis points year-over-year. Higher asset balances and portfolio optimization accounted for most of this increase.
Overall, higher investment margins in the quarter accounted for approximately $0.04 of EPS improvement year-over-year.
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 20.1%, favorable to the prior year quarter of 24.2% and 21.4% after adjusting for the interest-related component of the noncash charge in the third quarter of 2015. The lower operating expense ratio in the quarter was primarily due to the sale of MetLife Premier Client Group, lower employee benefits and other expense efficiencies. Overall, better expense margins contributed approximately $0.09 of EPS improvement versus the prior year quarter.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter based on the new operating segmentation as disclosed in our 8-K filed on October 20.
The U.S. segment is comprised of Group Benefits, Retirement & Income Solutions and Property & Casualty. The remaining 5 segments are Asia, Latin America, EMEA, MetLife Holdings and Brighthouse Financial.
Group Benefits reported operating earnings of $186 million, up 5% versus the prior year quarter and 2% adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary drivers were Non-Medical Health underwriting and higher investment margins. This was partially offset by less favorable mortality experience.
Group Benefits operating PFOs were $4.1 billion, up 4% year-over-year driven by growth across all products. Sales were up 31% year-to-date, with strong growth across most products and markets.
Retirement & Income Solutions, or R&IS, reported operating earnings of $308 million, up 15% versus the prior year quarter and 24% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key driver was higher investment margins. R&IS operating PFOs were $1.4 billion, down 13% year-over-year due to lower pension risk transfers, or PRT, versus a strong third quarter of 2015. As we have noted before, PRT sales can be lumpy, but we continue to see a good pipeline and remain optimistic about future growth opportunities. Excluding PRT, operating PFOs were up 8%.
Property & Casualty, or P&C, operating earnings were $58 million, down 13% versus the prior year quarter and also down 13% after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The primary driver was noncatastrophe homeowners losses, partially offset by an improvement in noncatastrophe auto results. 
In auto, we have been taking targeted rate increases over the last 12 months, and in the third quarter of 2016, the average premium increase on renewing customers was approximately 6%. These increases, along with other management actions, should increase an improving auto-combined ratio in the upcoming quarters adjusting for seasonality.
P&C operating PFOs were $882 million, up 1% year-over-year. P&C sales were down 5% due to pricing actions as well as a shift toward more profitable business segments and markets.
Turning to Asia. Operating earnings were $324 million, down 4% from the prior year quarter and 5% on a constant-currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The prior year quarter had favorable volume growth and benefited from $21 million of investment income from a loan sale as well as onetime tax benefits. In the current quarter, Asia results benefited from strong volume growth and lower expenses.
Asia operating PFOs were $2.2 billion, up 4% from the prior year quarter, but down 9% on a constant-currency basis due to the impact of the withdrawal in Japan of single premium Accident & Health Yen products in 2015 and the deconsolidation of the company's India operations. Asia sales were down 11% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, reflecting the impact of management actions to improve value in targeted markets.
In Japan, sales were down 10% year-over-year. We have seen a successful shift in sales to higher-return, foreign-currency denominated life products, which nearly doubled year-over-year, and away from low-return Yen life products, which were down 50% year-over-year. Continuing that trend, we expect over 90% of Japan sales in 2017 to come from higher-margin, foreign-denominated and protection products. 
Japan's third sector sales were down 31% versus the prior year as a result of exiting single premium A&H and the negative impact on packaged sales from a reduction in yen-denominated Whole Life product sales. Asia did have strong sales in emerging markets, which were up 24%.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $133 million, down 27% from the prior year quarter, but up 12% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were market impacts and volume growth.
Latin American operating PFOs were $891 million, up 4% and 12% on constant currency basis, driven by growth across the region.
Latin America sales were down 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, primarily due to lower group and Afore sales. 
EMEA operating earnings were $74 million, up 12% year-over-year and 61% on a constant currency basis after adjusting for notable items in both periods. The key drivers were favorable underwriting, lower expenses and several nonrecurring items as well as volume growth.
EMEA operating PFOs were $621 million, essentially unchanged from the prior year period, but up 3% on a constant currency basis driven by growth in employee benefits and Accident & Health. We continue to see a favorable shift towards higher-margin products. Total EMEA sales increased 10% on a constant currency basis.
MetLife Holdings, which primarily consists of our legacy retail and long-term care runoff businesses, reported operating earnings of $266 million, up 9% versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to higher variable investment income. Adjusting for notable items in both periods, operating earnings were essentially flat as favorable markets and lower expenses were offset by weaker underwriting.
MetLife Holdings operating PFOs were $1.6 billion, down 9% year-over-year, mostly due to the sale of the former MetLife Premier Client Group, which included the company's broker-dealer unit.
Brighthouse Financial, or BHF, operating earnings were $68 million, down 80% versus the prior year quarter. The key driver was the previously discussed $254 million onetime loss related to the resegmentation of MetLife's business to establish a BHF segment as well as the current quarter impact of $42 million. The ongoing impact to BHF from the loss of the aggregation benefit is expected to be approximately $40 million per quarter after tax, gradually declining over time.
Please note that the Brighthouse Financial segment results within MetLife's financial statements do not match Brighthouse Financial, Inc. and related company's financial statements shown in the Form-10 due to accounting timing differences.
Excluding the onetime loss of $254 million and all other notable items in both periods, operating earnings were down 22% due to unfavorable underwriting and higher taxes. This was partially offset by favorable markets and lower expenses.
BHF operating PFOs were $1.3 billion, down 13% year-over-year due to lower fees for annuities as a result of continued negative fund flows and lower premiums due to a decline in SPI sales.
BHF annuity sales were down 34% and life sales were down 46%, mostly resulting from the suspension of sales through one distributor and lower sales from the former MetLife Premier Client Group. Conversely, BHF continues to see strong growth from Shield Level Selector, which is up 54% year-over-year.
In Corporate & Other, we had an operating gain of $4 million compared to an operating loss of $983 million in the third quarter of 2015. In 3Q '15 Corporate & Other results included a noncash charge of $792 million related to the tax treatment of a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary of MLIC. In 3Q '16, the key driver for the operating gain is a lower effective tax rate, which included a true-up to our projected tax run rate of 22.1% and a benefit related to the settlement of certain income tax audits. Adjusting for these items, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 20.6%. Despite the operating gain in the quarter, we expect Corporate & Other's full year 2016 operating loss to be within the guidance range of $500 million to $700 million.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately $5.6 billion at September 30, which is up from $4.9 billion at June 30. This increase reflects subsidiary dividends, proceeds from the sale of the former MetLife Premier Client Group, payment of our quarterly common dividend and other holding company expenses.
Turning to our capital position. We report U.S. RBC ratios annually, so we do not have an update for the third quarter. For Japan, our core solvency margin ratio was 952% as of the second quarter of 2016, which is the latest public data.
For our U.S. companies, preliminary year-to-date third quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $3.4 billion. And net earnings were approximately $2.2 billion. Statutory operating earnings increased by $2.1 billion from the prior year, primarily due to the favorable impact of equity markets on certain variable annuity reserves and the impact of a prior year tax charge. We estimate that our U.S. statutory total adjusted capital was approximately $30 billion as of September 30, up 3% from December 31.
In conclusion, MetLife had a solid third quarter. Investment margins, driven by an improvement in variable investment income and lower expenses offset underwriting weakness in the quarter. In addition, our cash and capital position remain strong, and we remain confident that the steps we are taking to implement our strategy will drive improvement in free cash flow and create long-term sustainable value for our shareholders.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions."

And Asia, ex Japan and Korea, was up 10%. For Japan, all the sales shortfall really is around the A&H business, which was down 31%. And you should think about that in terms of 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 in terms of the shortfall: 1/3 being due to the withdrawal of single premium A&H products; 1/3 in terms of the package Yen Life sales as we flip the life business effectively, from Yen Whole Life to foreign currency, we lose some of the package sales; and 1/3 is also for reduction in terms of response direct-marketing business, where the economics weren't appropriate for us. On the Life side, whilst you see a number of about minus 3%, you should note the comments that John made earlier in terms of the really big shift we've made from Yen Life to foreign currency, which have higher value overall. And the other shortfall was Korea. The whole market is down in Korea in terms of the economic situation in that market, and we pulled back from some of the independent agents who do business there again because the commissions are too high and the value is too low. So that's sort of the overall story for Asia. I think you'll see that continue for the fourth quarter, although A&H sales in Japan will recover slightly as compared to the prior 3 quarters."
