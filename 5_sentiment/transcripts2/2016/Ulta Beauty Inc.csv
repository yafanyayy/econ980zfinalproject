Good afternoon and we [indiscernible] with everyone today. Our fourth quarter results capped an exceptional year. We made significant progress against our strategic imperatives while achieving outstanding sales and earnings growth. We continue to benefit from the powerful combination of strong demand in the beauty category and ULTA Beauty's highly differentiated product and service offerings. This unique position is driving business results that transcend prevailing trends across the retail landscape. 
To review the fourth quarter highlights. We grew the top line 21.1% and delivered 12.5% comp on top of 11.1% comps in the fourth quarter of 2014 which was our toughest comp of the year. Comp sales were driven primarily by traffic yet ticket increased nicely as well. The fourth quarter delivered the best 2-year comp since 2011, with a 23.6% 2-year stack. 
Product newness, our loyalty program, great in-store execution and investments in marketing and store payroll hours are fueling this industry-leading growth across both retail and online, with the fastest category growth in Cosmetics on both mass and prestige side of the portfolio. E-commerce top line growth and profitability were better than planned, driven by improved fulfillment capabilities and execution during the holiday season. And our salon business maintained its solid top line performance. 
For the full year of 2015, we achieved an 11.8% comp, our best annual comp since 2010. With double-digit comp in each of the 3 businesses, store, salon and e-commerce. Sales strength was driven primarily by traffic each quarter during the year and the full-year comp was comprised of a very healthy mix of 70% transaction growth and 30% ticket growth. 
Before updating you on the drivers of our fourth quarter results, I'd like to take a few of the team's accomplishments throughout fiscal 2015. We drove top line growth of 21.1% and earnings increased 25.2%, well above our expectations at the beginning of the year, reflecting robust market share gains and strong execution. We brought significant newness and exclusivity to the merchandise assortment and added 26 significant new brands during the year, demonstrating increased traction with our brand partners. 
We accelerated growth in our ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program membership, adding 3.2 million members, to reach a total of 18.2 million active members by year-end. We meaningfully increased brand awareness through our investments in television, radio, digital advertising and PR. We achieved strong and increased guest satisfactions scores as measured by MPS. We approved our supply chain operations in a few ways. We invested in better processes and inventories to increase in-stock levels, we drove efficiencies in our e-commerce fulfillment performance and smoothly launched the Greenwood distribution center. 
We also delivered against complex IT goals with the implementation of a host of new tools across the enterprise. A new warehouse management system, our new merchandise forecasting and replenishment system and a new product information tool, among others. 
So for the past several quarters, we've been describing to the investment committee our progress against our 6 go-to-market strategic imperatives. But we rarely discuss externally our foundational 7 strategic imperatives which is talent that drives a winning culture, guest centric, values based high performance. I believe that the results we just reported are a reflection of our attractive categories, balanced strategies, great execution and also the progress we've made in building our company's culture. 
I am so proud to see proof that our commitments are putting the guest and the associate at the center of our mindset is truly delivering marketplace results. We respect to the opinions of those who matter the most, the guests who give us their hard-earned money and the associates who really knows best how to optimize the guest experience and our operations. 
We're also leading through the lenses of functional expertise, enterprisewide thinking and collaboration, which is required more than ever in the fast-changing world of guest expectations. We now have evidence that these efforts are having an impact, not just in business results, but also in our culture. In fact, we saw significant year-over-year increases in the level of engagement of our associates as measured by a third-party through our Annual Cultural Survey. We are gratified to achieve global top quartile employee engagement scores among best-in-class companies. Highly engaged employees are tightly correlated with high-performing companies. 
So now let's turn back to our fourth quarter results. In an effort to allow more time for Q&A, instead of going through each of our strategic imperatives, I'll call out some of the highlights driving our performance. 
Our loyalty program is truly one of our most valuable assets. Asset membership grew 23%, showing continued acceleration. The growth in our loyalty program has been driven by two major things. The successful evolution of our marketing strategies to include awareness driving [indiscernible] television, radio and digital, is driving brand awareness in new guest to our stores. In addition, our store associates have done a terrific job of making new guests aware of the ULTAmate Rewards program and then converting them in. At the beginning of 2015, active member year-over-year growth was a bit less than 17%. And that growth rate increased each month throughout the year. We're seeing excellent trends in retention rates, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average ticket. Reactivation of loyalty members who hadn't shopped in the past 12 months remains robust as well, another indicator of the benefits of the changes in our marketing model. 
As we discussed at our Analyst Day in 2014, we're conducting ongoing marketing mix analysis using a customized modeling tool that correlate sales results to end market actions at the store and category level. This work clearly demonstrates that we've successfully and profitably delivered on the promise of getting to a healthier mix of marketing strategies and tactics. We're dedicating more resources to personalize offers through our loyalty program and newer tactics, including television, radio, expanded digital and PR. These modern campaigns are designed to position ULTA Beauty in a meaningful and differentiated way, with every piece of communication reinforcing our brand personality and elevating our beauty authority. 
This reallocation of resources increases the impact of marketing and we believe is one of several factors fueling the strength in our comp sales. While we are reducing our spend on less productive tactics, to be clear, we will always make sure that our guests see ULTA Beauty as providing a great value in periodic promotions, loyalty offers, newness, and great experiences in-store and online are all part of that value equation. 
These changes to our marketing strategy are also driving meaningful improvements in our brand awareness. Our latest survey shows that aided awareness rose to 84% versus 77% a year ago and unaided brand awareness improved to 39% from 36%. We believe this increase in awareness was driven in part by our national advertising campaigns. Stronger awareness of ULTA Beauty is helping us acquire new guests and reactivating guests who haven't shopped recently. 
Now in terms of merchandising. We continue to gain share in all categories, with particular strength in mass and prestige cosmetics. Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Redken, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit and the ULTA Beauty Collection were among the best performing brands for the quarter. 
We launched several new brands in our skin care area, including [indiscernible] and First Aid Beauty. The pipeline of new brands for 2016 includes exclusive brands like Jessica Alba's Honest Beauty and Fiona Style Cosmetics as well as the introduction of [indiscernible] Color Cosmetics and expansion of Clarins skincare and cosmetics. We continue to focus on products that are only available at ULTA Beauty. With the addition of many exclusive products within existing brands, including a new line of color cosmetics from Tarte called Double Duty Beauty. We're very excited to work with our brand partners to accelerate the rollout of Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques in hundreds of stores this year that will make us even more of a beauty destination. 
Our brand partners are finding increasing value in working with our CRM platform. The number of brands participating and targeting CRM campaigns rose meaningfully last year. We partnered with them to increase the number of targeted e-mail and direct mail campaigns and to develop exclusive offers for platinum members. All of these efforts drove incremental sales and margin dollars. 
Our brand partners also love working with our data and analytics team to drive trial of various products and categories. We continue to product samples to the hands of our guests in several smart ways and tripled the number of samples obtained from our brand partners during 2015. We are executing our sampling program through online beauty beds and targeted samples to surprise and delight our guests at point-of-sale in-store. We also have sample box programs in fragrance, professional hair care, prestige skincare and mass hair care that have proven to be extremely popular. And we doubled our sales of these multi-brand sample boxes during 2015. 
For example, our sample box called Secrets to Gorgeous Skin, offered during a recent skin event, was a big hit and we plan to offer many more of these sample boxes in 2016. 
Turning to services. The salon business comped nicely at 2% with continued strength in cut and color. Blowouts, hair treatments and makeup services were the highest growth categories. We're delivering trend right training to our salon professional and continue to integrate hair and makeup in our offering. Our hand-picked artistic team works to develop hair cut, color and finishing techniques that are reflective of this season, then creates and delivers high-impact training programs for all the salon teams at our stores. The trends curated by our team translate hair and makeup look straight from the runway in partnership with our brand. 
We recently launched spring and summer trends, including 9 different hair and makeup looks such as festival style hair and [indiscernible] makeup. The Benefit Brow Bar continues its excellent performance with double-digit comp sales and a continued expansion of brow services now in 712 stores. 
To report on store growth, we opened 14 stores in the fourth quarter to complete our 2015 program of 100 net new stores, ending with 874. New store productivity continues to be very strong, reflecting our growing brand awareness, dedicated resources to band opening activities, ongoing improvements to our portfolio of brands and high-quality real estate. We are increasingly a tenant of choice as landlords appreciate our growth profile, our ability to drive traffic to shopping centers and willingness of other retailers to follow in our footsteps to participate in the healthy traffic we draw. Landlords also appreciate the quality of our store design and the way our differentiated offering enhances the mix of retailers in their shopping centers. 
We also continue to enhance the store portfolio through improvements to our new store format, as well as investments to elevate existing stores. For the 2016 class of stores, we'll be implementing a series of enhancements to our store format that elevates both mass and prestige categories, give us a flexibility to respond to our growing assets to brands, improve the signage and presentation of our ULTA Beauty Collection and upgrade fixtures in key categories such as fragrance. 
New stores will also put the excitement of our services offering more on the forefront by placing the Benefit Brow Bar front and center. We'll also fully remodel about a dozen stores this year and touch hundreds of stores in the fleet with prestige boutique and remodel fixtures in key categories. 
To update you on our e-commerce business. Top line growth of 44.2% contributed 210 basis points to our total company comp. Significant improvements of fulfillment speed and customer satisfaction during holiday result in stronger-than-expected sales and much better profitability compared to year ago. We added Clinique to the ulta.com  assortment during the fourth quarter. So this way, e-commerce virtually at parity with brick-and-mortar in terms of our breadth of assortment. 
We continued to launch some new brands online to test before rolling out to the stores and offer some brands online only such as an expanded assortment of Bench products. 
Moving on to the supply chain. We are clearly seeing the benefit of cross-functional collaboration and joint planning among our supply chain, e-commerce and IT teams as well as store operations. Our focus on continuous improvement in simplifying processes led to efficiencies across our network of 4 distribution centers. During holiday, we achieved record network e-commerce throughput of 55,000 orders in 1 day, almost double our maximum volume last year. 
Shipping lead times improved dramatically with the percentage of orders shipped in 3 days or less at 92% versus just 14% last year, significantly increasing guest satisfaction. In-stock levels improved despite achieving sales well over our holiday sales forecast. 
The Greenwood DC successfully ramped up to serve 125 stores through the holiday season and delivered 25,000 orders per day during peak holiday. We remain very pleased with how the new DC is performing. We continue ramping up -- sorry, we'll continue to ramp up and serve another 100 plus stores in Greenwood by the end of this year. The new Dallas DC is on track to open this summer and we continue to rollout new systems like Swift, our merchandise forecasting replenishment tool and we're also investing in space and assortment planning tools this year. 
Now let me turn over to Scott to discuss the key drivers of our fourth quarter financial performance and our outlook for the first quarter and full year of 2016."

Top line growth was driven by a 12.5% comp and a very strong new store productivity. The marketing mix analysis that Mary mentioned showed that we were able to achieve this comp through a healthier mix of business drivers, including new brand launches and new products, more effective marketing, including TV, radio and digital, more efficient in store labor and continued benefits from new store maturation. Increased sales of gift cards helped drive topline strength post holiday. 
During the fourth quarter, our comp continued to be a bit more weighted through transaction growth, with traffic about 70% of the comps and average ticket representing about 30%. The retail only, the 10.4% comp, was composed of about 75% transaction growth and 25% ticket growth. Unit per transaction were flat but average basket rose 3% to just over $43. E-commerce growth was driven roughly 75% by traffic and 25% by ticket. 
Now let's talk about the key drivers of the 120 basis points of gross profit improvement, which was quite a bit better than our initial plan. The increase was partly driven by higher merchandise margins due to mix as we delivered strong sales in many of our better margin categories and brands, including the ULTA Beauty Collection. We also successfully continued our shift away from broad coupons and discounts and toward more targeted and relevant offers to our guests, supported by our loyalty program and CRM. In fact, we completely eliminated one of our usual discount offers at the end of the quarter, which helped us marginally. We leveraged store rent and occupancy expenses modestly on a double-digit comp and while our supply chain investments were still a drag on margins, they were less so than in the third quarter when we first opened the Greenwood Indiana DC. 
E-commerce fulfillment costs were also much more favorable this year. You probably recall that during the holiday season of 2014, we were challenged with fulfilling orders during the spike in demand between Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And the higher-than-expected e-commerce fulfillment cost for holiday 2014 weighted on gross profit a year ago, creating an easier margin comparison in the fourth quarter. The team did a much better job getting orders to customers in a timely fashion during the 2015 holiday season. 
In addition to the successful launch of the Greenwood DC, which provided additional capacity, we also increased the efficiency of our other distribution centers with process improvements throughout the year. The e-commerce marketing team did a nice job smoothing out consumer demand during the holiday season, with promotional events planned before and after the Black Friday period, culminating any much improved guest experience and significant profit improvement. The product mix for e-commerce continues to help as well as we ramp up sales of higher-margin haircare products, which were added to the site last February. 
Moving on to SG&A expense. Deleverage of 100 basis points was driven primarily by planned investments in marketing and store payroll hours to support holiday season sales. While marketing expense was flat for the year, it was back half weighted with the introduction of new vehicles to drive brand awareness including the national TV and radio campaigns. We also invested in store labor hours and training to improve the guest experience, especially during the key selling weeks during the holiday. Corporate overhead also deleveraged slightly due to higher incentive compensation in concert with our better-than-expected earnings performance. 
In terms of the balance sheet. Inventories were up 16.1% on a per-store basis, driven by investments in inventory to keep up with much better than expected topline growth, several new brand additions and the continued expansion of Clinique and Lancôme boutiques. The team did a great job selling through holiday inventory and making sure we start the new year with very clean inventory across all categories. 
While we generally strive to keep inventory per door growth in line with comp growth, we had compelling reasons to modestly exceed that benchmark and are very happy with the quality of our inventory and the resulting sales growth. With the large number of prestige brand boutiques and new brands being added in 2016, we expect inventory per door growth to remain somewhat elevated for the rest of the year although at a slightly lower level than Q4. 
Capital expenditures were $67 million for the quarter, driven by 14 new store openings, investments in systems, store fixtures and supply chain. CapEx for the full year was $299 million. We ended the year with $476 million of cash and short-term investments. The company repurchased approximately 262,000 shares at a cost of $46 million during the fourth quarter under our 10b5-1 plan. For the full year, we repurchased just over 1 million shares for $167 million. This reduction in our shares outstanding delivered about $0.03 of earnings per share growth for fiscal 2015. 
Today, we announced our 2016 guidance. In light of our accelerated share repurchase plan and continued momentum in our comparable sales growth, our anticipated earnings per share growth rate is higher than what the expected when we discussed our five-year plan back in the fall of 2014. We plan to add 100 net new stores with all stores in the program in our traditional prototypical store size. We expect to open 11 stores in Q1, 21 in Q2, 44 in Q3 and 24 in Q4. We plan to complete 12 major store remodels in to-be [ph] locations. We expect to grow e-commerce about 40%. Total company comps are expected to be in the 8% to 10% range. We anticipate earnings per share growth of approximately 18% to 20%. Operating margins are expected to be flattish, similar to what we achieved in 2015. Gross profit margin will be pressured by our new Dallas DC coming online this summer, continued investments in core merchandising systems and depreciation and write-offs related to our accelerated boutique rollout and store refresh program. 
CapEx has been planned higher than our previous view, which was in the $300 million range. We now anticipate CapEx of about $390 million. This includes slightly higher CapEx per new store, with the latest enhancements that Mary mentioned as well as a significant step up in boutiques in our new store program. We have also added about $80 million to the capital plan to refresh hundreds of our existing stores, which will include a major expansion of Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques as well as a significant presentation upgrade for fragrance and the ULTA Beauty Collection. We believe these prestige boutiques drive increased productivity in our stores and improve our positioning as a beauty destination. 
We are delighted that our brand partners want to grow even faster with us. 
In terms of share buybacks. Our Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase program for $425 million, which replaces the previous program. As you saw in the press release, we announced an ASR for $200 million, and expect to continue our open marketing repurchases similar to what we did in 2015. 
Turning now to guidance for the first quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.016 billion to $1.033 billion compared to $868 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 9% to 11% versus 11.4% last year. Online sales growth is expected to be in the 40% range. Preopening expense for the quarter is expected to be about $2.5 million, earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.30 versus $1.04 for Q1 of last year. We anticipate a tax rate of 37.8% and fully diluted share count of approximately 64 million. 
I'll now turn the call over to our conference call host for the Q&A session. Operator?"

Let me tell you, we're very excited about our comps but we guided 8% to 10% for the year, just to be clear, okay? So that's what we just communicated. But stepping back, we're pleased with that. I would say is that we're coming into this year, I guess what I would say is at the highest level, this is a business model that's working and we're executing it really well. And so we feel confident about the momentum and that continuing. It's a combination of a lot of factors coming together. So if you'll indulge me, I'll spend a minute on this. Which is first of all, it's great that we're in a great category, that is a growing category, right? That's important to start with. And then there's expandable consumption of beauty products. So these are everyday use, sometimes multiple times a day, driven by innovation, there's plenty of innovation. So we're in a growing business. We at ULTA Beauty, have, a really, I think, a very clear beam on who our target guest is and how to position ourselves against this guest. So this beauty enthusiast is a large and growing segment. Dave just mentioned, we are positioned All Things Beauty, All in One Place which is differentiated and relevant to that segment. We have exceptional brand partnership. So it's about knowing who we're trying to target but also offering her what she wants. So exciting products, new and exclusive, and really working with our brand partners to continue to have the great assortment across category price point services. I'd also add that smarter use of demand creation tools. So our loyalty program is really the heart. I talked about that. We've got long-term awareness and equity building tools moving in the right direction. The roll of e-com and digital, improved especially at the guest service side of that as well. So the demand creation tools are working well. And then, I say just exceptional collaboration in our -- with our teams and executing against complex things. So it's about making sure that the in-store experience is exceptional and that takes a lot, whether its payroll hours or investing in in-stocks. The distribution side of it, the focus on our Greenwood distribution center, the IT systems that support it and real estate is a core competency for us. And we are quite good at selecting store location, building them out, remodeling and store productivity is even stronger than we expected it to be. So I would say that really its a notion of kind of great market opportunity coming together and being executed well. And last thing I'd say is we are also less subject to some of other factors than some of retailers are. So whether it's weather, maybe weak mall traffic or fashion hits or misses, a few other things, we're less subject to that. So you pull that together, it helps us feel very confident that we can transcend what seems to be overall retail trends and deliver the kind of comps that we just guided over with you."

So we brought growth. And we're really excited to be continuing to partner with our brands to leverage growth.

We've got -- Mary mentioned a couple. But as we look forward into 2016, we're as excited. For the upcoming years, our results in 2015, we've got some great brands already that have already come out in the Spring Trend Magazine that you may have seen that came out. We featured over 2,000 new items across new brands and existing brands just in that magazine alone. Some key new brands that we're offering, Honest Beauty, just launched, Mary mentioned that, Jessica Alba's brand that is exclusive with us. Fiona Stiles, also exclusive with us. Fiona is a well-known makeup artist and we're proud to be working with her. Our existing brands continue to bring newness and excitement to us. Mary mentioned Tarte with their Double Duty Beauty and we're finding growth across all of our key brands, both big and small, continuing to expand and rollout brands that we launched last year, BECCA, Clarence, Clinique and Lancôme which I'll touch on in just a second. And in all of our big brands, our big partners across every part of our store, are great partners and finding new ways to grow and we're excited to be working with them brands like bare, Too Faced and Philosophy, Urban Decay and Benefit, Gee and Redken and Matrix. The list goes on. NYX and L'Oreal. So we're excited to be working on with our brand partners and we think we've got a rich pipeline to come. On boutiques specifically, we did mention that we're continuing to expand. I'd say boutique are an important part of our growth plan, should be evident by this. They're not only part of our growth plan. But we're really excited to be continuing to work. We have 4 main boutique brands there. There has been a large is essentially in every store. We're continuing to roll out Benefit. We have -- they were in roughly 700 stores at the end of last year. And then, over the last several years, we've been partnering and expanding our relationship with Clinique and Lancôme. Each of them ended up with roughly 200 stores at the end of the year. In total, across the ones that we're continuing to expand into existing doors and new doors, Benefit, Clinique and Lancôme, will be adding over 500 boutiques across those 3 brands in 2016. So we're excited about all the brand innovation and brand expansion that will be coming this year."

As we look towards 2016, again, we had headwinds in the first half of the year because of Greenwood being online. It wasn't there last year. It's still going to continue to scale up. And then in the second half of the year, we're going to step -- we'll see more benefits there as we lapped Greenwood but then we'll be taking online the new Dallas DC. There will be incremental headwinds there. So as we look at next year, it's going to be a fairly challenging, I would say, from a supply chain contribution perspective.

One is that we know that smaller markets like those markets, there's plenty of them out there and they offer another growth opportunity for us. Having said that, we could do 10,000 square-foot stores, and maybe even easier because it's an even better representation of the full band experience. So getting some more experiences in the small markets, those stores are doing well. We also -- the other thing is that as we look at in the future, we have not yet sized or put any kind of target out there. Other opportunities like say, urban stores or maybe the downtown main street parts of say, suburbs across the country, where there are smaller parcels of real estate. So we continue to refresh our real estate. And we're always doing that, we decided to go after smaller stores, we will have a lot of better handle on what that looks like in terms of how we think about season states, assortment of labor, models, supply chain models.

So it's not a problem. It's a great opportunity for us because it's -- and I talked about this in the business script. A team of people and their teams are thinking in a very integrated guest centric way And stores associate centric way. So we're thinking a lot about how do we think about just continuing to be ahead of the curve as it relates to the competitive environment and the shopping expectations in the future. So -- and there's no one answer to that I guess. So it's not like anything is broken. It's a matter of where do we point ourselves for the future.

But we're in the process of refreshing our real estate view and we're going to start to take a more specific look at the opportunities beyond that. So urban or downtown suburban type piece of the real estate. So I guess I just stay tuned on that. We'll continue to refresh that view. But I feel very optimistic about our ability to continue to drive market share growth. So whether it's in terms of square footage or at a comp basis, we have, if you step way back, we have only 5% share of the spending of the beauty today in the U.S. And beauty is highly fragmented. You can buy beauty products in thousands and thousands of places across the country. But we know that we kind of sweet spot with a group that's actually quite frankly really strong and growing in terms of the beauty enthusiasts admission. So we're differentiated. They like us. So we're never going to get complacent about building out too much. But we certainly don't want to underestimate the possibility here. So I feel good about this target that we've communicated. If that changes, certainly, we'll refresh that. But we'll continue to look at it. The good thing I'd say, reiterate, new store productivity, very strong. Cannibalization, very low. Too low to even be material and it's actually that's less which is great. And I'd like to mention that real estate opportunities, very strong out there for us and everything we just talked about as it relates to driving brand awareness of ULTA, only helps. Every store that we opened, we've got people who kind of know more about the brand than they did a couple of years ago so I think all of those factors are very positive for us."

I've mentioned merchandise margins a little earlier here. Again, the core, the mix of the business is very strong in retail. All of these new brands that are coming in, we've got generally very strong terms with our vendors. Pulling back on some of the broad discounting things and doing things more direct and focus with our customers are only going to help drive merchandise margins higher in the future.

Good afternoon and we have a lot to share with everyone today. Our fourth quarter results capped an exceptional year. We made significant progress against our strategic imperatives while achieving outstanding sales and earnings growth. We continue to benefit from the powerful combination of strong demand in the beauty category and ULTA Beauty's highly differentiated product and service offering. This unique positioning is driving business results that transcend prevailing trends across the retail landscape. 
To review the fourth quarter highlights. We grew the top line 21.1% and delivered 12.5% comp on top of 11.1% comps in the fourth quarter of 2014 which was our toughest comp of the year. Comp sales were driven primarily by traffic yet ticket increased nicely as well. The fourth quarter delivered the best 2-year comp since 2011, with a 23.6% 2-year stack. 
Product newness, our loyalty program, great in-store execution and investments in marketing and store payroll hours are fueling this industry-leading growth across both retail and online, with the fastest category growth in cosmetics on both mass and prestige side of the portfolio. E-commerce top line growth and profitability were better than planned, driven by improved fulfillment capabilities and execution during the holiday season. And our salon business maintained its solid top line performance. 
For the full year of 2015, we achieved an 11.8% comp, our best annual comp since 2010. With double-digit comps in each of the 3 businesses, store, salon and e-commerce. Sales strength was driven primarily by traffic each quarter during the year and the full year comp was comprised of a very healthy mix of 70% transaction growth and 30% ticket growth. 
Before updating you on the drivers of our fourth quarter results, I'd like to take a few of the team's accomplishments throughout fiscal 2015. We drove top line growth of 21.1% and earnings increased 25.2%, well above our expectations at the beginning of the year, reflecting robust market share gains and strong execution. We brought significant newness and exclusivity to the merchandise assortment and added 26 significant new brands during the year, demonstrating increased traction with our brand partners. 
We accelerated growth in our ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program membership, adding 3.2 million members, to reach a total of 18.2 million active members by year-end. We meaningfully increased brand awareness through our investments in television, radio, digital advertising and PR. We achieved strong and increased guest satisfactions scores as measured by MPS. We improved our supply chain operations in a few ways. We invested in better processes and inventories to increase in-stock levels, we drove efficiencies in our e-commerce fulfillment performance and smoothly launched the Greenwood distribution center. 
We also delivered against complex IT goals with the implementation of a host of new tools across the enterprise. A new warehouse management system, our new merchandise forecasting and replenishment system and a new product information tool, among others. 
So for the past several quarters, we've been describing to the investment community our progress against our 6 go-to-market strategic imperatives. But we rarely discuss externally our foundational 7 strategic imperative, which is talent that drives a winning culture, guest centric, the value-based high performance. I believe that the results we've just reported are the reflection of our attractive category, balanced strategies, great execution and also the progress we've made in building our company's culture. 
I am so proud to see proof that our commitments of putting the guest and the associate at the center of our mindset is truly delivering marketplace results. We're respecting the opinions of those who matter the most, the guests who give us their hard-earned money and the associates, who really knows best how to optimize the guest experience and our operations. 
We're also leading through the lenses of functional expertise, enterprise-wide thinking and collaboration, which is required more than ever in this fast-chasing world of guest expectations. We now have evidence that these efforts are having an impact, not just in business results, but also in our culture. In fact, we saw significant year-over-year increases in the level of engagement of our associates as measured by a third-party through our Annual Cultural Survey. We are gratified to achieve global top quartile employee engagement scores among best-in-class companies. Highly engaged employees are tightly correlated with high-performing companies. 
So now let's turn back to our fourth quarter results. In an effort to allow more time for Q&A, instead of going through each of our strategic imperatives, I'll call out some of the highlights driving our performance. 
Our loyalty program is truly one of our most valuable assets. Asset membership grew 23%, showing continued acceleration. The growth in our loyalty program has been driven by  2 major things. The successful evolution of our marketing strategies to include awareness driving tactics like television, radio and digital, is driving brand awareness in new guest to our stores. In addition, our store associates have done a terrific job of making new guests aware of the ULTAmate Rewards program and then converting them in. At the beginning of 2015, active member year-over-year growth was a bit less than 17%. And that growth rate increased each month throughout the year. We're seeing excellent trends in retention rates, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average ticket. Reactivation of loyalty members who hadn't shopped in the past 12 months remains robust as well, another indicator of the benefits of the changes in our marketing model. 
As we discussed at our Analyst Day in 2014, we're conducting ongoing marketing mix analysis using a customized modeling tool that correlate sales results to end market actions at the store and category level. This work clearly demonstrates that we've successfully and profitably delivered on the promise of getting to a healthier mix of marketing strategies and tactics. We're dedicating more resources to personalize offers through our loyalty program and newer tactics, including television, radio, expanded digital and PR. These marketing campaigns are designed to position ULTA Beauty in a meaningful and differentiated way, with every piece of communication reinforcing our brand personality and elevating our beauty authority. 
This reallocation of resources increases the impact of marketing and we believe is one of several factors fueling the strength in our comp sales. While we are reducing our spend on less productive tactics, to be clear, we will always make sure that our guests see ULTA Beauty as providing a great value in periodic promotions, loyalty offers, newness, and great experiences in-store and online are all part of that value equation. 
These changes to our marketing strategy are also driving meaningful improvements in our brand awareness. Our latest survey show that aided awareness rose to 84% versus 77% a year ago and unaided brand awareness improved to 39% from 36%. We believe this increase in awareness was driven in part by our national advertising campaigns. Stronger awareness of ULTA Beauty is helping us acquire new guests and reactivating guests who hadn't shopped recently. 
Now in terms of merchandising. We continue to gain share in all categories, with particular strength in mass and prestige cosmetics. Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Redken, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit and the ULTA Beauty Collection were among the best performing brands for the quarter. 
We launched several new brands in our skin care area, including Julep and First Aid Beauty. The pipeline of new brands for 2016 includes exclusive brands like Jessica Alba's Honest Beauty and Fiona Stiles Cosmetics as well as the introduction of Buxom Color Cosmetics and expansion of Clarins skincare and cosmetics. We continue to focus on products that are only available at ULTA Beauty. With the addition of many exclusive products within existing brands, including a new line of color cosmetics from Tarte called Double Duty Beauty. We're very excited to work with our brand partners to accelerate the rollout of Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques in hundreds of stores this year that will make us even more of a beauty destination. 
Our brand partners are finding increasing value in working with our CRM platform. The number of brands participating and targeting CRM campaigns rose meaningfully last year. We partnered with them to increase the number of targeted e-mail and direct mail campaigns and to develop exclusive offers for platinum members. All of these efforts drove incremental sales and margin dollars. 
Our brand partners also love working with our data analytics team to drive trial of various products and categories. We continue to put product samples in the hands of our guests in several smart ways and we tripled deliver of samples obtained from our brand partners during 2015. We're executing our sampling program through online beauty batch and targeted samples to surprise and delight our guests at point-of-sale in store. We also have sample box programs in fragrance, professional hair care, prestige skincare and mass hair care that have proven to be extremely popular. And we doubled our sales of these multi-brand sample boxes during 2015. 
For example, our sample box called Secrets to Gorgeous Skin, offered during a recent skin event, was a big hit and we plan to offer many more of these sample boxes in 2016. 
Turning to services. The salon business comped 9.2% with continued strength in cut and color. Blowouts, hair treatments and makeup services were the highest growth categories. We're delivering trend-right training to our salon professional and continue to integrate hair and makeup in our offering. Our hand-picked artistic team works to develop haircut, color and finishing techniques that are reflective of the season, that then creates and delivers high-impact training programs for all the salon teams in our stores. The trends created by our team translate hair and makeup look straight from the runway in partnership with our brand. 
We recently launched spring and summer trends, including 9 different hair and makeup looks such as festival style hair and pearlescent glow makeup. The Benefit Brow Bar continues its excellent performance with double-digit comp sales and a continued expansion of brow services now in 712 stores. 
To report on store growth, we opened 14 stores in the fourth quarter to complete our 2015 program of 100 net new stores, ending with 874. New store productivity continues to be very strong, reflecting our growing brand awareness, dedicated resources to grand opening activities, ongoing improvements to our portfolio of brands and high-quality real estate. We are increasingly a tenant of choice as landlords appreciate our growth profile, our ability to drive traffic to shopping centers and willingness of other retailers to follow in our footsteps to participate in the healthy traffic we draw. Landlords also appreciate the quality of our store design and the way our differentiated offering enhances the mix of retailers in their shopping centers. 
We also continue to enhance the store portfolio through improvements to our new store format, as well as investments to elevate existing stores. For the 2016 class of stores, we'll be implementing a series of enhancements to our store format that elevates both mass and prestige categories, give us a flexibility to respond to our growing access to brands, improve the signage and presentation of our ULTA Beauty Collection and upgrade fixtures in key categories such as fragrance. 
New stores will also put the excitement of our services offering more in the forefront by placing the Benefit Brow Bar front and center. We'll also fully remodel about a dozen stores this year and touch hundreds of stores in the fleet with prestige boutique and remodel fixtures in key categories. 
To update you on our e-commerce business. Top line growth of 44.2% contributed 210 basis points to our total company comp. Significant improvements and fulfillment speed and customer satisfaction during holiday resulted in stronger-than-expected sales and much better profitability compared to year ago. We added Clinique to the ulta.com assortment during the fourth quarter. So at this point, e-commerce is virtually at parity with brick-and-mortar in terms of our breadth of assortment. 
We continued to launch some new brands online to test before rolling out to the stores and offer some brands online only, such as an expanded assortment of men's products. 
Moving on to supply chain. We are clearly seeing the benefit of cross-functional collaboration and joint planning among our supply chain, e-commerce and IT teams as well as store operations. Our focus on continuous improvement in simplifying processes led to efficiencies across our network of 4 distribution centers. During holiday, we achieved record network e-commerce throughput of 55,000 orders in 1 day, almost double our maximum volume last year. 
Shipping lead times improved dramatically with the percentage of orders shipped in 3 days or less at 92% versus just 14% last year, significantly increasing guest satisfaction. In-stock levels improved despite achieving sales well over our holiday sales forecast. 
The Greenwood DC successfully ramped up to serve 125 stores through the holiday season and delivered 25,000 orders per day during peak holiday. We remain very pleased with how the new DC is performing. We continue ramping up -- continue to ramp up and serve another 100-plus stores in Greenwood by the end of this year. The new Dallas DC is on track to open this summer and we continue to rollout new systems like Swift, our merchandise forecasting and replenishment tool and we're also investing in space and assortment planning tools this year. 
Now, let me turn over to Scott to discuss the key drivers of our fourth quarter financial performance and our outlook for the first quarter and full year of 2016."
35929,326488350,950613,"ULTA Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 10, 2016",2016-03-10,"Earnings Calls","Ulta Beauty, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Top line growth was driven by a 12.5% comp and a very strong new store productivity.

Top line growth was driven by a 12.5% comp and a very strong new store productivity. The marketing mix analysis that Mary mentioned showed that we were able to achieve this comp through a healthier mix of business drivers, including new brand launches and new products, more effective marketing, including TV, radio and digital, more efficient in-store labor and continued benefits from new store maturation. Increased sales of gift cards helped drive top line strength post holiday. 
During the fourth quarter, our comp continue to be a bit more weighted through transaction growth, with traffic about 70% of the comps and average ticket representing about 30%. The retail only, the 10.4% comp, was composed of about 75% transaction growth and 25% ticket growth. Unit per transaction were flat but average basket rose 3% to just over $43. E-commerce growth was driven roughly 75% by traffic and 25% by ticket. 
Now let's talk about the key drivers of the 120 basis points of gross profit improvement, which was quite a bit better than our initial plan. The increase was partly driven by higher merchandise margins due to mix as we delivered strong sales in many of our better margin categories and brands, including the ULTA Beauty Collection. We also successfully continued our shift away from broad coupons and discounts and toward more targeted and relevant offers to our guests, supported by our loyalty program and CRM. In fact, we completely eliminated one of our usual discount offers at the end of the quarter, which helped our marginally. We leveraged store rent and occupancy expenses modestly on a double-digit comp and while our supply chain investments were still a drag on margins, they were less so than in the third quarter when we first opened the Greenwood, Indiana DC. 
E-commerce fulfillment costs were also much more favorable this year. You probably recall that during the holiday season of 2014, we were challenged with fulfilling orders during the spike in demand between Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And the higher-than-expected e-commerce fulfillment cost for holiday 2014 weighted on gross profit a year ago, creating an easier margin comparison in the fourth quarter. The team did a much better job getting orders to customers in a timely fashion during the 2015 holiday season. 
In addition to the successful launch of the Greenwood DC, which provided additional capacity, we also increased the efficiency of our other distribution centers with process improvements throughout the year. The e-commerce marketing team did a nice job smoothing out consumer demand during the holiday season, with promotional events planned before and after the Black Friday period, culminating in a much improved guest experience and significant profit improvement. The product mix for e-commerce continues to help as well as we ramp up sales of high-margin haircare products, which were added to the site last February. 
Moving on to SG&A expense. Deleverage of 100 basis points was driven primarily by planned investments in marketing and store payroll hours to support holiday season sales. While marketing expense was flat for the year, it was back half weighted with the introduction of new vehicles to drive brand awareness including the national TV and radio campaigns. We also invested in store labor hours and training to improve the guest experience, especially during the key selling weeks during the holiday. Corporate overhead also deleveraged slightly due to higher incentive compensation in concert with our better-than-expected earnings performance. 
In terms of the balance sheet. Inventories were up 16.1% on a per-store basis, driven by investments in inventory to keep up with much better-than-expected topline growth, several new brand additions and the continued expansion of Clinique and Lancôme boutiques. The team did a great job selling through holiday inventory and making sure we start the new year with very clean inventory across all categories. 
While we generally strive to keep inventory per door growth in line with comp growth, we had compelling business reasons to modestly exceed that benchmark and are very happy with the quality of our inventory and the resulting sales growth. With the large number of prestige brand boutiques and new brands being added in 2016, we expect inventory per door growth to remain somewhat elevated for the rest of the year although at a slightly lower level than Q4. 
Capital expenditures were $67 million for the quarter, driven by 14 new store openings, investments in systems, store fixtures and supply chain. CapEx for the full year was $299 million. We ended the year with $476 million of cash and short-term investments. The company repurchased approximately 262,000 shares at a cost of $46 million during the fourth quarter under our 10b5-1 plan. For the full year, we repurchased just over 1 million shares for $167 million. This reduction in our shares outstanding delivered about $0.03 of earnings per share growth for fiscal 2015. 
Today, we announced our 2016 guidance. In light of our accelerated share repurchase plan and continued momentum in our comparable sales growth, our anticipated earnings per share growth rate is higher than what we expected when we discussed our 5-year plan back in the fall of 2014. We plan to add 100 net new stores with all stores in the program in our traditional prototypical store size. We expect to open 11 stores in Q1, 21 in Q2, 44 in Q3 and 24 in Q4. We plan to complete 12 major store remodels and 2 relocations. We expect to grow e-commerce about 40%. Total company comps are expected to be in the 8% to 10% range. We anticipate earnings per share growth of approximately 18% to 20%. Operating margins are expected to be flattish, similar to what we achieved in 2015. Gross profit margin will be pressured by our new Dallas DC coming online this summer, continued investments in core merchandising systems and depreciation and write-offs related to our accelerated boutique rollout and store refresh program. 
CapEx has been planned higher than our previous view, which was in the $300 million range. We now anticipate CapEx of about $390 million. This includes slightly higher CapEx per new store, with the latest enhancements that Mary mentioned, as well as a significant step up in boutiques in our new store program. We have also added about $80 million to the capital plan to refresh hundreds of our existing stores, which will include a major expansion of Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques as well as a significant presentation upgrade for fragrance and the ULTA Beauty Collection. We believe these prestige boutiques drive increased productivity in our stores and improve our positioning as a beauty destination. 
We are delighted that our brand partners want to grow even faster with us. 
In terms of share buybacks. Our Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase program for $425 million, which replaces the previous program. As you saw in the press release, we announced an ASR for $200 million, and expect to continue our open market repurchases similar to what we did in 2015. 
Turning now to guidance for the first quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.016 billion to $1.033 billion compared to $868 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 9% to 11% versus 11.4% last year. Online sales growth is expected to be in the 40% range. Preopening expense for the quarter is expected to be about $2.5 million, earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.30 versus $1.04 for Q1 of last year. We anticipate a tax rate of 37.8% and fully diluted share count of approximately 64 million.

The -- but stepping back, we're pleased with that. I would say that as we're coming into this year, I guess what I would say is at the highest level, this is a business model that's working and we're executing it really well. And so we feel confident about the momentum and that continuing. It's a combination of a lot of factors coming together. So if you'll indulge me, let me just a minute on this. Which is first of all, it's great that we're in a great category, that is a growing category, right? And so that's important to start with. And there's expandable consumption of beauty products. So these are everyday use, sometimes multiple times a day, driven by innovation, there's plenty of innovation. So we're in a growing business. We at ULTA Beauty, have, a really, I think, a very clear beat on who our target guest is and how to position ourselves against this guest. So this beauty enthusiast is a large and growing segment. Dave just mentioned, that we are positioned as All Things Beauty, All in One Place which is differentiated and relevant to that segment. We have exceptional brand partnership. So it's about knowing who we're trying to target but also offering her what she wants. So exciting products, new and exclusive, and really working with our brand partners to continue to have the great assortment across category price point services. I'd also add that smarter use of demand creation tools. So our loyalty program is really the heart. I talked about that. We've got long-term awareness and equity building tools moving in the right direction. The role of e-com and digital improved especially at the guest service side of that as well. So the demand creation tools are working well. And then, I'd say just exceptional collaboration in our -- with our teams and executing against complex things. So it's about making sure that the in-store experience is exceptional and that takes a lot, whether its payroll hours or investing in in-stocks. The distribution side of it, the focus on our Greenwood distribution center, the IT systems that support it, and real estate is a core competency for us. And we're quite good at selecting store locations, building them out, remodeling and store productivity is even stronger than we expected it to be. So I would say that really is a notion of kind of great market opportunity coming together and being executed well. And last thing I'd say is that we also are less subject to some of other factors that some other retailers are. So whether it's weather, maybe weak mall traffic or fashion hits or misses, a few other things, we're less subject to that. So you pull that together, it helps us feel very confident that we can transcend what seems to be overall retail trends and deliver the kind of comps that we just guided over with you."

That has been something that we had been focused on for a long time. We've added well over 100 new brands over the last 5 years. And as you said, and as Mary mentioned, we had 26 new brands in 2015 alone, and that included brands [ph] Dior late in the year, Skyn Iceland, Soap & Glory, First Aid Beauty, Revolution Make Up, Pacifica, Tony Moly, several others that were key across all categories and all different mass and prestige and hair. And so we brought growth. And we're really excited to be continuing to partner with our brands to leverage growth. And we feel like we've got a great relationship that has been in -- that has been building and strengthening for many years and we're excited about our ability to do that. We've got -- Mary mentioned a couple. But as we look forward into 2016, we're as excited. For the upcoming years, we were -- in our results in 2015, we've got some great brands already that have already come out in the Spring Trend Magazine that you may have seen that came out. We featured over 2,000 new items across new brands and existing brands just in that magazine alone. Some key new brands that we're offering, Honest Beauty, just launched, Mary mentioned that, Jessica Alba's brand that is exclusive with us. Fiona Stiles, also exclusive with us. Fiona is a well-known makeup artist and we're proud to be working with her. Our existing brands continue to bring newness and excitement to us. Mary mentioned Tarte with their Double Duty Beauty and we're finding growth across all of our key brands, both big and small, continuing to expand and rollout brands like that we launched last year, BECCA and Clarins, Clinique and Lancôme, which I'll touch on in just a second. And then all of our big brands, our big partners across every part of our store, are great partners and finding new ways to grow and we're excited to be working with them and brands like Bare, and Too Faced, and Philosophy, and Urban Decay and Benefit, and Chi and Redken and Matrix. The list goes on. NYX and L'Oreal. So we're excited to be working on with our brand partners and we think we've got a rich pipeline to come. On boutiques specifically, we did mention that we're continuing to expand. I'd say boutiques are an important part of our growth plan, should be evident by this. They're not the only part of our growth plan. We're -- but we're really excited to be continuing to work. We have 4 main boutique brands. Bare has been a largest boutique brands and they're essentially in every store. We're continuing to roll out Benefit. We have -- they were in roughly 700 stores at the end of last year. And then, over the last several years, we've been partnering and expanding our relationship with Clinique and Lancôme. Each of them ended up with roughly 200 stores at the end of the year. In total, across the ones that we're continuing to expand into existing doors and new doors, Benefit, Clinique and Lancôme, will be adding over 500 boutiques across those 3 brands in 2016. So we're excited about all the brand innovation and brand expansion that will be coming this year."

I would say that you can think about digital as the center of pretty much everything now, right? So quite often, maybe some of these discovering and researching online before they come into the store whether they discover us online or in-store first, I'm not sure if I can break that out, but I'd say probably mostly in-store. Online tends to be very incremental to us as well. Our guests love the experience of coming to the store. The whole beauty enthusiasts vibe is about trying things and increasingly experiencing services. And then online, she's buying things that are kind of incremental to perhaps what she even had time to discover. We push out lots of e-mails, not lots, but I mean, appropriate number of e-mails to our guests around new and exclusive and exciting products and that tends to stimulate some online shopping as well.

So it was less of a drag on gross profit margin in the fourth quarter because the building was operating very effectively. As we look towards 2016, again, we will have headwinds in the first half of the year because of Greenwood being online. It wasn't there last year. It's still going to continue to scale up. And then in the second half of the year, we're going to step -- we'll see more benefits there as we lapped Greenwood but they will be taking online the new Dallas DC. So you're going to have incremental headwinds there. So as we look at next year, it's going to be a fairly challenging, I would say, from a supply chain and contribution perspective.

Any way, on the small stores, I guess I would just say stepping back, we have, as you know, 2 small stores that we open up with in small markets, Vernal and Utah markets in North Carolina. Both are performing fine. Most important thing is we're learning a lot about operating a smaller footprint. And as we look into the future, a couple of things I would say. One is that we know that smaller markets like those markets, there's plenty of them out there and they offer another growth opportunity for us. Having said that, we could do 10,000 square-foot stores, maybe even easier because it's better -- even better representation of the full brand experience. So we kind of get into to more experience in small markets, those stores are doing well. We also -- the other thing is that as we look out in the future, we have not yet sized or put any kind of target out there. Other opportunities like say, urban stores or maybe the downtown main street parts of say, suburbs across the country, where there are smaller parcels of real estate. So as we continue to refresh our real estate view. And we're always doing that, we decided to go after smaller stores, we'll have a lot better handle on what that looks like in terms of how we think about season states, assortment of labor models and supply chain models. So all good learnings and I think that's -- so we think consistently on like to kind of walk before you run. So we're walking and learning and it's going to provide benefits for us in the future."

And I -- honestly, I think that I'm very, very pleased at how many things are going well. We're not complacent about that. We push ourselves very hard. We're really focused and always improving."

I mean, we're very happy with where we are today. I mean, the business is performing very strong. We're probably a little bit ahead of where we would thought we would be at this point in time. The boutiques were in our five-year guidance. I mean, they were inherently built in there. But we are pulling them forward so there is an acceleration here. And we expect, again, those investments, we demonstrated that they pay great dividends for investors over the long term. So the CapEx specifically for next year, you can expect it to say elevated this boutique, the strategy we have in place with our brand partners is a multi-year rollout. So we're going to touch as many of our comp stores and again, that's what that $80 million is basically referring to as our existing store base. So try to touch as many of those over the next couple of years as we can."

We've also said that beyond that, the small market opportunity probably represents another couple of hundred. We're in the process of refreshing our real estate view and we're going to start to take a more specific look at the opportunities beyond that. So urban or downtown suburban type pieces of real estate. So I guess I'd just say, stay tuned on that. We'll continue to refresh that view. But I feel very optimistic about our ability to continue to drive market share growth. So whether it's in terms of square footage or at a comp basis, we have, if you step way back, we have only 5% share of the spending of the beauty enthusiast today, in the U.S. And its -- beauty is highly fragmented. You can buy beauty products in thousands and thousands of places across the country. But we know that we've had a sweet spot with the group that's actually, frankly, really, strong and growing in terms of the beauty enthusiasts segment. So we're differentiated. They like us. So we're never going to get complacent about building out too much. But we certainly don't want to underestimate the possibility here. So I feel good about the target that we've communicated. If that changes, certainly, we'll refresh that. But we'll continue to look at it. The other thing I'd say is that -- reiterate, new store productivity, very strong. Cannibalization, very low. Too low to even be material and it's actually that's less which is great. And I'd like to mention that real estate opportunities, very strong out there for us and everything we just talked about as it relates to driving brand awareness of ULTA, only helps. Every store that we opened now, we've got people who kind of know more about the brand than they did a couple of years ago, so I think all those factors are very positive for us."

But directionally, we feel very confident that these are going to deliver the kind of benefits that we expected upfront and that we described back in our investor day presentations. I've mentioned merchandise margins a little earlier here. Again, the core, the mix of the business is very strong in retail. All of these new brands that are coming in, where we've got generally very strong terms with our vendors. Pulling back on some of the broad discounting things and doing things more direct and focus with our customers are only going to help drive merchandise margins higher in the future.

Good afternoon and we have a lot to share with everyone today. Our fourth quarter results capped an exceptional year. We made significant progress against our strategic imperatives while achieving outstanding sales and earnings growth. We continue to benefit from the powerful combination of strong demand in the beauty category and ULTA Beauty's highly differentiated product and service offering. This unique positioning is driving business results that transcend prevailing trends across the retail landscape. 
To review the fourth quarter highlights, we grew the top line 21.1% and delivered 12.5% comps on top of 11.1% comps in the fourth quarter of 2014, which was our toughest comp of the year. Comp sales were driven primarily by traffic, yet ticket increased nicely as well. The fourth quarter delivered the best 2-year comp since 2011, with a 23.6% 2-year stack. 
Product newness, our loyalty program, great in-store execution and investments in marketing and store payroll hours are fueling this industry-leading growth across both retail and online, with the fastest category growth in cosmetics on both mass and prestige sides of the portfolio. E-commerce top line growth and profitability were better than planned, driven by improved fulfillment capabilities and execution during the holiday season. And our salon business maintained its solid top line performance. 
For the full year of 2015, we achieved an 11.8% comp, our best annual comp since 2010, with double-digit comps in each of the 3 businesses: store, salon and e-commerce. Sales strength was driven primarily by traffic each quarter during the year and the full year comp was comprised of a very healthy mix of 70% transaction growth and 30% ticket growth. 
Before updating you on the drivers of our fourth quarter results, I'd like to take a few of the team's accomplishments throughout fiscal 2015. We drove top line growth of 21.1% and earnings increased 25.2%, well above our expectations at the beginning of the year, reflecting robust market share gains and strong execution. We brought significant newness and exclusivity to the merchandise assortment and added 26 significant new brands during the year, demonstrating increased traction with our brand partners. 
We accelerated growth in our ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program membership, adding 3.2 million members, to reach a total of 18.2 million active members by year-end. We meaningfully increased brand awareness through our investments in television, radio, digital advertising and PR. We achieved strong and increased guest satisfaction scores as measured by MPS. We improved our supply chain operations in a few ways. We invested in better processes and inventories to increase in-stock levels, we drove efficiencies in our e-commerce fulfillment performance and smoothly launched the Greenwood distribution center. 
We also delivered against complex IT goals with the implementation of a host of new tools across the enterprise: a new warehouse management system, our new merchandise forecasting and replenishment system and a new product information tool, among others. 
So for the past several quarters we've been describing to the investment community our progress against our 6 go-to-market strategic imperatives. But we rarely discuss externally our foundational seventh strategic imperative, which is talent that drives a winning culture: guest-centric, values based, high performance. I believe that the results we've just reported are the reflection of our attractive category, balanced strategies, great execution and also the progress we've made in building our company's culture. 
I am so proud to see proof that our commitments of putting the guest and the associate at the center of our mindset is truly delivering marketplace results. We're respecting the opinions of those who matter the most, the guests who give us their hard-earned money and the associates, who really knows best how to optimize the guest experience and our operations. 
We're also leading through the lenses of functional expertise, enterprise-wide thinking and collaboration, which is required more than ever in this fast-chasing world of guest expectations. We now have evidence that these efforts are having an impact, not just in business results, but also in our culture. In fact, we saw significant year-over-year increases in the level of engagement of our associates as measured by a third party through our Annual Cultural Survey. We are gratified to achieve global top quartile employee engagement scores among best-in-class companies. Highly engaged employees are tightly correlated with high-performing companies. 
So now let's turn back to our fourth quarter results. In an effort to allow more time for Q&A, instead of going through each of our strategic imperatives, I'll call out some of the highlights driving our performance. 
Our loyalty program is truly one of our most valuable assets. Active membership grew 23%, showing continued acceleration. The growth in our loyalty program has been driven by 2 major things. The successful evolution of our marketing strategies to include awareness-driving tactics like television, radio and digital is driving brand awareness and new guests to our stores. In addition, our store associates have done a terrific job of making new guests aware of the ULTAmate Rewards program and then converting them in. At the beginning of 2015, active member year-over-year growth was a bit less than 17%. And that growth rate increased each month throughout the year. We're seeing excellent trends in retention rates, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average ticket. Reactivation of loyalty members who hadn't shopped in the past 12 months remains robust as well, another indicator of the benefits of the changes in our marketing model. 
As we discussed at our Analyst Day in 2014, we're conducting ongoing marketing mix analyses using a customized modeling tool that correlates sales results to end market actions at the store and category level. This work clearly demonstrates that we've successfully and profitably delivered on the promise of getting to a healthier mix of marketing strategies and tactics. We're dedicating more resources to personalize offers through our loyalty program and newer tactics, including television, radio, expanded digital and PR. These marketing campaigns are designed to position ULTA Beauty in a meaningful and differentiated way, with every piece of communication reinforcing our brand personality and elevating our beauty authority. 
This reallocation of resources increases the impact of marketing and we believe is one of several factors fueling the strength in our comp sales. While we are reducing our spend on less productive tactics, to be clear, we will always make sure that our guests see ULTA Beauty as providing a great value, and periodic promotions, loyalty offers, newness, and great experiences in-store and online are all part of that value equation. 
These changes to our marketing strategy are also driving meaningful improvements in our brand awareness. Our latest survey showed that aided awareness rose to 84% versus 77% a year ago and unaided brand awareness improved to 39% from 36%. We believe this increase in awareness was driven in part by our national advertising campaigns. Stronger awareness of ULTA Beauty is helping us acquire new guests and reactivating guests who hadn't shopped recently. 
Now in terms of merchandising, we continue to gain share in all categories, with particular strength in mass and prestige cosmetics. Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Redken, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit and the ULTA Beauty Collection were among the best performing brands for the quarter. 
We launched several new brands in our skin care area, including Julep and First Aid Beauty. The pipeline of new brands for 2016 includes exclusive brands like Jessica Alba's Honest Beauty and Fiona Stiles Cosmetics as well as the introduction of Buxom Color Cosmetics and the expansion of Clarins skincare and cosmetics. We continue to focus on products that are only available at ULTA Beauty, with the addition of many exclusive products within existing brands, including a new line of color cosmetics from Tarte called Double Duty Beauty. We're very excited to work with our brand partners to accelerate the rollout of Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques in hundreds of stores this year that will make us even more of a beauty destination. 
Our brand partners are finding increasing value in working with our CRM platform. The number of brands participating in targeted CRM campaigns rose meaningfully last year. We partnered with them to increase the number of targeted e-mail and direct mail campaigns and to develop exclusive offers for platinum members. All of these efforts drove incremental sales and margin dollars. 
Our brand partners also love working with our data analytics team to drive trial of various products and categories. We continue to put product samples in the hands of our guests in several smart ways and we tripled the number of samples obtained from our brand partners during 2015. We're executing our sampling programs through online Beauty Bags and targeted samples to surprise and delight our guests at point-of-sale in store. We also have sample box programs in fragrance, professional hair care, prestige skincare and mass hair care that have proven to be extremely popular. And we doubled our sales of these multi-brand sample boxes during 2015. 
For example, our sample box called Secrets to Gorgeous Skin, offered during a recent skin event, was a big hit and we plan to offer many more of these sample boxes in 2016. 
Turning to services. The salon business comped 9.2% with continued strength in cut and color. Blowouts, hair treatments and makeup services were the highest growth categories. We're delivering trend-right training to our salon professionals and continue to integrate hair and makeup in our offerings. Our hand-picked artistic team works to develop haircut, color and finishing techniques that are reflective of the season that then creates and delivers high-impact training programs for all the salon teams in our stores. The trends created by our team translate hair and makeup looks straight from the runway in partnership with our brand. 
We recently launched spring and summer trends, including 9 different hair and makeup looks such as festival style hair and pearlescent glow makeup. The Benefit Brow Bar continues its excellent performance with double-digit comp sales and a continued expansion of brow services now in 712 stores. 
To report on store growth, we opened 14 stores in the fourth quarter to complete our 2015 program of 100 net new stores, ending with 874. New store productivity continues to be very strong, reflecting our growing brand awareness, dedicated resources to grand opening activities, ongoing improvements to our portfolio of brands and high-quality real estate. We are increasingly a tenant of choice as landlords appreciate our growth profile, our ability to drive traffic to shopping centers and willingness of other retailers to follow in our footsteps to participate in the healthy traffic we draw. Landlords also appreciate the quality of our store design and the way our differentiated offering enhances the mix of retailers in their shopping centers. 
We also continue to enhance the store portfolio through improvements to our new store format, as well as investments to elevate existing stores. For the 2016 class of stores, we'll be implementing a series of enhancements to our store format that elevates both mass and prestige categories, give us a flexibility to respond to our growing access to brands, improve the signage and presentation of our ULTA Beauty Collection and upgrade fixtures in key categories such as fragrance. 
New stores will also put the excitement of our services offering more in the forefront by placing the Benefit Brow Bar front and center. We'll also fully remodel about a dozen stores this year and touch hundreds of stores in the fleet with prestige boutiques and remodeled fixtures in key categories. 
To update you on our e-commerce business. Top line growth of 44.2% contributed 210 basis points to our total company comp. Significant improvements in fulfillment speed and customer satisfaction during holiday resulted in stronger-than-expected sales and much better profitability compared to a year ago. We added Clinique to the ulta.com assortment during the fourth quarter. So at this point, e-commerce is virtually at parity with brick-and-mortar in terms of our breadth of assortment. 
We continued to launch some new brands online to test before rolling out to the stores and offer some brands online only, such as an expanded assortment of men's products. 
Moving on to supply chain. We are clearly seeing the benefits of cross-functional collaboration and joint planning among our supply chain, e-commerce and IT teams as well as store operations. Our focus on continuous improvement in simplifying processes led to efficiencies across our network of 4 distribution centers. During holiday we achieved record network e-commerce throughput of 55,000 orders in 1 day, almost double our maximum volume last year. 
Shipping lead times improved dramatically with the percentage of orders shipped in 3 days or less at 92% versus just 14% last year, significantly increasing guest satisfaction. In-stock levels improved despite achieving sales well over our holiday sales forecast. 
The Greenwood DC successfully ramped up to serve 125 stores through the holiday season and delivered 25,000 orders per day during peak holiday. We remain very pleased with how the new DC is performing. We continue ramping up -- continue to ramp up and serve another 100-plus stores in Greenwood by the end of this year. The new Dallas DC is on track to open this summer and we continue to roll out new systems like SWIFT, our merchandise forecasting and replenishment tool, and we're also investing in space and assortment planning tools this year. 
Now let me turn over to Scott to discuss the key drivers of our fourth quarter financial performance and our outlook for the first quarter and full year of 2016."
35929,326488350,950663,"ULTA Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 10, 2016",2016-03-10,"Earnings Calls","Ulta Beauty, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Top line growth was driven by a 12.5% comp and a very strong new store productivity. The marketing mix analysis that Mary mentioned showed that we were able to achieve this comp",1299,"Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Top line growth was driven by a 12.5% comp and a very strong new store productivity. The marketing mix analysis that Mary mentioned showed that we were able to achieve this comp through a healthier mix of business drivers, including new brand launches and new products; more effective marketing, including TV, radio and digital; more efficient in-store labor; and continued benefits from new store maturation. Increased sales of gift cards helped drive top line strength post holiday. 
During the fourth quarter our comp continued to be a bit more weighted to transaction growth, with traffic about 70% of the comp and average ticket representing about 30%. The retail only, the 10.4% comp, was composed of about 75% transaction growth and 25% ticket growth. Units per transaction were flat but average basket rose 3% to just over $43. E-commerce growth was driven roughly 75% by traffic and 25% by ticket. 
Now let's talk about the key drivers of the 120 basis points of gross profit improvement, which was quite a bit better than our initial plan. The increase was partly driven by higher merchandise margins due to mix as we delivered strong sales in many of our better margin categories and brands, including the ULTA Beauty Collection. We also successfully continued our shift away from broad coupons and discounts and toward more targeted and relevant offers to our guests, supported by our loyalty program and CRM. In fact, we completely eliminated one of our usual discount offers at the end of the quarter, which helped our margin rate. We leveraged store rent and occupancy expenses modestly on a double-digit comp. And while our supply chain investments were still a drag on margins, they were less so than in the third quarter, when we first opened the Greenwood, Indiana DC. 
E-commerce fulfillment costs were also much more favorable this year. You probably recall that during the holiday season of 2014 we were challenged with fulfilling orders during the spike in demand between Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And the higher-than-expected e-commerce fulfillment cost for holiday 2014 weighed on gross profit a year ago, creating an easier margin comparison in the fourth quarter. The team did a much better job getting orders to customers in a timely fashion during the 2015 holiday season. 
In addition to the successful launch of the Greenwood DC, which provided additional capacity, we also increased the efficiency of our other distribution centers with process improvements throughout the year. The e-commerce marketing team did a nice job smoothing out consumer demand during the holiday season, with promotional events planned before and after the Black Friday period, culminating in a much improved guest experience and significant profit improvement. The product mix for e-commerce continues to help as well as we ramp up sales of high-margin haircare products, which were added to the site last February. 
Moving on to SG&A expense. Deleverage of 100 basis points was driven primarily by planned investments in marketing and store payroll hours to support holiday season sales. While marketing expense was flat for the year, it was back half weighted with the introduction of new vehicles to drive brand awareness including the national TV and radio campaigns. We also invested in store labor hours and training to improve the guest experience, especially during the key selling weeks during the holiday. Corporate overhead also deleveraged slightly due to higher incentive compensation in concert with our better-than-expected earnings performance. 
In terms of the balance sheet, inventories were up 16.1% on a per-store basis, driven by investments in inventory to keep up with much-better-than-expected topline growth, several new brand additions and the continued expansion of Clinique and Lancôme boutiques. The team did a great job selling through holiday inventory and making sure we start the new year with very clean inventory across all categories. 
While we generally strive to keep inventory per door growth in line with comp growth, we had compelling business reasons to modestly exceed that benchmark and are very happy with the quality of our inventory and the resulting sales growth. With the large number of prestige brand boutiques and new brands being added in 2016, we expect inventory per door growth to remain somewhat elevated for the rest of the year, although at a slightly lower level than Q4. 
Capital expenditures were $67 million for the quarter, driven by 14 new store openings, investments in systems, store fixtures and supply chain. CapEx for the full year was $299 million. We ended the year with $476 million of cash and short-term investments. The company repurchased approximately 262,000 shares at a cost of $46 million during the fourth quarter under our 10b5-1 plan. For the full year, we repurchased just over 1 million shares for $167 million. This reduction in our shares outstanding delivered about $0.03 of earnings per share growth for fiscal 2015. 
Today we announced our 2016 guidance. In light of our accelerated share repurchase plan and continued momentum in our comparable sales growth, our anticipated earnings per share growth rate is higher than what we expected when we discussed our 5-year plan back in the fall of 2014. We plan to add 100 net new stores with all stores in the program in our traditional prototypical store size. We expect to open 11 stores in Q1, 21 in Q2, 44 in Q3 and 24 in Q4. We plan to complete 12 major store remodels and 2 relocations. We expect to grow e-commerce about 40%. Total company comps are expected to be in the 8% to 10% range. We anticipate earnings per share growth of approximately 18% to 20%. Operating margins are expected to be flattish, similar to what we achieved in 2015. Gross profit margin will be pressured by our new Dallas DC coming online this summer, continued investments in core merchandising systems and depreciation and write-offs related to our accelerated boutique rollout and store refresh program. 
CapEx has been planned higher than our previous view, which was in the $300 million range. We now anticipate CapEx of about $390 million. This includes slightly higher CapEx per new store, with the latest enhancements that Mary mentioned, as well as a significant step up in boutiques in our new store program. We have also added about $80 million to the capital plan to refresh hundreds of our existing stores, which will include a major expansion of Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques as well as a significant presentation upgrade for fragrance and the ULTA Beauty Collection. We believe these prestige boutiques drive increased productivity in our stores and improve our positioning as a beauty destination.  We are delighted that our brand partners want to grow even faster with us. 
In terms of share buybacks, our Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase program for $425 million, which replaces the previous program. As you saw in the press release, we announced an ASR for $200 million and expect to continue our open market repurchases similar to what we did in 2015. 
Turning now to guidance for the first quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.016 billion to $1.033 billion compared to $868 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 9% to 11% versus 11.4% last year. Online sales growth is expected to be in the 40% range. Preopening expense for the quarter is expected to be about $2.5 million. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.30 versus $1.04 for Q1 of last year. We anticipate a tax rate of 37.8% and fully diluted share count of approximately 64 million.

So the online booking tool is certainly one step in that direction, which is great. But we anticipate that, as we think about how we can continue to drive awareness in trial and rebooking in our salons, that we'll be able to continue to grow that for years to come. As I mentioned in the script, we've got plenty of excellent offerings for our guests, whether it's new trends right off the runway on cut and color, even things that people can try just for the first time like a blowout or a makeup service.

I would say that as we're coming into this year, I guess what I would say is at the highest level this is a business model that's working and we're executing it really well. And so we feel confident about the momentum and that continuing. It's a combination of a lot of factors coming together. 
So if you'll indulge me, let me just spend a minute on this, which is, first of all, it's great that we're in a great category that is a growing category, right? And so that's important to start with. And there's expandable consumption of beauty products. So these are everyday use, sometimes multiple times a day, driven by innovation. There's plenty of innovation. So we're in a growing business. We at ULTA Beauty have a really, I think, very clear beat on who our target guest is and how to position ourselves against this guest. So this beauty enthusiast is a large and growing segment. Dave just mentioned that we are positioned as All Things Beauty, All in One Place, which is differentiated and relevant to that segment. We have exceptional brand partnership. So it's about knowing who we're trying to target but also offering her what she wants. So exciting products, new and exclusive, and really working with our brand partners to continue to have the great assortment across category price point and services. 
I'd also add that smarter use of demand creation tools. So our loyalty program is really the heart. I talked about that. We've got long-term awareness and equity building tools moving in the right direction. The role of e-com and digital improved, especially at the guest service side of that as well. So the demand creation tools are working well. 
And then I'd say just exceptional collaboration in our -- with our teams and executing against complex things. So it's about making sure that the in-store experience is exceptional, and that takes a lot, whether its payroll hours or investing in in-stocks. The distribution side of it, the focus on our Greenwood distribution center, the IT systems that support it. And real estate is a core competency for us. And we're quite good at selecting store locations, building them out, remodeling. And store productivity is even stronger than we expected it to be. 
So I would say that truly is a notion of kind of a great market opportunity coming together and being executed well. 
And last thing I'd say is that we also are less subject to some other factors that some other retailers are. So whether it's weather, maybe weak mall traffic or fashion hits or misses, a few other things, we're less subject to that. 
So you put all that together, it helps us feel very confident that we can transcend what seems to be overall retail trends and deliver the kind of comps that we just guided you to."

And so we brought growth. And we're really excited to be continuing to partner with our brands to leverage growth. And we feel like we've got a great relationship that has been in -- that has been building and strengthening for many years and we're excited about our ability to do that. 
We've got -- Mary mentioned a couple, but as we look forward into 2016, we're as excited for the upcoming year as we were in our results in 2015. We've got some great brands already that have already come out in the Spring Trend magazine that you may have seen that came out. We featured over 2,000 new items across new brands and existing brands just in that magazine alone. Some key new brands that we're offering, Honest Beauty just launched. Mary mentioned that, Jessica Alba's brand that is exclusive with us. Fiona Stiles, also exclusive with us. Fiona is a well-known makeup artist and we're proud to be working with her. 
Our existing brands continue to bring newness and excitement to us. Mary mentioned Tarte with their Double Duty Beauty. And we're finding growth across all of our key brands, both big and small, continuing to expand and roll out brands that we launched last year: BECCA and Clarins, Clinique and Lancôme, which I'll touch on in just a second. And then all of our big brands, our big partners across every part of our store are great partners in finding new ways to grow and we're excited to be working with them and brands like Bare and Too Faced and Philosophy and Urban Decay and Benefit and Chi and Redken and Matrix. The list goes on. NYX and L'Oreal. So we're excited to be working with our brand partners and we think we've got a rich pipeline to come. 
On boutiques specifically, we did mention that we're continuing to expand. I'd say boutiques are an important part of our growth plan. It should be evident by this, they're not the only part of our growth plan, but we're really excited to be continuing to work. We have 4 main boutique brands. Bare has been our largest boutique brand and they're essentially in every store. We're continuing to roll out Benefit. We have -- they were in roughly 700 stores at the end of last year. And then over the last several years we've been partnering and expanding our relationship with Clinique and Lancôme. Each of them ended up with roughly 200 stores at the end of the year. In total, across the ones that we're continuing to expand into existing doors and new doors, Benefit, Clinique and Lancôme, we'll be adding over 500 boutiques across those 3 brands in 2016.

I would say that you can think about digital as the center of pretty much everything now, right? So quite often, maybe somebody is discovering and researching online before they come into the store. Whether they discover us online or in-store first, I'm not sure if I can break that out, but I'd say probably mostly in-store. Online tends to be very incremental to us as well. Our guests love the experience of coming to the store. The whole beauty enthusiast vibe is about trying things and increasingly experiencing services. And then online she's buying things that are kind of incremental to perhaps what she even had time to discover. We push out lots of e-mails, not lots, but I mean an appropriate number of e-mails to our guests around new and exclusive and exciting products and that tends to stimulate some online shopping as well.

And you'll recall the third quarter was really the first time we had it in service. So it was less of a drag on gross profit margin in the fourth quarter because the building was operating very effectively. As we look towards 2016, again, we will have headwinds in the first half of the year because of Greenwood being online. It wasn't there last year. It's still going to continue to scale up. And then in the second half of the year we're going to step -- we'll see more benefits there as we lap Greenwood but they will be taking online the new Dallas DC. So you're going to have incremental headwinds there. 
So as we look at next year, it's going to be fairly challenging, I would say, from a supply chain and contribution perspective. But we do expect to see merchandise margins continue to expand. So there will be a bit of a help there overall at the gross profit line."

I appreciate your humility and admitting when you get something wrong. Anyway, the small stores, I guess I would just say, stepping back, we have, as you know, 2 small stores that we opened up in small markets: Vernal, Utah, and Morganton, North Carolina. Both are performing fine. The most important thing is we're learning a lot about operating a smaller footprint. And as we look into the future, a couple of things I would say. One is that we know that smaller markets like those markets, there's plenty of them out there and they offer another growth opportunity for us. Having said that, we could do 10,000-square-foot stores maybe even easier because it's a better -- an even better representation of the full brand experience. So we kind of get into more experience in small markets. Those stores are doing well. 
We also -- the other thing is that as we look out in the future, we have not yet sized or put any kind of target out there on other opportunities like, say, urban stores or maybe the downtown main street parts of, say, suburbs across the country, where there are smaller parcels of real estate. So we continue to refresh our real estate view, and we're always doing that. And if we decide to go after smaller stores, we'll have a lot better handle on what that looks like in terms of how we think about season states, the assortment of labor models and supply chain models. So all good learnings. And I think we've shown  consistently that we like to kind of walk before we run. So we're walking and learning and it's going to provide benefits for us in the future."

So whether it's in terms of square footage or at a comp basis, we have, if you step way back, we have only 5% share of the spending of the beauty enthusiast today in the U.S. And it's -- beauty is highly fragmented.

So we're never going to get complacent about building out too much, but we certainly don't want to underestimate the possibility here. So I feel good about the target that we've communicated. If that changes, certainly we'll refresh that. But we'll continue to look at it. 
The other thing I'd say is that, reiterate, new store productivity: very strong. Cannibalization: very low. Too low to even be material. And it's actually gotten less, which is great. And I'd like to mention that real estate opportunities, very strong out there for us. And everything we just talked about as it relates to driving brand awareness of ULTA only helps. Every store that we open now we've got people who kind of know more about the brand than they did a couple years ago. So I think all those factors are very positive for us."

I mean, we've had a pretty good run the last few quarters and you can't always plan for everything to go perfectly every quarter.

We expect to do as good or better with Dallas coming online next year. Again, I won't break out basis points of headwinds or tailwinds from each one of those. But directionally we feel very confident that these are going to deliver the kind of benefits that we expected up front and that we described back in our investor day presentations. 
I mentioned merchandise margins a little earlier here. Again, the core, the mix of the business is very strong in retail. All these new brands that are coming in, we've got generally very strong terms with our vendors. Pulling back on some of the broad discounting things and doing things more direct and focused with our customers are only going to help drive merchandise margins higher in the future. So net-net we feel very confident that we're going to deliver at least flattish next year, and we're hoping that we're going to be able to do better, similar to what we did in 2015."

As far as mass and prestige there, each of those categories are very different in how they promote. But so -- we tend to have more promotions on the mass side, of course. Prestige is not -- does not tend to be a promoted category. Although starting on Sunday, Courtney, is our 21 Days of Beauty event, beauty's biggest event. So it is one of the 2 times a year where you can get pretty consistent prestige promotion. So that will be something we'll continue, focused events like that."

Good afternoon, everyone. 2016 is off to great start with excellent top and bottom line growth in our first quarter. There are several factors coming together to drive momentum in our business: healthy consumer demand in the beauty category, ULTA Beauty's unique and relevant format and positioning and effective collaboration across the enterprise, which is driving strong execution of our growth strategy. 
To recap the first quarter results: we drew -- grew the top line 23.7% and delivered a 15.2% comp on top of an 11.4% comp in the first quarter 2015. This is our best comp growth since 2006. Comp sales were driven primarily by traffic, while ticket also saw healthy increases. Ongoing strength in cosmetics, both mass and prestige, is largest contributor to our growth, but other major categories for delivering robust comps as well. E-commerce continues to see rapid sales growth. The Salon's top line was selling, even while we reduced the frequency of our promotion period. So with the overall revenue growth significantly better than planned, coupled with strong execution of our strategic imperatives, we delivered earnings per share growth of almost 40%, well above our expectations. 
I'd like to call out some more specific details on the primary contributors for our performance during the quarter. Growth in our loyalty program continues to fuel business results. ULTAmate Rewards membership grew to 19.4 million active members, up 25% year-over-year. This continued acceleration of sign-ups reflect store associates' efforts to convert new members and strong traffic driven apart by our advertising campaign. 
The number of members shopping increased as well as their sales ticket per visit. loyalty member retention increased each quarter and is up almost 200 basis points compared to last year. Using the loyalty program points as currency, our CRM team is working closely with our merchants and our brand partners to continue developing targeted and relevant campaigns that are increasingly resonating with our guests. 
Our marketing mix continues to evolve with great balance across television, radio, digital and social media as well as our traditional print vehicle. In March, we ran television and radio ads for our signature 21 Days of Beauty event. complemented this with an aggressive online video campaign as well as extensions into online radio with Spotify and Pandora. 
We elevated our social media and influence efforts anchored on our spring trends. We surrounded our consumer with current and relevant content online and in-store as well as activation at high-profile events, including the Coachella music Festival. Our comprehensive campaign for Mother's Day, which was called pamper Her with  , was designed to build awareness that our brand, deepen our connection with our guests and provide a platform to make ULTA Beauty a top-of-mind destination for gift-giving, especially in fragrance. In addition to the return of the Mother's Day gift guide and fragrance finder, we offered more gifts purchase and CRM promotions in conjunction with many exciting new fragrance launches. The Mother's Day activities also included a social media campaign with the launch of a special video entitled Mom, the Original Beauty Icon, which invited guests to celebrate mom by sharing what makes their own moms' beauty iconic through a post on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. This campaign was viewed over 4.5 million times. We believe all these marketing efforts contributed to our strong traffic growth during the quarter. 
Now to update you on merchandising. The trends from last year continued to drive business, with Urban Decay, cosmetics, Mix, , Too Faced,, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit and Ulta Beauty Collection along the best performing brands in the quarter. The pipeline of newness really continues to be quite compelling, translating into strong growth in both mass and prestige cosmetics. During the quarter, we launched Honest [ph] Beauty in 250 stores, rolled out our exclusive Feeling the [indiscernible] in 500 stores and added Cosmetics to all doors. Anastacia, Beverly Hills and launched new product lines. Clarence was rolled out to additional doors. We entered [indiscernible] Double Duty beauty Collection, which is exclusive to ULTA Beauty. And we rolled that Dior mascara to all stores. 
More recently, we announced the addition of [indiscernible] hair care products, and we began to offer a French skincare brand on our website. We also rolled out an assortment of the iconic drive bar hair products and tools in hundreds of stores. 
We are enhancing our ULTA Beauty Collection through a series of initiatives. we've been updating and elevating the formula and packaging as well as the in-store graphics, while improving speed to market and on trend products. Trend categories include contouring, strobing and multidimensional makeup. And we've also added an featuring new spring kids. We've produced compelling training videos and enhanced our sampling program. while we've made great progress, we're just getting started with our efforts to involve ULTA Beauty Collection to continue to represent our brand personality. 
Turning to services. Our salon sales rose 14.7% and comped 7.7%, with strength in blowouts, hair treatment and makeup services. We view the services business as a growth opportunity, and we're very focused on our strategy to convert more of our loyalty members to discover a high-quality services offering. Our Benefit Brow Bar business continued its strong performance, with brow services now in 738 stores. And we're proud to perform more brow service than anyone else in the U.S. 
Moving on to stores. We opened 13 stores and closed one in the first quarter, well on our way to executing our 2016 program of 100 net new stores. We ended the quarter with 886 stores. New store productivity remains very strong, with all vintages of stores benefiting from the successful execution of our strategic imperatives. Our growth and development team is now in the process of performing a deep dive analysis to refresh our estimate of the store potential in the U.S. This analysis includes an updated assessment of the potential for smaller and urban market as well as how our small store format will fit into the future storm mix.  Sharing the outcome of this work is expected to be one of the topics we plan to cover at our next Analyst Day this fall as well as other updates from our long-term strategic plan that we're now in the process of refreshing as well. 
Moving on to www.ulta.com. Our e-commerce growth was very strong, up 38.8% and contributing 130 basis points of total company comp. The mix of professional health care and prestige cosmetics continues to grow, helping our e-commerce margin rate. We are also adding brands and products that are available online such as Beauty,   hair care,   [indiscernible] among others. Our ulta.com guests remain very interested in our beauty bag sampling program and beauty break limited time promotions. 
Mobile is growing rapidly, now representing more than 60% of site traffic. We released new versions of our iPhone and Android apps in the first quarter. The iPhone app was featured on Apple Store home page. Moving up to a 5-star rating, this new version now includes features such as Apple Pay checkout, enhanced features displaying ULTAmate Rewards information and Gifts with Purchase details on product pages. Both app versions have been a big hit with users, garnering enthusiastic user reviews and an increase in downloads, now reaching well over 2 million between the two. 
Finally, our supply chain and IT teams have done a great job managing the ramp-up of the Greenwood distribution center while preparing to open our distribution center in Dallas, which began inbound inventories last week. The Greenwood DC is now serving about 200 stores and fulfilling roughly 40% of our e-commerce orders. We're on track to end the year delivering to approximately 240 stores from Greenwood. 
Our Dallas facility, a carbon copy of our Greenwood building, is right on track to begin outbound shipments in July as planned. We expect to ramp up this newest DC to serve 125 stores by holiday. As expected, the Greenwood distribution center and systems are producing efficiencies and cost per unit shipped. 
On the system side, we have good progress to report here as well. Swift, our forecasting replenishment tool, has been rolled out to additional categories including skincare and health care, and rest of categories will be implemented throughout the remainder of the year. I am particularly proud of the supply chain team and IT teams' performance in the collaboration and balancing execution of several major initiatives and projects while of doing an excellent job improving in stocks in our stores to support the higher-than-expected sales trends. 
So now I'll turn it over to Scott to discuss the drivers of our first quarter results and outlook for the second quarter and the year."
35929,336642658,992936,"ULTA Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, May 26, 2016",2016-05-26,"Earnings Calls","Ulta Beauty, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Starting with the income statement. Similar to previous quarters, our top line was driven by a very healthy 15.2% comp and strong new store productivity. The total company comp was composed of 11% transaction grow",817,"Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. 
Starting with the income statement. Similar to previous quarters, our top line was driven by a very healthy 15.2% comp and strong new store productivity. The total company comp was composed of 11% transaction growth and 4.2% average ticket growth. The retail comp of 14.3% was made up 10.5% traffic and 3.8% ticket. The Salon business comped 7.7%, and salon growth was all ticket based. e-commerce growth was almost entirely driven by traffic, with modest ticket growth. 
Gross profit increased 150 basis points. The improvement was driven by strong leverage on store rent and occupancy expenses as well as product margin expansion, offset by planned supply chain deleverage related to investments in new distribution centers and core merchandising systems. Strong product margin performance was driven in part by significant margin improvement in mass departments due to changes in our promotional offers and a mix of higher margin brands, including the ULTA Beauty Collection. We continued to carefully pull back on broad discounting, while placing more reliance on loyalty and our CRM tool kit. 
Moving on to SG&A expenses. We deleveraged by 20 basis points, primarily related to investments and headcount and consulting to support our growth initiatives. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventories were up 14.5% on a per-store basis, slightly below the comp rate. This growth was driven by investments in inventory to keep up with better-than-expected top line growth, new brand additions and the accelerated expansion of prestige boutiques. In-stock levels have improved year-over-year, but we still expect to make more progress going forward as we begin to reap the benefits of our new distribution centers and related systems. 
Capital expenditures were $54.3 million in the quarter driven by new store openings, merchandise features for the rollout of prestige brand boutiques and supply chain and system investments. 
We ended the quarter with $369 million in cash and short-term investments. 
We repurchased 158,000 shares at a cost of $27 million under our 10b5-1 plan. And as you know, we entered into a $200 million ASR agreement in March, which settled just last week. During the first quarter, we received 80% of the shares we expected to receive on settlement, or about 852,000 shares. The reduction in shares outstanding year-over-year contributed approximately $0.03 of earnings per share growth in the quarter. Including the entire $200 million paid as part of the ASR agreement, approximately $219 million remained available under the $425 million share repurchase program announced in March. 
Turning now to guidance for the second quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.041 billion to $1.058 billion compared to $877 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 11% to 13% versus 10.1% last year. Online sales growth is expected to be in the 40% range. We plan to open about 25 stores in Q2 compared to 20 stores during the same period last year. And preopening expense for the quarter is expected to be about $4.6 million. 
Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.32 to $1.37 versus $1.15 for Q2 of 2015.  Our supply chain investments, including new Dallas DC, are expected to weigh on margins the most in the second and third quarter. And we expect earnings per share growth to be higher in the fourth quarter this year.  We anticipate a tax rate of 37.6% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 63 million. 
In terms of our outlook for the full year 2016, we are raising our guidance for comparable sales and earnings per share growth to reflect the strong start to the year. Total company comps are now expected to be approximately 10% to 12% compared to our prior guidance of 8% to 10%. We now expect to grow earnings per share in the low 20s percentage range versus our prior guidance of 18% to 20% growth. Operating margins are now expected to leverage slightly. 
The other elements of our guidance for the year are unchanged. We are on track to open approximately 100 stores, all planned to be on 10,000 square foot prototype. We expect to open about 25 stores in Q2, 50 stores in Q3 and 15 stores in Q4. 
We're also planning 12 major remodels and 2 relocations. We plan to grow e-commerce approximately 40%. We expect CapEx to be about $390 million, driven by higher capital per new store and the rollout of boutiques. As a reminder, we planned about $80 million for boutique expansion and updates, with over 500 Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques as well as updates to our fragrance fixtures and the ULTA Beauty Collection. 
We anticipate that share repurchase activity under our $425 million authorization will contribute about 2 percentage points of earnings per share growth.

So gross margin overall, we're not going to break out all the basis points, pluses and minuses here, puts and takes, but I can just directionally talk. And I know sometimes people, it may not be clear because this is kind of a multivariable equation that we're solving for when we talk about promotions, right? So there's a couple of major buckets, I guess I would call them. Merchants discounts, right, so what are the offers in the magazines that we distribute or the tabs that we put in the newspapers? Is it 2 for 1? Is it buy one, get one 50% off? Is there a GWP with it, right? So that's one bucket. And then there's the marketing discount bucket, right, which is the coupon, right, 3 50 off 10, 20% of one item, 20% off the entire order kind of thing, right, with the postcard offer that we described in the past. And then there's the loyalty, right? So that will be the third leg of the stool. So again we approach this very carefully, right, and we're testing and learning   . But if we look at the first quarter, for example, we talked about the mass area, right? So mass has been generating really healthy comps for us. We've kind of learned over the course of the last year that the merchandise discounts don't need to be as broad maybe as what it did in the past. This year, we kind of narrowed it down. Instead of 2 -- buy 2, get 1 across the whole brand, maybe it's just a narrower set of SKUs. So that would be one example of something that we executed very well in the first quarter. in there's just another set of other what I call smart merchandising marketing decisions, continuing to tweak our coupon offers and the circulation that we have on our marketing offers, ULTA Beauty Collection, private label, super high margin part of our business with especially strong in the first quarter this year. E-commerce, we called out again, product mix, being very helpful to us. So you got a lot of good things happening in the merch margin bucket, I would say. And then you layer on top of that a 15 comp right? That helps a lot on the fixed store cost line. We called that out in our comments. And then we have some offsets, some deleverage on supply chain, which was planned and which was expected. So that's kind of it. I guess I'd say in a nutshell. On the explanation of the variation year-over-year, when we think about the comp breakout and ticket bifurcation, units were pretty flat year-over-year, so most of it was on average selling price."

There was accelerated depreciation in the first quarter. It's going to be heavy again in the second quarter as we look -- compare against last year. I would say that there's some cost of doing business things that are in there. You guys read all these stores about credit card fraud and the whole EMV thing that all of retail is kind of struggling with. So we're not immune to that, right? We had some of that in the first quarter. Now lucky for us, our EMV rollout is complete now. So that, we've mitigated that risk as we look out -- across the rest of the year. I would also say that work, like we've done in the past, we look to optimize the business, right?

And then if you look at dollars that are spent in amongst the targets that we focused on, the beauty enthusiasts on a budget, certainly, it's higher. We have 5% of their share of wallet. Of the people that are in a loyalty program, well clearly, it's higher than that. But I'll tell you what, there's a lot of upside to that as well. if we look at our best guest, if you step back, there are, I don't know. I mean there are 50,000 places you can buy beauty in the U.S., right? So between grocery, mass, drug, department store, specialty retailer, online, there's lot of places you can buy beauty. So there's a lot of sources of   share gain that will ideal for us and our guests and to be really resonating is the more success with us loyalty program, right, the more benefit she gets by consolidating per spend at ULTA. So we had not had that you do in terms of the number of relevant, the addressable market [indiscernible] folks that are could be in our loyalty program as well as -- We'll never have 100% of anybody's wallet, I think. That's kind of in any category, think about grocery for example. People buy food probably in 2 or 3 or 4 different types of retail outlets. It's probably always going to be a little bit of like that and beauty. But we feel good about where it is and there's a lot of potential for that growth."

They really, I guess you can point most directly to the acceleration the growth of the member. So a 25% increase in the members and ULTAmate Rewards program, that clearly, we can point to as a major driver. So more guests in the program and guests spending more often, reactivation of guests, better retention. Now that doesn't happen kind of by accident, right? So it's really a combination of, I would say, everything we're doing. I mentioned at the top, I mean, it's good to be in a category that's going and beauty, we believe, what we have is a very compelling proposition relative to a large segment of the market, right? So what we offer them is relevant and as we look out into the future, the future consumer and the line is, I think even more so relevant. But even within addition, right, we had to be driving awareness and traffic. So I feel great about what I recall our demand creation tool. So we wouldn't have an increase in the number. If it didn't have new people aware of the coming to trend in the traffic shows that. And then in addition, of course, it's about what we saw in the store and a service that we give and the services and a guest experience. So I talked a lot about the merchandise assortment. So I feel good about we're really doing business smartly with our brand partners. So I guess in total, it's a lot of things coming together I think effectively for us to drive members and to a loyalty program and have a relevant proposition to drive the growth. The second part you asked about was, yes there is a lot obviously happening as it relates to wages and whatnot. In particular, overtime pay thing that just passed. We are -- we've already factored that into our forecast. There is some   impact [ph] to us this year. it's immaterial, I would say.

So customers that shopped with us 2 years ago would that be considered a current customer. But we have a record of them. They come back in. They reactivate the account. And they would move into our active group, move back into our active member profile. So that's a chunk of it. But the biggest part of it is new-to-ULTA customers. And that is exactly as you described, customers coming in and shopping at ULTA and starting that experience as a new customer. And then when they get up and interact with one of our associates, become one of our customer during the visit there.

Good afternoon, everyone. 2016 is off to great start with excellent top and bottom line growth in our first quarter. There are several factors coming together to drive momentum in our business: healthy consumer demand in the beauty category, ULTA Beauty's unique and relevant format and positioning and effective collaboration across the enterprise, which is driving strong execution of our growth strategy. 
To recap the first quarter results: we drew -- grew the top line 23.7% and delivered a 15.2% comp on top of an 11.4% comp in the first quarter 2015. This is our best comp growth since 2006. Comp sales were driven primarily by traffic, while ticket also saw healthy increases. Ongoing strength in cosmetics, both mass and prestige, is largest contributor to our growth, but other major categories for delivering robust comps as well. E-commerce continues to see rapid sales growth. The Salon's top line was selling, even while we reduced the frequency of our promotion period. So with the overall revenue growth significantly better than planned, coupled with strong execution of our strategic imperatives, we delivered earnings per share growth of almost 40%, well above our expectations. 
I'd like to call out some more specific details on the primary contributors for our performance during the quarter. Growth in our loyalty program continues to fuel business results. ULTAmate Rewards membership grew to 19.4 million active members, up 25% year-over-year. This continued acceleration of sign-ups reflect store associates' efforts to convert new members and strong traffic driven apart by our advertising campaign. 
The number of members shopping increased as well as their sales ticket per visit. loyalty member retention increased each quarter and is up almost 200 basis points compared to last year. Using the loyalty program points as currency, our CRM team is working closely with our merchants and our brand partners to continue developing targeted and relevant campaigns that are increasingly resonating with our guests. 
Our marketing mix continues to evolve with great balance across television, radio, digital and social media as well as our traditional print vehicle. In March, we ran television and radio ads for our signature 21 Days of Beauty event. complemented this with an aggressive online video campaign as well as extensions into online radio with Spotify and Pandora. 
We elevated our social media and influence efforts anchored on our spring trends. We surrounded our consumer with current and relevant content online and in-store as well as activation at high-profile events, including the Coachella music Festival. Our comprehensive campaign for Mother's Day, which was called pamper Her with  , was designed to build awareness that our brand, deepen our connection with our guests and provide a platform to make ULTA Beauty a top-of-mind destination for gift-giving, especially in fragrance. In addition to the return of the Mother's Day gift guide and fragrance finder, we offered more gifts purchase and CRM promotions in conjunction with many exciting new fragrance launches. The Mother's Day activities also included a social media campaign with the launch of a special video entitled Mom, the Original Beauty Icon, which invited guests to celebrate mom by sharing what makes their own moms' beauty iconic through a post on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. This campaign was viewed over 4.5 million times. We believe all these marketing efforts contributed to our strong traffic growth during the quarter. 
Now to update you on merchandising. The trends from last year continued to drive business, with Urban Decay, cosmetics, Mix, , Too Faced,, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit and Ulta Beauty Collection along the best performing brands in the quarter. The pipeline of newness really continues to be quite compelling, translating into strong growth in both mass and prestige cosmetics. During the quarter, we launched Honest [ph] Beauty in 250 stores, rolled out our exclusive Feeling the [indiscernible] in 500 stores and added Cosmetics to all doors. Anastacia, Beverly Hills and launched new product lines. Clarence was rolled out to additional doors. We entered [indiscernible] Double Duty beauty Collection, which is exclusive to ULTA Beauty. And we rolled that Dior mascara to all stores. 
More recently, we announced the addition of [indiscernible] hair care products, and we began to offer a French skincare brand on our website. We also rolled out an assortment of the iconic drive bar hair products and tools in hundreds of stores. 
We are enhancing our ULTA Beauty Collection through a series of initiatives. we've been updating and elevating the formula and packaging as well as the in-store graphics, while improving speed to market and on trend products. Trend categories include contouring, strobing and multidimensional makeup. And we've also added an featuring new spring kids. We've produced compelling training videos and enhanced our sampling program. while we've made great progress, we're just getting started with our efforts to involve ULTA Beauty Collection to continue to represent our brand personality. 
Turning to services. Our salon sales rose 14.7% and comped 7.7%, with strength in blowouts, hair treatment and makeup services. We view the services business as a growth opportunity, and we're very focused on our strategy to convert more of our loyalty members to discover a high-quality services offering. Our Benefit Brow Bar business continued its strong performance, with brow services now in 738 stores. And we're proud to perform more brow service than anyone else in the U.S. 
Moving on to stores. We opened 13 stores and closed one in the first quarter, well on our way to executing our 2016 program of 100 net new stores. We ended the quarter with 886 stores. New store productivity remains very strong, with all vintages of stores benefiting from the successful execution of our strategic imperatives. Our growth and development team is now in the process of performing a deep dive analysis to refresh our estimate of the store potential in the U.S. This analysis includes an updated assessment of the potential for smaller and urban market as well as how our small store format will fit into the future storm mix.  Sharing the outcome of this work is expected to be one of the topics we plan to cover at our next Analyst Day this fall as well as other updates from our long-term strategic plan that we're now in the process of refreshing as well. 
Moving on to www.ulta.com. Our e-commerce growth was very strong, up 38.8% and contributing 130 basis points of total company comp. The mix of professional health care and prestige cosmetics continues to grow, helping our e-commerce margin rate. We are also adding brands and products that are available online such as Beauty,   hair care,   [indiscernible] among others. Our ulta.com guests remain very interested in our beauty bag sampling program and beauty break limited time promotions. 
Mobile is growing rapidly, now representing more than 60% of site traffic. We released new versions of our iPhone and Android apps in the first quarter. The iPhone app was featured on Apple Store home page. Moving up to a 5-star rating, this new version now includes features such as Apple Pay checkout, enhanced features displaying ULTAmate Rewards information and Gifts with Purchase details on product pages. Both app versions have been a big hit with users, garnering enthusiastic user reviews and an increase in downloads, now reaching well over 2 million between the two. 
Finally, our supply chain and IT teams have done a great job managing the ramp-up of the Greenwood distribution center while preparing to open our distribution center in Dallas, which began inbound inventories last week. The Greenwood DC is now serving about 200 stores and fulfilling roughly 40% of our e-commerce orders. We're on track to end the year delivering to approximately 240 stores from Greenwood. 
Our Dallas facility, a carbon copy of our Greenwood building, is right on track to begin outbound shipments in July as planned. We expect to ramp up this newest DC to serve 125 stores by holiday. As expected, the Greenwood distribution center and systems are producing efficiencies and cost per unit shipped. 
On the system side, we have good progress to report here as well. Swift, our forecasting replenishment tool, has been rolled out to additional categories including skincare and health care, and rest of categories will be implemented throughout the remainder of the year. I am particularly proud of the supply chain team and IT teams' performance in the collaboration and balancing execution of several major initiatives and projects while of doing an excellent job improving in stocks in our stores to support the higher-than-expected sales trends. 
So now I'll turn it over to Scott to discuss the drivers of our first quarter results and outlook for the second quarter and the year."

Good afternoon, everyone. Starting with the income statement. Similar to previous quarters, our top line was driven by a very healthy 15.2% comp and strong new store productivity.

Starting with the income statement. Similar to previous quarters, our top line was driven by a very healthy 15.2% comp and strong new store productivity. The total company comp was composed of 11% transaction growth and 4.2% average ticket growth. The retail comp of 14.3% was made up 10.5% traffic and 3.8% ticket. The Salon business comped 7.7%, and salon growth was all ticket based. e-commerce growth was almost entirely driven by traffic, with modest ticket growth. 
Gross profit increased 150 basis points. The improvement was driven by strong leverage on store rent and occupancy expenses as well as product margin expansion, offset by planned supply chain deleverage related to investments in new distribution centers and core merchandising systems. Strong product margin performance was driven in part by significant margin improvement in mass departments due to changes in our promotional offers and a mix of higher margin brands, including the ULTA Beauty Collection. We continued to carefully pull back on broad discounting, while placing more reliance on loyalty and our CRM tool kit. 
Moving on to SG&A expenses. We deleveraged by 20 basis points, primarily related to investments and headcount and consulting to support our growth initiatives. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventories were up 14.5% on a per-store basis, slightly below the comp rate. This growth was driven by investments in inventory to keep up with better-than-expected top line growth, new brand additions and the accelerated expansion of prestige boutiques. In-stock levels have improved year-over-year, but we still expect to make more progress going forward as we begin to reap the benefits of our new distribution centers and related systems. 
Capital expenditures were $54.3 million in the quarter driven by new store openings, merchandise features for the rollout of prestige brand boutiques and supply chain and system investments. 
We ended the quarter with $369 million in cash and short-term investments. 
We repurchased 158,000 shares at a cost of $27 million under our 10b5-1 plan. And as you know, we entered into a $200 million ASR agreement in March, which settled just last week. During the first quarter, we received 80% of the shares we expected to receive on settlement, or about 852,000 shares. The reduction in shares outstanding year-over-year contributed approximately $0.03 of earnings per share growth in the quarter. Including the entire $200 million paid as part of the ASR agreement, approximately $219 million remained available under the $425 million share repurchase program announced in March. 
Turning now to guidance for the second quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.041 billion to $1.058 billion compared to $877 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 11% to 13% versus 10.1% last year. Online sales growth is expected to be in the 40% range. We plan to open about 25 stores in Q2 compared to 20 stores during the same period last year. And preopening expense for the quarter is expected to be about $4.6 million. 
Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.32 to $1.37 versus $1.15 for Q2 of 2015.  Our supply chain investments, including new Dallas DC, are expected to weigh on margins the most in the second and third quarter. And we expect earnings per share growth to be higher in the fourth quarter this year.  We anticipate a tax rate of 37.6% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 63 million. 
In terms of our outlook for the full year 2016, we are raising our guidance for comparable sales and earnings per share growth to reflect the strong start to the year. Total company comps are now expected to be approximately 10% to 12% compared to our prior guidance of 8% to 10%. We now expect to grow earnings per share in the low 20s percentage range versus our prior guidance of 18% to 20% growth. Operating margins are now expected to leverage slightly. 
The other elements of our guidance for the year are unchanged. We are on track to open approximately 100 stores, all planned to be on 10,000 square foot prototype. We expect to open about 25 stores in Q2, 50 stores in Q3 and 15 stores in Q4. 
We're also planning 12 major remodels and 2 relocations. We plan to grow e-commerce approximately 40%. We expect CapEx to be about $390 million, driven by higher capital per new store and the rollout of boutiques. As a reminder, we planned about $80 million for boutique expansion and updates, with over 500 Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques as well as updates to our fragrance fixtures and the ULTA Beauty Collection. 
We anticipate that share repurchase activity under our $425 million authorization will contribute about 2 percentage points of earnings per share growth.

So gross margin overall, we're not going to break out all the basis points, pluses and minuses here, puts and takes, but I can just directionally talk. And I know sometimes people, it may not be clear because this is kind of a multivariable equation that we're solving for when we talk about promotions, right? So there's a couple of major buckets, I guess I would call them. Merchants discounts, right, so what are the offers in the magazines that we distribute or the tabs that we put in the newspapers? Is it 2 for 1? Is it buy one, get one 50% off? Is there a GWP with it, right? So that's one bucket. And then there's the marketing discount bucket, right, which is the coupon, right, 3 50 off 10, 20% of one item, 20% off the entire order kind of thing, right, with the postcard offer that we described in the past. And then there's the loyalty, right? So that will be the third leg of the stool. So again we approach this very carefully, right, and we're testing and learning   . But if we look at the first quarter, for example, we talked about the mass area, right? So mass has been generating really healthy comps for us. We've kind of learned over the course of the last year that the merchandise discounts don't need to be as broad maybe as what it did in the past. This year, we kind of narrowed it down. Instead of 2 -- buy 2, get 1 across the whole brand, maybe it's just a narrower set of SKUs. So that would be one example of something that we executed very well in the first quarter. in there's just another set of other what I call smart merchandising marketing decisions, continuing to tweak our coupon offers and the circulation that we have on our marketing offers, ULTA Beauty Collection, private label, super high margin part of our business with especially strong in the first quarter this year. E-commerce, we called out again, product mix, being very helpful to us. So you got a lot of good things happening in the merch margin bucket, I would say. And then you layer on top of that a 15 comp right? That helps a lot on the fixed store cost line. We called that out in our comments. And then we have some offsets, some deleverage on supply chain, which was planned and which was expected. So that's kind of it. I guess I'd say in a nutshell. On the explanation of the variation year-over-year, when we think about the comp breakout and ticket bifurcation, units were pretty flat year-over-year, so most of it was on average selling price."

I would say that there's some cost of doing business things that are in there. You guys read all these stores about credit card fraud and the whole EMV thing that all of retail is kind of struggling with. So we're not immune to that, right?

I would also say that work, like we've done in the past, we look to optimize the business, right?

They really, I guess you can point most directly to the acceleration the growth of the member. So a 25% increase in the members and ULTAmate Rewards program, that clearly, we can point to as a major driver. So more guests in the program and guests spending more often, reactivation of guests, better retention. Now that doesn't happen kind of by accident, right? So it's really a combination of, I would say, everything we're doing. I mentioned at the top, I mean, it's good to be in a category that's going and beauty, we believe, what we have is a very compelling proposition relative to a large segment of the market, right? So what we offer them is relevant and as we look out into the future, the future consumer and the line is, I think even more so relevant. But even within addition, right, we had to be driving awareness and traffic. So I feel great about what I recall our demand creation tool. So we wouldn't have an increase in the number. If it didn't have new people aware of the coming to trend in the traffic shows that. And then in addition, of course, it's about what we saw in the store and a service that we give and the services and a guest experience. So I talked a lot about the merchandise assortment. So I feel good about we're really doing business smartly with our brand partners. So I guess in total, it's a lot of things coming together I think effectively for us to drive members and to a loyalty program and have a relevant proposition to drive the growth. The second part you asked about was, yes there is a lot obviously happening as it relates to wages and whatnot. In particular, overtime pay thing that just passed. We are -- we've already factored that into our forecast. There is some   impact [ph] to us this year. it's immaterial, I would say. Those managers are typically paid above the threshold, and some of our comanagers are affected. [ph] And as you look out into future years, we'll continue to obviously be cognizant of that in factoring each and other pay factors."

Good afternoon, everyone. 2016 is off to a phenomenal start with excellent top and bottom line growth in our first quarter. There are several factors coming together to drive the momentum in our business: healthy consumer demand in the beauty category, ULTA Beauty's unique and relevant format and positioning and effective collaboration across the enterprise, which is driving strong execution of our growth strategy. 
To recap the first quarter results: we grew the top line 23.7% and delivered a 15.2% comp on top of an 11.4% comp in the first quarter 2015. This is our best comp growth since 2006. Comp sales were driven primarily by traffic, while ticket also saw healthy increases. Ongoing strength in cosmetics, both mass and prestige, is the largest contributor to our growth, but other major categories are delivering robust comps as well. E-commerce continues to see rapid sales growth. The Salon's top line was solid even while we reduced the frequency of our promotions. So with overall revenue growth significantly better than planned, coupled with strong execution of our strategic imperatives, we delivered earnings per share growth of almost 40%, well above our expectations. 
I'd like to call out some more specific details on the primary contributors for our performance during the quarter. Growth in our loyalty program continues to fuel our business results. ULTAmate Rewards membership grew to 19.4 million active members, up 25% year-over-year. This continued acceleration of sign-ups reflect our store associates' efforts to convert new members and strong traffic driven in part by our advertising campaign. 
The number of members shopping increased as well as their average sales per ticket -- per visit. Loyalty member retention has increased steadily each quarter and is up almost 200 basis points compared to last year. Using the loyalty program points as currency, our CRM team is working closely with our merchants and our brand partners to continue developing targeted and relevant campaigns that are increasingly resonating with our guests. 
Our marketing mix continues to evolve with great balance across television, radio, digital and social media as well as our traditional print vehicles. In March, we ran television and radio ads for our signature 21 Days of Beauty event. We complemented this with an aggressive online video campaign as well as extensions into online radio with Spotify and Pandora. 
We elevated our social media and influence efforts anchored on our spring trends. We surrounded our consumer with current and relevant content online and in-store as well as activation at high-profile events, including the Coachella music festival. 
Our comprehensive campaign for Mother's Day, which was called Pamper Her with Pretty, was designed to build awareness of our brand, deepen our connection with our guests and provide a platform to make ULTA Beauty a top-of-mind destination for gift-giving, especially in fragrance. In addition to the return of the Mother's Day gift guide and fragrance finder, we offered more Gifts with Purchase and CRM promotions in conjunction with many exciting new fragrance launches. 
The Mother's Day activities also included a social media campaign with the launch of a special video entitled Mom, the Original Beauty Icon, which invited guests to celebrate mom by sharing what makes their own moms' beauty iconic through a post on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. This campaign was viewed over 4.5 million times. We believe all these marketing efforts contributed to our strong traffic growth during the quarter. 
Now to update you on merchandising. The trends from last year continued to drive the business, with Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX,  Anastasia, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit and ULTA Beauty Collection among the best performing brands for the quarter -- the pipeline of newness really continues to be quite compelling, translating into strong growth in both mass and prestige cosmetics. 
During the quarter, we launched Honest Beauty in 250 stores, rolled out our exclusive Fiona Stiles line in 500 stores and added Buxom Cosmetics to all doors. Anastasia Beverly Hills and Perricone launched new product lines. Clarins was rolled out to additional doors. We introduced Tarte's Double Duty Beauty collection, which is exclusive to ULTA Beauty. And we rolled out Dior mascara to all stores. 
More recently, we announced the addition of dpHUE hair care products, and we began to offer Nuxe, a French skincare brand, on our website. We also rolled out an assortment of the iconic Drybar hair products and tools in hundreds of stores. 
We are enhancing our ULTA Beauty Collection through a series of initiatives. We've been updating and elevating the formulas and packaging as well as the in-store graphics, while improving speed to market and on-trend products. Trend categories include contouring, strobing and multidimensional makeup. And we've also added an endcap featuring new spring kits. We've produced compelling training videos and enhanced our sampling programs. While we've made great progress, we're just getting started with our efforts to evolve ULTA Beauty Collection to continue to represent our brand personality. 
Turning to services. Our salon sales rose 14.7% and comped 7.7%, with strength in blowouts, hair treatments and makeup services. We view the services business as a growth opportunity, and we're very focused on our strategy to convert more of our loyalty members to discover a high-quality services offering. Our Benefit Brow Bar business continued its strong performance, with brow services now in 738 stores. And we're proud to perform more brow services than anyone else in the U.S. 
Moving on to stores. We opened 13 stores and closed one in the first quarter, well on our way to executing our 2016 program of 100 net new stores. We ended the quarter with 886 stores. New store productivity remains very strong, with all vintages of stores benefiting from the successful execution of our strategic imperatives. Our growth and development team is now in the process of performing a deep dive analysis to refresh our estimate of the store potential in the U.S. This analysis includes an updated assessment of the potential for smaller and urban markets as well as how our small store format will fit into the future store mix. Sharing the outcome of this work is expected to be one of the topics we plan to cover at our next Analyst Day this fall as well as other updates from our long-term strategic plan that we're now in the process of refreshing as well. 
Moving on to ulta.com. Our e-commerce growth was very strong, up 38.8% and contributing 130 basis points to our total company comp. The mix of professional hair care and prestige cosmetics continues to grow, helping our e-commerce margin rate. We're also adding brands and products that are available only online such as J.Cat Beauty,  StriVectin Hair Care,   Eyeko and ManCave among others. Our ulta.com guests remain very interested in our beauty bag sampling program and Beauty Break! limited time promotions. 
Mobile is growing rapidly, now representing more than 60% of site traffic. We released new versions of our iPhone and Android apps in the first quarter. The iPhone app was featured on the Apple Store home page. Moving up to a 5-star rating, this new version now includes features such as Apple Pay checkout, enhanced features displaying ULTAmate Rewards information and Gifts with Purchase details on product pages. Both app versions have been a big hit with users, garnering enthusiastic user reviews and an increase in downloads, now reaching well over 2 million between the 2. 
Finally, our supply chain and IT teams have done a great job managing the ramp-up of the Greenwood distribution center while preparing to open our new distribution center in Dallas, which began to accept inbound inventories just last week. The Greenwood DC is now serving about 200 stores and fulfilling roughly 40% of our e-commerce orders. We're on track to end the year delivering to approximately 240 stores from Greenwood. 
Our Dallas facility, a carbon copy of our Greenwood building, is right on track to begin outbound shipments in July as planned. We expect to ramp up this newest DC to serve 125 stores by holiday. As expected, the Greenwood distribution center and systems are producing efficiencies and cost per unit shipped. 
On the system side, we have good progress to report here as well. SWIFT, our forecasting replenishment tool, has been rolled out to additional categories including skincare and hair care, and rest of categories will be implemented throughout the remainder of the year. I am particularly proud of the supply chain team and the IT teams' performance and deep collaborations, and they're balancing the execution of several major initiatives and projects while doing an excellent job improving in-stocks in our stores to support the higher-than-expected sales trends. 
So now I'll turn it over to Scott to discuss the drivers of our first quarter results and outlook for the second quarter and the year."

Starting with the income statement. Similar to previous quarters, our top line was driven by a very healthy 15.2% comp and strong new store productivity. The total company comp was composed of 11% transaction growth and 4.2% average ticket growth. The retail comp of 14.3% was made up of 10.5% traffic and 3.8% ticket. The Salon business comped 7.7%, and salon growth was all ticket-based. E-commerce growth was almost entirely driven by traffic, with modest ticket growth. 
Gross profit increased 150 basis points. The improvement was driven by strong leverage on store rent and occupancy expenses as well as by healthy product margin expansion, offset by planned supply chain deleverage related to investments in new distribution centers and core merchandising systems. Strong product margin performance was driven in part by significant margin improvement in mass departments due to changes in our promotional offers and a mix of higher margin brands, including the ULTA Beauty Collection. We continued to carefully pull back on broad discounting, while placing more reliance on loyalty and our CRM tool kit. 
Moving on to SG&A expenses. We deleveraged by 20 basis points, primarily related to investments in headcount and consulting to support our growth initiatives. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventories were up 14.5% on a per-store basis, slightly below the comp rate. This growth was driven by investments in inventory to keep up with better-than-expected top line growth, new brand additions and the accelerated expansion of prestige boutiques. In-stock levels have improved year-over-year, but we still expect to make more progress going forward as we begin to reap the benefits of our new distribution centers and related systems. 
Capital expenditures were $54.3 million in the quarter, driven by new store openings, merchandise fixtures for the rollout of prestige brand boutiques and supply chain and system investments. 
We ended the quarter with $369 million in cash and short-term investments. 
We repurchased 158,000 shares at a cost of $27 million under our 10b5-1 plan. 
And as you know, we entered into a $200 million ASR agreement in March, which settled just last week. During the first quarter, we received 80% of the shares we expected to receive on settlement, or about 852,000 shares. 
The reduction in shares outstanding year-over-year contributed approximately $0.03 of earnings per share growth in the quarter. Including the entire $200 million paid as part of the ASR agreement, approximately $219 million remained available under the $425 million share repurchase program announced in March. 
Turning now to guidance for the second quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.041 billion to $1.058 billion compared to $877 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 11% to 13% versus 10.1% last year. Online sales growth is expected to be in the 40% range. We plan to open about 25 stores in Q2 compared to 20 stores during the same period last year. And preopening expense for the quarter is expected to be about $4.6 million. 
Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.32 to $1.37 versus $1.15 for Q2 of 2015.  Our supply chain investments, including new Dallas DC, are expected to weigh on margins the most in the second and third quarter. And we expect earnings per share growth to be higher in the fourth quarter this year.  We anticipate a tax rate of 37.6% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 63 million. 
In terms of our outlook for the full year 2016, we are raising our guidance for comparable sales and earnings per share growth to reflect the strong start to the year. Total company comps are now expected to be approximately 10% to 12% compared to our prior guidance of 8% to 10%. We now expect to grow earnings per share in the low 20s percentage range versus our prior guidance of 18% to 20% growth. Operating margins are now expected to leverage slightly. 
The other elements of our guidance for the year are unchanged. We are on track to open approximately 100 stores, all planned to be our [ph] 10,000 square foot prototype. We expect to open about 25 stores in Q2, 50 stores in Q3 and 15 stores in Q4. 
We're also planning 12 major remodels and 2 relocations. We plan to grow e-commerce approximately 40%. 
We expect CapEx to be about $390 million, driven by slightly higher capital per new store and the rollout of boutiques. 
As a reminder, we planned about $80 million for boutique expansion and updates, with over 500 Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques as well as updates to our fragrance fixtures and the ULTA Beauty Collection. 
We anticipate that share repurchase activity under our $425 million authorization will contribute about 2 percentage points of earnings per share growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to our conference call host for the Q&A session. Operator?"

And actually, when we get her email address, the ability to give her email, spark her imagination and curiosity about other products that maybe she didn't see in the store, seems to be driving.

So gross margin overall, we're not going to break down all the basis points, pluses and minuses here, puts and takes, but I could just directionally talk. And I know sometimes people, it may not be clear because this is kind of a multivariable equation that we're solving for here and also when we talk about promotions, right? So there's a couple of major buckets, I guess, I would call them. Merchant discounts, right? So what are we -- what are the offers in the magazines that we distribute or the tabs that we put into newspapers? Is it a 2-for-1? Is it a buy one, get one, 50% off? Is there a GWP with it, right? So that's one bucket. Then there's the marketing discount bucket, right, which is the coupon, right? $3.50 off $10, 20% off one item, 20% off the entire order kind of thing, right, with the postcard offer that we described in the past. And then there's the loyalty, right? So that would be the third leg of the stool. So again, we approach this very carefully, right, and we're testing and learning constantly. But if we look at the first quarter, for example, we talked about the mass area, right? So mass has been generating really healthy comps for us. We've kind of learned over the course of the last year that the merchandise discounts don't need to be as broad maybe as what we've done in the past. So this year, we kind of narrowed it down. Instead of 2 -- buy 2, get 1 across the whole brand, maybe it's just a narrower set of SKUs. So that would be one example of something that we executed very well in the first quarter, right? And then there's just another -- a set of other just what I'd call smart merchandising marketing decisions, continuing to tweak our coupon offers and the circulation that we have on our marketing offers, Ulta Beauty collection, private label, super high margin part of our business where they're especially strong in the first quarter this year. E-commerce, we called out again, product mix is being very helpful to us. So you got a lot of good things happening in the merch margin bucket, I would say. And then you layer on top of that a 15 comp, right? That helps a lot on the fixed store cost line. We called that out in our comments. And then we had some offset, some deleverage on supply chain, which was planned and which was expected. So that's kind of it, I guess, I'd say in a nutshell. On the explanation of the variation year-over-year, when we think about the comp breakout and the ticket bifurcation, units were pretty flat year-over-year, so most of it was on average selling price."

So it's really a combination of, I would say, everything we're doing. I mentioned at the top, I mean, it's great to be in a category that's growing and beauty, we believe, what we have is a very compelling proposition relative to a large segment of the market, right? So what we offer them is relevant. And as we look out into the future, the future consumer, millennials, I think even more so relevant. But then in addition, right, we had to be driving awareness and traffic. So I feel great about what I would call our demand creation tools, so we wouldn't have an increase in the numbers if we didn't have new people aware of and coming to ULTA, and the traffic shows that. And then, in addition, of course, it's about what we sell in the store and the service that we give and the services and the guest experience. So I talked a lot about the merchandise assortment. So I feel good about -- we're really doing business smartly with our brand partners. So I guess, in total, it's a lot of things coming together, I think, effectively for us to drive members into our loyalty program and have a relevant proposition to drive their growth. The second part you asked about was on -- yes, there's a lot obviously happening as it relates to wages and whatnot. In particular, the overtime pay thing that just passed, we are -- we've already factored that into our forecast. There's some attach to us this year, it's pretty immaterial, I would say. Those were managers that are typically paid above the threshold, and some of our comanagers are affected. And as we look out into future years, we'll continue to obviously be cognizant of factoring wage in the other pay factors."

And again, we -- the landlords, the relationships that we have are very strong. We know ULTA's being sought out as a tenant of choice, we're proven traffic drivers to centers.

I guess what I would say is that, yes, we have several urban, I guess, you'd call them, stores in the fleet. And they do fine. As we're thinking about the future, I wouldn't say we've ever had a concerted urban strategy, right? So we don't have a lot of them. Our main strategy has been really in suburbs and in power centers, in lifestyle centers. We've talked about -- we feel good about the 10,000 square foot store format and the ability to hit at least 1,200 at least of that format. But what I referenced at, we're also looking at what's the opportunity in smaller markets and then also what's the opportunity in places where the parcels of real estate will, by definition, be smaller, so whether it's urban centers or the downtown maybe shopping area of high-end suburbs, right? So all I -- we've got 2/3 with two 5,000 square foot stores right now that we're operating to learn about the dynamics of a different sized box. And they're doing well, they're also learning a lot about the best way to operate that. And as we look at refreshing our view of store growth, urban is a question we're asking ourselves and would look at. As you said, obviously, the economics are different. But as we drive brand awareness across the country with our marketing efforts, we know that we've -- wherever we go now, people know more about us than, I guess, they would have been in the past, right?

Good afternoon, everyone. 2016 is off to a phenomenal start with excellent top and bottom line growth in our first quarter. There are several factors coming together to drive the momentum in our business: healthy consumer demand in the beauty category; ULTA Beauty's unique and relevant format and positioning; and effective collaboration across the enterprise, which is driving strong execution of our growth strategy. 
To recap the first quarter results: We grew the top line 23.7% and delivered a 15.2% comp on top of an 11.4% comp in the first quarter of 2015. This is our best comp growth since 2006. Comp sales were driven primarily by traffic, while ticket also saw healthy increases. Ongoing strength in cosmetics, both mass and prestige, is the largest contributor to our growth, but other major categories are delivering robust comps as well. E-commerce continues to see rapid sales growth. The Salon's top line was solid even while we reduced the frequency of our promotions. So with overall revenue growth significantly better than planned, coupled with strong execution of our strategic imperatives, we delivered earnings per share growth of almost 40%, well above our expectations. 
I'd like to call out some more specific details on the primary contributors for our performance during the quarter. Growth in our loyalty program continues to fuel our business results. ULTAmate Rewards membership grew to 19.4 million active members, up 25% year-over-year. This continued acceleration of sign-ups reflects our store associates' efforts to convert new members and strong traffic driven in part by our advertising campaigns. 
The number of members shopping increased as well as their average sales per ticket -- per visit. Loyalty member retention has increased steadily each quarter and is up almost 200 basis points compared to last year. Using the loyalty program points as currency, our CRM team is working closely with our merchants and our brand partners to continue developing targeted and relevant campaigns that are increasingly resonating with our guests. 
Our marketing mix continues to evolve with great balance across television, radio, digital and social media as well as our traditional print vehicles. In March, we ran television and radio ads for our signature 21 Days of Beauty event. We complemented this with an aggressive online video campaign as well as extensions into online radio with Spotify and Pandora. 
We elevated our social media and influencer efforts anchored on our spring trends. We surrounded our consumer with current and relevant content online and in-store as well as activation at high-profile events, including the Coachella music festival. 
Our comprehensive campaign for Mother's Day, which was called Pamper Her with Pretty, was designed to build awareness of our brand, deepen our connection with our guests and provide a platform to make ULTA Beauty a top-of-mind destination for gift-giving, especially in fragrance. In addition to the return of the Mother's Day gift guide and fragrance finder, we offered more Gifts with Purchase and CRM promotions in conjunction with many exciting new fragrance launches. 
The Mother's Day activities also included a social media campaign with the launch of a special video entitled Mom, the Original Beauty Icon, which invited guests to celebrate mom by sharing what makes their own moms' beauty iconic through a post on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. This campaign was viewed over 4.5 million times. We believe all these marketing efforts contributed to our strong traffic growth during the quarter. 
Now to update you on merchandising. The trends from last year continued to drive the business, with Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Anastasia, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit and ULTA Beauty Collection among the best performing brands for the quarter. The pipeline of newness really continues to be quite compelling, translating into strong growth in both mass and prestige cosmetics. 
During the quarter, we launched Honest Beauty in 250 stores, rolled out our exclusive Fiona Stiles line in 500 stores and added Buxom Cosmetics to all doors. Anastasia Beverly Hills and Perricone launched new product lines. Clarins was rolled out to additional doors. We introduced Tarte's Double Duty Beauty collection, which is exclusive to ULTA Beauty. And we rolled out Dior mascara to all stores. 
More recently, we announced the addition of dpHUE hair care products, and we began to offer Nuxe, a French skincare brand, on our website. We also rolled out an assortment of the iconic Drybar hair products and tools in hundreds of stores. 
We are enhancing our ULTA Beauty Collection through a series of initiatives. We've been updating and elevating the formulas and packaging as well as the in-store graphics, while improving speed to market and on-trend products. Trend categories include contouring, strobing and multidimensional makeup. And we've also added an endcap featuring new spring kits. We've produced compelling training videos and enhanced our sampling programs. While we've made great progress, we're just getting started with our efforts to evolve ULTA Beauty Collection to continue to represent our brand personality. 
Turning to services. Our salon sales rose 14.7% and comped 7.7%, with strength in blowouts, hair treatments and makeup services. We view the services business as a growth opportunity, and we're very focused on our strategy to convert more of our loyalty members to discover our high-quality services offering. Our Benefit Brow Bar business continued its strong performance, with brow services now in 738 stores. And we're proud to perform more brow services than anyone else in the U.S. 
Moving on to stores. We opened 13 stores and closed 1 in the first quarter, well on our way to executing our 2016 program of 100 net new stores. We ended the quarter with 886 stores. New store productivity remains very strong, with all vintages of stores benefiting from the successful execution of our strategic imperatives. Our growth and development team is now in the process of performing a deep dive analysis to refresh our estimate of the store potential in the U.S. This analysis includes an updated assessment of the potential for smaller and urban markets as well as how our small store format will fit into the future store mix. Sharing the outcome of this work is expected to be one of the topics we plan to cover at our next Analyst Day this fall as well as other updates from our long-term strategic plan that we're now in the process of refreshing as well. 
Moving on to ulta.com. Our e-commerce growth was very strong, up 38.8% and contributing 130 basis points to our total company comp. The mix of professional hair care and prestige cosmetics continues to grow, helping our e-commerce margin rate. We're also adding brands and products that are available only online such as J.Cat Beauty, StriVectin Hair Care, Eyeko and ManCave among others. Our ulta.com guests remain very interested in our beauty bag sampling program and Beauty Break! limited time promotions. 
Mobile is growing rapidly, now representing more than 60% of site traffic. We released new versions of our iPhone and Android apps in the first quarter. The iPhone app was featured on the Apple Store home page. Moving up to a 5-star rating, this new version now includes features such as Apple Pay checkout, enhanced features displaying ULTAmate Rewards information and Gifts with Purchase details on product pages. Both app versions have been a big hit with users, garnering enthusiastic user reviews and an increase in downloads, now reaching well over 2 million between the 2. 
Finally, our supply chain and IT teams have done a great job managing the ramp-up of the Greenwood distribution center while preparing to open our new distribution center in Dallas, which began to accept inbound inventories just last week. The Greenwood DC is now serving about 200 stores and fulfilling roughly 40% of our e-commerce orders. We're on track to end the year delivering to approximately 240 stores from Greenwood. 
Our Dallas facility, a carbon copy of our Greenwood building, is right on track to begin outbound shipments in July as planned. We expect to ramp up this newest DC to serve 125 stores by holiday. As expected, the Greenwood distribution center and systems are producing efficiencies and cost per unit shipped. 
On the system side, we have good progress to report here as well. SWIFT, our forecasting replenishment tool, has been rolled out to additional categories including skincare and hair care, and the rest of categories will be implemented throughout the remainder of the year. I am particularly proud of the supply chain team and the IT teams' performance and deep collaborations, and they're balancing the execution of several major initiatives and projects while doing an excellent job improving in-stocks in our stores to support the higher-than-expected sales trends. 
So now I'll turn it over to Scott to discuss the drivers of our first quarter results and outlook for the second quarter and the year."

Starting with the income statement. Similar to previous quarters, our top line was driven by a very healthy 15.2% comp and strong new store productivity. The total company comp was composed of 11% transaction growth and 4.2% average ticket growth. The retail comp of 14.3% was made up of 10.5% traffic and 3.8% ticket. The Salon business comped 7.7%, and Salon growth was all ticket-based. E-commerce growth was almost entirely driven by traffic, with modest ticket growth. 
Gross profit increased 150 basis points. The improvement was driven by strong leverage on store rent and occupancy expenses as well as by healthy product margin expansion, offset by planned supply chain deleverage related to investments in new distribution centers and core merchandising systems. Strong product margin performance was driven in part by significant margin improvement in mass departments due to changes in our promotional offers and a mix of higher margin brands, including the ULTA Beauty Collection. We continued to carefully pull back on broad discounting, while placing more reliance on loyalty and our CRM tool kit. 
Moving on to SG&A expenses. We deleveraged by 20 basis points, primarily related to investments in headcount and consulting to support our growth initiatives. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventories were up 14.5% on a per-store basis, slightly below the comp rate. This growth was driven by investments in inventory to keep up with better-than-expected top line growth, new brand additions and the accelerated expansion of our prestige boutiques. In-stock levels have improved year-over-year, but we still expect to make more progress going forward as we begin to reap the benefits of our new distribution centers and related systems. 
Capital expenditures were $54.3 million in the quarter, driven by new store openings, merchandise fixtures for the rollout of prestige brand boutiques and supply chain and system investments. 
We ended the quarter with $369 million in cash and short-term investments. 
We repurchased 158,000 shares at a cost of $27 million under our 10b5-1 plan. 
And as you know, we entered into a $200 million ASR agreement in March, which settled just last week. During the first quarter, we received 80% of the shares we expected to receive on settlement, or about 852,000 shares. 
The reduction in shares outstanding year-over-year contributed approximately $0.03 of earnings per share growth in the quarter. Including the entire $200 million paid as part of the ASR agreement, approximately $219 million remained available under the $425 million share repurchase program announced in March. 
Turning now to guidance for the second quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.041 billion to $1.058 billion compared to $877 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 11% to 13% versus 10.1% last year. Online sales growth is expected to be in the 40% range. We plan to open about 25 stores in Q2 compared to 20 stores during the same period last year. And preopening expense for the quarter is expected to be about $4.6 million. 
Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.32 to $1.37 versus $1.15 for Q2 of 2015.  Our supply chain investments, including the new Dallas DC, are expected to weigh on margins the most in the second and third quarter. And we expect earnings per share growth to be higher in the fourth quarter this year.  We anticipate a tax rate of 37.6% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 63 million. 
In terms of our outlook for the full year 2016, we are raising our guidance for comparable sales and earnings per share growth to reflect the strong start to the year. Total company comps are now expected to be approximately 10% to 12% compared to our prior guidance of 8% to 10%. We now expect to grow earnings per share in the low 20s percentage range versus our prior guidance of 18% to 20% growth. Operating margins are now expected to leverage slightly. 
The other elements of our guidance for the year are unchanged. We are on track to open approximately 100 stores, all planned to be on our 10,000 square foot prototype. We expect to open about 25 stores in Q2, 50 stores in Q3 and 15 stores in Q4. We're also planning 12 major remodels and 2 relocations. We plan to grow e-commerce approximately 40%. 
We expect CapEx to be about $390 million, driven by slightly higher capital per new store and the rollout of boutiques. As a reminder, we planned about $80 million for boutique expansion and updates, with over 500 Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques as well as updates to our fragrance fixtures and the ULTA Beauty Collection. 
We anticipate that share repurchase activity under our $425 million authorization will contribute about 2 percentage points of earnings per share growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to our conference call host for the Q&A session. Operator?"

Really proud about our store teams being able to convert new traffic and new members into the store and into the program. How high is that? I mean, certainly, we ask ourselves that question as well. As we think about our kind of long-term view of the business, it's going to be obviously a very key driver for us as we move forward. And if you step way back and look at it, our share of the market in beauty in the U.S. is still only 3% or so of the total market, right? So we know there's a lot of growth ahead. And we're very focused on understanding kind of what it is about the loyalty program that drives the appeal and continue to make sure that we fine-tune it going forward. So we think there's more growth there certainly, and I think our results are showing that."

But that's a little bit lumpy, and it's kind of first half of the year kind of weighted, I would say. And then, we also have some store payroll implications related to the same boutique strategy, right? So I think we explained back in the fourth quarter that it takes a lot for those boutiques to ramp up, right? So they're being installed now and we got some payroll investment there in the early days, which again, over time moderates and plays very well at least from a profitability standpoint. So it's really the payroll piece of that and some of the depreciation that's related there that's causing it."

So the person who's shopping both in-store and online is driving 2.5x the sales than somebody who's only shopping in the store. So what that says to us is it's quite incremental. There's not like a lot of replenishment-type activity happening. We talked about this. We focus on this beauty enthusiast who's really focused on trend and newness. And actually, when we get her email address, the ability to give her email, spark her imagination and curiosity about other products that maybe she didn't see in the store, seems to be driving. Whether it's that or Beauty Breaks! or samples, they're really responding. So over time, we certainly see that expanding in terms of percentage of sales.

So gross margin overall, we're not going to break down all the basis points, pluses and minuses here, puts and takes, but I could just directionally talk. And I know sometimes people, it may not be clear because this is kind of a multivariable equation that we're solving for here and also when we talk about promotions, right? So there's a couple of major buckets, I guess, I would call them. Merchant discounts, right? So what are we -- what are the offers in the magazines that we distribute or the tabs that we put into newspapers? Is it a 2-for-1? Is it a buy one, get one 50% off? Is there a GWP with it, right? So that's one bucket. Then there's the marketing discount bucket, right, which is the coupon, right? $3.50 off $10, 20% off one item, 20% off the entire order kind of thing, right, with the postcard offer that we described in the past. And then there's the loyalty, right? So that would be the third leg of the stool. So again, we approach this very carefully, right, and we're testing and learning constantly. But if we look at the first quarter, for example, we talked about the mass area, right? So mass has been generating really healthy comps for us. We've kind of learned over the course of the last year that the merchandise discounts don't need to be as broad maybe as what we've done in the past. So this year, we kind of narrowed it down. Instead of 2 -- buy 2, get 1 across the whole brand, maybe it's just a narrower set of SKUs. So that would be one example of something that we executed very well in the first quarter, right? And then there's just another -- a set of other just what I'd call smart merchandising marketing decisions, continuing to tweak our coupon offers and the circulation that we have on our marketing offers, Ulta Beauty collection, private label, super high margin part of our business where they're especially strong in the first quarter this year. E-commerce, we called out again, product mix there is being very helpful to us. So you got a lot of good things happening in the merch margin bucket, I would say. And then you layer on top of that a 15 comp, right? That helps a lot on the fixed store cost line. We called that out in our comments. And then we had some offset, some deleverage on supply chain, which was planned and which was expected. So that's kind of it, I guess, I'd say in a nutshell. On the explanation of the variation year-over-year, when we think about the comp breakout and the ticket bifurcation, units were pretty flat year-over-year, so most of it was on average selling price."

I would say that there's some cost of doing business things that are in there. You guys read all these stories about credit card fraud and the whole EMV thing that all of retail is kind of struggling with. So we're not immune to that, right? We had some of that in the first quarter. Now lucky for us, our EMV rollout is complete now. So that -- we've mitigated that risk as we look out across the rest of the year. I would also say that we're -- like we've done in the past, we look to optimize the business, right? So there's some additional investments, I guess, I would call, in the short term around some test-and-learn things around levers, future levers to drive growth, that we think we can move up here and accelerate a little bit into 2016.

And then, in addition, of course, it's about what we sell in the store and the service that we give and the services and the guest experience. So I talked a lot about the merchandise assortment. So I feel good about -- we're really doing business smartly with our brand partners. So I guess, in total, it's a lot of things coming together, I think, effectively for us to drive members into our loyalty program and have a relevant proposition to drive their growth. The second part you asked about was on -- yes, there's a lot obviously happening as it relates to wages and whatnot. In particular, the overtime pay thing that just passed, we are -- we've already factored that into our forecast. There's some attach to us this year, it's pretty immaterial, I would say. Most of our managers are typically paid above the threshold, and some of our comanagers are affected. And as we look out into future years, we'll continue to obviously be cognizant of the factoring wage and other pay factors."

So we feel very confident about our current pace of 100 stores a year, right, that we talked about here as our medium-term target. We just came back, I guess, from ICSC here in the last day or so. And again, we -- the landlords, the relationships that we have are very strong. We know ULTA's being sought out as a tenant of choice, we're proven traffic drivers to centers. And the beauty category is something that many landlords -- that's a piece of the offering, retail offering, that they'd love to add to the mix overall."

I guess what I would say is that, yes, we have several urban, I guess, you'd call them, stores in the fleet. And they do fine. As we're thinking about the future, I wouldn't say we've ever had a concerted urban strategy, right? So we don't have a lot of them. Our main strategy has been really in suburbs and in power centers, in lifestyle centers. We've talked about -- we feel good about the 10,000 square foot store format and the ability to hit at least 1,200 at least of that format. But what I referenced at, we're also looking at what's the opportunity in smaller markets and then also what's the opportunity in places where the parcels of real estate would, by definition, be smaller, so whether it's urban centers or the downtown maybe shopping area of high-end suburbs, right? So all I -- we've got 2/3 with 2 5,000-square-foot stores right now that we're operating to learn about the dynamics of a different sized box. And they're doing well, they're also learning a lot about the best way to operate that. And as we look at refreshing our view of store growth, urban is a question we're asking ourselves and would look at. As you said, obviously, the economics are different. But as we drive brand awareness across the country with our marketing efforts, we know that we've -- wherever we go now, people know more about us than, I guess, they would have been in the past, right? So that's a good way, a place to start. So more to come on that."

Good afternoon, everyone. 2016 is off to a phenomenal start with excellent top and bottom line growth in our first quarter. There are several factors coming together to drive the momentum in our business: healthy consumer demand in the beauty category; ULTA Beauty's unique and relevant format and positioning; and effective collaboration across the enterprise, which is driving strong execution of our growth strategy. 
To recap the first quarter results: We grew the top line 23.7% and delivered a 15.2% comp on top of an 11.4% comp in the first quarter of 2015. This is our best comp growth since 2006. Comp sales were driven primarily by traffic, while ticket also saw healthy increases. Ongoing strength in cosmetics, both mass and prestige, is the largest contributor to our growth, but other major categories are delivering robust comps as well. E-commerce continues to see rapid sales growth. The Salon's top line was solid even while we reduced the frequency of our promotions. So with overall revenue growth significantly better than planned, coupled with strong execution of our strategic imperatives, we delivered earnings per share growth of almost 40%, well above our expectations. 
I'd like to call out some more specific details on the primary contributors for our performance during the quarter. Growth in our loyalty program continues to fuel our business results. ULTAmate Rewards membership grew to 19.4 million active members, up 25% year-over-year. This continued acceleration of sign-ups reflects our store associates' efforts to convert new members and strong traffic driven in part by our advertising campaigns. 
The number of members shopping increased as well as their average sales per ticket -- per visit. Loyalty member retention has increased steadily each quarter and is up almost 200 basis points compared to last year. Using the loyalty program points as currency, our CRM team is working closely with our merchants and our brand partners to continue developing targeted and relevant campaigns that are increasingly resonating with our guests. 
Our marketing mix continues to evolve with great balance across television, radio, digital and social media as well as our traditional print vehicles. In March, we ran television and radio ads for our signature 21 Days of Beauty event. We complemented this with an aggressive online video campaign as well as extensions into online radio with Spotify and Pandora. 
We elevated our social media and influencer efforts anchored on our spring trends. We surrounded our consumer with current and relevant content online and in-store as well as activation at high-profile events, including the Coachella music festival. 
Our comprehensive campaign for Mother's Day, which was called Pamper Her with Pretty, was designed to build awareness of our brand, deepen our connection with our guests and provide a platform to make ULTA Beauty a top-of-mind destination for gift-giving, especially in fragrance. In addition to the return of the Mother's Day gift guide and fragrance finder, we offered more Gifts with Purchase and CRM promotions in conjunction with many exciting new fragrance launches. 
The Mother's Day activities also included a social media campaign with the launch of a special video entitled Mom, the Original Beauty Icon, which invited guests to celebrate mom by sharing what makes their own moms' beauty iconic through a post on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. This campaign was viewed over 4.5 million times. We believe all these marketing efforts contributed to our strong traffic growth during the quarter. 
Now to update you on merchandising. The trends from last year continued to drive the business, with Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Anastasia, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit and ULTA Beauty Collection among the best performing brands for the quarter. The pipeline of newness really continues to be quite compelling, translating into strong growth in both mass and prestige cosmetics. 
During the quarter, we launched Honest Beauty in 250 stores, rolled out our exclusive Fiona Stiles line in 500 stores and added Buxom Cosmetics to all doors. Anastasia Beverly Hills and Perricone launched new product lines. Clarins was rolled out to additional doors. We introduced Tarte's Double Duty Beauty collection, which is exclusive to ULTA Beauty. And we rolled out Dior mascara to all stores. 
More recently, we announced the addition of dpHUE hair care products, and we began to offer Nuxe, a French skincare brand, on our website. We also rolled out an assortment of the iconic Drybar hair products and tools in hundreds of stores. 
We are enhancing our ULTA Beauty Collection through a series of initiatives. We've been updating and elevating the formulas and packaging as well as the in-store graphics, while improving speed to market and on-trend products. Trend categories include contouring, strobing and multidimensional makeup. And we've also added an endcap featuring new spring kits. We've produced compelling training videos and enhanced our sampling programs. While we've made great progress, we're just getting started with our efforts to evolve ULTA Beauty Collection to continue to represent our brand personality. 
Turning to services. Our salon sales rose 14.7% and comped 7.7%, with strength in blowouts, hair treatments and makeup services. We view the services business as a growth opportunity, and we're very focused on our strategy to convert more of our loyalty members to discover our high-quality services offering. Our Benefit Brow Bar business continued its strong performance, with brow services now in 738 stores. And we're proud to perform more brow services than anyone else in the U.S. 
Moving on to stores. We opened 13 stores and closed 1 in the first quarter, well on our way to executing our 2016 program of 100 net new stores. We ended the quarter with 886 stores. New store productivity remains very strong, with all vintages of stores benefiting from the successful execution of our strategic imperatives. Our growth and development team is now in the process of performing a deep dive analysis to refresh our estimate of the store potential in the U.S. This analysis includes an updated assessment of the potential for smaller and urban markets as well as how our small store format will fit into the future store mix. Sharing the outcome of this work is expected to be one of the topics we plan to cover at our next Analyst Day this fall as well as other updates from our long-term strategic plan that we're now in the process of refreshing as well. 
Moving on to ulta.com. Our e-commerce growth was very strong, up 38.8% and contributing 130 basis points to our total company comp. The mix of professional hair care and prestige cosmetics continues to grow, helping our e-commerce margin rate. We're also adding brands and products that are available only online such as J.Cat Beauty, StriVectin Hair Care, Eyeko and ManCave among others. Our ulta.com guests remain very interested in our beauty bag sampling program and Beauty Break! limited time promotions. 
Mobile is growing rapidly, now representing more than 60% of site traffic. We released new versions of our iPhone and Android apps in the first quarter. The iPhone app was featured on the Apple Store home page. Moving up to a 5-star rating, this new version now includes features such as Apple Pay checkout, enhanced features displaying ULTAmate Rewards information and Gifts with Purchase details on product pages. Both app versions have been a big hit with users, garnering enthusiastic user reviews and an increase in downloads, now reaching well over 2 million between the 2. 
Finally, our supply chain and IT teams have done a great job managing the ramp-up of the Greenwood distribution center while preparing to open our new distribution center in Dallas, which began to accept inbound inventories just last week. The Greenwood DC is now serving about 200 stores and fulfilling roughly 40% of our e-commerce orders. We're on track to end the year delivering to approximately 240 stores from Greenwood. 
Our Dallas facility, a carbon copy of our Greenwood building, is right on track to begin outbound shipments in July as planned. We expect to ramp up this newest DC to serve 125 stores by holiday. As expected, the Greenwood distribution center and systems are producing efficiencies and cost per unit shipped. 
On the system side, we have good progress to report here as well. SWIFT, our forecasting replenishment tool, has been rolled out to additional categories including skincare and hair care, and the rest of categories will be implemented throughout the remainder of the year. I am particularly proud of the supply chain team and the IT teams' performance and deep collaborations, and they're balancing the execution of several major initiatives and projects while doing an excellent job improving in-stocks in our stores to support the higher-than-expected sales trends. 
So now I'll turn it over to Scott to discuss the drivers of our first quarter results and outlook for the second quarter and the year."

Starting with the income statement. Similar to previous quarters, our top line was driven by a very healthy 15.2% comp and strong new store productivity. The total company comp was composed of 11% transaction growth and 4.2% average ticket growth. The retail comp of 14.3% was made up of 10.5% traffic and 3.8% ticket. The Salon business comped 7.7%, and Salon growth was all ticket-based. E-commerce growth was almost entirely driven by traffic, with modest ticket growth. 
Gross profit increased 150 basis points. The improvement was driven by strong leverage on store rent and occupancy expenses as well as by healthy product margin expansion, offset by planned supply chain deleverage related to investments in new distribution centers and core merchandising systems. Strong product margin performance was driven in part by significant margin improvement in mass departments due to changes in our promotional offers and a mix of higher margin brands, including the ULTA Beauty Collection. We continued to carefully pull back on broad discounting, while placing more reliance on loyalty and our CRM tool kit. 
Moving on to SG&A expenses. We deleveraged by 20 basis points, primarily related to investments in headcount and consulting to support our growth initiatives. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventories were up 14.5% on a per-store basis, slightly below the comp rate. This growth was driven by investments in inventory to keep up with better-than-expected top line growth, new brand additions and the accelerated expansion of our prestige boutiques. In-stock levels have improved year-over-year, but we still expect to make more progress going forward as we begin to reap the benefits of our new distribution centers and related systems. 
Capital expenditures were $54.3 million in the quarter, driven by new store openings, merchandise fixtures for the rollout of prestige brand boutiques and supply chain and system investments. 
We ended the quarter with $369 million in cash and short-term investments. 
We repurchased 158,000 shares at a cost of $27 million under our 10b5-1 plan. 
And as you know, we entered into a $200 million ASR agreement in March, which settled just last week. During the first quarter, we received 80% of the shares we expected to receive on settlement, or about 852,000 shares. 
The reduction in shares outstanding year-over-year contributed approximately $0.03 of earnings per share growth in the quarter. Including the entire $200 million paid as part of the ASR agreement, approximately $219 million remained available under the $425 million share repurchase program announced in March. 
Turning now to guidance for the second quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.041 billion to $1.058 billion compared to $877 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 11% to 13% versus 10.1% last year. Online sales growth is expected to be in the 40% range. We plan to open about 25 stores in Q2 compared to 20 stores during the same period last year. And preopening expense for the quarter is expected to be about $4.6 million. 
Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.32 to $1.37 versus $1.15 for Q2 of 2015.  Our supply chain investments, including the new Dallas DC, are expected to weigh on margins the most in the second and third quarter. And we expect earnings per share growth to be higher in the fourth quarter this year.  We anticipate a tax rate of 37.6% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 63 million. 
In terms of our outlook for the full year 2016, we are raising our guidance for comparable sales and earnings per share growth to reflect the strong start to the year. Total company comps are now expected to be approximately 10% to 12% compared to our prior guidance of 8% to 10%. We now expect to grow earnings per share in the low 20s percentage range versus our prior guidance of 18% to 20% growth. Operating margins are now expected to leverage slightly. 
The other elements of our guidance for the year are unchanged. We are on track to open approximately 100 stores, all planned to be on our 10,000 square foot prototype. We expect to open about 25 stores in Q2, 50 stores in Q3 and 15 stores in Q4. We're also planning 12 major remodels and 2 relocations. We plan to grow e-commerce approximately 40%. 
We expect CapEx to be about $390 million, driven by slightly higher capital per new store and the rollout of boutiques. As a reminder, we planned about $80 million for boutique expansion and updates, with over 500 Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques as well as updates to our fragrance fixtures and the ULTA Beauty Collection. 
We anticipate that share repurchase activity under our $425 million authorization will contribute about 2 percentage points of earnings per share growth. 
I'll now turn the call over to our conference call host for the Q&A session. Operator?"

Really proud about our store teams being able to convert new traffic and new members into the store and into the program. How high is that? I mean, certainly, we ask ourselves that question as well. As we think about our kind of long-term view of the business, it's going to be obviously a very key driver for us as we move forward. And if you step way back and look at it, our share of the market in beauty in the U.S. is still only 3% or so of the total market, right? So we know there's a lot of growth ahead. And we're very focused on understanding kind of what it is about the loyalty program that drives the appeal and continue to make sure that we fine-tune it going forward. So we think there's more growth there certainly, and I think our results are showing that."

But that's a little bit lumpy, and it's kind of first half of the year kind of weighted, I would say. And then, we also have some store payroll implications related to the same boutique strategy, right? So I think we explained back in the fourth quarter that it takes a lot for those boutiques to ramp up, right? So they're being installed now and we got some payroll investment there in the early days, which again, over time moderates and plays very well at least from a profitability standpoint. So it's really the payroll piece of that and some of the depreciation that's related there that's causing it."

There's not like a lot of replenishment-type activity happening. We talked about this. We focus on this beauty enthusiast who's really focused on trend and newness. And actually, when we get her email address, the ability to give her email, spark her imagination and curiosity about other products that maybe she didn't see in the store, seems to be driving. Whether it's that or Beauty Breaks! or samples, they're really responding. So over time, we certainly see that expanding in terms of percentage of sales.

So gross margin overall, we're not going to break down all the basis points, pluses and minuses here, puts and takes, but I could just directionally talk. And I know sometimes people, it may not be clear because this is kind of a multivariable equation that we're solving for here and also when we talk about promotions, right? So there's a couple of major buckets, I guess, I would call them. Merchant discounts, right? So what are we -- what are the offers in the magazines that we distribute or the tabs that we put into newspapers? Is it a 2-for-1? Is it a buy one, get one 50% off? Is there a GWP with it, right? So that's one bucket. Then there's the marketing discount bucket, right, which is the coupon, right? $3.50 off $10, 20% off one item, 20% off the entire order kind of thing, right, with the postcard offer that we described in the past. And then there's the loyalty, right? So that would be the third leg of the stool. So again, we approach this very carefully, right, and we're testing and learning constantly. But if we look at the first quarter, for example, we talked about the mass area, right? So mass has been generating really healthy comps for us. We've kind of learned over the course of the last year that the merchandise discounts don't need to be as broad maybe as what we've done in the past. So this year, we kind of narrowed it down. Instead of 2 -- buy 2, get 1 across the whole brand, maybe it's just a narrower set of SKUs. So that would be one example of something that we executed very well in the first quarter, right? And then there's just another -- a set of other just what I'd call smart merchandising marketing decisions, continuing to tweak our coupon offers and the circulation that we have on our marketing offers, Ulta Beauty collection, private label, super high margin part of our business where they're especially strong in the first quarter this year. E-commerce, we called out again, product mix there is being very helpful to us. So you got a lot of good things happening in the merch margin bucket, I would say. And then you layer on top of that a 15 comp, right? That helps a lot on the fixed store cost line. We called that out in our comments. And then we had some offset, some deleverage on supply chain, which was planned and which was expected. So that's kind of it, I guess, I'd say in a nutshell. On the explanation of the variation year-over-year, when we think about the comp breakout and the ticket bifurcation, units were pretty flat year-over-year, so most of it was on average selling price."

I would say that there's some cost of doing business things that are in there. You guys read all these stories about credit card fraud and the whole EMV thing that all of retail is kind of struggling with. So we're not immune to that, right? We had some of that in the first quarter. Now lucky for us, our EMV rollout is complete now. So that -- we've mitigated that risk as we look out across the rest of the year. I would also say that we're -- like we've done in the past, we look to optimize the business, right? So there's some additional investments, I guess, I would call, in the short term around some test-and-learn things around levers, future levers to drive growth, that we think we can move up here and accelerate a little bit into 2016.

That whole idea for us that our guest could be really resonating with this is the more success with us with loyalty program, right, the more benefit she gets by consolidating her spend at ULTA.

So it's really a combination of, I would say, everything we're doing. I mentioned at the top, I mean, it's great to be in a category that's growing and beauty, we believe, what we have is a very compelling proposition relative to a large segment of the market, right? So what we offer them is relevant. And as we look out into the future, the future consumer, millennials, I think even more so relevant. But then in addition, right, we have to be driving awareness and traffic. So I feel great about what I would call our demand creation tools, so we wouldn't have an increase in the numbers if we didn't have new people aware of and coming to ULTA, and the traffic shows that.

As we're thinking about the future, I wouldn't say we've ever had a concerted urban strategy, right? So we don't have a lot of them. Our main strategy has been really in suburbs and in power centers, in lifestyle centers. We've talked about -- we feel good about the 10,000 square foot store format and the ability to hit at least 1,200 at least of that format. But what I referenced at, we're also looking at what's the opportunity in smaller markets and then also what's the opportunity in places where the parcels of real estate would, by definition, be smaller, so whether it's urban centers or the downtown maybe shopping area of high-end suburbs, right? So all I -- we've got 2/3 with 2 5,000-square-foot stores right now that we're operating to learn about the dynamics of a different sized box. And they're doing well, they're also learning a lot about the best way to operate that. And as we look at refreshing our view of store growth, urban is a question we're asking ourselves and would look at. As you said, obviously, the economics are different. But as we drive brand awareness across the country with our marketing efforts, we know that we've -- wherever we go now, people know more about us than, I guess, they would have been in the past, right?

Our team achieved another quarter of excellent top and bottom line performance while making significant progress in many elements of our growth strategy. Highlights of the quarter includes the continued impact of a strong pipeline of newness and innovation in merchandising, progress in growing our brand awareness, reaching major milestones related to our loyalty program, continued rapid growth in our e-commerce business and successful execution of our supply chain investments. 
To summarize our second quarter financial performance. Total company sales grew 21.9%, and comp sales rose 14.4% on top of 10.1% comps in the second quarter of 2015, driven by healthy gains in both transaction count and average ticket. Strength in cosmetics, both mass and prestige, continues to be the biggest driver of our growth while our other major categories are contributing as well. E-commerce performance was very strong, and The Salon business achieved solid top line growth. We deliver earnings per share growth of 24.3% despite significant investments in the business, including the opening of our new distribution center in Dallas, implementing core merchandising systems and rolling out a large number of prestige brand boutiques and related store remodels.
Let me cover some of the highlights driving our performance in the second quarter. Starting with our efforts to acquire new customers, our loyalty program surpassed the 20 million member mark and now boasts 20.6 million active members, growing more than 27% year-over-year on a rolling 12-month basis. We believe our evolving marketing strategy with a growing focus on multimedia advertising and digital marketing is working to raise our profile in consumer awareness and to better define our brand. Once people discover Ulta Beauty, our store associates continue to do a fantastic job signing them up for ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program. Retention rate, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average member ticket remain very strong.
We're also very excited to launch our new ULTAmate Rewards credit card program chain-wide just a few weeks ago. We now offer members an Ulta Beauty private label credit card, which can be used in any of our stores and in ulta.com, and we offer cobranded credit card, which can be used wherever MasterCard is accepted. Our team has been working diligently on this project for more than a year, designing a program we know our members will love, upgrading our POS systems, preparing our store associates and developing our robust marketing program. It's a great example of enterprisewide collaboration across multiple areas of the business. The credit card is designed to enhance our ULTAmate Rewards program by offering greater benefits to our members, which we believe will drive increased engagement and loyalty.
While we don't expect this new program to have a material impact on our results in the short term, early indications are quite positive, and we believe this will create tremendous value for our guests and our company over the long term.
Our marketing mix continues to evolve with increased use of television, radio, digital and social media and less reliance on traditional print vehicles. During the second quarter, we executed a successful gorgeous hair event supported by national radio and digital campaigns. Reflecting our 2016 focus on the live category, we continued our live halfway campaign and launched the hashtag this is how I live digital campaign with native content integration, influencers, dedicated e-mails, video and banners with mass reach beauty sites like Refinery 29 and Pop Sugar.
Now turning to merchandising. Newness and innovation continues to drive the business. We're seeing ongoing strength in both mass and prestige cosmetics with impressive growth in Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Anastasia, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit, Maybelline, Real Techniques and ULTA Beauty Collection. The professional hair care category was also strong anchored by great execution of the signature Ulta Beauty promotion, our leader event featuring compelling prices on jumbo sizes of salon hair care brands.
New items contributed significantly to the overall comp. Noteworthy additions included Urban Decay's new assortment of 100 shades of lipstick, the introduction of Anastasia color cosmetics, the launch of Soap & Glory cosmetics, hundreds of new SKUs from NYX and innovation in the narrow category with gel culture featuring up to 14 days durability. We added several new limited distribution version brands including Shiseido, Gillette, Dry Bar, Moisture and Barada. We also expanded Clarins skincare to additional stores and rolled out Cosmetics to almost entire chain. The ULTA Beauty Collection continued its rapid growth with new products and an upgraded presentation, which includes an all-new layout and improved graphics. While also improving the shopping experience with our chain-wide tester program for the ULTA Beauty Collection as well as NYX within the mass cosmetics assortment. We're very pleased with the strong execution of a large number of Clinique and Lancome boutique installations in our plan this year and excited to introduce these prestige brands to our guests. We'll continue to enhance the assortment with a strong pipeline of brands for the rest of the year and many more brands in the wings for 2017. Also, we recently launched the iconic Estée Lauder brand on our website and will roll it out to 30 stores in September with a broad expansion plan for next spring.
[indiscernible] our services business, Salon sales rose 14.3% and comps 8% with strength in hair color, hair treatment and makeup services. We saw strong responses to [indiscernible] campaigns drive services and continue to develop additional strategies to drive new customer acquisition over the long term. One example were testing enhancements to our online booking software and expect to roll up a new platform this fall. The new booking tool make it much easier for our guests to select a service and schedule appointment online where and when it's convenient for her. Also, our salon stylists were excited to experience our fall winter training programs developed by our lead artistic team featuring a glamping team, which is designed to integrate an on-trend hair and makeup look like Ron's hair color, blend of coppery red and brown and natural darling makeup, which is a fresh take on no-makeup makeup. We also introduced the first time we featured men men's haircare colors service. Our Benefit brow bar business continued its strong performance with brow services in 785 [ph] stores at the end of the quarter with more than 500 of these offerings brow tinting as well. We also enhanced benefits product offerings during the quarter with the addition of 36 new innovative brow products, which are merchandised in the boutiques as well as on custom pictures in our stores.
Turning to new store growth. We opened up 24 stores and closed 3 stores in the second quarter. One closure was the Chicago State Street location, and the other 2 were relocations. We're on track to complete our 2016 program of 100 net new stores and ended the quarter with 907 stores. New store productivity continues to be excellent with new stores performing well above their budgets and their IRR targets. In addition to the new store program, our growth and development team is very focused on ensuring high-quality execution of our prestige boutique rollout, and we completed a large number of the more than 500 Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques plans for this year. We're taking advantage of this boutique expansion activity to further a fresh our Starfleet with improvements of fragrance, nail and ULTA Beauty Collection fixtures. And looking ahead, we've already approved 100 stores for next year's real estate program. 
Now moving on to ulta.com, our e-commerce growth was very strong, up 54.9% and contributing 180 basis points to our total company. Site traffic accounted for almost all of the growth as we continue to invest in digital marketing. E-commerce margins improved in part due to the more efficient fulfillment cost from orders delivered from our new Greenwood distribution center. Similar to our performance and stores, the fastest-growing categories were prestige and mass cosmetics. Professional hair care was also a standout as this category ramps up online following the addition of many brands previously sold in-store only last year. Our signature leader event featuring jumbo sizes of hair care products at compelling prices was very successful online during the quarter. To highlight our authority in hair care, we also conducted our first ever live beauty chat with expert salon stylists. These numbers of our elite Ulta Beauty artistic team answer guest questions on hair products, tools and tips.
Turning to assortment newness, we launched Shiseido skincare products in the west side ahead of our limited in-store launch. Continuing on our efforts to increase our portfolio of online brands, we introduced ELF, a popular value-priced cosmetics brand at the end of the quarter. This new brand features many new products exclusive to Ulta Beauty in this assortment and got off to a very strong start in the website. We continue to improve the guest experience at ulta.com with more content for the beauty enthusiasts. And recently, we launched a new feature called Ulta Beauty mix with tips, articles and how-tos. The content is shoppable, and we view this as our first significant step towards merging content and commerce. In addition, we made several technical enhancements to the website, including a search engine optimization URL rewrite. We also released updates for our iPhones, Android and iPad apps, including support for ULTAmate Rewards credit card applications and account management and improved loyalty program sign-up process, a new gift card purchase capability and Apple Pay expedited checkout.
Turning to supply chain and systems, I'm very pleased to report that our new Dallas DC opened up on time in early July and is currently fulfilling more than 90 stores and about 30% of our e-commerce volume. The Dallas DC is expected to ramp up a bit faster than Greenwood with plans to service more than 130 stores and 25,000 e-commerce orders per day by the end of the holiday period. Similar to the benefits received from the Greenwood DC, the advantages of the Dallas operating model includes fewer, fuller and more stable retail curtains, increased categorization and improved labeling and enhancements for e-commerce orders. The Greenwood, Indiana DC now just over a year old is serving about 220 stores and fulfilling almost 40% of our e-commerce orders. We still plan to end the year delivering to approximately 240 stores from Greenwood.
On the system side, SWIFT, our new forecasting and replenishment tool, has now been rolled out to all product categories. The space and core planning and assortment optimization tool went live a few weeks ago, and our teams are starting to use to plan for holiday and next year store planogram. The space planning system will be fully integrated with SWIFT, and these processes will be integrated with our new data system, which will the work and, thus, reduce the time needed to create store plans and our increasingly complex thoughts. So needless to say, I'm proud of our teams have executed across these initiatives while supporting strong growth.
Before turning over to Scott, I'd like to preview our upcoming investor conference in Chicago on October 13. I'm very excited to update you on our long-term growth strategies and looking forward to giving a deep understanding of drivers of our business, the future growth opportunities we're prioritizing and also to give you insight into the talent and capabilities across our leadership team. You hear about our view of category consumer trends that support our confidence in growth in the beauty category. We'll show how we plan to continue to elevate awareness and clarity of Ulta Beauty as a retail brand. We'll provide an update in our loyalty program and how we're using data in new ways to drive greater share of wallet of our alternate ultimate rewards members. We'll discuss the pipeline of new brands with a plan to add to our assortment and provide new insight about our products and services offering. We'll describe our supply chain systems investments position us to drive cost efficiencies and higher service levels. We'll discuss the multi-facet real estate analysis we've just completed that gives us confidence in many more years of store growth ahead, confirming square footage growth is a key part of our strategy to double our market share in the next several years. We'll detail the margin drivers that give us great confidence in achieving our mid-teens operating margin target by 2019 and show you more confidence in achieving the long-term earnings growth targets we set as part of the strategic plan that we shared back in 2014 even on a much bigger base of business that we forecasted in the initial plan.
So now I'll turn it over to Scott to give you more details about our second quarter results and our outlook for the third quarter and the year."

And once, again our top line was driven by a very healthy 14.4% comp and strong new store productivity. The to",954,"Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Net sales for the second quarter increased 21.9% to $1.07 billion. And once, again our top line was driven by a very healthy 14.4% comp and strong new store productivity. The total company comp was composed of 9.7% transaction growth and 4.7% average ticket growth. The retail comp was 12.9% was made up of 8.9% traffic and 4% ticket. The Salon business comped 8% with all of the increase, driven by ticket growth similar to trends earlier in the year. E-commerce growth of 54.9% was driven almost entirely by increased traffic with ticket growth up low-single digits. 
Gross profit increased 110 basis points. The improvement was driven by leverage store rent and occupancy expenses as well as by healthy product margin expansion, partially offset by plant supply chain investments and our new distribution centers. E-commerce margins also improved with strength in the high-margin professional hair care segment. 
Moving on to SG&A expense. We deleveraged by 110 basis points, driven by additional headcount to support our growth initiatives as well as an unexpected charge related to a store closure. We recently closed our multilevel Statestreet store in Chicago. The store was temporarily closed back in May due to disruption from a construction in an adjacent building. The extensive damages of the store and the extraordinary amount of time and expense required to reopen the store resulted in our decision to permanently close the location, necessitating a significant impairment charge This charge represented about 1/3 of the SG&A deleverage in the quarter. We reassigned our impacted associates to nearby alternate stores and have assisted guests to minimize any disruption in their shopping experience. We are currently evaluating nearby relocation opportunities and expect to get a replacement store up and running soon. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventories were up 18.7% on a per store basis, a bit higher than expected, reflecting the opening of our new distribution center in Dallas. Excluding the impact of the inventory for the new DC, inventories were up 14.5% on a per store basis, in line with our comp. We continue to invest in inventory, given better-than-expected top line growth, new brand additions and the step-up expansion of prestige boutiques. Going forward, we're expecting to see total inventory per door growth more in line with comp growth by the end of the year and anticipate that the efficiencies from our supply chain investments, including new DCs and merchandise planning tools, will become more evident in our financial results starting in 2017.
Capital expenditures were $95.3 million in the quarter, driven by new store openings, fixtures for the rollout of prestige brand boutiques and supply chain investments. We ended the quarter with $304.1 million in cash and short-term investments.
In terms of share buybacks, year-to-date, including our ASR, which settled in the second quarter and activity under our 10b5-1 plans, we have repurchased 1.27 million shares at an average price of approximately $199 per share. At the end of the quarter, approximately 193 million remained under the $425 million share repurchase authorization.
Turning now to guidance for the third quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.070 billion to $1.090 billion compared to $911 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 11% to 13% versus 12.8% last year. Online sales growth is expected to be in the 40% range.
We plan to open about 40 stores in Q3 compared to 45 stores during the same period last year, and preopening expense for the quarter is expected to be about $7.6 million.
Earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.30 versus $1.11 for Q3 of 2015. We anticipate a tax rate of 37.6% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 63 million.
Our supply chain investments, particularly the ramp-up of our new Dallas DC on top of the Greenwood building still only fulfilling about half its plant capacity will continue to weigh in margins the rest of the year. We expect to see the largest impact in the third quarter with deleveraging of P&L reflecting the high watermark of our supply chain investments. We anticipate stronger earnings growth in the fourth quarter on higher sales volumes.
In light of the strength in the business in the first half of the year, we are raising our guidance for the full year 2016. We now expect comparable sales to be in the range of 11% to 13% for the full year versus prior guidance of 10% to 12%. We now expect to grow earnings per share in the low to mid-20s percentage range versus our prior guidance of low 20s percentage growth. We continue to expect our share repurchase activity under our $425 million authorization will contribute about 2 percentage points of earnings per share growth this year.
The other elements of our earlier guidance are unchanged. We're on track to open approximately 100 net new stores all planned to be our 10,000 square foot prototype. We expect to open about 40 stores in Q3 and 25 stores in Q4. We are also executing 12 major remodels and 2 relocations. We plan to grow e-commerce approximately 40%.
CapEx is on target to be about $390 [ph] million, driven by slightly higher capital per new store and the rollout of boutiques. As a reminder, we planned about $80 million for the boutique expansion and updates with the rollout of over 500 Clinique, la and Benefit boutiques underway as well as updates to our fragrance fixtures and the ULTA Beauty Collection.

Again, I don't want to be reconciling basis points quarter-to-quarter, but if it's kind of in the general ZIP Code, I should say, what we saw in the third quarter last year. And our net-net, I think for the third quarter, gross profit is kind of flattish year-over-year when you add up all the puts and takes because we are still going to get a sizable fixed cost benefit leverage benefit in the quarter we're going to continue to expand merchandise margins like we have earlier in the year and so that will kind of cover up some of the I guess, I would say from the deleveraging supply chain. I don't think most of the models include how SG&A deleverage in the third quarter. It's much more significant than what most people are thinking. It's really a combination of the boutiques, the high watermark in the boutiques and the remodel programs and all the other things we have in process to drive growth for the business. So again, it doesn't matter sequencing and quarters. A lot of it ends up in the third quarter this year. We've got some consulting timing that we've moved from early in the year to the back half to help us for the future as well to help us frame up growth drivers that help us next year and beyond. And then there's another store impairment charge coming in the third quarter. That was just a very recent development as part of the heavy flooding down in Louisiana. So that's another roughly a $0.02 charge that was unexpected that we have to record in the third quarter. So that's really the combination of things. When I think about the rest of the year, then moving on to the fourth quarter, again, supply chain we start get some benefits there. So we expect to get leverage overall on some of those supply chain investments. SG&A then we get back to a normal cadence. The heavier sales volume in the fourth quarter. The upfront cost in some of those boutiques are behind us now, and we get leverage SG&A in the fourth quarter. So that's how we kind of end up full year then with slight leverage coming from gross profit and slight deleverage on the SG&A line that gives us an all-in slight leverage for the year the operating margin."

35929,379751954,1039266,"ULTA Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Ulta Beauty, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon.

Our team achieved another quarter of excellent top and bottom line performance while making significant progress in many elements of our growth strategy. Highlights of the quarter include the continued impact of a strong pipeline of newness and innovation in merchandising, progress in growing our brand awareness, reaching major milestones related to our loyalty program, continued rapid growth in our e-commerce business and successful execution of our supply chain investment.
To summarize our second quarter financial performance. Total company sales grew 21.9%, and comp sales rose 14.4% on top of 10.1% comps in the second quarter of 2015, driven by healthy gains in both transaction count and average ticket. Strength in cosmetics, both mass and prestige, continues to be the biggest driver of our growth, while our other major categories are contributing as well.  E-commerce performance was very strong, and The Salon business achieved solid top line growth. 
We deliver earnings per share growth of 24.3% despite significant investments in the business, including the opening of our new distribution center in Dallas, implementing core merchandising systems and rolling out a large number of prestige brand boutiques and related store remodel.
Let me cover some of the highlights driving our performance in the second quarter. Starting with our efforts to acquire new customers, our loyalty program surpassed the 20 million member mark and now boasts 20.6 million active members, growing more than 27% year-over-year on a rolling 12-month basis. We believe our evolving marketing strategy with a growing focus on multimedia advertising and digital marketing is working to raise our profile in consumer awareness and to better define our brand. Once people discover Ulta Beauty, our store associates continue to do a fantastic job signing them up for ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program. Retention rate, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average member ticket remain very strong.
We're also very excited to launch our new ULTAmate Rewards credit card program chain-wide just a few weeks ago. We now offer members an Ulta Beauty private label credit card, which can be used in any of our stores and at ulta.com, and we offer a co-branded credit card, which can be used wherever MasterCard is accepted. 
Our team has been working diligently on this project for more than a year, designing a program we know our members will love, upgrading our POS systems, preparing our store associates and developing our robust marketing program. It's a great example of enterprise-wide collaboration across multiple areas of the business. 
The credit card is designed to enhance our ULTAmate Rewards program by offering greater benefits to our members, which we believe will drive increased engagement and loyalty. While we don't expect this new program to have a material impact on our results in the short term, early indications are quite positive, and we believe this will create tremendous value for our guests and our company over the long term.
Our marketing mix continues to evolve with increased use of television, radio, digital and social media and less reliance on traditional print vehicles. During the second quarter, we executed a successful Gorgeous Hair event supported by national radio and digital campaigns. Reflecting our 2016 focus on the lip category, we continued our Lip Happily campaign and launched the #ThisIsHowILip  digital campaign with native content integration, influencers, dedicated e-mails, video and banners with mass-reach beauty sites like [indiscernible],  Refinery29 and POPSUGAR.
Now turning to merchandising. Newness and innovation continues to drive the business. We're seeing ongoing strength in both mass and prestige cosmetics, with impressive growth in Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Anastasia, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit, Maybelline, Real Techniques and the ULTA Beauty Collection. The professional hair care category was also strong, anchored by great execution of the signature Ulta Beauty promotion, our leader event featuring compelling prices on jumbo sizes of salon hair care brands.
New items contributed significantly to the overall comp. Noteworthy additions included Urban Decay's new assortment of 100 shades of Vice Lipstick, the introduction of Anastasia color cosmetics, the launch of Soap & Glory cosmetics, hundreds of new SKUs from NYX and innovation in the now category with Essie's Gel Couture nail polish featuring up to 14 days durability. We added several new limited-distribution brands including Shiseido, e.l.f., Gillette, Drybar, Maui Moisture and Vita Liberata. We also sent Clarins skincare to additional stores and rolled out BECCA Cosmetics to almost the entire chain. 
The ULTA Beauty Collection continued its rapid growth with new products and an upgraded presentation, which includes a new wall layout and improved graphics. We're also improving the shopping experience with our chain-wide tester program for the ULTA Beauty Collection as well as mix within the mass cosmetics assortment. 
We're very pleased with the strong execution of a large number of Clinique and Lancôme boutique installations that are planned this year, and the stores are excited to introduce these prestige brands to our guests. We'll continue to enhance the overall assortment with a strong pipeline of brands for the rest of the year and many more brands in the wings for 2017. Also, we recently launched the iconic Estée Lauder brand on our website and will roll it out to 30 stores in September with a broad expansion plan for next spring.
           
To update you on our services business, our Salon sales rose 14.3% and comps 8% with strength in hair color, hair treatment and makeup services. We saw strong responses to year-round campaigns to drive services and continue to develop additional strategies to drive new customer acquisition over the long term. One example, we're testing enhancements to our online booking software and expect to roll out the new platform this fall. The new booking tool will make it much easier for our guest to select her service and schedule her appointment online, where and when it's convenient for her. 
Also, our salon stylists were excited to experience our fall/winter training programs developed by our lead artistic team featuring a glamping theme, which is designed to integrate on-trend hair and makeup looks like ronze hair color, a blend of coppery red and brown; and natural darling makeup, which is a fresh take on no-makeup makeup. We also introduced Bro Lab [ph], the first time we feature a men's haircare color service. 
Our Benefit Brow Bar business continued its strong performance with brow services in 785 stores at the end of the quarter, with more than 500 of these offering brow tinting as well. We also enhanced Benefit's product offerings during the quarter with the addition of 36 new innovative brow products, which are merchandised in the boutiques as well as on custom pictures in our stores.
Turning to new store growth. We opened up 24 stores and closed 3 stores in the second quarter. One closure was the Chicago State Street location, and the other 2 were relocation. We're on track to complete our 2016 program of 100 net new stores and ended the quarter with 907 stores. New store productivity continues to be excellent with new stores performing well above their budgets and their IRR targets. 
In addition to the new store program, our growth and development team is very focused on ensuring high-quality execution of our prestige boutique rollout, and we completed a large number of the more than 500 Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques planned for this year. We're taking advantage of this boutique expansion activity to further refresh our store fleet with improvements to fragrance, nail and ULTA Beauty Collection fixtures. And looking ahead, we've already approved 100 stores for next year's real estate program. 
Now moving on to ulta.com. Our e-commerce growth was very strong, up 54.9% and contributing 180 basis points to our total company comp. Site traffic accounted for almost all of the growth as we continue to invest in digital marketing. 
E-commerce margins improved in part due to the more efficient fulfillment cost from orders delivered from our new Greenwood distribution center. Similar to our performance in stores, the fastest-growing categories were prestige and mass cosmetics. 
Professional hair care was also a standout as this category ramps up online following the addition of many brands previously sold in-store only last year. Our signature leader event, featuring jumbo sizes of hair care products at compelling prices, was very successful online during the quarter. 
To highlight our authority in hair care, we also conducted our first ever live beauty chat with expert salon stylists. These members of our elite Ulta Beauty artistic team answered guest questions on hair products, tools and tips.
Turning to assortment newness. We launched Shiseido skincare products in the website ahead of our limited in-store launch. Continuing on our efforts to increase our portfolio of online brands, we introduced e.l.f., a popular value-priced cosmetics brand, at the end of the quarter. This new brand features many new products exclusive to Ulta Beauty in the assortment and got off to a very strong start in the website. 
We continue to improve the guest experience at ulta.com with more content for the beauty enthusiasts. And recently, we launched a new feature called Ulta Beauty Mix with tips, articles and how-tos. The content is shoppable, and we view this as our first significant step towards merging content and commerce. 
In addition, we've made several technical enhancements to the website, including a search engine optimization URL rewrite. We also released updates for our iPhones, Android and iPad apps, including support for ULTAmate Rewards credit card applications and account management and improved loyalty program sign-up process, a new gift card purchase capability and Apple Pay expedited checkout.
Turning to supply chain and systems, I'm very pleased to report that our new Dallas DC opened up on time in early July and is currently fulfilling more than 90 stores and about 30% of our e-commerce volume. The Dallas DC is expected to ramp up a bit faster than Greenwood, with plans to service more than 130 stores and 25,000 e-commerce orders per day by the end of the holiday period. 
Similar to the benefits we see from the Greenwood DC, the advantages of the Dallas operating model includes fewer, fuller and more stable retail cartons, increased categorization and improved labeling and enhancements for e-commerce orders. The Greenwood, Indiana DC, now just over a year old, is serving about 220 stores and fulfilling almost 40% of our e-commerce orders. We still plan to end the year delivering to approximately 240 stores from Greenwood.
On the system side, SWIFT, our new forecasting and replenishment tool, has now been rolled out to all product categories. The space and floor planning and assortment optimization tool went live a few weeks ago, and our teams are starting to use the new system to plan for holiday and next year's store planogram. The space planning system will be fully integrated with SWIFT, and these processes will be integrated with our new master data system, which will automate the work and thus reduce the time needed to create floor plans at our increasingly complex thoughts. 
So needless to say, I'm extremely proud of how our teams have executed across these initiatives while supporting strong growth.
Before turning over to Scott, I'd like to preview our upcoming investor conference in Chicago on October 13. I'm very excited to update you on our long-term growth strategies and looking forward to giving you a deeper understanding of the drivers of our business, the future growth opportunities we're prioritizing and also to give you insight into the talent and capabilities across our leadership team. 
You'll hear about our view of category and consumer trends that support our confidence in growth in the beauty category. We'll show how we plan to continue to elevate awareness and clarity about Ulta Beauty as a retail brand. We'll provide an update on our loyalty program and how we're using data in new ways to drive greater share of wallet of our ULTAmate Rewards members. We'll discuss the pipeline of new brands we plan to add to our assortment and provide new insight about our products and services offering. We'll describe how our supply chain and systems investments position us to drive cost efficiencies and higher service levels. We'll discuss the multi-facet real estate analysis we've just completed that gives us confidence in many more years of store growth ahead, confirming square footage growth as a key part of our strategy to double our market share in the next several years. We'll detail the margin drivers that give us great confidence in achieving our mid-teens operating margin target by 2019 and show you why we're confident in achieving the long-term earnings growth targets we set as part of the strategic plan that we shared back in 2014, even on a much bigger base of business than we forecasted in the initial plan.
So now I'll turn it over to Scott to give us more details about our second quarter results and our outlook for the third quarter and the year."

Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Net sales for the second quarter increased 21.9% to $1.07 billion. And once again, our top line was driven by a very healthy 14.4% comp and strong new store productivity. The to",956,"Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Net sales for the second quarter increased 21.9% to $1.07 billion. And once again, our top line was driven by a very healthy 14.4% comp and strong new store productivity. The total company comp was composed of 9.7% transaction growth and 4.7% average ticket growth. The retail comp of 12.9% was made up of 8.9% traffic and 4% ticket. The Salon business comped 8%, with all of the increase, driven by ticket growth similar to trends earlier in the year. E-commerce growth of 54.9% was driven almost entirely by increased traffic with ticket growth up low-single digits. 
Gross profit increased 110 basis points. The improvement was driven by a leverage of store rent and occupancy expenses as well as by healthy product margin expansion, partially offset by planned supply chain investments in our new distribution centers. E-commerce margins also improved with strength in the high-margin professional hair care segment. 
Moving on to SG&A expense. We deleveraged by 110 basis points, driven by additional headcount to support our growth initiatives as well as an unexpected charge related to a store closure. We recently closed our multilevel State Street store in Chicago. The store was temporarily closed back in May due to disruption from a construction in an adjacent building. The extensive damages to the store and the extraordinary amount of time and expense required to reopen the store resulted in our decision to permanently close the location, necessitating a significant impairment charge. 
This charge represented about 1/3 of the SG&A deleverage in the quarter. 
We reassigned our impacted associates to nearby alternate stores and have assisted guests to minimize any disruption in their shopping experience. We are currently evaluating nearby relocation opportunities and expect to get our replacement store up and running soon. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventories were up 18.7% on a per store basis, a bit higher than expected, reflecting the opening of our new distribution center in Dallas. Excluding the impact of the inventory for the new DC, inventories were up 14.5% on a per store basis, in line with our comp. We continue to invest in inventory, given better-than-expected top line growth, new brand additions and the step-up expansion of prestige boutiques. Going forward, we're expecting to see total inventory per door growth more in line with comp growth by the end of the year and anticipate that the efficiencies from our supply chain investments, including new DCs and merchandise planning tools, will become more evident in our financial results starting in 2017.
Capital expenditures were $95.3 million in the quarter, driven by new store openings, fixtures for the rollout of prestige brand boutiques and supply chain investments. We ended the quarter with $304.1 million in cash and short-term investments.
In terms of share buybacks, year-to-date, including our ASR, which settled in the second quarter and activity under our 10b5-1 plans, we have repurchased 1.27 million shares at an average price of approximately $199 per share. At the end of the quarter, approximately 193 million remained under the $425 million share repurchase authorization.
Turning now to guidance for the third quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.070 billion to $1.090 billion compared to $911 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 11% to 13% versus 12.8% last year. Online sales growth is expected to be in the 40% range.
We plan to open about 40 stores in Q3 compared to 45 stores during the same period last year, and preopening expense for the quarter is expected to be about $7.6 million.
Earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.30 versus $1.11 for Q3 of 2015. We anticipate a tax rate of 37.6% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 63 million.
Our supply chain investments, particularly the ramp-up of our new Dallas DC on top of the Greenwood building still only fulfilling about half its plant capacity, will continue to weigh in margins the rest of the year. We expect to see the largest impact in the third quarter with deleveraging of P&L reflecting the high watermark of our supply chain investments. We anticipate stronger earnings growth in the fourth quarter on higher sales volumes.
In light of the strength in the business in the first half of the year, we are raising our guidance for the full year 2016. We now expect comparable sales to be in the range of 11% to 13% for the full year versus prior guidance of 10% to 12%. We now expect to grow earnings per share in the low to mid-20s percentage range versus our prior guidance of low 20s percentage growth. We continue to expect our share repurchase activity under our $425 million authorization will contribute about 2 percentage points of earnings per share growth this year.
The other elements of our earlier guidance are unchanged. We're on track to open approximately 100 net new stores, all planned to be our 10,000 square foot prototype. We expect to open about 40 stores in Q3 and 25 stores in Q4. We are also executing 12 major remodels and 2 relocations. We plan to grow e-commerce approximately 40%.
CapEx is on target to be about $390 million, driven by slightly higher capital per new store and the rollout of boutiques. As a reminder, we planned about $80 million for the boutique expansion and update, with the rollout of over 500 Clinique Lancôme and Benefit boutiques underway as well as updates to our fragrance fixtures and the ULTA Beauty Collection.

On the -- I guess I would just step back and say we compete, as you know, with a lot of players, both bricks and mortar as well as online, but really nobody brings together everything that we do at one place. And so I don't think so much about head-to-head competition at any one place even though we certainly look very closely at the competitive environment. So our online offerings now represent everything we have in the store and more, pretty much everything we have in store plus more. We're starting to expand that. Our guests enjoy the online experience. We're improving the shipping time frame every day. And certainly, as she participates in buying products online at Ulta Beauty, she gets points, and that's the whole loyalty program she loves, because the more she buys from us, the more she gets points that then she can redeem anywhere in the store. So certainly, we compete with Amazon in some ways in beauty. I would say we offer a great selection that our guests love. But of course, as you know, we also have exceptional bricks-and-mortar physical experience that our guests love. And really, the beauty enthusiasts that Dave described love to go in person and buy beauty and experience beauty and, of course, get our services. So I look at them as part of the mosaic of, competition and I think our proposition for our guests is really superior in total. In terms of margin and e-commerce, that's getting stronger. I mean, a big reason behind the investments that we've done in our distribution centers is to really improve the efficiency and effectiveness of that part of our business, and that's happening. I'd say the guest is happier with the speed of delivery, and certainly, the margins are improving."

Net-net, I think, for the third quarter, gross profit is kind of flattish year-over-year when you add up all the puts and takes because we are still going to get a sizable fixed store cost leverage benefit in the quarter, we're going to continue to expand merchandise margins like we have earlier in the year, and so that will kind of cover up some of the hurt, I guess, I would say, from the deleverage with the supply chain. I don't think most of the models include now the SG&A deleverage in the third quarter. It's much more significant than what most people are thinking. It's really a combination of the boutiques, the high watermark on the boutiques and the remodel programss and all the other things we have in process to drive growth for the business. So again, it's just a matter sequencing quarters, right? A lot of it ends up in the third quarter this year. We've got some consulting timing that we've moved from earlier in the year to the back half to help us plan for the future as well to help us frame out growth drivers that will help us next year and beyond. And then, there's another store impairment charge coming in the third quarter. That was just a fairly recent development as part of the heavy flooding down at Louisiana. So that's another roughly a $0.02 charge that was unexpected that we have to record in the third quarter. So that's really the combination of things. When I think about the rest of the year then, moving on to the fourth quarter, again, supply chain, we start get some benefits there, so we expect to get leverage overall on some of those supply chain investments. SG&A then, we get back into a normal cadence. The heavier sales volume in the fourth quarter. The upfront cost in some of those boutiques are behind us now, and we get leveraged SG&A in the fourth quarter. So that's kind of how we end up full year then, with slight leverage coming from gross profit and slight deleverage on the SG&A line that gives us an all-in slight leverage for the year in operating margin."

And as that becomes bigger perhaps in the future, we're always looking at that to see if there's a way we can make it even easier for her. But what she seems to be responding to is the breadth of innovation and newness.

And what she's tending to buy is in response to things that we're bringing to her attention via email, so it's usually products or exclusives or new trends.

So all those things, we feel, given frankly the fact that we only have a 5% share of this really enthusiastic beauty shopper provides us plenty of runway for growth. So we'll talk more about this. We certainly have done a lot of work and analysis and feel confident that we can drive market share growth, frankly, both through comp store growth as well as new stores."

Our team achieved another quarter of excellent top and bottom line performance while making significant progress in many elements of our growth strategy.

Our team achieved another quarter of excellent top and bottom line performance while making significant progress in many elements of our growth strategy. Highlights of the quarter include the continued impact of a strong pipeline of newness and innovation in merchandising, progress in growing our brand awareness, reaching major milestones related to our loyalty program, continued rapid growth in our e-commerce business and successful execution of our supply chain investments.
To summarize our second quarter financial performance. Total company sales grew 21.9%, and comp sales rose 14.4% on top of 10.1% comps in the second quarter of 2015, driven by healthy gains in both transaction count and average ticket. Strength in cosmetics, both mass and prestige, continues to be the biggest driver of our growth, while our other major categories are contributing as well. E-commerce performance was very strong, and The Salon business achieved solid top line growth. 
We deliver earnings per share growth of 24.3% despite significant investments in the business, including the opening of our new distribution center in Dallas, implementing core merchandising systems and rolling out a large number of prestige brand boutiques and related store remodels.
Let me cover some of the highlights driving our performance in the second quarter. Starting with our efforts to acquire new customers, our loyalty program surpassed the 20 million member mark and now boasts 20.6 million active members, growing more than 27% year-over-year on a rolling 12-month basis. We believe our evolving marketing strategy with a growing focus on multimedia advertising and digital marketing is working to raise our profile in consumer awareness and to better define our brands. Once people discover Ulta Beauty, our store associates continue to do a fantastic job signing them up for ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program. Retention rate, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average member ticket remain very strong.
We're also very excited to launch our new ULTAmate Rewards credit card program chain-wide just a few weeks ago. We now offer members an Ulta Beauty private label credit card, which can be used in any of our stores and at ulta.com, and we offer a co-branded credit card, which can be used wherever MasterCard is accepted. 
Our team has been working diligently on this project for more than a year, designing a program we know our members will love, upgrading our POS systems, preparing our store associates and developing our robust marketing program. It's a great example of enterprise-wide collaboration across multiple areas of the business. 
The credit card is designed to enhance our ULTAmate Rewards program by offering greater benefits to our members, which we believe will drive increased engagement and loyalty. While we don't expect this new program to have a material impact on our results in the short term, early indications are quite positive, and we believe this will create tremendous value for our guests and our company over the long term.
Our marketing mix continues to evolve with increased use of television, radio, digital and social media and less reliance on traditional print vehicles. During the second quarter, we executed a successful Gorgeous Hair event supported by national radio and digital campaigns. Reflecting our 2016 focus on the lip category, we continued our Lip Happily campaign and launched the #ThisIsHowILip digital campaign with native content integration, influencers, dedicated e-mails, video and banners with mass-reach beauty sites like Viva La, Refinery29 and POPSUGAR.
Now turning to merchandising. Newness and innovation continues to drive the business. We're seeing ongoing strength in both mass and prestige cosmetics, with impressive growth in Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Anastasia, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit, Maybelline, Real Techniques and the ULTA Beauty Collection. The professional hair care category was also strong, anchored by great execution of the signature Ulta Beauty promotion, our leader event featuring compelling prices on jumbo sizes of salon hair care brands.
New items contributed significantly to the overall comp. Noteworthy additions included Urban Decay's new assortment of 100 shades of Vice Lipstick, the introduction of Anastasia color cosmetics, the launch of Soap & Glory cosmetics, hundreds of new SKUs from NYX and innovation in the nail category with Essie's Gel Couture nail polish featuring up to 14 days durability. We added several new limited-distribution brands including Shiseido, e.l.f., Gillette, Drybar, Maui Moisture and Vita Liberata. We also expanded Clarins skincare to additional stores and rolled out BECCA Cosmetics to almost the entire chain. 
The ULTA Beauty Collection continued its rapid growth with new products and an upgraded presentation, which includes a new wall layout and improved graphics. We're also improving the shopping experience with our chain-wide tester program for the ULTA Beauty Collection as well as mix within the mass cosmetics assortment. 
We're very pleased with the strong execution of a large number of Clinique and Lancôme boutique installations that are planned this year, and the stores are excited to introduce these prestige brands to our guests. We'll continue to enhance the overall assortment with a strong pipeline of brands for the rest of the year and many more brands in the wings for 2017. Also, we recently launched the iconic Estée Lauder brand on our website and will roll it out to 30 stores in September with a broad expansion plan for next spring.
 
To update you on our services business, our Salon sales rose 14.3% and comps 8% with strength in hair color, hair treatments and makeup services. We saw strong responses to year-round [ph] campaigns to drive services and continue to develop additional strategies to drive new customer acquisition over the long term. One example, we're testing enhancements to our online booking software and expect to roll out the new platform this fall. The new booking tool will make it much easier for our guest to select her service and schedule her appointment online, where and when it's convenient for her. 
Also, our salon stylists were excited to experience our fall/winter training programs developed by our lead artistic team featuring a glamping theme, which is designed to integrate on-trend hair and makeup looks like ronze hair color, a blend of coppery red and brown; and natural darling makeup, which is a fresh take on no-makeup makeup. We also introduced BroLiage [ph], the first time we featured a men's haircare color service. 
Our Benefit Brow Bar business continued its strong performance with brow services in 785 stores at the end of the quarter, with more than 500 of these offering brow tinting as well. We also enhanced Benefit's product offerings during the quarter with the addition of 36 new innovative brow products, which are merchandised in the boutiques as well as on custom pictures in our stores.
Turning to new store growth. We opened up 24 stores and closed 3 stores in the second quarter. One closure was the Chicago State Street location, and the other 2 were relocations. We're on track to complete our 2016 program of 100 net new stores and ended the quarter with 907 stores. New store productivity continues to be excellent with new stores performing well above their budgets and their IRR targets. 
In addition to the new store program, our growth and development team is very focused on ensuring high-quality execution of our prestige boutique rollout, and we completed a large number of the more than 500 Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques planned for this year. We're taking advantage of this boutique expansion activity to further refresh our store fleet with improvements to fragrance, nail and ULTA Beauty Collection fixtures. And looking ahead, we've already approved 100 stores for next year's real estate program. 
Now moving on to ulta.com. Our e-commerce growth was very strong, up 54.9% and contributing 180 basis points to our total company comp. Site traffic accounted for almost all of the growth as we continue to invest in digital marketing. 
E-commerce margins improved in part due to the more efficient fulfillment costs from orders delivered from our new Greenwood distribution center. Similar to our performance in stores, the fastest-growing categories were prestige and mass cosmetics. 
Professional hair care was also a standout as this category ramps up online following the addition of many brands previously sold in-store only last year. Our signature leader event, featuring jumbo sizes of hair care products at compelling prices, was very successful online during the quarter. 
To highlight our authority in hair care, we also conducted our first ever live beauty chat with expert salon stylists. These members of our elite Ulta Beauty artistic team answered guest questions on hair products, tools and tips.
Turning to assortment newness. We launched Shiseido skincare products in the website ahead of our limited in-store launch. Continuing on our efforts to increase our portfolio of online brands, we introduced e.l.f., a popular value-priced cosmetics brand, at the end of the quarter. This new brand features many new products exclusive to Ulta Beauty in the assortment and got off to a very strong start in the website. 
We continue to improve the guest experience at ulta.com with more content for the beauty enthusiasts. And recently, we launched a new feature called Ulta Beauty Mix with tips, articles and how-tos. The content is shoppable, and we view this as our first significant step towards merging content and commerce. 
In addition, we've made several technical enhancements to the website, including a search engine optimization URL rewrite. We also released updates for our iPhone, Android and iPad apps, including support for ULTA Reward credit card applications and account management and improved loyalty program sign-up process, a new gift card purchase capability and Apple Pay expedited checkout.
Turning to supply chain and systems, I'm very pleased to report that our new Dallas DC opened up on time in early July and is currently fulfilling more than 90 stores and about 30% of our e-commerce volume. The Dallas DC is expected to ramp up a bit faster than Greenwood, with plans to service more than 130 stores and 25,000 e-commerce orders per day by the end of the holiday period. 
Similar to the benefits we're seeing from the Greenwood DC, the advantages of the Dallas operating model includes fewer, fuller and more stable retail cartons, increased categorization and improved labeling and enhancements for e-commerce orders. The Greenwood, Indiana DC, now just over a year old, is serving about 220 stores and fulfilling almost 40% of our e-commerce orders. We still plan to end the year delivering to approximately 240 stores from Greenwood.
On the system side, SWIFT, our new forecasting and replenishment tool, has now been rolled out to all product categories. The space and floor planning and assortment optimization tool went live a few weeks ago, and our teams are starting to use the new system to plan for holiday and next year's store planogram. The space planning system will be fully integrated with SWIFT, and these processes will be integrated with our new master data system, which will automate the work and thus reduce the time needed to create floor plans at our increasingly complex spots. 
So needless to say, I'm extremely proud of how our teams have executed across these initiatives while supporting strong growth.
Before turning over to Scott, I'd like to preview our upcoming investor conference in Chicago on October 13. I'm very excited to update you on our long-term growth strategies and looking forward to giving you a deeper understanding of the drivers of our business, the future growth opportunities we're prioritizing and also to give you insight into the talents and capabilities across our leadership team. 
You'll hear about our view of category and consumer trends that support our confidence in growth in the beauty category. We'll show how we plan to continue to elevate awareness and clarity about Ulta Beauty as a retail brand. We'll provide an update on our loyalty program and how we're using data in new ways to drive greater share of wallet of our ULTAmate Rewards members. We'll discuss the pipeline of new brands we plan to add to our assortment and provide new insight about our products and services offering. We'll describe how our supply chain and systems investments position us to drive cost efficiencies and higher service levels. We'll discuss the multi-faceted real estate analysis we've just completed that gives us confidence in many more years of store growth ahead, confirming square footage growth as a key part of our strategy to double our market share in the next several years. We'll detail the margin drivers that give us great confidence in achieving our mid-teens operating margin target by 2019 and show you why we're confident in achieving the long-term earnings growth targets we set as part of the strategic plan that we shared back in 2014, even on a much bigger base of business than we forecasted in the initial plan.
So now I'll turn it over to Scott to give us more details about our second quarter results and our outlook for the third quarter and the year."
35929,379751954,1039338,"ULTA Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Ulta Beauty, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Net sales for the second quarter increased 21.9% to $1.07 billion. And once again, our top line was driven by a very healthy 14.4% comp and strong new store productivity. The to",956,"Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Net sales for the second quarter increased 21.9% to $1.07 billion. And once again, our top line was driven by a very healthy 14.4% comp and strong new store productivity. The total company comp was composed of 9.7% transaction growth and 4.7% average ticket growth. The retail comp of 12.9% was made up of 8.9% traffic and 4% ticket. The Salon business comped 8%, with all of the increase, driven by ticket growth similar to trends earlier in the year. E-commerce growth of 54.9% was driven almost entirely by increased traffic with ticket growth up low-single digits. 
Gross profit increased 110 basis points. The improvement was driven by a leverage of store rent and occupancy expenses as well as by healthy product margin expansion, partially offset by planned supply chain investments in our new distribution centers. E-commerce margins also improved with strength in the high-margin professional hair care segment. 
Moving on to SG&A expense. We deleveraged by 110 basis points, driven by additional headcount to support our growth initiatives as well as an unexpected charge related to a store closure. We recently closed our multilevel State Street store in Chicago. The store was temporarily closed back in May due to disruption from a construction in an adjacent building. The extensive damages to the store and the extraordinary amount of time and expense required to reopen the store resulted in our decision to permanently close the location, necessitating a significant impairment charge. 
This charge represented about 1/3 of the SG&A deleverage in the quarter. 
We reassigned our impacted associates to nearby alternate stores and have assisted guests to minimize any disruption in their shopping experience. We are currently evaluating nearby relocation opportunities and expect to get a replacement store up and running soon. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventories were up 18.7% on a per store basis, a bit higher than expected, reflecting the opening of our new distribution center in Dallas. Excluding the impact of the inventory for the new DC, inventories were up 14.5% on a per store basis, in line with our comp. We continue to invest in inventory, given better-than-expected top line growth, new brand additions and the step-up expansion of prestige boutiques. Going forward, we're expecting to see total inventory per door growth more in line with comp growth by the end of the year and anticipate that the efficiencies from our supply chain investments, including new DCs and merchandise planning tools, will become more evident in our financial results starting in 2017.
Capital expenditures were $95.3 million in the quarter, driven by new store openings, fixtures for the rollout of prestige brand boutiques and supply chain investments. We ended the quarter with $304.1 million in cash and short-term investments.
In terms of share buybacks, year-to-date, including our ASR, which settled in the second quarter and activity under our 10b5-1 plans, we have repurchased 1.27 million shares at an average price of approximately $199 per share. At the end of the quarter, approximately 193 million remained under the $425 million share repurchase authorization.
Turning now to guidance for the third quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.072 billion to $1.090 billion compared to $911 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 11% to 13% versus 12.8% last year. Online sales growth is expected to be in the 40% range.
We plan to open about 40 stores in Q3 compared to 45 stores during the same period last year, and preopening expense for the quarter is expected to be about $7.6 million.
Earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.30 versus $1.11 for Q3 of 2015. We anticipate a tax rate of 37.6% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 63 million.
Our supply chain investments, particularly the ramp-up of our new Dallas DC on top of the Greenwood building still only fulfilling about half its plant capacity, will continue to weigh on margins the rest of the year. We expect to see the largest impact in the third quarter with deleveraging of P&L reflecting the high watermark of our supply chain investments. We anticipate stronger earnings growth in the fourth quarter on higher sales volumes.
In light of the strength in the business in the first half of the year, we are raising our guidance for the full year 2016. We now expect comparable sales to be in the range of 11% to 13% for the full year versus prior guidance of 10% to 12%. We now expect to grow earnings per share in the low to mid-20s percentage range versus our prior guidance of low 20s percentage growth. We continue to expect that share repurchase activity under our $425 million authorization will contribute about 2 percentage points of earnings per share growth this year.
The other elements of our full-year guidance are unchanged. We're on track to open approximately 100 net new stores, all planned to be our 10,000 square foot prototype. We expect to open about 40 stores in Q3 and 25 stores in Q4. We are also executing 12 major remodels and 2 relocations. We plan to grow e-commerce approximately 40%.
CapEx is on target to be about $390 million, driven by slightly higher capital per new store and the rollout of boutiques. As a reminder, we've planned about $80 million for the boutique expansion and updates, with the rollout of over 500 Clinique Lancôme and Benefit boutiques underway as well as updates to our fragrance fixtures and the ULTA Beauty Collection.

On the -- I guess I would just step back and say we compete, as you know, with a lot of players, both bricks and mortar as well as online, but really nobody brings together everything that we do at one place. And so I don't think so much about head-to-head competition at any one place even though we certainly look very closely at the competitive environment. So our online offerings now represent everything we have in the store and more, pretty much everything we have in store plus more. We're starting to expand that. Our guests enjoy the online experience. We're improving the shipping time frame every day. And certainly, as she participates in buying products online at Ulta Beauty, she gets points, and that's the whole loyalty program she loves, because the more she buys from us, the more she gets points that then she can redeem anywhere in the store. So certainly, we compete with Amazon in some ways in beauty. I would say we offer a great selection that our guests love. But of course, as you know, we also have exceptional bricks-and-mortar physical experience that our guests love. And really, the beauty enthusiasts that Dave described love to go in person and buy beauty and experience beauty and, of course, get our services. So I look at them as part of the mosaic of competition and I think our proposition for our guests is really superior in total. In terms of margin on e-commerce, that's getting stronger. I mean, a big reason behind the investments that we've done in our distribution centers is to really improve the efficiency and effectiveness of that part of our business, and that's happening. I'd say the guest is happier with the speed of delivery, and certainly, the margins are improving."

Again, I don't want to be reconciling basis points quarter-to-quarter, but it's kind of in the general ZIP code, I would say, to what you saw in third quarter last year. Net-net, I think, for the third quarter, gross profit is kind of flattish year-over-year when you add up all the puts and takes because we are still going to get a sizable fixed store cost leverage benefit in the quarter, we're going to continue to expand merchandise margins like we have earlier in the year, and so that will kind of cover up some of the hurt, I guess, I would say, from the deleverage from supply chain. What I don't think most of the models include now is the SG&A deleverage in the third quarter. It's much more significant than what most people are thinking. It's really a combination of the boutiques, the high watermark on the boutiques and the remodel programs and all the other things we have in process to drive growth for the business. So again, it's just a matter sequencing the quarters, right? A lot of it ends up in the third quarter this year. We've got some consulting timing that we've moved from earlier in the year to the back half to help us plan for the future as well, to help us frame out growth drivers that will help us next year and beyond. And then, there's another store impairment charge coming in the third quarter. That was just a fairly recent development as part of the heavy flooding down in Louisiana. So that's another roughly a $0.02 charge that was unexpected that we have to record in the third quarter. So that's really the combination of things. When I think about the rest of the year then, moving on to the fourth quarter, again, supply chain, we start get some benefits there, so we expect to get leverage overall on some of those supply chain investments. SG&A then, we get back into our normal cadence. The heavier sales volume in the fourth quarter. The upfront cost from some of those boutiques are behind us now, and we get leveraged SG&A in the fourth quarter. So that's kind of how we end up full year then, with slight leverage coming from gross profit and slight deleverage on the SG&A line that gives us an all-in slight leverage for the year in operating margin."

But we want to make sure that we're really focused on understanding how her needs are evolving, and we're bringing innovation across all elements, both mass and prestige. We've had a lot of innovation, great, exciting innovation in fragrance. We've got Sarah Jessica Parker's fragrance coming out on Sunday. I think it's good to be great. So a lot of innovation continued in fragrance. Skin care is an area that has had its ups and downs, but we see growth and potential within that. And then, certainly, haircare and connected to our salon, it's a big and very important part of our business, the styling part, liquids, shampoos, conditioners, tools, our professional tools area -- personal tools areas, so we'll continue to innovate across all parts of the store and optimize our assortment as we go forward."

There might be a couple of items that she's quite attached to, but I'll tell you, for the most part, our guests are really coming in and loving to try new products. She loves trends, she loves newness, she loves great, new products that are launched by our brand partners. So what we're finding is that very little of the business is one-for-one replenishment. And as that becomes bigger perhaps in the future, we're always looking at that to see if there's a way we can make it even easier for her. But what she seems to be responding to is the breadth of innovation and newness. And if you look at, for example, our e-commerce guests, the guests who shop online and in-store, again, some of our best guests, they spend significantly more than someone who's not buying online. And what she's tending to buy is in response to things that we're bringing to her attention via email, so it's usually new products or exclusives or new trends. Again, I don't have anything against replenishment, but I love the fact that we're replenishing our products a lot, but the one-for-one piece is something that is not a big part of the business."

As we look at consumer trends going forward, and Dave touched on this, but younger women, millennials, Hispanic women, fastest-growing segment of our population, there's a propensity, we think, for the beauty category for all those folks to continue to play a very important role in her overall spend of her money and how she spends her time. So that's all good. And the great thing is that innovation comes from companies large and small, it's probably the most exciting consumer category, I think, that exists because innovation comes from many different sources, and we positioned ourselves to hopefully be a great partner for brands to do business with and we offer this variety of products, categories and price points. So I think that also helps to sort of insulate us as the subcategories go up and down, and Dave talked a little bit about those categories.

We've added some new brands into that space, Fizz & Bubble, Soap & Glory among others, and we've got some great business.

Our team achieved another quarter of excellent top and bottom line performance while making significant progress in many elements of our growth strategy.

Our team achieved another quarter of excellent top and bottom line performance while making significant progress in many elements of our growth strategy. Highlights of the quarter include the continued impact of a strong pipeline of newness and innovation in merchandising, progress in growing our brand awareness, reaching major milestones related to our loyalty program, continued rapid growth in our e-commerce business and successful execution of our supply chain investments.
To summarize our second quarter financial performance. Total company sales grew 21.9%, and comp sales rose 14.4% on top of 10.1% comps in the second quarter of 2015, driven by healthy gains in both transaction count and average ticket. Strength in cosmetics, both mass and prestige, continues to be the biggest driver of our growth, while our other major categories are contributing as well. E-commerce performance was very strong, and The Salon business achieved solid top line growth. 
We deliver earnings per share growth of 24.3% despite significant investments in the business, including the opening of our new distribution center in Dallas, implementing core merchandising systems and rolling out a large number of prestige brand boutiques and related store remodels.
Let me cover some of the highlights driving our performance in the second quarter. Starting with our efforts to acquire new customers, our loyalty program surpassed the 20 million member mark and now boasts 20.6 million active members, growing more than 27% year-over-year on a rolling 12-month basis. We believe our evolving marketing strategy with a growing focus on multimedia advertising and digital marketing is working to raise our profile in consumer awareness and to better define our brands. Once people discover Ulta Beauty, our store associates continue to do a fantastic job signing them up for ULTAmate Rewards loyalty program. Retention rate, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average member ticket remain very strong.
We're also very excited to launch our new ULTAmate Rewards credit card program chain-wide just a few weeks ago. We now offer members an Ulta Beauty private label credit card, which can be used in any of our stores and at ulta.com, and we offer a co-branded credit card, which can be used wherever MasterCard is accepted. 
Our team has been working diligently on this project for more than a year, designing a program we know our members will love, upgrading our POS systems, preparing our store associates and developing our robust marketing program. It's a great example of enterprise-wide collaboration across multiple areas of the business. 
The credit card is designed to enhance our ULTAmate Rewards program by offering greater benefits to our members, which we believe will drive increased engagement and loyalty. While we don't expect this new program to have a material impact on our results in the short term, early indications are quite positive, and we believe this will create tremendous value for our guests and our company over the long term.
Our marketing mix continues to evolve with increased use of television, radio, digital and social media and less reliance on traditional print vehicles. During the second quarter, we executed a successful Gorgeous Hair event supported by national radio and digital campaigns. Reflecting our 2016 focus on the lip category, we continued our Lip Happily campaign and launched the #ThisIsHowILip digital campaign with native content integration, influencers, dedicated e-mails, video and banners with mass-reach beauty sites like Viva La, Refinery29 and POPSUGAR.
Now turning to merchandising. Newness and innovation continues to drive the business. We're seeing ongoing strength in both mass and prestige cosmetics, with impressive growth in Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Anastasia, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit, Maybelline, Real Techniques and the ULTA Beauty Collection. The professional hair care category was also strong, anchored by great execution of the signature Ulta Beauty promotion, our leader event featuring compelling prices on jumbo sizes of salon hair care brands.
New items contributed significantly to the overall comp. Noteworthy additions included Urban Decay's new assortment of 100 shades of Vice Lipstick, the introduction of Anastasia color cosmetics, the launch of Soap & Glory cosmetics, hundreds of new SKUs from NYX and innovation in the nail category with Essie's Gel Couture nail polish featuring up to 14 days durability. We added several new limited-distribution brands including Shiseido, e.l.f., Gillette, Drybar, Maui Moisture and Vita Liberata. We also expanded Clarins skincare to additional stores and rolled out BECCA Cosmetics to almost the entire chain. 
The ULTA Beauty Collection continued its rapid growth with new products and an upgraded presentation, which includes a new wall layout and improved graphics. We're also improving the shopping experience with our chain-wide tester program for the ULTA Beauty Collection as well as mix within the mass cosmetics assortment. 
We're very pleased with the strong execution of a large number of Clinique and Lancôme boutique installations that are planned this year, and the stores are excited to introduce these prestige brands to our guests. We'll continue to enhance the overall assortment with a strong pipeline of brands for the rest of the year and many more brands in the wings for 2017. Also, we recently launched the iconic Estée Lauder brand on our website and will roll it out to 30 stores in September with a broad expansion plan for next spring.
 
To update you on our services business, our Salon sales rose 14.3% and comps 8% with strength in hair color, hair treatments and makeup services. We saw strong responses to year-round [ph] campaigns to drive services and continue to develop additional strategies to drive new customer acquisition over the long term. One example, we're testing enhancements to our online booking software and expect to roll out the new platform this fall. The new booking tool will make it much easier for our guest to select her service and schedule her appointment online, where and when it's convenient for her. 
Also, our salon stylists were excited to experience our fall/winter training programs developed by our lead artistic team featuring a glamping theme, which is designed to integrate on-trend hair and makeup looks like ronze hair color, a blend of coppery red and brown; and natural darling makeup, which is a fresh take on no-makeup makeup. We also introduced BroLiage [ph], the first time we featured a men's haircare color service. 
Our Benefit Brow Bar business continued its strong performance with brow services in 785 stores at the end of the quarter, with more than 500 of these offering brow tinting as well. We also enhanced Benefit's product offerings during the quarter with the addition of 36 new innovative brow products, which are merchandised in the boutiques as well as on custom pictures in our stores.
Turning to new store growth. We opened up 24 stores and closed 3 stores in the second quarter. One closure was the Chicago State Street location, and the other 2 were relocations. We're on track to complete our 2016 program of 100 net new stores and ended the quarter with 907 stores. New store productivity continues to be excellent with new stores performing well above their budgets and their IRR targets. 
In addition to the new store program, our growth and development team is very focused on ensuring high-quality execution of our prestige boutique rollout, and we completed a large number of the more than 500 Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques planned for this year. We're taking advantage of this boutique expansion activity to further refresh our store fleet with improvements to fragrance, nail and ULTA Beauty Collection fixtures. And looking ahead, we've already approved 100 stores for next year's real estate program. 
Now moving on to ulta.com. Our e-commerce growth was very strong, up 54.9% and contributing 180 basis points to our total company comp. Site traffic accounted for almost all of the growth as we continue to invest in digital marketing. 
E-commerce margins improved in part due to the more efficient fulfillment costs from orders delivered from our new Greenwood distribution center. Similar to our performance in stores, the fastest-growing categories were prestige and mass cosmetics. 
Professional hair care was also a standout as this category ramps up online following the addition of many brands previously sold in-store only last year. Our signature leader event, featuring jumbo sizes of hair care products at compelling prices, was very successful online during the quarter. 
To highlight our authority in hair care, we also conducted our first ever live beauty chat with expert salon stylists. These members of our elite Ulta Beauty artistic team answered guest questions on hair products, tools and tips.
Turning to assortment newness. We launched Shiseido skincare products in the website ahead of our limited in-store launch. Continuing on our efforts to increase our portfolio of online brands, we introduced e.l.f., a popular value-priced cosmetics brand, at the end of the quarter. This new brand features many new products exclusive to Ulta Beauty in the assortment and got off to a very strong start in the website. 
We continue to improve the guest experience at ulta.com with more content for the beauty enthusiasts. And recently, we launched a new feature called Ulta Beauty Mix with tips, articles and how-tos. The content is shoppable, and we view this as our first significant step towards merging content and commerce. 
In addition, we've made several technical enhancements to the website, including a search engine optimization URL rewrite. We also released updates for our iPhone, Android and iPad apps, including support for ULTA Reward credit card applications and account management and improved loyalty program sign-up process, a new gift card purchase capability and Apple Pay expedited checkout.
Turning to supply chain and systems, I'm very pleased to report that our new Dallas DC opened up on time in early July and is currently fulfilling more than 90 stores and about 30% of our e-commerce volume. The Dallas DC is expected to ramp up a bit faster than Greenwood, with plans to service more than 130 stores and 25,000 e-commerce orders per day by the end of the holiday period. 
Similar to the benefits we're seeing from the Greenwood DC, the advantages of the Dallas operating model includes fewer, fuller and more stable retail cartons, increased categorization and improved labeling and enhancements for e-commerce orders. The Greenwood, Indiana DC, now just over a year old, is serving about 220 stores and fulfilling almost 40% of our e-commerce orders. We still plan to end the year delivering to approximately 240 stores from Greenwood.
On the system side, SWIFT, our new forecasting and replenishment tool, has now been rolled out to all product categories. The space and floor planning and assortment optimization tool went live a few weeks ago, and our teams are starting to use the new system to plan for holiday and next year's store planogram. The space planning system will be fully integrated with SWIFT, and these processes will be integrated with our new master data system, which will automate the work and thus reduce the time needed to create floor plans at our increasingly complex spots. 
So needless to say, I'm extremely proud of how our teams have executed across these initiatives while supporting strong growth.
Before turning over to Scott, I'd like to preview our upcoming investor conference in Chicago on October 13. I'm very excited to update you on our long-term growth strategies and looking forward to giving you a deeper understanding of the drivers of our business, the future growth opportunities we're prioritizing and also to give you insight into the talents and capabilities across our leadership team. 
You'll hear about our view of category and consumer trends that support our confidence in growth in the beauty category. We'll show how we plan to continue to elevate awareness and clarity about Ulta Beauty as a retail brand. We'll provide an update on our loyalty program and how we're using data in new ways to drive greater share of wallet of our ULTAmate Rewards members. We'll discuss the pipeline of new brands we plan to add to our assortment and provide new insight about our products and services offering. We'll describe how our supply chain and systems investments position us to drive cost efficiencies and higher service levels. We'll discuss the multi-faceted real estate analysis we've just completed that gives us confidence in many more years of store growth ahead, confirming square footage growth as a key part of our strategy to double our market share in the next several years. We'll detail the margin drivers that give us great confidence in achieving our mid-teens operating margin target by 2019 and show you why we're confident in achieving the long-term earnings growth targets we set as part of the strategic plan that we shared back in 2014, even on a much bigger base of business than we forecasted in the initial plan.
So now I'll turn it over to Scott to give us more details about our second quarter results and our outlook for the third quarter and the year."
35929,379751954,1039548,"ULTA Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, Inc., Q2 2017 Earnings Call, Aug 25, 2016",2016-08-25,"Earnings Calls","Ulta Beauty, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Net sales for the second quarter increased 21.9% to $1.07 billion. And once again, our top line was driven by a very healthy 14.4% comp and strong new store productivity. The to",956,"Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Net sales for the second quarter increased 21.9% to $1.07 billion. And once again, our top line was driven by a very healthy 14.4% comp and strong new store productivity. The total company comp was composed of 9.7% transaction growth and 4.7% average ticket growth. The retail comp of 12.9% was made up of 8.9% traffic and 4% ticket. The Salon business comped 8%, with all of the increase, driven by ticket growth similar to trends earlier in the year. E-commerce growth of 54.9% was driven almost entirely by increased traffic with ticket growth up low-single digits. 
Gross profit increased 110 basis points. The improvement was driven by a leverage of store rent and occupancy expenses as well as by healthy product margin expansion, partially offset by planned supply chain investments in our new distribution centers. E-commerce margins also improved with strength in the high-margin professional hair care segment. 
Moving on to SG&A expense. We deleveraged by 110 basis points, driven by additional headcount to support our growth initiatives as well as an unexpected charge related to a store closure. We recently closed our multilevel State Street store in Chicago. The store was temporarily closed back in May due to disruption from a construction in an adjacent building. The extensive damages to the store and the extraordinary amount of time and expense required to reopen the store resulted in our decision to permanently close the location, necessitating a significant impairment charge. 
This charge represented about 1/3 of the SG&A deleverage in the quarter. 
We reassigned our impacted associates to nearby alternate stores and have assisted guests to minimize any disruption in their shopping experience. We are currently evaluating nearby relocation opportunities and expect to get a replacement store up and running soon. 
Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventories were up 18.7% on a per store basis, a bit higher than expected, reflecting the opening of our new distribution center in Dallas. Excluding the impact of the inventory for the new DC, inventories were up 14.5% on a per store basis, in line with our comp. We continue to invest in inventory, given better-than-expected top line growth, new brand additions and the step-up expansion of prestige boutiques. Going forward, we're expecting to see total inventory per door growth more in line with comp growth by the end of the year and anticipate that the efficiencies from our supply chain investments, including new DCs and merchandise planning tools, will become more evident in our financial results starting in 2017.
Capital expenditures were $95.3 million in the quarter, driven by new store openings, fixtures for the rollout of prestige brand boutiques and supply chain investments. We ended the quarter with $304.1 million in cash and short-term investments.
In terms of share buybacks, year-to-date, including our ASR, which settled in the second quarter and activity under our 10b5-1 plans, we have repurchased 1.27 million shares at an average price of approximately $199 per share. At the end of the quarter, approximately 193 million remained under the $425 million share repurchase authorization.
Turning now to guidance for the third quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.072 billion to $1.090 billion compared to $911 million last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 11% to 13% versus 12.8% last year. Online sales growth is expected to be in the 40% range.
We plan to open about 40 stores in Q3 compared to 45 stores during the same period last year, and preopening expense for the quarter is expected to be about $7.6 million.
Earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.25 to $1.30 versus $1.11 for Q3 of 2015. We anticipate a tax rate of 37.6% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 63 million.
Our supply chain investments, particularly the ramp-up of our new Dallas DC on top of the Greenwood building still only fulfilling about half its plant capacity, will continue to weigh on margins the rest of the year. We expect to see the largest impact in the third quarter with deleveraging of P&L reflecting the high watermark of our supply chain investments. We anticipate stronger earnings growth in the fourth quarter on higher sales volumes.
In light of the strength in the business in the first half of the year, we are raising our guidance for the full year 2016. We now expect comparable sales to be in the range of 11% to 13% for the full year versus prior guidance of 10% to 12%. We now expect to grow earnings per share in the low to mid-20s percentage range versus our prior guidance of low 20s percentage growth. We continue to expect that share repurchase activity under our $425 million authorization will contribute about 2 percentage points of earnings per share growth this year.
The other elements of our full-year guidance are unchanged. We're on track to open approximately 100 net new stores, all planned to be our 10,000 square foot prototype. We expect to open about 40 stores in Q3 and 25 stores in Q4. We are also executing 12 major remodels and 2 relocations. We plan to grow e-commerce approximately 40%.
CapEx is on target to be about $390 million, driven by slightly higher capital per new store and the rollout of boutiques. As a reminder, we've planned about $80 million for the boutique expansion and updates, with the rollout of over 500 Clinique Lancôme and Benefit boutiques underway as well as updates to our fragrance fixtures and the ULTA Beauty Collection.

On the -- I guess I would just step back and say we compete, as you know, with a lot of players, both bricks and mortar as well as online, but really nobody brings together everything that we do at one place. And so I don't think so much about head-to-head competition at any one place even though we certainly look very closely at the competitive environment. So our online offerings now represent everything we have in the store and more, pretty much everything we have in store plus more. We're starting to expand that. Our guests enjoy the online experience. We're improving the shipping time frame every day. And certainly, as she participates in buying products online at Ulta Beauty, she gets points, and that's the whole loyalty program she loves, because the more she buys from us, the more she gets points that then she can redeem anywhere in the store. So certainly, we compete with Amazon in some ways in beauty. I would say we offer a great selection that our guests love. But of course, as you know, we also have exceptional bricks-and-mortar physical experience that our guests love. And really, the beauty enthusiasts that Dave described love to go in person and buy beauty and experience beauty and, of course, get our services. So I look at them as part of the mosaic of competition and I think our proposition for our guests is really superior in total. In terms of margin on e-commerce, that's getting stronger. I mean, a big reason behind the investments that we've done in our distribution centers is to really improve the efficiency and effectiveness of that part of our business, and that's happening. I'd say the guest is happier with the speed of delivery, and certainly, the margins are improving."

Again, I don't want to be reconciling basis points quarter-to-quarter, but it's kind of in the general ZIP code, I would say, to what you saw in third quarter last year. Net-net, I think, for the third quarter, gross profit is kind of flattish year-over-year when you add up all the puts and takes because we are still going to get a sizable fixed store cost leverage benefit in the quarter, we're going to continue to expand merchandise margins like we have earlier in the year, and so that will kind of cover up some of the hurt, I guess, I would say, from the deleverage from supply chain. What I don't think most of the models include now is the SG&A deleverage in the third quarter. It's much more significant than what most people are thinking. It's really a combination of the boutiques, the high watermark on the boutiques and the remodel programs and all the other things we have in process to drive growth for the business. So again, it's just a matter sequencing the quarters, right? A lot of it ends up in the third quarter this year. We've got some consulting timing that we've moved from earlier in the year to the back half to help us plan for the future as well, to help us frame out growth drivers that will help us next year and beyond. And then, there's another store impairment charge coming in the third quarter. That was just a fairly recent development as part of the heavy flooding down in Louisiana. So that's another roughly a $0.02 charge that was unexpected that we have to record in the third quarter. So that's really the combination of things. When I think about the rest of the year then, moving on to the fourth quarter, again, supply chain, we start get some benefits there, so we expect to get leverage overall on some of those supply chain investments. SG&A then, we get back into our normal cadence. The heavier sales volume in the fourth quarter. The upfront cost from some of those boutiques are behind us now, and we get leveraged SG&A in the fourth quarter. So that's kind of how we end up full year then, with slight leverage coming from gross profit and slight deleverage on the SG&A line that gives us an all-in slight leverage for the year in operating margin."

So we see that as an area that we think we're working on just on how do you think about continuing to drive that as a growth lever, a traffic driver, bringing in a new guest. I'm sure you know that when a guest becomes a salon guest, she or he becomes one of our best guests because they come frequently and they spend 2.5x the amount of non-salon users. So more to come on that. And we think it's going to provide not only growth but also the ability to really position us as the beauty authority for many years to come. On categories, David?"

And it's really a focused approach on looking at sales and gross margin per square foot, inventory turn, a bunch of metrics that really look for the most profitable usage of our space, but also focused on elements that are really delivering against our core proposition of All Things Beauty, All in One Place. And so when we look at adding new brands, makeup is the fastest-growing part of the beauty business, and certainly, it is within our portfolio, so you'll continue to see makeup brands for sure. But we want to make sure that we're really focused on understanding how her needs are evolving, and we're bringing innovation across all elements, both mass and prestige. We've had a lot of innovation, great, exciting innovation in fragrance. We've got Sarah Jessica Parker's fragrance coming out on Sunday. I think it's good to be great. So a lot of innovation continued in fragrance. Skin care is an area that has had its ups and downs, but we see growth and potential within that. And then, certainly, haircare and connected to our salon, it's a big and very important part of our business, the styling part, liquids, shampoos, conditioners, tools, our professional tools area -- personal tools areas, so we'll continue to innovate across all parts of the store and optimize our assortment as we go forward."

There's categories that she'll need to replenish when she's out. There might be a couple of items that she's quite attached to, but I'll tell you, for the most part, our guests are really coming in and loving to try new products. She loves trends, she loves newness, she loves great, new products that are launched by our brand partners. So what we're finding is that very little of the business is one-for-one replenishment. And as that becomes bigger perhaps in the future, we're always looking at that to see if there's a way we can make it even easier for her. But what she seems to be responding to is the breadth of innovation and newness. And if you look at, for example, our e-commerce guests, the guests who shop online and in-store, again, some of our best guests, they spend significantly more than someone who's not buying online. And what she's tending to buy is in response to things that we're bringing to her attention via email, so it's usually new products or exclusives or new trends. Again, I don't have anything against replenishment, but I love the fact that we're replenishing our products a lot, but the one-for-one piece is something that is not a big part of the business."

As we look at consumer trends going forward, and Dave touched on this, but younger women, millennials, Hispanic women, fastest-growing segment of our population, there's a propensity, we think, for the beauty category for all those folks to continue to play a very important role in her overall spend of her money and how she spends her time. So that's all good. And the great thing is that innovation comes from companies large and small, it's probably the most exciting consumer category, I think, that exists because innovation comes from many different sources, and we positioned ourselves to hopefully be a great partner for brands to do business with and we offer this variety of products, categories and price points. So I think that also helps to sort of insulate us as the subcategories go up and down, and Dave talked a little bit about those categories.

They're designed to actually do e-commerce, pick-and-fill-and-ship processes unlike the older buildings, which were retrofitted and not quite as efficient. So we're happy to see that and we're showing the benefits show up in the P&Ls as currently and as we think about the future, so we're very excited about that. As far as in-stock rates overall, that's something that we've -- that's kind of priority #1 when we think about the guest experience in our stores. And again, that's part and parcel of all the investments that we've been talking about for the last couple of years, whether it's distribution center to help the throughput there, capacity and capability overall, but also, we're doing a lot other work behind the scenes with merchandise planning, tools, SWIFT we've talked about, master data, managing that better, floor planning and space planning kind of tools that are going online as well to help with in-stocks overall. And then, our team internally here, there's a lot of individual projects and look-sees going on around how we can do a better job, just making sure we go extra heavy on A and B SKUs so we just don't disappoint folks, and how can we be more effective with some of the C, D, E and F SKUs, right, in the stores and how we better align ourselves on that. So all oars are in the water when it comes to in-stocks and inventory productivity across the enterprise."

And I think, it's because we continue to benefit from the fact that we're in the category that's important to our guests. And I mentioned this earlier, it's replenishable, it's affordable indulgence, and beauty is popular right now in many ways in terms of culture and social media. And so you combine that with being in a range of categories and price points, so even if somebody is a little bit more pinched, you can also get great products at a lower price from us. And at partnership with our brand partners, we're continuing -- continuing to excite her with newness. So I feel like our results would say that there's certain pockets of consumer spending that are quite strong, and obviously, we see that macro for the category of beauty as well.

We've added some new brands into that space, Fizz & Bubble, Soap & Glory among others, and we've got some great business. The exclusive distribution of the Body Shop outside of their own shops is an example, and so it's not huge for that total bath and body space isn't enormous for us, but it's an example of what you're talking about.

We've grown our prestige business pretty quickly over the last several years as we've added a number of brands, but we've also been focused on growing mass, so a key part what our guest really responds to us is this idea of mass and prestige because that's where she shops, that's how when you look at products that she has at home, most women don't have either prestige or either mass only, they have both. So providing both to her is a key part of our strategy. We will never kind of shift away from that, we want to see growth on both sides because that's what our guest wants.

Highlights for the quarter in",2144,"Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon. Ulta Beauty's top line momentum accelerated in the third quarter driving record sales and earnings performance. The team continues to execute exceptionally well against our key strategies. 
Highlights for the quarter include success in acquiring new brands, strength in overall newness, increases in awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand, continued excellent results from our loyalty program, improving performance of our supply chain and systems and robust growth in our e-commerce business. 
In the third quarter, we grew the top line 24.2% and delivered 16.7% comp sales on top of the 12.8% comp in the third quarter of last year. This is the best comp performance on both the 1- and 2-year basis in our history as a public company, driven by healthy traffic and ticket growth. 
We achieved the strongest quarterly comps of the year in all 3 channels. E-commerce growth was well above plan, and the retail and salon businesses also delivered their best top line growth of the year. 
In terms of categories. Cosmetics, both mass and prestige, continued to lead our growth, with new brands and new items from existing brands contributing to better-than-expected performance. Strength on the top line was broad-based as we gained market share across all major categories. 
Earnings per share rose to $1.40, representing 26% growth, significantly better performance than what we anticipated going into the quarter when our initial outlook called for 13% to 17% earnings per share growth. This upside in EPS was due to better-than-expected top line growth and our continued success with loyalty and CRM efforts. 
I'd now like to highlight some of the key drivers of our third quarter performance in the context of our strategic imperatives, starting with our loyalty program. We grew rolling 12-month active membership by 28% to reach 21.7 million active members as our store teams continued to drive excellent conversion at checkout. Similar to the trends we've seen all year, the loyalty program metrics, including retention rate, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average member ticket, all continued to be very strong. We continued to prioritize more personalized CRM offers for our loyalty members versus broad discounts and promotions, and as evolution in our marketing strategy continues to benefit margin rate and allows us to invest in other parts of the marketing mix such as television, radio and digital advertising, which continued to drive awareness and clarity about our brands. 
Our Ultamate Rewards credit card reward program continues to be well received since its launch in August. We're seeing strong guest engagement both in-store and online. Our team carried out extensive associate training and planning ahead of the launch, resulting in seamless execution of the program. Credit card sign-ups are exceeding expectations. Some of the compelling promotions we're offering for new cardholders are driving higher average baskets and unit per transaction as guests take advantage of onetime offers. 
Turning to our marketing and brand awareness activities. Our third quarter marketing plan features signature promotions like 21 Days Of Beauty in September, our Gorgeous Hair events in October and a series of activities focused on raising funds for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. We returned as the official partner to The Ellen DeGeneres Show, putting BCRF and Ulta Beauty on a national stage to millions of viewers each week to raise awareness and funds. Our store teams raised nearly $3 million during this year's Gorgeous Way to Give campaign, and our salon stylists were proud to perform more than 50,000 beauty services at our Cut For A Cause event in support of our BCRF fund-raising program. 
From an advertising perspective, during the fall, we ran national TV and radio ads to support our 21 Days Of Beauty and Gorgeous Hair promotions. To [ph] create this new and built on the inaugural campaign from last year. We continue to also see significant growth in our social platforms, especially Instagram and Snapchat. We recently surpassed 2.6 million fans on Instagram and held our first-ever Snapchat takeover with YouTube influencer, Jenny Fox. We have Wende Zomnir, the Founder and Chief Creative Officer of Urban Decay, take over our Snapchat and Instagram channels, yielding millions of impressions. And we also announced a partnership with E! News with the launch of freeSTYLE, a weekly Facebook Live show. The program includes fan interactions, discussions and reviews of the best and most relevant people, products and trends that matter to the 9.5 million highly engaged E! News Facebook fans. 
Now on the merchandising front. New brands and new products within existing brands drove better-than-expected sales growth with strength across all categories. Similar to what we've experienced all year long, makeup brands like Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Anastasia, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit, Real Techniques and Ardell delivered the highest growth rate in the quarter. Our own Ulta Beauty Collection was also a top performer. We've restaged the brand with new packaging, branding and innovation and about 600 stores now featuring enhanced wall presentation with improved signage and elevated fixtures. 
In mass skincare, TONYMOLY and Boots No7 were standouts. And our Pro Hair business accelerated, with newness from DevaCurl and Living Proof contributing to strong comps in this category. Living Proof also partnered with our services business for a 1-day salon takeover event to introduce salon guests to this brand. 
And we discussed many of the new brands we're adding to our assortment at our Analyst Day just a few weeks ago, but let me recap a few of the highlights. During the third quarter, we launched Estée Lauder skincare and cosmetics in 30 stores and online. We launched Shiseido, Origins and proactiv, greatly enhancing our skincare offering. We added e.l.f. to our online assortment. We introduced the innovation -- the innovated Dyson hairdryer in 200 stores and online. We've also completed almost all of the 500-plus Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques planned for the year. In addition, we added the best of Clinique [indiscernible] in all stores that don't have a full Clinique boutique. 
Turning to our services business. Salon sales grew 16.7% and comped 10.3% with strength in color, hair treatment and makeup services. Our services business is increasingly using CRM campaigns to drive awareness and encourage trial of our service offerings. We rolled out our improved online booking experience to all stores during the quarter to make it even easier for our guests to make an appointment in our salons. 
We continue to focus on elevating our in-house artistic team and curating design trends exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Our fall and holiday trends include a look we call Sombre, which is a new softer way to achieve an ombre look; and a new color we call ronze, highlights that bring together beautiful shades of copper and auburn. The artistic team participated in several designer runway shows at Fashion Week, driving awareness for Ulta Beauty's hair authority and inspiring the entire salon team across the chain. And our Benefit Brow boutiques continued their excellent performance with brow services now available in more than 800 stores and a successful launch of the wide range of new brow products in more shades. We're now testing online booking for brow services to make it easier for our guests to make an appointment in our Benefit Brow Bars. 
Turning to store growth. We opened 42 stores in the third quarter, on our way to executing our 2016 program of 100 net new stores, ending the quarter with 949 stores. Our growth and development team has completed almost all of the 500-plus prestige brand boutiques we planned for this year, including new stores and remodels, along with updates to the Ulta Beauty Collection of fragrance and nail fixtures. 
New store productivity remains very strong, with the class of 2016 stores performing well above budget and [ph] far-above sales hurdles established to meet our internal rate of return thresholds. We've already approved all of the 100 stores planned for 2017 program, including a new store in Michigan Avenue in Chicago. 
As you heard in our Analyst Day, we completed our in-depth analysis of the real estate opportunity in the U.S. and announced a new launch [ph] room target to roll out between 1,400 to 1,700 stores, with opportunities to further penetrate existing suburban markets, expand our penetration in small markets and begin to develop urban markets. At the same time, we updated our new store maturation ramp based on current trends and higher new store productivity, upgrading year 1 sales from $2.8 million to $3.1 million and revising upward our year 5 sales estimate to $4.5 million from $4 million. We're confident that our stores will continue to produce very attractive returns. 
Turning to our e-commerce business. ulta.com sales grew 59.1% on top of 56.3% growth last year, contributing 240 basis points to our total company comp. The strong revenue growth was driven entirely by increased transactions. We continue to evolve and operate [ph] the guest experience while improving site performance. We made enhancements to our mobile app, including our product detail page redesigned to better display product options and information, integration of our weekly [ph] launch content platform called The Mix [ph] and the addition of our new salon appointment booking tool. We launched a trial [ph] feature called Glam Lab [ph] last month to allow guests to virtually test products and shades within our iPhone and Android app by uploading a selfie or choosing a model with a similar complexion. Our technology partner for this platform is a company known for best-in-class realism and accuracy of color matching. 
Finally, to update you on supply chain performance and investments, we are very pleased and proud with how smoothly our team has executed on a very complex set of initiatives of system rollouts in addition to opening 2 new DCs in the past 1.5 years. Our Greenwood DC is now servicing 227 stores and fulfilling 44% of our e-commerce orders. Our newest distribution center in Dallas is ramping on schedule and currently fulfilling 130 stores and 30% of total e-com orders. 
On the systems side, we're starting to see benefits from the core merchandise systems we recently implemented. SWIFT, our new forecasting replenishment tool, continues to ramp up and help us optimize inventory. Our store-level in-stocks [ph] are improving and more of our inventories in our stores versus in our DCs improving the guest experience. We now have all the tools in place to help us make better, more database assortment and inventory decisions. 
So that wraps up my third quarter review. Looking at the holiday, we're expecting healthy traffic and strong sales growth as a result of our integrated merchandising and marketing plan. From a product standpoint, we're excited to offer an array of newness and exclusivity on our holiday assortment across all categories and brands. 
To share a few highlights, we'll feature an assortment of Clinique and Lancôme products in every store for holiday. We just launched NARS, featuring 3 hero products: their famous blush, bronzer and a multipurpose stick, The Multiple. These are available online and featured on the [indiscernible] and every store in time for holiday with a more expansive assortment offered online later this month and then launched in select stores next year. 
Our merchants have done a great job partnering with our brands to offer exclusive products across many brands and categories, a wide variety of a holiday-themed kits and stocking stuffers and men's grooming and fragrance kits. This year, we upgraded our fragrance kit with purchase program, complementing the exciting newness of our holiday fragrance assortment. We've also launched an elevated Ulta Beauty Collection of our traditional blockbuster kit that have already shown strong consumer response. 
And in support our compelling merchandise offering, we rolled out our holiday advertising campaign JOY TO THE GIRL, which is integrated from a design and messaging perspective across all touch points, from in-store signage to new TV and radio spots running now to price and even the packaging of our Ulta Beauty Collection holiday assortment. Our campaign encourage our guests to see us as a great gift giving destination as well as a place to get glammed up for holiday events with a visit to our salon. The guest kits and get glammed theme is featured in television and radio spots, during [indiscernible] content and our social media platform and on the mix on our website. 
Key to executing our holiday plan, our store operations, e-commerce, supply chain and systems teams have all done an excellent job, preparing for the busy holiday season and our efforts have already paid off with a successful Black Friday, Cyber Monday weekend both in stores and online. All areas are stacked up and ready to delight our guests during the big weeks ahead. 
So now I'll hand over to Scott to discuss our third quarter financials and our outlook for the fourth quarter."

Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 24.2% to $1.13 billion, driven by 16.7% comparable sales and continued strong performance of new stores. The total company comp was composed of 11.1% transaction growth and 5.6% average ticket growth. The retail comp of 14.6% was comprised of 9.6% traffic and 5% ticket. Ticket growth was driven about 1/3 by units per transaction and about 2/3 by average selling price. The Salon business, comped 10.3%. And similar to the recent trend, was driven by ticket growth. The combined retail comp and salon comp, yielded a total store comp of 14.3%. 
Gross profit increased 90 basis points. The improvement was the result of product margin expansion and leverage of store rent and occupancy expenses on strong comps, offset by planned supply chain investments.

We deleveraged by 80 basis points, driven by investments in growth initiatives, including store funeral [ph] to support our boutique strategy and a differentiated guest experience and deleveraged a corporate overhead cost, in part due to an impairment charge related to the closure of a store in Louisiana due to the August flooding. This was partially offset by modest leverage in marketing. 
The tax rate was 37.4%, consistent with the first half of the year. Last year's Q3 tax rate of 36% reflected the benefit of some tax true-ups. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Inventories increased 16.5% on a per-store basis, which is slightly below the comp rate. Similar to the recent trend, we continue to invest in inventory to support sales growth, seeing access to new brands and expand the presence of prestige boutiques in our stores. Also, our new distribution centers in Greenwood and Dallas are ramping and performing well, but are still far from being fully optimized. 
Capital expenditures were $131.6 million for the quarter, driven by new store openings, fixtures related to the continued rollout of boutiques as well as investments in systems. We ended the quarter with $243 million in cash and short-term investments. 
In terms of share buybacks. We continue to repurchase shares in the open market as part of our 10b5-1 plan. During the third quarter, we repurchased about 179,000 shares of our stock, net of cost of just over $44 million. Year-to-date, including the accelerated share repurchase program and activity under our 10b5-1 plan, we repurchased approximately 1,450,000 shares at an average price of about $205 per share. Share repurchases under our current authorization are expected to contribute about 2 points of EPS growth for the year. 
At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $148 million remaining available under the $425 million share repurchase program announced in March 2016. 
Turning now to guidance for the fourth quarter. We anticipate sales to be in the range of $1.516 billion to $1.541 billion versus $1.268 billion last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 12% to 14% versus 12.5% last year. E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the 40% [ph] range. We plan to open about 25 stores in the fourth quarter versus the 14 last year, so preopening expense will be higher. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.13 versus $1.69 last year, with modest leverage on both the gross profit and SG&A lines. The tax rate is expected to be 37.5% and our fully diluted share count is estimated at 63 million. 
At our Analyst Day event in October, we raised our guidance for the full year 2016, expecting comparable sales to grow approximately 12% to 14% including the impact of the e-commerce business. And EPS to increase in the mid-20s percentage range. 
Now with the upside to third quarter earnings, we expect full year comparable sales to grow 13% to 15% and earnings growth to be in the high 20s percentage range. Operating margin is expected to be up modestly for the year. 
CapEx is on track to reach approximately $390 million, driven by slightly higher CapEx per new store and also includes about $80 million for boutique expansion, with 500 plus store touches for Clinique, Lancôme, and Benefit boutiques as well as fragrance fixtures and Ulta Beauty Collection updates.

So fourth quarter, as we go in, with the heavier sales lift in the fourth quarter, we expect to see operating margin expansion and SG&A leverage as well.

Watching sales trends, so we mentioned the credit card got off to a spectacular start as we got into the quarter. We weren't expecting it to be quite so strong. So again Mary mentioned that there's a nice offer there, right, 20% off for an entire purchase when you sign up initially.

We talked about expansion in some of the biggest established prestige brands. You know we've been continuing to expand our partnership with Clinique and Lancôme, we're just getting started with Estée Lauder and NARS but upstarts have been a big part of our success over time and we feel really privileged to be partnering with smaller brands that are innovating in new and creative ways, Makeup Revolution in the mass cosmetic space is one example of that that has demonstrated some nice growth.

But other elements of our marketing plan, really all elements of our marketing plan are coming together to drive awareness of growth. Radio is a strong contributor to that, but we've been investing more heavily in the digital space, in awareness, in social media, influencer, really across our entire digital footprint to connect with our guests where she wants to be connected.

But that balance is important because it's the ability to just continue to grow the business and not be reliant on just sort of a set number of people visits. So the balance I think we expect to hope [indiscernible] every quarter but that's the overall goal. In terms of e-com profitability, I guess the constant area of focus. First of all, our e-commerce business has gotten more profitable in last couple of years as we expanded the assortment. Certainly, in the investments in the supply chain, being able to get those orders together in a more effective and efficient way. It will probably always be a somewhat lower profit margin than in the bricks and mortar parts of the business just because of the shipping cost. But we're happy with it. I mean, online business, as you can tell as we talked in the Analyst Day, looks quite incremental to our guests in terms of how she uses the channel period.

I guess, I just say, we are one we really pleased across all categories that we're seeing strong growth. I think Mary mentioned in her remarks that we're gaining share in each of our key categories and the drivers overall, we've talked about in the past is just a highly engaged consumer in beauty and our continued ability to connect with her and gain market share and gain her trust and loyalty and wallet share. And we think specifically within makeup, a lot of trends driving makeup. It is the fastest growing segment of beauty right now and that's really driven by a high-level engagement, particularly with the young women, teens and millennials, but really across all age groups. And all ethnicities, Hispanic and women of color, in particular, are heavily engaged in makeup. There's more education and training and knowledge and trends around different makeup looks and styles. So it is just a really healthy category and our participation in that has expanded through the brands that were carrying, the way were marketing it, the way we're participating in social media, so we're benefiting from that. Skincare has been struggling for a few years, but has shown some nice signs of growth. Korean skincare has played a role in that. We're seeing strong growth in different aspects. Masks are a big part of other Asian skincare trends are driving growth. And in overall, recognition by millennials, in particular, that is not all about makeup, but you just need to make sure that your skin is in good shape as well. And so we're seeing a nice rebound of skincare. Other categories, fragrance, nice -- isn't going anywhere near the level of makeup, but a lot of innovation in that space. We, of course, have been driving that with 1 example of that is our Sarah Jessica Parker exclusive stash. So a lot of different reasons [indiscernible] key categories and we -- it's a big focus for Ulta to make sure were front and center in all of those trends."

Highlights for the quarter in",2132,"Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon. Ulta Beauty's top line momentum accelerated in the third quarter driving record sales and earnings performance. The team continues to execute exceptionally well against our key strategies. 
Highlights for the quarter include success in acquiring new brands, strength in overall newness, increases in awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand, continued excellent results from our loyalty program, improving performance of our supply chain and systems and robust growth in our e-commerce business. 
In the third quarter, we grew the top line 24.2% and delivered 16.7% comp sales on top of the 12.8% comp in the third quarter of last year. This is the best comp performance on both the 1- and 2-year basis in our history as a public company, driven by healthy traffic and ticket growth. 
We achieved the strongest quarterly comps of the year in all 3 channels. E-commerce growth was well above plan, and the retail and salon businesses also delivered their best top line growth of the year. 
In terms of categories. Cosmetics, both mass and prestige, continued to lead our growth, with new brands and new items from existing brands contributing to better-than-expected performance. Strength on the top line was broad-based as we gained market share across all major categories. 
Earnings per share rose to $1.40, representing 26% growth, significantly better performance than what we anticipated going into the quarter when our initial outlook called for 13% to 17% earnings per share growth. This upside in EPS was due to better-than-expected top line growth and our continued success with loyalty and CRM efforts. 
I'd now like to highlight some of the key drivers of our third quarter performance in the context of our strategic imperatives, starting with our loyalty program. We grew rolling 12-month active membership by 28% to reach 21.7 million active members as our store teams continued to drive excellent conversion at checkout. Similar to the trends we've seen all year, the loyalty program metrics, including retention rate, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average member ticket, all continued to be very strong. We continued to prioritize more personalized CRM offers for our loyalty members versus broad discounts and promotions, and as evolution in our marketing strategy continues to benefit margin rate and allows us to invest in other parts of the marketing mix such as television, radio and digital advertising, which continued to drive awareness and clarity about our brands. 
Our Ultamate Rewards credit card reward program continues to be well received since its launch in August. We're seeing strong guest engagement both in-store and online. Our team carried out extensive associate training and planning ahead of the launch, resulting in seamless execution of the program. Credit card sign-ups are exceeding expectations. Some of the compelling promotions we're offering for new cardholders are driving higher average baskets and unit per transaction as guests take advantage of onetime offers. 
Turning to our marketing and brand awareness activities. Our third quarter marketing plan features signature promotions like 21 Days Of Beauty in September, our Gorgeous Hair events in October and a series of activities focused on raising funds for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. We returned as the official partner to The Ellen DeGeneres Show, putting BCRF and Ulta Beauty on a national stage to millions of viewers each week to raise awareness and funds. Our store teams raised nearly $3 million during this year's Gorgeous Way to Give campaign, and our salon stylists were proud to perform more than 50,000 beauty services at our Cut for a Cause event in support of our BCRF fund-raising program. 
From an advertising perspective, during the fall, we ran national TV and radio ads to support our 21 Days Of Beauty and Gorgeous Hair promotions. It created this new and built on the inaugural campaign from last year. We continue to also see significant growth in our social platforms, especially Instagram and Snapchat. We recently surpassed 2.6 million fans on Instagram and held our first-ever Snapchat takeover with YouTube influencer, Jenny Fox. We have Wende Zomnir, the Founder and Chief Creative Officer of Urban Decay, take over our Snapchat and Instagram channels, yielding millions of impressions. And we also announced a partnership with E! News with the launch of freeSTYLE, a weekly Facebook Live show. The program includes fan interactions, discussions and reviews of the best and most relevant people, products and trends that matter to the 9.5 million highly engaged E! News Facebook fans. 
Now on the merchandising front. New brands and new products within existing brands drove better-than-expected sales growth with strength across all categories. Similar to what we've experienced all year long, makeup brands like Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Anastasia, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit, Real Techniques and Ardell delivered the highest growth rate in the quarter. Our own Ulta Beauty Collection was also a top performer. We've restaged the brand with new packaging, branding and innovation and about 600 stores now featuring enhanced wall presentation with improved signage and elevated fixtures. 
In mass skincare, TONYMOLY and Boots No7 were standouts. And our Pro Hair business accelerated, with newness from DevaCurl and Living Proof contributing to strong comps in this category. Living Proof also partnered with our services business for a 1-day salon takeover event to introduce salon guests to this brand. 
And we discussed many of the new brands we're adding to our assortment at our Analyst Day just a few weeks ago, but let me recap a few of the highlights. During the third quarter, we launched Estée Lauder skincare and cosmetics in 30 stores and online. We launched Shiseido, Origins and proactiv, greatly enhancing our skincare offering. We added e.l.f. to our online assortment. We introduced the innovation -- the innovated Dyson hairdryer in 200 stores and online. We've also completed almost all of the 500-plus Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques planned for the year. In addition, we added the best of Clinique [indiscernible] in all stores that don't have a full Clinique boutique. 
Turning to our services business. Salon sales grew 16.7% and comped 10.3% with strength in color, hair treatment and makeup services. Our services business is increasingly using CRM campaigns to drive awareness and encourage trial of our service offerings. We rolled out our improved online booking experience to all stores during the quarter to make it even easier for our guests to make an appointment in our salons. 
We continue to focus on elevating our in-house artistic team and curating design trends exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Our fall and holiday trends include a look we call Sombre, which is a new softer way to achieve an ombre look; and a new color we call ronze, highlights that bring together beautiful shades of copper and auburn. The artistic team participated in several designer runway shows at Fashion Week, driving awareness for Ulta Beauty's hair authority and inspiring the entire salon team across the chain. And our Benefit Brow boutiques continued their excellent performance with brow services now available in more than 800 stores and a successful launch of the wide range of new brow products in more shades. We're now testing online booking for brow services to make it easier for our guests to make an appointment in our Benefit Brow Bars. 
Turning to store growth. We opened 42 stores in the third quarter, on our way to executing our 2016 program of 100 net new stores, ending the quarter with 949 stores. Our growth and development team has completed almost all of the 500-plus prestige brand boutiques we planned for this year, including new stores and remodels, along with updates to the Ulta Beauty Collection of fragrance and nail fixtures. 
New store productivity remains very strong, with the class of 2016 stores performing well above budget and far-above sales hurdles established to meet our internal rate of return thresholds. We've already approved all of the 100 stores planned for 2017 program, including a new store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago. 
As you heard in our Analyst Day, we completed our in-depth analysis of the real estate opportunity in the U.S. and announced a new long-term target to roll out between 1,400 to 1,700 stores, with opportunities to further penetrate existing suburban markets, expand our penetration in small markets and begin to develop urban markets. At the same time, we updated our new store maturation ramp based on current trends and higher new store productivity, upgrading year 1 sales from $2.8 million to $3.1 million and revising upward our year 5 sales estimate to $4.5 million from $4 million. We're confident that our stores will continue to produce very attractive returns. 
Turning to our e-commerce business. ulta.com sales grew 59.1% on top of 56.3% growth last year, contributing 240 basis points to our total company comp. The strong revenue growth was driven entirely by increased transactions. We continue to evolve and operate the guest experience while improving site performance. We made enhancements to our mobile app, including our product detail page redesigned to better display product options and information, integration of our recently launched content platform called The Mix and the addition of our new salon appointment booking tool. We launched a try-on feature called GLAM LAB last month to allow guests to virtually test products and shades within our iPhone and Android app by uploading a selfie or choosing a model with a similar complexion. Our technology partner for this platform is a company known for best-in-class realism and accuracy of color matching. 
Finally, to update you on supply chain performance and investments, we are very pleased and proud with how smoothly our team has executed on a very complex set of initiatives of system rollouts in addition to opening 2 new DCs in the past 1.5 years. Our Greenwood DC is now servicing 227 stores and fulfilling 44% of our e-commerce orders. Our newest distribution center in Dallas is ramping on schedule and currently fulfilling 130 stores and 30% of total e-com orders. 
On the systems side, we're starting to see benefits from the core merchandise systems we recently implemented. SWIFT, our new forecasting replenishment tool, continues to ramp up and help us optimize inventory. Our store-level in-stocks are improving and more of our inventories in our stores versus in our DCs improving the guest experience. We now have all the tools in place to help us make better, more database assortment and inventory decisions. 
So that wraps up my third quarter review. Looking at the holiday, we're expecting healthy traffic and strong sales growth as a result of our integrated merchandising and marketing plan. From a product standpoint, we're excited to offer an array of newness and exclusivity on our holiday assortment across all categories and brands. 
To share a few highlights, we'll feature an assortment of Clinique and Lancôme products in every store for holiday. We just launched NARS, featuring 3 hero products: their famous blush, bronzer and a multipurpose stick, The Multiple. These are available online and featured on the [indiscernible] and every store in time for holiday with a more expansive assortment offered online later this month and then launched in select stores next year. 
Our merchants have done a great job partnering with our brands to offer exclusive products across many brands and categories, a wide variety of holiday-themed kits and stocking stuffers and men's grooming and fragrance kits. This year, we upgraded our fragrance kit with purchase program, complementing the exciting newness of our holiday fragrance assortment. And we've also launched an elevated Ulta Beauty Collection of our traditional blockbuster kit that have already shown strong consumer response. And to support our compelling merchandise offering, we rolled out our holiday advertising campaign JOY TO THE GIRL, which is integrated from a design and messaging perspective across all touch points from in-store signage to new TV and radio spots running now to prints and even the packaging of our Ulta Beauty Collection holiday assortment. Our campaign encouraged our guests to see us as a great gift-giving destination as well as a place to get glammed up for holiday events with a visit to our salon. The guest kits and get glammed theme is featured in television and radio spots through inspirational content and our social media platform and on The Mix on our website. 
Key to executing our holiday plan, our store operations, e-commerce, supply chain and systems teams have all done an excellent job preparing for the busy holiday season, and their efforts have already paid off with the successful Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend both in stores and online. All areas are staffed up and ready to delight our guests during these big weeks ahead. 
So now I'll hand over to Scott to discuss our third quarter financials and our outlook for the fourth quarter."

Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 24.2% to $1.13 billion, driven by 16.7% comparable sales and continued strong performance of new stores. The total company comp was composed of 11.1% transaction growth and 5.6% average ticket growth. The retail comp of 14.6% was comprised of 9.6% traffic and 5% ticket. Ticket growth was driven about 1/3 by units per transaction and about 2/3 by average selling price. The Salon business comped 10.3% and, similar to the recent trend, was driven by ticket growth. The combined retail comp and salon comp yielded a total store comp of 14.3%. 
Gross profit increased 90 basis points. The improvement was the result of product margin expansion and leverage of store rent and occupancy expenses on strong comps, offset by planned supply chain investments. 
Turning to SG&A expense. We deleveraged by 80 basis points, driven by investments in growth initiatives, including store payroll to support our boutique strategy and a differentiated guest experience; and deleveraged a corporate overhead cost, in part due to an impairment charge related to the closure of a store in Louisiana due to the August flooding. This was partially offset by modest leverage in marketing. 
The tax rate was 37.4%, consistent with the first half of the year. Last year's Q3 tax rate of 36% reflected the benefit of some tax true-ups. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Inventory increased 16.5% on a per-store basis, which is slightly below the comp rate. Similar to the recent trend, we continue to invest in inventory to support sales growth, gain access to new brands and expand the presence of prestige boutiques in our stores. Also, our new distribution centers in Greenwood and Dallas are ramping and performing well but are still far from being fully optimized. 
Capital expenditures were $131.6 million for the quarter, driven by new store openings, fixtures related to the continued rollout of boutiques as well as investments in systems. We ended the quarter with $243 million in cash and short-term investments. 
In terms of share buybacks, we continue to repurchase shares in the open market as part of our 10b5-1 plan. During the third quarter, we repurchased about 179,000 shares of our stock at a cost of just over $44 million. Year-to-date, including the accelerated share repurchase program and activity under our 10b5-1 plan, we repurchased approximately 1,450,000 shares at an average price of about $205 per share. Share repurchases under our current authorization are expected to contribute about 2 points of EPS growth for the year. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $148 million remaining available under the $425 million share repurchase program announced in March 2016. 
Turning now to guidance for the fourth quarter. We anticipate sales to be in a range of $1.516 billion to $1.541 billion versus $1.268 billion last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 12% to 14% versus 12.5% last year. E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the 40% range. We plan to open about 25 stores in the fourth quarter versus 14 last year, so preopening expense will be higher. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.13 versus $1.69 last year, with modest leverage on both the gross profit and SG&A lines. The tax rate is expected to be 37.5%, and our fully diluted share count is estimated at 63 million. 
At our Analyst Day event in October, we raised our guidance for the full year 2016, expecting comparable sales to grow approximately 12% to 14%, including the impact of the e-commerce business and EPS to increase in the mid-20s percentage range. 
Now with the upside to third quarter earnings, we expect full year comparable sales to grow 13% to 15% and earnings growth to be in the high 20s percentage range. Operating margin is expected to be up modestly for the year. 
CapEx is on track to reach approximately $390 million, driven by slightly higher CapEx per new store and also includes about $80 million for boutique expansion, with 500-plus store touches for Clinique, Lancôme, and Benefit boutiques as well as fragrance fixtures and Ulta Beauty Collection updates.

We talked about expansion in some of the biggest established prestige brands. You know we've been continuing to expand our partnership with Clinique and Lancôme. We're just getting started with Estée Lauder and NARS, and -- but then upstarts has been a big part of our success over time, and we feel really privileged to be partnering with smaller brands that are innovating in new and creative ways. Makeup Revolution in the mass cosmetic space is one example of that, that has demonstrated some nice growth.

Last quarter, I think were about 2/3 traffic, 1/3 ticket, and retail online was mostly transact [ph] traffic, which is great. But that balance is important because it's the ability to just continue to grow the business and not be reliant on just sort of a set number of people and visits. So a balance I think we'd expect to hope -- it's never going to be exact in every quarter, but that's the overall goal. In terms of e-com profitability, I mean, I guess that's the constant area of focus. First of all, our e-commerce business has gotten more profitable in the last couple of years as we've expanded the assortment, certainly the investments in supply chain, being able to get those orders together in more effective and efficient way. It will probably always be a somewhat lower profit margin than in the bricks-and-mortar part of the business just because of the shipping costs, but we're happy with it. I mean, the online business, as you can tell as we talked at Analyst Day, is -- looks to be quite incremental to our guests in terms of how she uses the channel. And so as we continue to close the gap of profit margin, it's a great part of business."

And the drivers, overall, we've talked about in the past is just a highly engaged consumer in beauty and our continued ability to connect with her and gain market share and gain her trust and loyalty and wallet share. And we think specifically within makeup, a lot of trends driving makeup. It is the fastest-growing segment of beauty right now, and that's really driven by a high-level engagement, particularly with young women, teens and millennials but really across all age groups and all ethnicities. Hispanic and all women of color, in particular, are heavily engaged in makeup. There's more education and training and knowledge and trends around different makeup looks and styles. So it is just a really healthy category, and our participation in that has expanded through the brands that we're carrying, the way we're marketing it, the way we're participating in the social media, so we're benefiting from that. Skincare has been struggling for a few years but has shown some nice signs of growth. Korean skincare has played a role in that. We're seeing strong growth in different aspects. Masks, a big part of other Asian skincare trends, are driving growth. And overall recognition by millennials, in particular, that it isn't all about makeup, but you need to make sure your skin is in good shape as well. And so we're seeing a nice rebound at skincare. Other categories, fragrance, that's -- that is -- isn't growing anywhere near the level of makeup but a lot of innovation in that space. We, of course, have been driving that with -- one example of that is our Sarah Jessica Parker exclusive stash. So a lot of different reasons across key categories, and we -- it's a big focus for Ulta to make sure that we're front and center in all of those trends."

Highlights of the quarter include success in acquiring new brands, strength in overall newness, increases in awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand, continued excellent results from our loyalty program, improving performance of our supply chain and systems and robust growth in our e-commerce business. 
In the third quarter, we grew the top line 24.2% and delivered 16.7% comp sales on top of a 12.8% comp in the third quarter of last year. This is the best comp performance on both a 1- and 2-year basis in our history as a public company, driven by healthy traffic and ticket growth. 
We achieved the strongest quarterly comps of the year in all 3 channels. E-commerce growth was well above plan, and the retail and salon businesses also delivered their best top line growth of the year. 
In terms of categories. Cosmetics, both mass and prestige, continue to lead our growth, with new brands and new items from existing brands contributing to better-than-expected performance. Strength on the top line was broad-based as we gained market share across all major categories. 
Earnings per share rose to $1.40, representing 26% growth, significantly better performance than what we anticipated going into the quarter when our initial outlook called for 13% to 17% earnings per share growth. This upside in EPS was due to better-than-expected top line growth and our continued success with loyalty and CRM efforts. 
I'd now like to highlight some of the key drivers of our third quarter performance in the context of our strategic imperatives, starting with our loyalty program. We grew rolling 12-month active membership by 28% to reach 21.7 million active members as our store teams continued to drive excellent conversion at checkout. Similar to the trends we've seen all year, the loyalty program metrics, including retention rate, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average member ticket, all continued to be very strong. We continue to prioritize more personalized CRM offers for our loyalty members versus broad discounts and promotions. And this evolution in our marketing strategy continues to benefit margin rate and allows us to invest in other parts of the marketing mix such as television, radio and digital advertising, which continue to drive awareness and clarity about our brands. 
Our Ultamate Rewards credit card reward program continues to be well received since its launch in August. We're seeing strong guest engagement both in-store and online. Our team carried out extensive associate training and planning ahead of the launch, resulting in seamless execution of the program. Credit card sign-ups are exceeding expectations. Some of the compelling promotions we're offering for new cardholders are driving higher average baskets and units per transaction as guests take advantage of onetime offers. 
Turning to our marketing and brand awareness activities. Our third quarter marketing plan features signature promotions like 21 Days Of Beauty in September, our Gorgeous Hair events in October and a series of activities focused on raising funds for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. We returned as the official partner to The Ellen DeGeneres Show, putting BCRF and Ulta Beauty on a national stage to millions of viewers each week to raise awareness and funds. Our store teams raised nearly $3 million during this year's Gorgeous Way to Give campaign, and our salon stylists were proud to perform more than 50,000 beauty services at our Cut for a Cause event in support of our BCRF fund-raising program. 
From an advertising perspective, during the fall, we ran national TV and radio ads to support our 21 Days Of Beauty and Gorgeous Hair promotions. The creative is new and built on the inaugural campaign from last year. We continue to also see significant growth in our social platforms, especially Instagram and Snapchat. We recently surpassed 2.6 million fans on Instagram and held our first-ever Snapchat takeover with YouTube influencer, Jenny Fox. We have Wende Zomnir, the Founder and Chief Creative Officer of Urban Decay, take over our Snapchat and Instagram channels, yielding millions of impressions. And we also announced a partnership with E! News with the launch of freeSTYLE, a weekly Facebook Live show. The program includes fan interactions, discussions and reviews of the best and most relevant people, products and trends that matter to the 9.5 million highly engaged E! News Facebook fans. 
Now on the merchandising front. New brands and new products within existing brands drove better-than-expected sales growth with strength across all categories. Similar to what we've experienced all year long, makeup brands like Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Anastasia, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit, Real Techniques and Ardell delivered the highest growth rates in the quarter. Our own Ulta Beauty Collection was also a top performer. We've restaged the brand with new packaging, branding and innovation, and about 600 stores now feature an enhanced wall presentation with improved signage and elevated fixtures. 
In mass skincare, TONYMOLY and Boots No7 were standouts. And our Pro Hair business accelerated, with newness from DevaCurl and Living Proof contributing to strong comps in this category. Living Proof also partnered with our services business for a 1-day salon takeover event to introduce salon guests to this brand. 
And we discussed many of the new brands we're adding to our assortment at our Analyst Day just a few weeks ago, but let me recap a few of the highlights. During the third quarter, we launched Estée Lauder skincare and cosmetics in 30 stores and online. We launched Shiseido, Origins and proactiv, greatly enhancing our skincare offering. We added e.l.f. to our online assortment. We introduced the innovation -- the innovative Dyson hairdryer in 200 stores and online. We've also completed almost all of the 500-plus Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques planned for the year. In addition, we added a best of Clinique endcap in all stores that don't have a full Clinique boutique. 
Now turning to our services business. Salon sales grew 16.7% and comped 10.3% with strength in color, hair treatment and makeup services. Our services business is increasingly using CRM campaigns to drive awareness and encourage trial of our service offerings. We rolled out our improved online booking experience to all stores during the quarter to make it even easier for our guests to make an appointment in our salons. 
We continue to focus on elevating our in-house artistic team and curating design trends exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Our fall and holiday trends include a look we call Sombre, which is a new softer way to achieve an ombre look; and a new color we call ronze, highlights that bring together beautiful shades of copper and auburn. The artistic team participated in several designer runway shows at Fashion Week, driving awareness for Ulta Beauty's hair authority and inspiring the entire salon team across the chain. And our Benefit Brow boutiques continued their excellent performance with brow services now available in more than 800 stores and the successful launch of a wide range of new brow products in more shades. We're now testing online booking for brow services to make it easier for our guests to make an appointment in our Benefit Brow Bars. 
Turning to store growth. We opened 42 stores in the third quarter, on our way to executing our 2016 program of 100 net new stores, ending the quarter with 949 stores. Our growth and development team has completed almost all of the 500-plus prestige brand boutiques we planned for this year, including new stores and remodels, along with updates to the Ulta Beauty Collection in fragrance and nail fixtures. 
New store productivity remains very strong, with the class of 2016 stores performing well above budget and far-above sales hurdles established to meet our internal rate of return threshold. We've already approved all of the 100 stores planned for our 2017 program, including a new store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago. 
As you heard in our Analyst Day, we completed our in-depth analysis of the real estate opportunity in the U.S. and announced a new long-term target to roll out between 1,400 to 1,700 stores, with opportunities to further penetrate existing suburban markets, expand our penetration in small markets and begin to develop urban markets. At the same time, we updated our new store maturation ramp based on current trends and higher new store productivity, upgrading year 1 sales from $2.8 million to $3.1 million and revising upward our year 5 sales estimate to $4.5 million from $4 million. We're confident that our stores will continue to produce very attractive returns. 
Turning to our e-commerce business. ulta.com sales grew 59.1% on top of 56.3% growth last year, contributing 240 basis points to our total company comp. The strong revenue growth was driven entirely by increased transactions. We continue to evolve and upgrade the guest experience while improving site performance. We made enhancements to our mobile app, including a product detail page redesign to better display product options and information, integration of our recently launched content platform called The Mix and the addition of our new salon appointment booking tool. We launched a try-on feature called GLAM LAB last month to allow guests to virtually test products and shades within our iPhone and Android app by uploading a selfie or choosing a model with a similar complexion. Our technology partner for this platform is a company known for best-in-class realism and accuracy of color matching. 
Finally, to update you on supply chain performance and investments, we are very pleased and proud with how smoothly our team has executed on a very complex set of initiatives and system rollouts in addition to opening 2 new DCs in the past 1.5 years. Our Greenwood DC is now serving 227 stores and fulfilling 44% of our e-commerce orders. Our newest distribution center in Dallas is ramping on schedule and currently fulfilling 130 stores and 30% of total e-com orders. 
On the systems side, we're starting to see benefits from the core merchandise systems we recently implemented. SWIFT, our new forecasting replenishment tool, continues to ramp up and help us optimize inventory. Our store-level in-stocks are improving and more of our inventory is in our stores versus in our DCs, improving the guest experience. We now have all the tools in place to help us make better, more data-based assortment and inventory decisions. 
So that wraps up my third quarter review. Looking ahead to holiday, we're expecting healthy traffic and strong sales growth as a result of our integrated merchandising and marketing plan. From a product standpoint, we're excited to offer an array of newness and exclusivity on our holiday assortment across all categories and brands. 
To share a few highlights, we'll feature an assortment of Clinique and Lancôme products in every store for holiday. We just launched NARS, featuring 3 hero products: their famous blush, bronzer and a multipurpose stick, The Multiple. These are available online and featured on the [indiscernible] in every store in time for holiday with a more expansive assortment offered online later this month and then launched in select stores next year. 
Our merchants have done a great job partnering with our brands to offer exclusive products across many brands and categories, a wide variety of holiday-themed kits and stocking stuffers and men's grooming and fragrance kits. This year, we upgraded our fragrance gift with purchase program, complementing the exciting newness in our holiday fragrance assortment. And we've also launched an elevated Ulta Beauty Collection of our traditional blockbuster kits that have already shown strong consumer response. And to support our compelling merchandise offering, we rolled out our holiday advertising campaign JOY TO THE GIRL, which is integrated from a design and messaging perspective across all touch points from in-store signage to new TV and radio spots running now to print and even the packaging of our Ulta Beauty Collection holiday assortment. Our campaign encouraged our guests to see us as a great gift-giving destination as well as a place to get glammed up for holiday events with a visit to our salon. The guest gifts and get glammed theme is featured in television and radio spots through inspirational content on our social media platform and on The Mix on our website. 
Key to executing our holiday plan, our store operations, e-commerce, supply chain and systems teams have all done an excellent job preparing for the busy holiday season, and their efforts have already paid off with the successful Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend both in stores and online. All areas are staffed up and ready to delight our guests during the big weeks ahead. 
So now I'll hand over to Scott to discuss our third quarter financials and our outlook for the fourth quarter."

Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 24.2% to $1.13 billion, driven by 16.7% comparable sales and continued strong performance of new stores. The total company comp was composed of 11.1% transaction growth and 5.6% average ticket growth. The retail comp of 14.6% was comprised of 9.6% traffic and 5% ticket. Ticket growth was driven about 1/3 by units per transaction and about 2/3 by average selling price. The Salon business comped 10.3% and, similar to the recent trend, was driven by ticket growth. The combined retail comp and salon comp yielded a total store comp of 14.3%. 
Gross profit increased 90 basis points. The improvement was the result of product margin expansion and leverage of store rent and occupancy expenses on strong comps, offset by planned supply chain investments. 
Turning to SG&A expense. We deleveraged by 80 basis points, driven by investments in growth initiatives, including store payroll to support our boutique strategy and a differentiated guest experience; and deleverage of corporate overhead cost, in part due to an impairment charge related to the closure of a store in Louisiana due to the August flooding. This was partially offset by modest leverage in marketing. 
The tax rate was 37.4%, consistent with the first half of the year. Last year's Q3 tax rate of 36% reflected the benefit of some tax true-ups. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Inventories increased 16.5% on a per-store basis, which is slightly below the comp rate. Similar to the recent trend, we continue to invest in inventory to support sales growth, gain access to new brands and expand the presence of prestige boutiques in our stores. Also, our new distribution centers in Greenwood and Dallas are ramping and performing well but are still far from being fully optimized. 
Capital expenditures were $131.6 million for the quarter, driven by new store openings, fixtures related to the continued rollout of boutiques as well as investments in systems. We ended the quarter with $243 million in cash and short-term investments. 
In terms of share buybacks, we continue to repurchase shares in the open market as part of our 10b5-1 plan. During the third quarter, we repurchased about 179,000 shares of our stock at a cost of just over $44 million. Year-to-date, including the accelerated share repurchase program and activity under our 10b5-1 plan, we repurchased approximately 1,450,000 shares at an average price of about $205 per share. Share repurchases under our current authorization are expected to contribute about 2 points of EPS growth for the year. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $148 million remaining available under the $425 million share repurchase program announced in March 2016. 
Turning now to guidance for the fourth quarter. We anticipate sales to be in a range of $1.516 billion to $1.541 billion versus $1.268 billion last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 12% to 14% versus 12.5% last year. E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the 40% range. We plan to open about 25 stores in the fourth quarter versus 14 last year, so preopening expense will be higher. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.13 versus $1.69 last year, with modest leverage on both the gross profit and SG&A lines. The tax rate is expected to be 37.5%, and our fully diluted share count is estimated at 63 million. 
At our Analyst Day event in October, we raised our guidance for the full year 2016, expecting comparable sales to grow approximately 12% to 14%, including the impact of the e-commerce business and EPS to increase in the mid-20s percentage range. 
Now with the upside to third quarter earnings, we expect full year comparable sales to grow 13% to 15% and earnings growth to be in the high 20s percentage range. Operating margin is expected to be up modestly for the year. 
CapEx is on track to reach approximately $390 million, driven by slightly higher CapEx per new store and also includes about $80 million for boutique expansion, with 500-plus store touches for Clinique, Lancôme, and Benefit boutiques as well as fragrance fixtures and Ulta Beauty Collection updates.

So we mentioned pulling back on broader kind of promotional efforts and kind of redeploying some of that into more targeted things with our loyalty and CRM tools. I mean, that just continues to work really well. So we're a pragmatic crew here. One of the fortunate things we have in this model is being able to toggle while we're in the quarter, right, and watching sales trends. So we mentioned the credit card got off to a spectacular start as we got into the quarter. We weren't expecting it to be quite so strong. So again, Mary mentioned there was a -- there's a nice offer there, right, 20% off your entire purchase when you sign up initially. So as we saw that kind of take off, we are able to pull back on the postcard that we typically do later in the quarter. So again, just looking at all the different elements and levers that we have to pull and try to optimize total results each quarter."

And specifically, you asked about department stores brands or big established brands versus upstarts. And frankly, I think we're looking for both. We talked about expansion in some of the biggest established prestige brands. You know we've been continuing to expand our partnership with Clinique and Lancôme. We're just getting started with Estée Lauder and NARS, and -- but then upstarts has been a big part of our success over time, and we feel really privileged to be partnering with smaller brands that are innovating in new and creative ways. Makeup Revolution in the mass cosmetic space is one example of that, that has demonstrated some nice growth. So we'll look -- we will look for those opportunities as well, and both of those areas will continue to drive our growth."

We see strong and growing ROI across that probably most visible vehicle in TV. But other elements of our marketing plan, really all elements of our marketing plan are coming together to continue to drive awareness and growth. Radio is a strong contributor to that, but we've been investing much more heavily in the digital space, in awareness, in social media, influencer, really across our entire digital footprint to connect with our guest where she wants to be connected. Mary mentioned in her remarks, our Ulta Beauty Mix is an example of that on our own website, of creating our own content as a big push, also partnering with influencers to drive that. So TV is a big part of it. We're pleased with the results. We're continuing that as we speak over the holiday period. We're back on air, and we see that as a part of our mix.

I would say on the traffic versus ticket, to me, the ideal is just to be balanced, and we've been doing that, I think, pretty effectively. Last quarter, I think we were about 2/3 traffic, 1/3 ticket, and retail online was mostly transact -- traffic, which is great. But that balance is important because it's the ability to just continue to grow the business and not be reliant on just sort of a set number of people and visits. So a balance I think we'd expect to hope -- it's never going to be exactly that every quarter, but that's the overall goal. In terms of e-comm profitability, I mean, I guess that's a constant area of focus. First of all, our e-commerce business has gotten more profitable in the last couple of years as we've expanded the assortment, certainly the investments in supply chain, being able to get those orders together in more effective and efficient way. It will probably always be a somewhat lower profit margin than in the bricks-and-mortar part of the business just because of the shipping costs, but we're happy with it. I mean, the online business, as you can tell as we talked at Analyst Day, it looks to be quite incremental to our guests in terms of how she uses the channel. And so as we continue to close the gap on profit margin, it's a great part of the business."

And we think specifically within makeup, a lot of trends driving makeup. It is the fastest-growing segment of beauty right now, and that's really driven by a high-level engagement, particularly with young women, teens and millennials but really across all age groups and all ethnicities. Hispanic and all women of color, in particular, are heavily engaged in makeup. There's more education and training and knowledge and trends around different makeup looks and styles. So it is just a really healthy category, and our participation in that has expanded through the brands that we're carrying, the way we're marketing it, the way we're participating in social media, so we're benefiting from that. Skincare has been struggling for a few years but has shown some nice signs of growth. Korean skincare has played a role in that. We're seeing strong growth in different aspects. Masks are a big part but other Asian skincare trends are driving growth. And overall recognition by millennials, in particular, that it isn't all about makeup, but you need to make sure your skin is in good shape as well. And so we're seeing a nice rebound at skincare. Other categories, fragrance, that's -- isn't growing anywhere near the level of makeup but a lot of innovation in that space. We, of course, have been driving that with -- one example of that is our Sarah Jessica Parker exclusive, STASH. So a lot of different reasons across key categories, and we -- it's a big focus for Ulta to make sure that we're front and center in all of those trends."

So I mean, I really -- can't really comment on what people are doing or not doing. We certainly pay a lot of attention and are out there watching it as well. I'm proud about the fact that I think we're leading through guest insights and really driving execution through a lot of collaboration, and it's working."

In terms of the class of store, is this a situation where as you go to the kind of next tier down of stores that we shouldn't expect the same sort of returns on the boutiques or perhaps you're not wanting to expand further? Just any color on the boutiques would be helpful. And then secondly, just on e-commerce with the implied deceleration relative to 3Q.

We've really been rolling them out in our comp stores based on what's optimal from a scheduling standpoint, where it can fit lease terms for stores. Because we do other activities within the store when we put a boutique in. We'll  update our Ulta Beauty Collection presentation. In some cases, we put in a new fragrance presentation. So it is a part -- an important part but only a portion of the activity that we have in store when we put that in. So we'll continue to put those in next year and see that again. I'd say -- well, so that's important. It is one element of the new brand activity that we'll have across the whole chain next year. And as far as e-com growth in the fourth quarter, we just -- we feel confident within the guidance that we've given, and we'll continue to try to focus on that business.

It's becoming more important to us than ever in terms of driving sales and traffic, and it's fast-growing. We've been innovating in terms of our mobile platform, and I mentioned already but an example  is GLAM LAB, which is a nice little piece of technology that I'm not good enough to take my selfie to really execute it well. I've tried. But it's a great thing for millennials who want to have a more interactive experience. So as our offering and our execution in mobile improve, we just get stronger there.

Highlights of the quarter in",2136,"Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon. Ulta Beauty's top line momentum accelerated in the third quarter, driving record sales and earnings performance. The team continues to execute exceptionally well against our key strategies. 
Highlights of the quarter include success in acquiring new brands, strength in overall newness, increases in awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand, continued excellent results from our loyalty program, improving performance of our supply chain and systems and robust growth in our e-commerce business. 
In the third quarter, we grew the top line 24.2% and delivered 16.7% comp sales on top of a 12.8% comp in the third quarter of last year. This is the best comp performance on both a 1- and 2-year basis in our history as a public company, driven by healthy traffic and ticket growth. 
We achieved the strongest quarterly comps of the year in all 3 channels. E-commerce growth was well above plan, and the retail and salon businesses also delivered their best top line growth of the year. 
In terms of categories. Cosmetics, both mass and prestige, continue to lead our growth, with new brands and new items from existing brands contributing to better-than-expected performance. Strength on the top line was broad-based as we gained market share across all major categories. 
Earnings per share rose to $1.40, representing 26% growth, significantly better performance than what we anticipated going into the quarter when our initial outlook called for 13% to 17% earnings per share growth. This upside in EPS was due to better-than-expected top line growth and our continued success with loyalty and CRM efforts. 
I'd now like to highlight some of the key drivers of our third quarter performance in the context of our strategic imperatives, starting with our loyalty program. We grew rolling 12-month active membership by 28% to reach 21.7 million active members as our store teams continued to drive excellent conversion at checkout. Similar to the trends we've seen all year, the loyalty program metrics, including retention rate, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average member ticket, all continued to be very strong. We continue to prioritize more personalized CRM offers for our loyalty members versus broad discounts and promotions. And this evolution in our marketing strategy continues to benefit margin rate and allows us to invest in other parts of the marketing mix such as television, radio and digital advertising, which continue to drive awareness and clarity about our brands. 
Our Ultamate Rewards credit card reward program continues to be well received since its launch in August. We're seeing strong guest engagement both in-store and online. Our team carried out extensive associate training and planning ahead of the launch, resulting in seamless execution of the program. Credit card sign-ups are exceeding expectations. Some of the compelling promotions we're offering for new cardholders are driving higher average baskets and units per transaction as guests take advantage of onetime offers. 
Turning to our marketing and brand awareness activities. Our third quarter marketing plan features signature promotions like 21 Days Of Beauty in September, our Gorgeous Hair events in October and a series of activities focused on raising funds for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. We returned as the official partner to The Ellen DeGeneres Show, putting BCRF and Ulta Beauty on a national stage to millions of viewers each week to raise awareness and funds. Our store teams raised nearly $3 million during this year's Gorgeous Way to Give campaign, and our salon stylists were proud to perform more than 50,000 beauty services at our Cut for a Cause event in support of our BCRF fund-raising program. 
From an advertising perspective, during the fall, we ran national TV and radio ads to support our 21 Days Of Beauty and Gorgeous Hair promotions. The creative is new and built on the inaugural campaign from last year. We continue to also see significant growth in our social platforms, especially Instagram and Snapchat. We recently surpassed 2.6 million fans on Instagram and held our first-ever Snapchat takeover with YouTube influencer, Jenny Fox. We have Wende Zomnir, the Founder and Chief Creative Officer of Urban Decay, take over our Snapchat and Instagram channels, yielding millions of impressions. And we also announced a partnership with E! News with the launch of freeSTYLE, a weekly Facebook Live show. The program includes fan interactions, discussions and reviews of the best and most relevant people, products and trends that matter to the 9.5 million highly engaged E! News Facebook fans. 
Now on the merchandising front. New brands and new products within existing brands drove better-than-expected sales growth with strength across all categories. Similar to what we've experienced all year long, makeup brands like Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Anastasia, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit, Real Techniques and Ardell delivered the highest growth rates in the quarter. Our own Ulta Beauty Collection was also a top performer. We've restaged the brand with new packaging, branding and innovation, and about 600 stores now feature an enhanced wall presentation with improved signage and elevated fixtures. 
In mass skincare, TONYMOLY and Boots No7 were standouts. And our Pro Hair business accelerated, with newness from DevaCurl and Living Proof contributing to strong comps in this category. Living Proof also partnered with our services business for a 1-day salon takeover event to introduce salon guests to this brand. 
And we discussed many of the new brands we're adding to our assortment at our Analyst Day just a few weeks ago, but let me recap a few of the highlights. During the third quarter, we launched Estée Lauder skincare and cosmetics in 30 stores and online. We launched Shiseido, Origins and proactiv, greatly enhancing our skincare offering. We added e.l.f. to our online assortment. We introduced the innovation -- the innovative Dyson hairdryer in 200 stores and online. We've also completed almost all of the 500-plus Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques planned for the year. In addition, we added a best of Clinique endcap in all stores that don't have a full Clinique boutique. 
Now turning to our services business. Salon sales grew 16.7% and comped 10.3% with strength in color, hair treatment and makeup services. Our services business is increasingly using CRM campaigns to drive awareness and encourage trial of our service offerings. We rolled out our improved online booking experience to all stores during the quarter to make it even easier for our guests to make an appointment in our salons. 
We continue to focus on elevating our in-house artistic team and curating design trends exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Our fall and holiday trends include a look we call Sombre, which is a new softer way to achieve an ombre look; and a new color we call ronze, highlights that bring together beautiful shades of copper and auburn. The artistic team participated in several designer runway shows at Fashion Week, driving awareness for Ulta Beauty's hair authority and inspiring the entire salon team across the chain. And our Benefit Brow boutiques continued their excellent performance with brow services now available in more than 800 stores and the successful launch of a wide range of new brow products in more shades. We're now testing online booking for brow services to make it easier for our guests to make an appointment in our Benefit Brow Bars. 
Turning to store growth. We opened 42 stores in the third quarter, on our way to executing our 2016 program of 100 net new stores, ending the quarter with 949 stores. Our growth and development team has completed almost all of the 500-plus prestige brand boutiques we planned for this year, including new stores and remodels, along with updates to the Ulta Beauty Collection in fragrance and nail fixtures. 
New store productivity remains very strong, with the class of 2016 stores performing well above budget and far-above sales hurdles established to meet our internal rate of return threshold. We've already approved all of the 100 stores planned for our 2017 program, including a new store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago. 
As you heard in our Analyst Day, we completed our in-depth analysis of the real estate opportunity in the U.S. and announced a new long-term target to roll out between 1,400 to 1,700 stores, with opportunities to further penetrate existing suburban markets, expand our penetration in small markets and begin to develop urban markets. At the same time, we updated our new store maturation ramp based on current trends and higher new store productivity, upgrading year 1 sales from $2.8 million to $3.1 million and revising upward our year 5 sales estimate to $4.5 million from $4 million. We're confident that our stores will continue to produce very attractive returns. 
Turning to our e-commerce business. ulta.com sales grew 59.1% on top of 56.3% growth last year, contributing 240 basis points to our total company comp. The strong revenue growth was driven entirely by increased transactions. We continue to evolve and upgrade the guest experience while improving site performance. We made enhancements to our mobile app, including a product detail page redesign to better display product options and information, integration of our recently launched content platform called The Mix and the addition of our new salon appointment booking tool. We launched a try-on feature called GLAM LAB last month to allow guests to virtually test products and shades within our iPhone and Android app by uploading a selfie or choosing a model with a similar complexion. Our technology partner for this platform is a company known for best-in-class realism and accuracy of color matching. 
Finally, to update you on supply chain performance and investments, we are very pleased and proud with how smoothly our team has executed on a very complex set of initiatives and system rollouts in addition to opening 2 new DCs in the past 1.5 years. Our Greenwood DC is now serving 227 stores and fulfilling 44% of our e-commerce orders. Our newest distribution center in Dallas is ramping on schedule and currently fulfilling 130 stores and 30% of total e-com orders. 
On the systems side, we're starting to see benefits from the core merchandise systems we recently implemented. SWIFT, our new forecasting replenishment tool, continues to ramp up and help us optimize inventory. Our store-level in-stocks are improving and more of our inventory is in our stores versus in our DCs, improving the guest experience. We now have all the tools in place to help us make better, more data-based assortment and inventory decisions. 
So that wraps up my third quarter review. Looking ahead to holiday, we're expecting healthy traffic and strong sales growth as a result of our integrated merchandising and marketing plan. From a product standpoint, we're excited to offer an array of newness and exclusivity on our holiday assortment across all categories and brands. 
To share a few highlights, we'll feature an assortment of Clinique and Lancôme products in every store for holiday. We just launched NARS, featuring 3 hero products: their famous blush, bronzer and a multipurpose stick, The Multiple. These are available online and featured on the [indiscernible] in every store in time for holiday with a more expansive assortment offered online later this month and then launched in select stores next year. 
Our merchants have done a great job partnering with our brands to offer exclusive products across many brands and categories, a wide variety of holiday-themed kits and stocking stuffers and men's grooming and fragrance kits. This year, we upgraded our fragrance gift with purchase program, complementing the exciting newness in our holiday fragrance assortment. And we've also launched an elevated Ulta Beauty Collection of our traditional blockbuster kits that have already shown strong consumer response. And to support our compelling merchandise offering, we rolled out our holiday advertising campaign JOY TO THE GIRL, which is integrated from a design and messaging perspective across all touch points from in-store signage to new TV and radio spots running now to print and even the packaging of our Ulta Beauty Collection holiday assortment. Our campaign encouraged our guests to see us as a great gift-giving destination as well as a place to get glammed up for holiday events with a visit to our salon. The guest gifts and get glammed theme is featured in television and radio spots through inspirational content on our social media platform and on The Mix on our website. 
Key to executing our holiday plan, our store operations, e-commerce, supply chain and systems teams have all done an excellent job preparing for the busy holiday season, and their efforts have already paid off with the successful Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend both in stores and online. All areas are staffed up and ready to delight our guests during the big weeks ahead. 
So now I'll hand over to Scott to discuss our third quarter financials and our outlook for the fourth quarter."

Net sales for the quarter increased 24.2% to $1.13 billion, driven by 16.7% comparable sales and continued strong performance of new stores. The total company comp was composed",721,"Thanks, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 24.2% to $1.13 billion, driven by 16.7% comparable sales and continued strong performance of new stores. The total company comp was composed of 11.1% transaction growth and 5.6% average ticket growth. The retail comp of 14.6% was comprised of 9.6% traffic and 5% ticket. Ticket growth was driven about 1/3 by units per transaction and about 2/3 by average selling price. The Salon business comped 10.3% and, similar to the recent trend, was driven by ticket growth. The combined retail comp and salon comp yielded a total store comp of 14.3%. 
Gross profit increased 90 basis points. The improvement was the result of product margin expansion and leverage of store rent and occupancy expenses on strong comps, offset by planned supply chain investments. 
Turning to SG&A expense. We deleveraged by 80 basis points, driven by investments in growth initiatives, including store payroll to support our boutique strategy and a differentiated guest experience; and deleverage of corporate overhead cost, in part due to an impairment charge related to the closure of a store in Louisiana due to the August flooding. This was partially offset by modest leverage in marketing. 
The tax rate was 37.4%, consistent with the first half of the year. Last year's Q3 tax rate of 36% reflected the benefit of some tax true-ups. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Inventories increased 16.5% on a per-store basis, which is slightly below the comp rate. Similar to the recent trend, we continue to invest in inventory to support sales growth, gain access to new brands and expand the presence of prestige boutiques in our stores. Also, our new distribution centers in Greenwood and Dallas are ramping and performing well but are still far from being fully optimized. 
Capital expenditures were $131.6 million for the quarter, driven by new store openings, fixtures related to the continued rollout of boutiques as well as investments in systems. We ended the quarter with $243 million in cash and short-term investments. 
In terms of share buybacks, we continue to repurchase shares in the open market as part of our 10b5-1 plan. During the third quarter, we repurchased about 179,000 shares of our stock at a cost of just over $44 million. Year-to-date, including the accelerated share repurchase program and activity under our 10b5-1 plan, we repurchased approximately 1,450,000 shares at an average price of about $205 per share. Share repurchases under our current authorization are expected to contribute about 2 points of EPS growth for the year. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $148 million remaining available under the $425 million share repurchase program announced in March 2016. 
Turning now to guidance for the fourth quarter. We anticipate sales to be in a range of $1.516 billion to $1.541 billion versus $1.268 billion last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 12% to 14% versus 12.5% last year. E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the 40% range. We plan to open about 25 stores in the fourth quarter versus 14 last year, so preopening expense will be higher. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.13 versus $1.69 last year, with modest leverage on both the gross profit and SG&A lines. The tax rate is expected to be 37.5%, and our fully diluted share count is estimated at 63 million. 
At our Analyst Day event in October, we raised our guidance for the full year 2016, expecting comparable sales to grow approximately 12% to 14%, including the impact of the e-commerce business and EPS to increase in the mid-20s percentage range. 
Now with the upside to third quarter earnings, we expect full year comparable sales to grow 13% to 15% and earnings growth to be in the high 20s percentage range. Operating margin is expected to be up modestly for the year. 
CapEx is on track to reach approximately $390 million, driven by slightly higher CapEx per new store and also includes about $80 million for boutique expansion, with 500-plus store touches for Clinique, Lancôme, and Benefit boutiques as well as fragrance fixtures and Ulta Beauty Collection updates.

So we mentioned the credit card got off to a spectacular start as we got into the quarter. We weren't expecting it to be quite so strong. So again, Mary mentioned there was a -- there's a nice offer there, right, 20% off your entire purchase when you sign up initially.

We talked about expansion in some of the biggest established prestige brands. You know we've been continuing to expand our partnership with Clinique and Lancôme. We're just getting started with Estée Lauder and NARS, and -- but then upstarts has been a big part of our success over time, and we feel really privileged to be partnering with smaller brands that are innovating in new and creative ways.

Just curious, I know you don't probably manage the business to it. But just curious as you think about -- when you head into 2017 or beyond, what do you think is the makeup of that comp performance you've laid out between ticket and traffic and what might be the drivers? And then, just a second quick one, is online profitability versus the store four-walls, like what kind of sales volume perhaps does the online business need to be to reach parity?"

I would say on the traffic versus ticket, to me, the ideal is just to be balanced, and we've been doing that, I think, pretty effectively. Last quarter, I think we were about 2/3 traffic, 1/3 ticket, and retail online was mostly transact -- traffic,",239,"Yes. I would say on the traffic versus ticket, to me, the ideal is just to be balanced, and we've been doing that, I think, pretty effectively. Last quarter, I think we were about 2/3 traffic, 1/3 ticket, and retail online was mostly transact -- traffic, which is great. But that balance is important because it's the ability to just continue to grow the business and not be reliant on just sort of a set number of people and visits. So a balance I think we'd expect to hope -- it's never going to be exactly that every quarter, but that's the overall goal. In terms of e-comm profitability, I mean, I guess that's a constant area of focus. First of all, our e-commerce business has gotten more profitable in the last couple of years as we've expanded the assortment, certainly the investments in supply chain, being able to get those orders together in more effective and efficient way. It will probably always be a somewhat lower profit margin than in the bricks-and-mortar part of the business just because of the shipping costs, but we're happy with it. I mean, the online business, as you can tell as we talked at Analyst Day, it looks to be quite incremental to our guests in terms of how she uses the channel. And so as we continue to close the gap on profit margin, it's a great part of the business."

On the specific categories, I guess, I'd just say that we're, one, really pleased across all categories that we're seeing strong growth. I think Mary mentioned in her remarks that we're gaining share in each of our key categories. And the drivers, overall, we've talked about in the past is just a highly engaged consumer in beauty and our continued ability to connect with her and gain market share and gain her trust and loyalty and wallet share. And we think specifically within makeup, a lot of trends driving makeup. It is the fastest-growing segment of beauty right now, and that's really driven by a high-level engagement, particularly with young women, teens and millennials but really across all age groups and all ethnicities. Hispanic and all women of color, in particular, are heavily engaged in makeup. There's more education and training and knowledge and trends around different makeup looks and styles. So it is just a really healthy category, and our participation in that has expanded through the brands that we're carrying, the way we're marketing it, the way we're participating in social media, so we're benefiting from that. Skincare has been struggling for a few years but has shown some nice signs of growth. Korean skincare has played a role in that. We're seeing strong growth in different aspects. Masks are a big part but other Asian skincare trends are driving growth. And overall recognition by millennials, in particular, that it isn't all about makeup, but you need to make sure your skin is in good shape as well. And so we're seeing a nice rebound at skincare. Other categories, fragrance, that's -- isn't growing anywhere near the level of makeup but a lot of innovation in that space. We, of course, have been driving that with -- one example of that is our Sarah Jessica Parker exclusive, STASH. So a lot of different reasons across key categories, and we -- it's a big focus for Ulta to make sure that we're front and center in all of those trends."

We all -- everybody understands that mobile is the center of everybody's life. It's our appendage, our attachment. And I'm proud about the fact that I think as a company, our team has really been increasing our focus and our execution around mobile. It's becoming more important to us than ever in terms of driving sales and traffic, and it's fast-growing. We've been innovating in terms of our mobile platform, and I mentioned already but an example  is GLAM LAB, which is a nice little piece of technology that I'm not good enough to take my selfie to really execute it well. I've tried. But it's a great thing for millennials who want to have a more interactive experience. So as our offering and our execution in mobile improve, we just get stronger there.

Is there anything else you might want to add, Dave, in terms of  innovation there?"

And then we also kind of -- we were also -- with people cost-associated expenses in the quarter, again the way we kind of operate out. But we finally get all of our corporate headcount kind of adds in place usually in the third quarter.

Ulta Beauty's top line momentum accelerated in the third quarter, driving record sales and earnings performance. The team continues to execute exceptionally well against our key strategies. Highlights of the quarter in",2134,"Thank you, Laurel. Good afternoon. Ulta Beauty's top line momentum accelerated in the third quarter, driving record sales and earnings performance. The team continues to execute exceptionally well against our key strategies. 
Highlights of the quarter include success in acquiring new brands, strength in overall newness, increases in awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand, continued excellent results from our loyalty program, improving performance of our supply chain and systems and robust growth in our e-commerce business. 
In the third quarter, we grew the top line 24.2% and delivered 16.7% comp sales on top of the 12.8% comp in the third quarter of last year. This is the best comp performance on both a 1- and 2-year basis in our history as a public company, driven by healthy traffic and ticket growth. 
We achieved the strongest quarterly comps of the year in all 3 channels. E-commerce growth was well above plan, and the retail and salon businesses also delivered their best top line growth of the year. 
In terms of categories. Cosmetics, both mass and prestige, continued to lead our growth, with new brands and new items from existing brands contributing to better-than-expected performance. Strength on the top line was broad-based as we gained market share across all major categories. 
Earnings per share rose to $1.40, representing 26% growth, significantly better performance than what we anticipated going into the quarter when our initial outlook called for 13% to 17% earnings per share growth. This upside in EPS was due to better-than-expected top line growth and our continued success with loyalty and CRM efforts. 
I'd now like to highlight some of the key drivers of our third quarter performance in the context of our strategic imperatives, starting with our loyalty program. We grew rolling 12-month active membership by 28% to reach 21.7 million active members as our store teams continued to drive excellent conversion at checkout. Similar to the trends we've seen all year, the loyalty program metrics, including retention rate, sales per member, frequency of purchase and average member ticket, all continued to be very strong. We continued to prioritize more personalized CRM offers for our loyalty members versus broad discounts and promotions. And this evolution in our marketing strategy continues to benefit margin rate and allows us to invest in other parts of the marketing mix such as television, radio and digital advertising, which continue to drive awareness and clarity about our brands. 
Our Ultamate Rewards credit card reward program continues to be well received since its launch in August. We're seeing strong guest engagement both in-store and online. Our team carried out extensive associate training and planning ahead of the launch, resulting in seamless execution of the program. Credit card sign-ups are exceeding expectations. Some of the compelling promotions we're offering for new cardholders are driving higher average baskets and units per transaction as guests take advantage of onetime offers. 
Turning to our marketing and brand awareness activities. Our third quarter marketing plan features signature promotions like 21 Days Of Beauty in September, our Gorgeous Hair events in October and a series of activities focused on raising funds for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. We returned as the official partner to The Ellen DeGeneres Show, putting BCRF and Ulta Beauty on a national stage to millions of viewers each week to raise awareness and funds. Our store teams raised nearly $3 million during this year's Gorgeous Way to Give campaign, and our salon stylists were proud to perform more than 50,000 beauty services at our Cut for a Cause event in support of our BCRF fund-raising program. 
From an advertising perspective, during the fall, we ran national TV and radio ads to support our 21 Days Of Beauty and Gorgeous Hair promotions. The creative is new and built on the inaugural campaign from last year. We continue to also see significant growth in our social platforms, especially Instagram and Snapchat. We recently surpassed 2.6 million fans on Instagram and held our first-ever Snapchat takeover with YouTube influencer, Jenny Fox. We have Wende Zomnir, the Founder and Chief Creative Officer of Urban Decay, take over our Snapchat and Instagram channels, yielding millions of impressions. And we also announced a partnership with E! News with the launch of freeSTYLE, a weekly Facebook Live show. The program includes fan interactions, discussions and reviews of the best and most relevant people, products and trends that matter to the 9.5 million highly engaged E! News Facebook fans. 
Now on the merchandising front. New brands and new products within existing brands drove better-than-expected sales growth with strength across all categories. Similar to what we've experienced all year long, makeup brands like Urban Decay, IT Cosmetics, NYX, Anastasia, Too Faced, Tarte, Clinique, Lancôme, Benefit, Real Techniques and Ardell delivered the highest growth rates in the quarter. Our own Ulta Beauty Collection was also a top performer. We've restaged the brand with new packaging, branding and innovation and about 600 stores now featuring enhanced wall presentation with improved signage and elevated fixtures. 
In mass skincare, TONYMOLY and Boots No7 were standouts. And our Pro Hair business accelerated, with newness from DevaCurl and Living Proof contributing to strong comps in this category. Living Proof also partnered with our services business for a 1-day salon takeover event to introduce salon guests to this brand. 
And we discussed many of the new brands we're adding to our assortment at our Analyst Day just a few weeks ago, but let me recap a few of the highlights. During the third quarter, we launched Estée Lauder skincare and cosmetics in 30 stores and online. We launched Shiseido, Origins and proactiv, greatly enhancing our skincare offering. We added e.l.f. to our online assortment. We introduced the innovation -- the innovative Dyson hairdryer in 200 stores and online. We've also completed almost all of the 500-plus Clinique, Lancôme and Benefit boutiques planned for the year. In addition, we added a best of Clinique endcap in all stores that don't have a full Clinique boutique. 
Now turning to our services business. Salon sales grew 16.7% and comped 10.3% with strength in color, hair treatment and makeup services. Our services business is increasingly using CRM campaigns to drive awareness and encourage trial of our service offerings. We rolled out our improved online booking experience to all stores during the quarter to make it even easier for our guests to make an appointment in our salons. 
We continue to focus on elevating our in-house artistic team and curating design trends exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Our fall and holiday trends include a look we call Sombre, which is a new softer way to achieve an ombre look; and a new color we call ronze, highlights that bring together beautiful shades of copper and auburn. The artistic team participated in several designer runway shows at Fashion Week, driving awareness for Ulta Beauty's hair authority and inspiring the entire salon team across the chain. And our Benefit Brow boutiques continued their excellent performance with brow services now available in more than 800 stores and the successful launch of a wide range of new brow products in more shades. We're now testing online booking for brow services to make it easier for our guests to make an appointment in our Benefit Brow Bars. 
Turning to store growth. We opened 42 stores in the third quarter, on our way to executing our 2016 program of 100 net new stores, ending the quarter with 949 stores. Our growth and development team has completed almost all of the 500-plus prestige brand boutiques we planned for this year, including new stores and remodels, along with updates to the Ulta Beauty Collection of fragrance and nail fixtures. 
New store productivity remains very strong, with the class of 2016 stores performing well above budget and far-above sales hurdles established to meet our internal rate of return threshold. We've already approved all of the 100 stores planned for 2017 program, including a new store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago. 
As you heard in our Analyst Day, we completed our in-depth analysis of the real estate opportunity in the U.S. and announced a new long-term target to roll out between 1,400 to 1,700 stores, with opportunities to further penetrate existing suburban markets, expand our penetration in small markets and begin to develop urban markets. At the same time, we updated our new store maturation ramp based on current trends and higher new store productivity, upgrading year 1 sales from $2.8 million to $3.1 million and revising upward our year 5 sales estimate to $4.5 million from $4 million. We're confident that our stores will continue to produce very attractive returns. 
Turning to our e-commerce business. ulta.com sales grew 59.1% on top of 56.3% growth last year, contributing 240 basis points to our total company comp. The strong revenue growth was driven entirely by increased transactions. We continue to evolve and upgrade the guest experience while improving site performance. We made enhancements to our mobile app, including our product detail page redesigned to better display product options and information, integration of our recently launched content platform called The Mix and the addition of our new salon appointment booking tool. We launched a try-on feature called GLAM LAB last month to allow guests to virtually test products and shades within our iPhone and Android app by uploading a selfie or choosing a model with a similar complexion. Our technology partner for this platform is a company known for best-in-class realism and accuracy of color matching. 
Finally, to update you on supply chain performance and investments, we are very pleased and proud with how smoothly our team has executed on a very complex set of initiatives and system rollouts in addition to opening 2 new DCs in the past 1.5 years. Our Greenwood DC is now serving 227 stores and fulfilling 44% of our e-commerce orders. Our newest distribution center in Dallas is ramping on schedule and currently fulfilling 130 stores and 30% of total e-com orders. 
On the systems side, we're starting to see benefits from the core merchandise systems we recently implemented. SWIFT, our new forecasting replenishment tool, continues to ramp up and help us optimize inventory. Our store-level in-stocks are improving and more of our inventory is in our stores versus in our DCs, improving the guest experience. We now have all the tools in place to help us make better, more data-based assortment and inventory decisions. 
So that wraps up my third quarter review. Looking ahead to holiday, we're expecting healthy traffic and strong sales growth as a result of our integrated merchandising and marketing plan. From a product standpoint, we're excited to offer an array of newness and exclusivity on our holiday assortment across all categories and brands. 
To share a few highlights, we'll feature an assortment of Clinique and Lancôme products in every store for holiday. We just launched NARS, featuring 3 hero products: their famous blush, bronzer and a multipurpose stick, The Multiple. These are available online and featured on the [indiscernible] in every store in time for holiday with a more expansive assortment offered online later this month and then launched in select stores next year. 
Our merchants have done a great job partnering with our brands to offer exclusive products across many brands and categories, a wide variety of holiday-themed kits and stocking stuffers and men's grooming and fragrance kits. This year, we upgraded our fragrance kit with purchase program, complementing the exciting newness of our holiday fragrance assortment. And we've also launched an elevated Ulta Beauty Collection of our traditional blockbuster kits that have already shown strong consumer response. And to support our compelling merchandise offering, we rolled out our holiday advertising campaign JOY TO THE GIRL, which is integrated from a design and messaging perspective across all touch points from in-store signage to new TV and radio spots running now to prints and even the packaging of our Ulta Beauty Collection holiday assortment. Our campaign encouraged our guests to see us as a great gift-giving destination as well as a place to get glammed up for holiday events with a visit to our salon. The guest gifts and get glammed theme is featured in television and radio spots through inspirational content on our social media platform and on The Mix on our website. 
Key to executing our holiday plan, our store operations, e-commerce, supply chain and systems teams have all done an excellent job preparing for the busy holiday season, and their efforts have already paid off with the successful Black Friday/Cyber Monday weekend both in stores and online. All areas are staffed up and ready to delight our guests during the big weeks ahead. 
So now I'll hand over to Scott to discuss our third quarter financials and our outlook for the fourth quarter."

Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with the income statement. Net sales for the quarter increased 24.2% to $1.13 billion, driven by 16.7% comparable sales and continued strong performance of new stores. The total company comp was composed of 11.1% transaction growth and 5.6% average ticket growth. The retail comp of 14.6% was comprised of 9.6% traffic and 5% ticket. Ticket growth was driven about 1/3 by units per transaction and about 2/3 by average selling price. The Salon business comped 10.3% and, similar to the recent trend, was driven by ticket growth. The combined retail comp and salon comp yielded a total store comp of 14.3%. 
Gross profit increased 90 basis points. The improvement was the result of product margin expansion and leverage of store rent and occupancy expenses on strong comps, offset by planned supply chain investments. 
Turning to SG&A expense. We deleveraged by 80 basis points, driven by investments in growth initiatives, including store payroll to support our boutique strategy and a differentiated guest experience; and deleverage of corporate overhead cost, in part due to an impairment charge related to the closure of a store in Louisiana due to the August flooding. This was partially offset by modest leverage in marketing. 
The tax rate was 37.4%, consistent with the first half of the year. Last year's Q3 tax rate of 36% reflected the benefit of some tax true-ups. 
Moving to the balance sheet. Inventories increased 16.5% on a per-store basis, which is slightly below the comp rate. Similar to the recent trend, we continue to invest in inventory to support sales growth, gain access to new brands and expand the presence of prestige boutiques in our stores. Also, our new distribution centers in Greenwood and Dallas are ramping and performing well but are still far from being fully optimized. 
Capital expenditures were $131.6 million for the quarter, driven by new store openings, fixtures related to the continued rollout of boutiques as well as investments in systems. We ended the quarter with $243 million in cash and short-term investments. 
In terms of share buybacks, we continue to repurchase shares in the open market as part of our 10b5-1 plan. During the third quarter, we repurchased about 179,000 shares of our stock at a cost of just over $44 million. Year-to-date, including the accelerated share repurchase program and activity under our 10b5-1 plan, we repurchased approximately 1,450,000 shares at an average price of about $205 per share. Share repurchases under our current authorization are expected to contribute about 2 points of EPS growth for the year. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $148 million remaining available under the $425 million share repurchase program announced in March 2016. 
Turning now to guidance for the fourth quarter. We anticipate sales to be in a range of $1.516 billion to $1.541 billion versus $1.268 billion last year. We expect comparable sales to increase in the range of 12% to 14% versus 12.5% last year. E-commerce sales are expected to grow in the 40% range. We plan to open about 25 stores in the fourth quarter versus 14 last year, so preopening expense will be higher. Earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.08 to $2.13 versus $1.69 last year, with modest leverage on both the gross profit and SG&A lines. The tax rate is expected to be 37.5%, and our fully diluted share count is estimated at 63 million. 
At our Analyst Day event in October, we raised our guidance for the full year 2016, expecting comparable sales to grow approximately 12% to 14%, including the impact of the e-commerce business and EPS to increase in the mid-20s percentage range. 
Now with the upside to third quarter earnings, we expect full year comparable sales to grow 13% to 15% and earnings growth to be in the high 20s percentage range. Operating margin is expected to be up modestly for the year. 
CapEx is on track to reach approximately $390 million, driven by slightly higher CapEx per new store and also includes about $80 million for boutique expansion, with 500-plus store touches for Clinique, Lancôme, and Benefit boutiques as well as fragrance fixtures and Ulta Beauty Collection updates.

I would say that, certainly, the assortment of products, of brands, the acceleration of new brands and the, frankly, the great performance of newness of new brands and the newness within existing brands has been a key factor. And I would also say that our sort of demand-creation engine just gets more fine-tuned. The team's done a great job through loyalty -- evolving the way that we promote to becoming more personalized. Our CRM platform working extremely well. As you mentioned, the launch of the credit cards has been another layer of a way for us to drive relevancy and drive share of beauty wallet with our shoppers. So it's really a combination of all of those things coming together plus, I would say, fantastic execution. So in store, the experience we think just gets better. Our associates have done a fantastic job of converting guests into our loyalty program. And obviously, our loyalty members are driving the majority of our sales. And of course, our in stocks are just getting better all the time. The supply chain and systems and teams behind those are working to just make sure that guests have what they want. So I hate to throw the laundry list at you, but it really is a combination of all of those factors working in concert."

The supply chain, we're just getting out of the gate with our Dallas C [ph] there. So it takes a while for those things to scale up. So fourth quarter, as we go in with the heavier sales lift in the fourth quarter, we expect to see operating margin expansion and SG&A leverage as well. As I look to '17 and beyond, I would just be a little careful there. Again, we've given some long-term financial framework there, right, where we expect operating margin to expand. And I think we said generally, heavier on the gross profit line, a little bit less so on the SG&A line, but they both are expected to leverage in '17 and beyond."

One of the fortunate things we have in this model is being able to toggle while we're in the quarter, right, and watching sales trends. So we mentioned the credit card got off to a spectacular start as we got into the quarter. We weren't expecting it to be quite so strong. So again, Mary mentioned there was a -- there's a nice offer there, right, 20% off your entire purchase when you sign up initially.

And specifically, you asked about department stores brands or big established brands versus upstarts. And frankly, I think we're looking for both. We talked about expansion in some of the biggest established prestige brands. You know we've been continuing to expand our partnership with Clinique and Lancôme. We're just getting started with Estée Lauder and NARS, and -- but then upstarts has been a big part of our success over time, and we feel really privileged to be partnering with smaller brands that are innovating in new and creative ways. Makeup Revolution in the mass cosmetic space is one example of that, that has demonstrated some nice growth.

We see strong and growing ROI across that probably most visible vehicle in TV. But other elements of our marketing plan, really all elements of our marketing plan are coming together to continue to drive awareness and growth. Radio is a strong contributor to that, but we've been investing much more heavily in the digital space, in awareness, in social media, influencer, really across our entire digital footprint to connect with our guest where she wants to be connected. Mary mentioned in her remarks, our Ulta Beauty Mix is an example of that on our own website, of creating our own content as a big push, also partnering with influencers to drive that.

Last quarter, I think we were about 2/3 traffic, 1/3 ticket, and retail online was mostly transact -- traffic, which is great. But that balance is important because it's the ability to just continue to grow the business and not be reliant on just sort of a set number of people and visits. So a balance I think we'd expect to hope -- it's never going to be exactly that every quarter, but that's the overall goal. In terms of e-comm profitability, I mean, I guess that's a constant area of focus. First of all, our e-commerce business has gotten more profitable in the last couple of years as we've expanded the assortment, certainly the investments in supply chain, being able to get those orders together in more effective and efficient way. It will probably always be a somewhat lower profit margin than in the bricks-and-mortar part of the business just because of the shipping costs, but we're happy with it. I mean, the online business, as you can tell as we talked at Analyst Day, is -- looks to be quite incremental to our guests in terms of how she uses the channel. And so as we continue to close the gap on profit margin, it's a great part of business."

I think Mary mentioned in her remarks that we're gaining share in each of our key categories. And the drivers, overall, we've talked about in the past is just a highly engaged consumer in beauty and our continued ability to connect with her and gain market share and gain her trust and loyalty and wallet share. And we think specifically within makeup, a lot of trends driving makeup. It is the fastest-growing segment of beauty right now, and that's really driven by a high-level engagement, particularly with young women, teens and millennials but really across all age groups and all ethnicities. Hispanic and all women of color, in particular, are heavily engaged in makeup. There's more education and training and knowledge and trends around different makeup looks and styles. So it is just a really healthy category, and our participation in that has expanded through the brands that we're carrying, the way we're marketing it, the way we're participating in social media, so we're benefiting from that. Skincare has been struggling for a few years but has shown some nice signs of growth. Korean skincare has played a role in that. We're seeing strong growth in different aspects. Masks are a big part but other Asian skincare trends are driving growth. And overall recognition by millennials, in particular, that it isn't all about makeup, but you need to make sure your skin is in good shape as well. And so we're seeing a nice rebound at skincare. Other categories, fragrance, that's -- that is -- isn't growing anywhere near the level of makeup but a lot of innovation in that space. We, of course, have been driving that with -- one example of that is our Sarah Jessica Parker exclusive, STASH. So a lot of different reasons across key categories, and we -- it's a big focus for Ulta to make sure that we're front and center in all of those trends."
