During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. 
I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involves some risk.

This morning, we reported results for our second quarter of fiscal 2016, which included revenue growth of 6% or 8% on a constant dollar basis. This solid revenue growth was impacted by about 1 percentage point",1195,"Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported results for our second quarter of fiscal 2016, which included revenue growth of 6% or 8% on a constant dollar basis. This solid revenue growth was impacted by about 1 percentage point from the sale of our AdvancedMD business at the end of the first fiscal quarter. 
In the second quarter, we continue to see very strong demand for our solutions, which is evidenced by our new business bookings growth of 15%. 
Sales of additional Human Capital Management modules that assist with Affordable Care Act or ACA compliance continue to contribute meaningfully to this performance, which has exceeded our expectations on a year-to-date basis. 
As a result, we are now forecasting new business bookings growth of at least 12% for fiscal 2016. 
In addition to delivering this solid performance, we've returned to shareholders an additional $780 million through share repurchases in the first half of the fiscal year. And in November of 2015, our board approved an increase of our cash dividend of 8%, marking our 41st consecutive year of dividend increases. These actions demonstrate our commitment to shareholder-friendly actions and are intended to contribute to ADP's goal of achieving top quartile total shareholder return. 
It has been an exciting and challenging quarter for ADP and our associates as we help our clients prepared to comply with the ACA. Our teams have worked very hard to implement Human Capital Management modules that were sold during calendar 2015, and I am pleased with the number of units started on our ACA platforms during the quarter. This is performance that we should be proud of, and I want to thank our associates for all their hard work and dedication to our clients. 
We now have more than 14,000 U.S. clients with over 50 full-time employees live on our ACA solutions. Let me put that achievement into perspective. 
By the end of March, employers with 50 plus employees will be required to send Form 1095-C to each of their employees describing the health insurance available to them. This is the most significant employee tax filing form that the U.S. government has introduced since the W-2 and ADP is on track to deliver about 10 million of them in the first year. 
Success of our ACA solutions is just one example of ADP's proficiency in dealing with complex compliance issues. From helping clients determine eligibility for work opportunity tax credit signed into law just weeks ago to preparing for anticipated changes in overtime rules, ADP's expertise is unique in the dynamic world of HR compliance. 
And as this complexity grows, many clients are choosing to outsource HR entirely to ADP. Our PEO business, ADP TotalSource, experienced another strong quarter, growing revenue 18% and average work site employees by 14% in the second quarter. 
With this growth, we eclipsed an exciting milestone. ADP TotalSource, already the largest PEO in the U.S., now supports more than 400,000 client employees. 
In fact, if ADP TotalSource were an independent employer, it would rank among the top 5 private employers in the U.S. 
On the new product front, while it's in early days, we're excited about the progress we're making with our analytics platform called ADP DataCloud. 
During the quarter, we fully released the benchmarking capability with more than 1,000 job titles, which allows our clients to generate actionable insights from workforce data embedded in their ADP HCM solutions. 
The benchmarking platform available for U.S. companies throughout aggregated and anonymize information from ADP's large U.S. client base. And of course, ADP's data advantage is a Global one. 
During the quarter, we introduced the ADP France and National Employment Report as part of our commitment to adding deeper insight into the label markets globally and providing businesses, governments and others with a source of credible and valuable information. 
Similar to the U.S. report, each month, ADP will publish aggregated employment statistics from an anonymized sample drawing from 1.3 million workers included among ADP's client base in France. 
These are just a few examples of ADP's leadership in the HCM category, which continues to receive positive external recognition. 
Most recently, Ventana Research recognized our ADP Vantage platform with its technology innovation award in the business innovation category. And bestowing this honor, Ventana recognized us for our ability to, ""help employees not just be efficient through modern user experience, but actually enjoy working with the application. "" It's always gratifying to see the HCM community recognize the progress we've made with our platforms. 
And now, I'd like to give you an update on client retention. In the second quarter, ADP experienced a decline and retention of 120 basis points, which marks a sequential improvement over the first quarter. While we are disappointed to see this metrics lift from its recent historical high, we are pleased that retention on our strategic platforms remains high. 
Consistent with the first quarter, the majority of the retention declines stems from clients on mature technology, and we still believe that market activity from employers choosing their ACA providers has introduced a change event for our clients. 
Although disappointing, our management team remains focused on this metrics -- on this metric, and we have taken actions to address opportunities we have for improvement. 
Our progress on client migrations remains a key area of focus for us. And based on the success we've seen in our Small Business services unit with all clients now on ADP RUN, we believe these migrations are the right thing for our clients and for the long-term success of our business. 
As evidence of this, in December, we reached a milestone as we were able to sunset the PCPW platform in the mid-market, a legacy payroll products. 
Many clients have chosen ADP for our strength and expertise in compliance. We are in a time when the level of uncertainty in the regulatory environment is higher than it's been in decades. And as a result, our clients are even more reliant on our service teams. 
As a management team, we remain focused on the client experience, which includes staffing our service teams to the levels appropriate for assisting our clients with these HCM needs. 
Since last quarter, we have hired over 1,000 associates to assist our clients and expect to receive the benefit of adding these talented people in the coming months. 
Once again, I want to thank and congratulate these new as well as our tenured associates for their continued contributions to our success. 
I'll wrap with just 1 reflection from our ReThink Global HCM Conference, which I attended last week in Rome. There we had executive HR, finance, IT and security leaders together to explore the global perspectives around managing and cultivating the foundation of organizational success. It's clear that winning the workforce talent as well as handling compliance on a global scale are critical issues facing businesses around the world. What's even clear to me is that no organization is better positioned to help these clients than we are. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jan for a further review of our second quarter results and an update on our fiscal 2016 outlook."
126269,320081261,925258,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we realized a gain of $40 million from the sale of a building. My comments on the quarter refer to adjusted results, which exclude the impact of this gain. ADP revenues grew 6%",1119,"Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we realized a gain of $40 million from the sale of a building. My comments on the quarter refer to adjusted results, which exclude the impact of this gain. 
ADP revenues grew 6% or 8% on a constant dollar basis. This growth includes approximately 1 percentage point of pressure due to the divestiture of the AdvancedMD business, which occurred at the end of the first quarter. 
As Carlos mentioned, our new business bookings remained strong, posting 15% growth for the second quarter. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes for adjusted EBIT grew 2% or 4% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBIT margin decreased about 70 basis points compared to 18.7% in the last year's second quarter. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 4% to $0.72 or 6% on constant dollar basis, and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with the year ago. 
The slower earnings growth we realized in the second quarter as well as the decline in margins were anticipated as we made planned investments to increase operational resources in support of our service teams and new product implementations. 
In addition, increased selling expenses resulting from higher than anticipated new business bookings also contributed to the slower growth. 
In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 3% for the quarter or 6% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was primarily driven by net new business additions in the quarter. As a reminder, the new recurring revenue from ACA-related modules is not expected to impact revenue growth until the third fiscal quarter. 
As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 120 basis points for the quarter as we continue to experience elevated losses from clients in legacy platforms. 
Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.5% in the second quarter. Average client fund balances grew 4% compared to a year ago or 6% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions from new business as well as increased pays per control. Outside the U.S., growth in our multinational solutions remains strong. 
Employer Services margin declined about 30 basis points in the quarter due to planned investments that we have made in operational resources to install new business sold and provide services to our clients as well as higher selling expenses from continued strong new business bookings. 
ADP's PEO continues to perform very well, with revenue growth of 18% in the second quarter. 
As Carlos mentioned, the PEO reached a milestone in the quarter surpassing 400,000 average client employees to reach 403,000, which represents growth of 14%. 
We continue to see an increase in benefit plan participation rates from our work site employees, a trend we expect to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year. The PEO also continues to drive margin expansion through operating efficiencies, expanding margins by approximately 20 basis points in the quarter. 
We are pleased with the progress we have made through fiscal year -- for the first half of fiscal year 2016, particularly with the success we have seen in new business bookings. As Carlos mentioned, we are now forecasting new business bookings growth of at least 12% compared to our prior forecast of at least 10%. 
As a result of this change to our expectation and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which occurred towards the end of calendar year 2015, we have updated certain elements of our fiscal year 2016 forecast. 
ADP now expects fiscal year 2016 revenue growth of about 7% compared with our prior forecast of 7% to 8%. This change is due to higher than anticipated pressure from unfavorable foreign currency translation, which is now expected to impact our revenue growth by about 2 percentage points for the fiscal year. 
On a constant dollar basis, ADP now expects revenue growth of 9%, which is the higher end of our previously forecasted range of 8% to 9%. This updated forecast reflects our increased expectations for new business bookings growth as well as our confidence in the recurring revenue, which will start from new solutions sold over the past 3 quarters. And as a reminder, this forecast also includes almost 1 percentage points of expected pressure from the sale of the AdvancedMD business, which occurred towards the end of the first quarter. 
For the Employer Services segment, revenue growth is anticipated to be 4% to 5% compared with our prior forecast of 5% to 6% due to higher than anticipated pressure from unfavorable foreign currency translation. On a constant dollar basis, revenue growth is now expected to be about 7 compared with our prior forecast of 6% to 7%. 
Due to the strong half performance -- first half performance of the PEO, ADP is now anticipating 16% to 18% growth for this segment compared to our prior forecast of 15% to 17%. 
Our forecast for adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 basis points is unchanged. 
On a segment level, we are now expecting margin expansion of about 75 basis points in Employer Services compared with our prior forecast of about 100 basis points. Margin expectations for the PEO remain unchanged. 
ADP has made some minor changes to our forecast for the client funds extended investment strategy to adjust for the December 2015 increase in the Fed funds rate as well as additional pressure anticipated from foreign currency translation that is expected to reduce our balanced growth. Exchanges are not material to our overall forecast and the details can be found in the supplemented slides on our Investor Relations website. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow 11% to 13% from the $2.89 in fiscal year 2015 compared with our prior forecast growth of 12% to 14%. This forecast reflects additional selling expenses anticipated from increased new business bookings, higher than anticipated pressure of unfavorable foreign currency translation, which is assumed to have a negative impact of 1 to 2 percentage points on earnings per share growth. On a constant dollar basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be 12% to 14% compared with our prior forecast of 13% to 15% growth. 
These changes to our full year outlook reflects the results of our first half and our expectations for the balance of the fiscal year 2016. However, we continue to acknowledge that changing factors in the marketplace due to uncertainty around ACA compliance could put a short-term strain on our earnings growth. We remain committed to our strategy and to our clients, which we believe will yield the best results for ADP over the long run. 
So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions."

So we have other legacy products that are -- that are larger, have more clients on them that are also underperforming from a retention standpoint that a greater focus for us than just a mathematical improvement from PCPW retirement because it's not just mathematically, I think, significant because it's been waning over the last 12 months even as we got close to the final retirement, the final clients."

I think what we said in the first quarter is really been no material change. Again, I think that consistent with what we said in the first quarter, I think the piece of migrations was quite accelerated in the first quarter versus the prior year first quarter. And in the second quarter, it was the same in part because we had a lot of migrations already in the pipeline, and we had momentum, and so I think it's safe to say that we're kind of in the same place, if you will, in terms of the pressure that migrations, which were the benefit of hindsight, and I take some accountability or I take all the accountability as the boss for this, that migration is a very big priority for us but not at any cost. And organizational, we have with a lot of focus and a lot of pressure in the organization as usual responded to the boss. And I think we may have overdone it and created an inordinate amount of pressure on the organization as a result of the piece of migrations. And I think we also have mentioned that I think the ACA decisions of some of our mid-market clients were making because in the upmarket, these are not decisions that you can make over the course of 2 or 3 months. And in the low end of the market, it doesn't apply because under -- companies under 50 employees don't have to comply. So really it's a mid-market issue, and we think it had impact. We just don't know really how to measure that. And then lastly, I also acknowledge that I think we exited the last fiscal year with not enough resources to handle everything I just mentioned, the extra activity around migrations and all of the activity and noise around ACA. So as we've mentioned in our comments, we've added resources, and we've taken actions. This is not the first time ACA is definitely a new factor in the pace of migrations is something that -- the benefit of hindsight you probably step on the accelerator a little too fast. But we've been through this type of event before. It seems similar to prior times where there's really no concentration of anyone particular competitor or any pattern that we can see other than self-inflicted wounds that are repairable, and we're in the process of preparing them, and we see some signs of improvement. So despite the fact that we still have 40% of the clients in mid-market, it doesn't necessarily mean that we will have to continue to see, and we don't plan on continuing. We obviously have no -- we don't provide a forecast, and we don't provide guidance around retention, but I can assure you that we don't believe that we have to accept the retention levels that we have on our legacy platforms today. So we're not just standing idly by and continuing on the same piece of migration and with the same actions and don't expect the same results going forward."

And so I think the",459,"Again, given that we historically don't get into a lot of detail for obvious competitive reasons on our new business bookings in terms of breaking by segment or by product, but I think it's important for you to understand directionally. And so I think the wording we've used, I think it may have been in my comments or in Jan's opening comments is that clearly ACA added to our new business bookings growth and exceeded our -- allowed us to exceed our expectations in terms of bookings. So I guess, an indirect way of answering your question is that the long term 8% to 10% new bookings for growth that we strive for absent change events like ACA, it will be safe to say that this year we're on track to achieve that and that performance above and beyond that would be attributable to ACA. And of course, that's only with 6 months done. That could change in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But I think right now, based on the information we have and what we see in terms of market activity, I think the fair way to look at it, and it's important for all of you to understand that because as Jan's said, even though we still have an opportunity in front of us, the opportunity is obviously smaller now than it was in the prior year. And so we don't expect to get as much lift. We hope we do, but we wouldn't expect to get as much lift from ACA in fiscal 2017 in terms of our new bookings growth. Having said all that, most exciting thing for me around ACA, in this event in general is that it should, and we hope will drive companies to look at the full HCM bundles. So ACA compliance really requires that you have information not just about how many employees you have and what they're paid, but also about their time, how much -- how many hours they work per week, whether the benefits or don't have benefits. So having, for example, a Workforce Now platform like we have in the mid-market really helps a lot with ACA compliance. Not to mention that as we roll out analytics tools and other things to help manage people better, those are also attractive features. So I think the combination of the improvements in our user experience, the information that we provide to analytics plus the advantages we get in compliance, we believe and it's our expectation and our hope is that we'll continue to generate new business bookings growth in terms of clients and also sales dollars into the future even if the tailwind that we get from ACA diminishes a little bit in fiscal 2017."

So unless all of a sudden, all of the competitors got together and do something different, there would be nothing in our information that shows this is a competitive issue in terms of what's driving our retention. So I think that's one answer to the -- one part answer to the question. So again, we don't see any changes in the pricing environment or in the competitive environment. In terms of the conversions and the migrations, it is clear as we're pointing out, that we're getting pressure on legacy platforms. But it doesn't mean that we can't have a better retention rate even on the legacy platforms. So take the example of our downmarket SBS business. In that business, we went through immigration similar to the one that we're describing in majors over the course of multiple years. And as in this case, you have to balance speed with the desire to get done. And in that case, we felt some level of pressure around retention at various points. And when we were done with that migration, our retention rates have definitely improved. So they've been just stabilized, but they improved. But in the case of that client migration, we did not encounter some of these, what we term as self-inflicted wounds that we're having here that we believe we can address, and we believe we can correct as we're going through the migration. So again, the problem is there's a lot of uncertainty, and it's very would be -- I think irresponsible for us to make definitive statements because we just don't know for sure. But I want to make sure that everyone's very, very clear that we believe that we can impact the retention rates in the mid-market even as we're doing these migrations. I also want everybody to understand that we're not going to stop doing the migrations, but we will moderate, we still are on track to be finished by the end of fiscal '17, which was our original plan. But the pace at which we do these and the timing of when we do them, I think, we will do on our terms in order to maximize the balance between client retention and also the long-term health of our business and which is right for our clients."

Think about this mathematically clearly as we continue to migrate clients, the number of clients on legacy platforms becomes smaller and smaller and mathematically have a smaller and smaller impact on our retention rates. So I'll just caution a linear assumption around retention into 2017 even though that's clearly a possibility. But I would caution against making that assumption because that base of clients is becoming smaller and smaller, and we'll have a smaller impact on our overall retention rate. I also just want to reiterate, and I'll let Jan weigh in what we just said earlier, which is at this point, our new business bookings is more than upsetting the pressure we're having from retention and our revenue growth rate, we moved up in terms of our guidance for this year, and we're very, very happy with where we are versus our long-term range. We have said in the first quarter, and we will say again today that in the second half of this fiscal year on a constant dollar basis if you adjust for the AdvancedMD disposition, which typically would have been included in discontinued ops but because of accounting changes, it is not in discontinued ops So if you adjust for that, we will be the high end of our long-term revenue growth guidance."

This morning, we reported results for our second quarter of fiscal 2016, which included revenue growth of 6% or 8% on a constant dollar basis. This solid revenue growth was impacted by about 1 percentage point",1195,"Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported results for our second quarter of fiscal 2016, which included revenue growth of 6% or 8% on a constant dollar basis. This solid revenue growth was impacted by about 1 percentage point from the sale of our AdvancedMD business at the end of the first fiscal quarter.
In the second quarter, we continue to see very strong demand for our solutions, which is evidenced by our new business bookings growth of 15%. Sales of additional Human Capital Management modules that assist with Affordable Care Act or ACA compliance continue to contribute meaningfully to this performance, which has exceeded our expectations on a year-to-date basis. As a result, we are now forecasting new business bookings growth of at least 12% for fiscal 2016.
In addition to delivering this solid performance, we've returned to shareholders an additional $780 million through share repurchases in the first half of the fiscal year. And in November of 2015, our board approved an increase of our cash dividend of 8%, marking our 41st consecutive year of dividend increases. These actions demonstrate our commitment to shareholder-friendly actions and are intended to contribute to ADP's goal of achieving top quartile total shareholder return.
It has been an exciting and challenging quarter for ADP and our associates as we help our clients prepare to comply with the ACA. Our teams have worked very hard to implement Human Capital Management modules that were sold during calendar 2015, and I am pleased with the number of units started on our ACA platforms during the quarter. This is performance that we should be proud of, and I want to thank our associates for all of their hard work and dedication to our clients.
We now have more than 14,000 U.S. clients with over 50 full-time employees live on our ACA solutions. Let me put that achievement into perspective. By the end of March, employers with 50-plus employees will be required to send Form 1095-C to each of their employees describing the health insurance available to them. This is the most significant employee tax filing form that the U.S. government has introduced since the W-2, and ADP is on track to deliver about 10 million of them in the first year.
Success of our ACA solutions is just one example of ADP's proficiency in dealing with complex compliance issues. From helping clients determine eligibility for Work Opportunity Tax Credit signed into law just weeks ago to preparing for anticipated changes in overtime rules, ADP's expertise is unique in the dynamic world of HR compliance.
And as this complexity grows, many clients are choosing to outsource HR entirely to ADP. Our PEO business, ADP TotalSource, experienced another strong quarter, growing revenue 18% and average worksite employees by 14% in the second quarter. With this growth, we eclipsed an exciting milestone. ADP TotalSource, already the largest PEO in the U.S., now supports more than 400,000 client employees. In fact, if ADP TotalSource were an independent employer, it would rank among the top 5 private employers in the U.S.
On the new product front, while in it's early days, we're excited about the progress we're making with our analytics platform called ADP DataCloud. During the quarter, we fully released the benchmarking capability with more than 1,000 job titles, which allows our client to generate actionable insights from workforce data embedded in their ADP HCM solutions, the benchmarking platform available for U.S. companies throughout aggregated and anonymized information from ADP's large U.S. client base.
And of course, ADP's data advantage is a global one. During the quarter, we introduced the ADP France National Employment Report as part of our commitment to adding deeper insight into the labor markets globally and providing businesses, governments and others with a source of credible and valuable information. Similar to the U.S. report, each month, ADP will publish aggregated employment statistics from an anonymized sample drawing from 1.3 million workers included among ADP's client base in France. These are just a few examples of ADP's leadership in the HCM category, which continues to receive positive external recognition.
Most recently, Ventana Research recognized our ADP Vantage platform with its Technology Innovation Award in the business innovation category. In bestowing this honor, Ventana recognized us for our ability to, and I quote, ""help employees not just be efficient through modern user experience, but actually enjoy working with the application."" It's always gratifying to see the HCM community recognize the progress we've made with our platforms.
And now, I'd like to give you an update on client retention. In the second quarter, ADP experienced a decline in retention of 120 basis points, which marks a sequential improvement over the first quarter. While we are disappointed to see this metric slip from its recent historical high, we are pleased that retention on our strategic platforms remains high.
Consistent with the first quarter, the majority of the retention declines stems from clients on mature technology, and we still believe that market activity from employers choosing their ACA providers has introduced a change event for our clients. Although disappointing, our management team remains focused on this metric, and we are -- we have taken actions to address opportunities we have for improvement.
Our progress on client migrations remains a key area of focus for us. And based on the success we've seen in our Small Business Services unit with all clients now on ADP RUN, we believe these migrations are the right thing for our clients and for the long-term success of our business. As evidence of this, in December, we reached a milestone as we were able to sunset the PCPW platform in the mid-market, a legacy payroll product.
Many clients have chosen ADP for our strength and expertise in compliance. We are in a time when the level of uncertainty in the regulatory environment is higher than it's been in decades. And as a result, our clients are even more reliant on our service teams. As a management team, we remain focused on the client experience, which includes staffing our service teams to the levels appropriate for assisting our clients with these HCM needs. Since last quarter, we have hired over 1,000 associates to assist our clients and expect to receive the benefit of adding these talented people in the coming months. Once again, I want to thank and congratulate these new as well as our tenured associates for their continued contributions to our success.
I'll wrap with just one reflection from our ReThink Global HCM Conference, which I attended last week in Rome. There, we had executive, HR, finance, IT and security leaders together to explore global perspectives around managing and cultivating the foundation of organizational success. It's clear that winning the word for [ph] talent as well as handling compliance on a global scale are critical issues facing businesses around the world. What's even clear to me is that no organization is better positioned to help these clients than we are.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jan for a further review of our second quarter results and an update on our fiscal 2016 outlook."
126269,320081261,925580,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we realized a gain of $40 million from the sale of a building. My comments on the quarter refer to adjusted results, which exclude the impact of this gain.ADP revenues grew 6%",1115,"Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we realized a gain of $40 million from the sale of a building. My comments on the quarter refer to adjusted results, which exclude the impact of this gain.
ADP revenues grew 6% or 8% on a constant dollar basis. This growth includes approximately 1 percentage point of pressure due to the divestiture of the AdvancedMD business, which occurred at the end of the first quarter.
As Carlos mentioned, our new business bookings remained strong, posting 15% growth for the second quarter. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT grew 2% or 4% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBIT margin decreased about 70 basis points compared to 18.7% in the last year's second quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 4% to $0.72 or 6% on a constant dollar basis and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with the year ago.
The slower earnings growth we realized in the second quarter as well as the decline in margins were anticipated as we made planned investments to increase operational resources in support of our service teams and new product implementations. In addition, increased selling expenses resulting from higher-than-anticipated new business bookings also contributed to the slower growth.
In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 3% for the quarter or 6% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was primarily driven by net new business additions in the quarter. As a reminder, the new recurring revenue from ACA-related modules is not expected to impact revenue growth until the third fiscal quarter. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 120 basis points for the quarter as we continue to experience elevated losses from clients on legacy platforms.
Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.5% in the second quarter. Average client fund balances grew 4% compared to a year ago or 6% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions from new business as well as increased pays per control. Outside the U.S., growth in our multinational solutions remains strong.
Employer Services margin declined about 30 basis points in the quarter due to planned investments that we have made in operational resources to install new business sold and provide services to our clients as well as higher selling expenses from continued strong new business bookings.
ADP's PEO continues to perform very well, with revenue growth of 18% in the second quarter. As Carlos mentioned, the PEO reached a milestone in the quarter, surpassing 400,000 average client employees to reach 403,000, which represents growth of 14%.
We continue to see an increase in benefit plan participation rates from our worksite employees, a trend we expect to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year. The PEO also continues to drive margin expansion through operating efficiencies, expanding margins by approximately 20 basis points in the quarter.
We are pleased with the progress we have made through fiscal year -- for the first half of fiscal year 2016, particularly with the success we have seen in new business bookings. As Carlos mentioned, we are now forecasting new business bookings growth of at least 12% compared to our prior forecast of at least 10%. As a result of this change to our expectations and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which occurred towards the end of calendar year 2015, we have updated certain elements of our fiscal year 2016 forecast.
ADP now expects fiscal year 2016 revenue growth of about 7% compared with our prior forecast of 7% to 8%. This change is due to higher-than-anticipated pressure from unfavorable foreign currency translation, which is now expected to impact our revenue growth by about 2 percentage points for the fiscal year.
On a constant dollar basis, ADP now expects revenue growth of 9%, which is the higher end of our previously forecasted range of 8% to 9%. This updated forecast reflects our increased expectations for new business bookings growth as well as our confidence in the recurring revenue, which will start from new solutions sold over the past 3 quarters. And as a reminder, this forecast also includes almost 1 percentage points of expected pressure from the sale of the AdvancedMD business, which occurred towards the end of the first quarter. 
For the Employer Services segment, revenue growth is anticipated to be 4% to 5% compared with our prior forecast of 5% to 6% due to higher than anticipated pressure from unfavorable foreign currency translation. On a constant dollar basis, revenue growth is now expected to be about 7% compared with our prior forecast of 6% to 7%. Due to the strong half performance -- first half performance of the PEO, ADP is now anticipating 16% to 18% growth for this segment compared to our prior forecast of 15% to 17%. 
Our forecast for adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 basis points is unchanged. On the segment level, we are now expecting margin expansion of about 75 basis points in Employer Services compared with our prior forecast of about 100 basis points. Margin expansion -- expectations for the PEO remain unchanged.
ADP has made some minor changes to our forecast for the client funds extended investment strategy to adjust for the December 2015 increase in the Fed funds rate as well as additional pressure anticipated from foreign currency translation that is expected to reduce our balance growth. Exchanges are not material to our overall forecast and the details can be found in the supplemented slides on our Investor Relations website.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow 11% to 13% from the $2.89 in fiscal year 2015 compared with our prior forecast growth of 12% to 14%. This forecast reflects additional selling expenses anticipated from increased new business bookings, higher-than-anticipated pressure of unfavorable foreign currency translation, which is assumed to have a negative impact of 1 to 2 percentage points on earnings per share growth. On a constant dollar basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be 12% to 14% compared with our prior forecast of 13% to 15% growth.
These changes to our full year outlook reflect the results of our first half and our expectations for the balance of the fiscal year 2016. However, we continue to acknowledge that changing factors in the marketplace due to uncertainty around ACA compliance could put a short-term strain on our earnings growth. We remain committed to our strategy and to our clients, which we believe will yield the best results for ADP over the long run.
So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions."

I think that's what we said in the first quarter. There's really been no material change. And again, I think that consistent with what we said in the first quarter, I think the pace of migrations was quite accelerated in the first quarter versus the prior year first quarter. And in the second quarter, it was the same in part because we had a lot of migrations already in the pipeline and we had momentum. And so I think it's safe to say that we're kind of in the same place, if you will, in terms of the pressure that migrations, which with the benefit of hindsight, and I take some accountability or I take all the accountability as the boss for this, that migration is a very big priority for us, but not at any cost. And organizational, we had put a lot of focus and a lot of pressure in the organization, as usual, responded to the boss. And I think we may have overdone and created an inordinate amount of pressure on the organization as a result of the pace of migrations. And I think we also have mentioned that I think the ACA decisions that some of our mid-market clients were making -- because in the upmarket, these are not decisions that you can make over the course of 2 or 3 months. And in the low end of the market, it doesn't apply because under -- companies under 50 employees don't have to comply. So really, it's a mid-market issue and we think it had impact, we just don't know really how to measure that. And then lastly, I also acknowledge that I think we exited the last fiscal year with not enough resources to handle everything I just mentioned, the extra activity around migrations and all of the activity and noise around ACA. So as we've mentioned in our comments, we've added resources and we've taken actions. It's not the first time. ACA is definitely a new factor, and the pace of migrations is something that, with the benefit of hindsight, we probably step on the accelerator a little too fast. But we've been through this type of event before. It seemed similar to prior times where there's really no concentration of any one particular competitor or any pattern that we can see other than self-inflicted wounds that are repairable, and we're in the process of repairing them, and we see some signs of improvement. So despite the fact that we still have 40% of the clients in the mid-market, it doesn't necessarily mean that we will have to continue to see and we don't plan on continuing. We obviously have no -- we don't provide a forecast and we don't provide guidance around retention. But I can assure you that we don't believe that we have to accept the retention levels that we have on our legacy platforms today. So we're not just standing idly by and continuing on the same pace of migrations and with the same actions and don't expect the same results going forward."

But I think it's important for you to understand directionally. And so I think the wording we've used, I think it may have been in my comments or in Jan's opening comments is that clearly, ACA added to our new business bookings growth and exceeded our -- allowed us to exceed our expectations in terms of bookings. So I guess, an indirect way of answering your question is that the long term 8% to 10% new bookings growth that we strive for, absent change events like ACA, it would be safe to say that this year, we're on track to achieve that and that performance above and beyond that would be attributable to ACA. And of course, that's only with 6 months done. That could change in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But I think right now, based on the information we have and what we see in terms of market activity, I think that the fair way to look at it -- and it's important for all of you to understand that because as Jan said, even though we still have an opportunity in front of us, the opportunity is obviously smaller now than it was in the prior year. And so we don't expect to get as much lift. We hope we do, but we wouldn't expect to get as much lift from ACA in fiscal 2017 in terms of our new bookings growth. Having said all that, most exciting thing for me around ACA and this event in general is that it should and we hope will drive companies to look at the full HCM bundles. So ACA compliance really requires that you have information not just about how many employees you have and what they're paid, but also about their time, how much -- how many hours they work per week, whether they have benefits or don't have benefits. So having, for example, a Workforce Now platform like we have in the mid-market really helps a lot with ACA compliance. Not to mention that as we roll out analytics tools and other things to help manage people better, those are also attractive features. So I think the combination of the improvements in our user experience, the information that we provide to analytics plus the advantages you get through compliance, we believe and this is our expectation and our hope is that, that will continue to generate new business bookings growth in terms of clients and also sales dollars into the future even if the tailwind that we get from ACA diminishes a little bit in fiscal 2017."

So unless all of a sudden, all of the competitors got together and did something different, there would be nothing in our information that shows this is a competitive issue in terms of what's driving our retention. So I think that's one answer to the -- one part of the answer to the question. So again, no -- we don't see any changes in the pricing environment or in the competitive environment. The -- in terms of the conversions and the migrations, it is clear, as we're pointing out, that we're getting pressure on legacy platforms. But it doesn't mean that we can't have a better retention rate even on the legacy platforms. So take the example of our downmarket SBS business. In that business, we went through a migration similar to the one we're describing in majors over the course of multiple years. And as in this case, you have to balance speed with the desire to get done. And in that case, we felt some level of pressure around retention at various points. And when we were done with that migration, our retention rates have definitely improved. So they've been just stabilized, but they improved. But in the case of that client migration, we did not encounter some of these, what we term as self-inflicted wounds that we're having here that we believe we can address and we believe we can correct as we're going through the migration. So again, the problem is there's a lot of uncertainty and it's very -- it would be, I think, irresponsible for us to make definitive statements because we just don't know for sure. But I want to make sure that everyone's very, very clear that we believe that we can impact the retention rates in the mid-market even as we're doing these migrations. And I also want everybody to understand that we're not going to stop doing the migrations, but we will moderate. We still are on track to be finished by the end of fiscal '17, which was our original plan. But the pace at which we do these and the timing of when we do them, I think, we will do on our terms in order to maximize the balance between client retention and also the long-term health of our business and what's for our clients."

So I would just caution a linear assumption around retention into 2017, even though that's clearly a possibility. But I would caution against making that assumption because that base of clients is becoming smaller and smaller, and we'll have a smaller impact on our overall retention rate. I also just want to reiterate and I'll let Jan weigh in what we just said earlier, which is at this point, our new business bookings is more than offsetting the pressure we're having from retention. And our revenue growth rate, we moved up in terms of our guidance for this year, and we're very, very happy with where we are versus our long-term range. We have said in the first quarter and we will say again today that in the second half of this fiscal year, on a constant dollar basis, if you adjust for the AdvancedMD disposition, which typically would have been included in discontinued ops, but because of accounting changes, it is not in discontinued ops.

So that's the goal. The upmarket migrations will be a multi-year effort and we're going to proceed together in partnership with our clients. And I don't think we're going to give specific migration numbers for the upmarket. It would be an ongoing effort to move those clients."

And so we do have a chart that shows, and I think we may have even mentioned it in our comments in the script, that the benefits participation rate is trending upwards. So it had been trending downwards several years ago pre-ACA, and now it's trending upward. It's not a dramatic increase, but it's enough to help drive additional difference between our worksite employee growth and our top line revenue growth, which is why it's so important to look at the margin dynamics of that business, excluding those pass-through revenues."

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.
I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such, involves some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.
With that, I will turn the call over to Carlos."
126269,320081261,925733,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported results for our second quarter of fiscal 2016, which included revenue growth of 6% or 8% on a constant dollar basis. This solid revenue growth was impacted by about 1 percentage point",1195,"Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported results for our second quarter of fiscal 2016, which included revenue growth of 6% or 8% on a constant dollar basis. This solid revenue growth was impacted by about 1 percentage point from the sale of our AdvancedMD business at the end of the first fiscal quarter.
In the second quarter, we continue to see very strong demand for our solutions, which is evidenced by our new business bookings growth of 15%. Sales of additional Human Capital Management modules that assist with Affordable Care Act or ACA compliance continue to contribute meaningfully to this performance, which has exceeded our expectations on a year-to-date basis. As a result, we are now forecasting new business bookings growth of at least 12% for fiscal 2016.
In addition to delivering this solid performance, we've returned to shareholders an additional $780 million through share repurchases in the first half of the fiscal year. And in November of 2015, our board approved an increase of our cash dividend of 8%, marking our 41st consecutive year of dividend increases. These actions demonstrate our commitment to shareholder-friendly actions and are intended to contribute to ADP's goal of achieving top quartile total shareholder return.
It has been an exciting and challenging quarter for ADP and our associates as we help our clients prepare to comply with the ACA. Our teams have worked very hard to implement Human Capital Management modules that were sold during calendar 2015, and I am pleased with the number of units started on our ACA platforms during the quarter. This is performance that we should be proud of, and I want to thank our associates for all of their hard work and dedication to our clients.
We now have more than 14,000 U.S. clients with over 50 full-time employees live on our ACA solutions. Let me put that achievement into perspective. By the end of March, employers with 50-plus employees will be required to send Form 1095-C to each of their employees describing the health insurance available to them. This is the most significant employee tax filing form that the U.S. government has introduced since the W-2, and ADP is on track to deliver about 10 million of them in the first year.
Success of our ACA solutions is just one example of ADP's proficiency in dealing with complex compliance issues. From helping clients determine eligibility for Work Opportunity Tax Credits signed into law just weeks ago to preparing for anticipated changes in overtime rules, ADP's expertise is unique in the dynamic world of HR compliance.
And as this complexity grows, many clients are choosing to outsource HR entirely to ADP. Our PEO business, ADP TotalSource, experienced another strong quarter, growing revenue 18% and average worksite employees by 14% in the second quarter. With this growth, we eclipsed an exciting milestone. ADP TotalSource, already the largest PEO in the U.S., now supports more than 400,000 client employees. In fact, if ADP TotalSource were an independent employer, it would rank among the top 5 private employers in the U.S.
On the new product front, while in it's early days, we're excited about the progress we're making with our analytics platform called ADP DataCloud. During the quarter, we fully released a benchmarking capability with more than 1,000 job titles, which allows our clients to generate actionable insights from workforce data embedded in their ADP HCM solutions, the benchmarking platform available for U.S. companies throughout aggregated and anonymized information from ADP's large U.S. client base.
And of course, ADP's data advantage is a global one. During the quarter, we introduced the ADP France National Employment Report as part of our commitment to adding deeper insights into the labor markets globally and providing businesses, governments and others with a source of credible and valuable information. Similar to the U.S. report, each month, ADP will publish aggregated employment statistics from an anonymized sample drawing from 1.3 million workers included among ADP's client base in France. These are just a few examples of ADP's leadership in the HCM category, which continues to receive positive external recognition.
Most recently, Ventana Research recognized our ADP Vantage platform with its Technology Innovation Award in the business innovation category. In bestowing this honor, Ventana recognized us for our ability to, and I quote, ""help employees not just be efficient through a modern user experience, but actually enjoy working with the application."" It's always gratifying to see the HCM community recognize the progress we've made with our platforms.
And now, I'd like to give you an update on client retention. In the second quarter, ADP experienced a decline in retention of 120 basis points, which marks a sequential improvement over the first quarter. While we are disappointed to see this metric slip from its recent historical high, we are pleased that retention on our strategic platforms remains high.
Consistent with the first quarter, the majority of the retention declines stems from clients on mature technology, and we still believe that market activity from employers choosing their ACA providers has introduced a change event for our clients. Although disappointing, our management team remains focused on this metric, and we are -- we have taken actions to address opportunities we have for improvement.
Our progress on client migrations remains a key area of focus for us. And based on the success we've seen in our Small Business Services unit with all clients now on ADP RUN, we believe these migrations are the right thing for our clients and for the long-term success of our business. As evidence of this, in December, we reached a milestone as we were able to sunset the PCPW platform in the mid-market, a legacy payroll product.
Many clients have chosen ADP for our strength and expertise in compliance. We are in a time when the level of uncertainty in the regulatory environment is higher than it's been in decades. And as a result, our clients are even more reliant on our service teams. As a management team, we remain focused on the client experience, which includes staffing our service teams to the levels appropriate for assisting our clients with these HCM needs. Since last quarter, we have hired over 1,000 associates to assist our clients and expect to receive the benefit of adding these talented people in the coming months. Once again, I want to thank and congratulate these new as well as our tenured associates for their continued contributions to our success.
I'll wrap with just one reflection from our ReThink Global HCM Conference, which I attended last week in Rome. There, we had executive, HR, finance, IT and security leaders together to explore global perspectives around managing and cultivating the foundation of organizational success. It's clear that winning the war for talent as well as handling compliance on a global scale are critical issues facing businesses around the world. What's even clearer to me is that no organization is better positioned to help these clients than we are.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jan for a further review of our second quarter results and an update on our fiscal 2016 outlook."
126269,320081261,925733,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we realized a gain of $14 million from the sale of a building. My comments on the quarter refer to adjusted results, which exclude the impact of this gain.ADP revenues grew 6%",1115,"Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we realized a gain of $14 million from the sale of a building. My comments on the quarter refer to adjusted results, which exclude the impact of this gain.
ADP revenues grew 6% or 8% on a constant dollar basis. This growth includes approximately 1 percentage point of pressure due to the divestiture of the AdvancedMD business, which occurred at the end of the first quarter.
As Carlos mentioned, our new business bookings remained strong, posting 15% growth for the second quarter. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT grew 2% or 4% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBIT margin decreased about 70 basis points compared to 18.7% in the last year's second quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 4% to $0.72 or 6% on a constant dollar basis and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago.
The slower earnings growth we realized in the second quarter as well as the decline in margins were anticipated as we made planned investments to increase operational resources in support of our service teams and new product implementations. In addition, increased selling expenses resulting from higher-than-anticipated new business bookings also contributed to the slower growth.
In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 3% for the quarter or 6% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was primarily driven by net new business additions in the quarter. As a reminder, new recurring revenue from ACA-related modules is not expected to impact revenue growth until the third fiscal quarter. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 120 basis points for the quarter as we continue to experience elevated losses from clients on legacy platforms.
Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.5% in the second quarter. Average client fund balances grew 4% compared to a year ago or 6% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions from new business as well as increased pays for control. Outside the U.S., growth in our multinational solutions remains strong.
Employer Services margin declined about 30 basis points in the quarter due to planned investments that we have made in operational resources to install new business sold and provide services to our clients as well as higher selling expenses from continued strong new business bookings.
ADP's PEO continues to perform very well, with revenue growth of 18% in the second quarter. As Carlos mentioned, the PEO reached a milestone in the quarter, surpassing 400,000 average client employees to reach 403,000, which represents growth of 14%.
We continue to see an increase in benefit plan participation rates from our worksite employees, a trend we expect to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year. The PEO also continues to drive margin expansion through operating efficiencies, expanding margins by approximately 20 basis points in the quarter.
We are pleased with the progress we have made through fiscal year -- for the first half of fiscal year 2016, particularly with the success we have seen in new business bookings. As Carlos mentioned, we are now forecasting new business bookings growth of at least 12% compared to our prior forecast of at least 10%. As a result of this change to our expectations and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which occurred towards the end of calendar year 2015, we have updated certain elements of our fiscal year 2016 forecast.
ADP now expects fiscal year 2016 revenue growth of about 7% compared with our prior forecast of 7% to 8%. This change is due to higher-than-anticipated pressure from unfavorable foreign currency translation, which is now expected to impact our revenue growth by about 2 percentage points for the fiscal year.
On a constant dollar basis, ADP now expects revenue growth of 9%, which is the higher end of our previously forecasted range of 8% to 9%. This updated forecast reflects our increased expectations for new business bookings growth as well as our confidence in the recurring revenue, which will start from new solutions sold over the past 3 quarters. And as a reminder, this forecast also includes almost 1 percentage point of expected pressure from the sale of the AdvancedMD business, which occurred towards the end of the first quarter. 
For the Employer Services segment, revenue growth is anticipated to be 4% to 5% compared with our prior forecast of 5% to 6% due to higher than anticipated pressure from unfavorable foreign currency translation. On a constant dollar basis, revenue growth is now expected to be about 7% compared with our prior forecast of 6% to 7%. Due to the strong half performance -- first half performance of the PEO, ADP is now anticipating 16% to 18% growth for this segment compared to our prior forecast of 15% to 17%. 
Our forecast for adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 basis points is unchanged. On a segment level, we are now expecting margin expansion of about 75 basis points in Employer Services compared with our prior forecast of about 100 basis points. Margin expansion -- expectations for the PEO remain unchanged.
ADP has made some minor changes to our forecast for the client funds extended investment strategy to adjust for the December 2015 increase in the Fed funds rate as well as additional pressure anticipated from foreign currency translation that is expected to reduce our balance growth. These changes are not material to our overall forecast and the details can be found in the supplemented slides on our Investor Relations website.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow 11% to 13% from the $2.89 in fiscal year 2015 compared with our prior forecast growth of 12% to 14%. This forecast reflects additional selling expenses anticipated from increased new business bookings, higher-than-anticipated pressure of unfavorable foreign currency translation, which is assumed to have a negative impact of 1 to 2 percentage points on earnings per share growth. On a constant dollar basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be 12% to 14% compared with our prior forecast of 13% to 15% growth.
These changes to our full year outlook reflect the results of our first half and our expectations for the balance of the fiscal year 2016. However, we continue to acknowledge that changing factors in the marketplace due to uncertainty around ACA compliance could put a short-term strain on our earnings growth. We remain committed to our strategy and to our clients, which we believe will yield the best results for ADP over the long run.
So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions."

But over the last 12 months, that was relative to the total size of ADP. And even to the size of our mid-market business, I would say that it would not be a material change. So we have other legacy products that are larger and still have more clients on them that are also underperforming from a retention standpoint that are a greater focus for us than just the mathematical improvement from PCPW retirement because it's not just not mathematically, I think, significant because it's been waning over the last 12 months even as we got close to the final retirement of the final clients."

I think that's what we said in the first quarter. There's really been no material change. And again, I think that consistent with what we said in the first quarter, I think that the pace of migrations was quite accelerated in the first quarter versus the prior year first quarter. And in the second quarter, it was the same, in part because we had a lot of migrations already in the pipeline and we had momentum. And so I think it's safe to say that we're kind of in the same place, if you will, in terms of the pressure that migrations, which with the benefit of hindsight, and I take some accountability or I take all the accountability as the boss for this, that migration is a very big priority for us, but not at any cost. And organizationally, we had put a lot of focus and a lot of pressure and the organization, as usual, responded to the boss. And I think we may have overdone it and created an inordinate amount of pressure on the organization as a result of the pace of migrations. And I think we also have mentioned that I think the ACA decisions that some of our mid-market clients were making -- because in the upmarket, these are not decisions that you can make over the course of 2 or 3 months. And in the low end of the market, it doesn't apply because under -- companies under 50 employees don't have to comply. So it really is a mid-market issue and we think it had an impact, we just don't know really how to measure that. And then lastly, I also acknowledge that I think we exited the last fiscal year with not enough resources to handle everything I just mentioned, the extra activity around migrations and all of the activity and noise around ACA. So as we've mentioned in our comments, we've added resources and we've taken actions. It's not the first time. ACA is definitely a new factor, and the pace of migrations is something that, with the benefit of hindsight, we probably stepped on the accelerator a little too fast. But we've been through this type of event before. It seems similar to prior times where there's really no concentration of any one particular competitor or any pattern that we can see other than self-inflicted wounds that are repairable, and we're in the process of repairing them, and we see some signs of improvement. So despite the fact that we still have 40% of the clients in the mid-market, it doesn't necessarily mean that we will have to continue to see -- and we don't plan on continuing. We obviously have no -- we don't provide a forecast and we don't provide guidance around retention. But I can assure you that we don't believe that we have to accept the retention levels that we have on our legacy platforms today. So we're not just standing idly by and continuing on the same pace of migrations and with the same actions and don't expect the same results going forward."

And so I think the wording we've used, I think it may have been in my comments or in Jan's opening comments is that clearly, ACA added to our new business bookings growth and exceeded our -- allowed us to exceed our expectations in terms of bookings. So I guess, an indirect way of answering your question is that the long term 8% to 10% new bookings growth that we strive for, absent change events like ACA, it would be safe to say that this year, we're on track to achieve that and that performance above and beyond that would be attributable to ACA. And of course, that's only with 6 months done. That could change in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But I think right now, based on the information we have and what we see in terms of market activity, I think that a fair way to look at it and it's important for all of you to understand that because as Jan said, even though we still have an opportunity in front of us, the opportunity is obviously smaller now than it was in the prior year. And so we don't expect to get as much lift. We hope we do, but we wouldn't expect to get as much lift from ACA in fiscal 2017 in terms of our new bookings growth. Having said all that, the most exciting thing for me around ACA and this event in general is that it should and we hope will drive companies to look at the full HCM bundle. So ACA compliance really requires that you have information not just about how many employees you have and what they're paid, but also about their time, how much -- how many hours they work per week, whether they have benefits or don't have benefits. So having, for example, a Workforce Now platform like we have in the mid-market really helps a lot with ACA compliance. Not to mention that as we roll out analytics tools and other things to help manage people better, those are also attractive features. So I think the combination of the improvements in our user experience, the information that we provide through analytics plus the advantages you get through compliance, we believe and this is our expectation and our hope is that, that will continue to generate new business bookings growth in terms of clients and also sales dollars into the future even if the tailwind that we get from ACA diminishes a little bit in fiscal 2017."

So unless all of a sudden, all of the competitors got together and did something different, there would be nothing in our information that shows that this is a competitive issue in terms of what's driving our retention. So I think that's one answer to the -- one part of the answer to the question. So again, no -- we don't see any changes in the pricing environment or in the competitive environment. The -- in terms of the conversions and the migrations, it is clear, as we're pointing out, that we're getting pressure on legacy platforms. But it doesn't mean that we can't have a better retention rate even on those legacy platforms. So take the example of our downmarket SBS business. In that business, we went through a migration similar to the one that we're describing in majors over the course of multiple years. And as in this case, you have to balance speed with the desire to get done. And in that case, we felt some level of pressure around retention at various points. And when we were done with that migration, our retention rates have definitely improved. So they just didn't stabilize but they improved. But in the case of that client migration, we did not encounter some of these, what we term as self-inflicted wounds that we're having here that we believe we can address and we believe we can correct as we're going through the migration. So again, the problem is there's a lot of uncertainty and it's very -- it would be, I think, irresponsible for us to make definitive statements because we just don't know for sure. But I want to make sure that everyone's very, very clear that we believe that we can impact the retention rates in the mid-market even as we're doing these migrations. And I also want everybody to understand that we're not going to stop doing the migrations, but we will moderate. We still are on track to be finished by the end of fiscal '17, which was our original plan. But the pace at which we do these and the timing of when we do them, I think, we will do on our terms in order to maximize the balance between client retention and also the long-term health of our business and what's right for our clients."

But you should -- again, back to the discussion we had about PCPW, just if you think about this mathematically, clearly, as we continue to migrate clients, the number of clients on legacy platforms becomes smaller and smaller and mathematically it has a smaller and smaller impact on our retention rate. So I would just caution a linear assumption around retention into 2017, even though that's clearly a possibility. But I would caution against making that assumption because that base of clients is becoming smaller and smaller and will have a smaller impact on our overall retention rate. I also just want to reiterate, and I'll let Jan weigh in, what we just said earlier, which is at this point, our new business bookings is more than offsetting the pressure we're having from retention. And our revenue growth rate, we moved up in terms of our guidance for this year, and we're very, very happy with where we are versus our long-term range. We have said in the first quarter and we will say again today that in the second half of this fiscal year, on a constant dollar basis, if you adjust for the AdvancedMD disposition, which typically would have been included in discontinued ops, but because of accounting changes, it is not in discontinued ops. So if you adjust for that, we will be at the high end of our long-term revenue growth guidance."

This morning, we reported results for our second quarter of fiscal 2016, which included revenue growth of 6% or 8% on a constant dollar basis. This solid revenue growth was impacted by about 1 percentage point",1195,"Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported results for our second quarter of fiscal 2016, which included revenue growth of 6% or 8% on a constant dollar basis. This solid revenue growth was impacted by about 1 percentage point from the sale of our AdvancedMD business at the end of the first fiscal quarter.
In the second quarter, we continue to see very strong demand for our solutions, which is evidenced by our new business bookings growth of 15%. Sales of additional Human Capital Management modules that assist with Affordable Care Act or ACA compliance continue to contribute meaningfully to this performance, which has exceeded our expectations on a year-to-date basis. As a result, we are now forecasting new business bookings growth of at least 12% for fiscal 2016.
In addition to delivering this solid performance, we've returned to shareholders an additional $780 million through share repurchases in the first half of the fiscal year. And in November of 2015, our board approved an increase of our cash dividend of 8%, marking our 41st consecutive year of dividend increases. These actions demonstrate our commitment to shareholder-friendly actions and are intended to contribute to ADP's goal of achieving top quartile total shareholder return.
It has been an exciting and challenging quarter for ADP and our associates as we help our clients prepare to comply with the ACA. Our teams have worked very hard to implement Human Capital Management modules that were sold during calendar 2015, and I am pleased with the number of units started on our ACA platforms during the quarter. This is performance that we should be proud of, and I want to thank our associates for all of their hard work and dedication to our clients.
We now have more than 14,000 U.S. clients with over 50 full-time employees live on our ACA solutions. Let me put that achievement into perspective. By the end of March, employers with 50-plus employees will be required to send Form 1095-C to each of their employees describing the health insurance available to them. This is the most significant employee tax filing form that the U.S. government has introduced since the W-2, and ADP is on track to deliver about 10 million of them in the first year.
Success of our ACA solutions is just one example of ADP's proficiency in dealing with complex compliance issues. From helping clients determine eligibility for Work Opportunity Tax Credits signed into law just weeks ago to preparing for anticipated changes in overtime rules, ADP's expertise is unique in the dynamic world of HR compliance.
And as this complexity grows, many clients are choosing to outsource HR entirely to ADP. Our PEO business, ADP TotalSource, experienced another strong quarter, growing revenue 18% and average worksite employees by 14% in the second quarter. With this growth, we eclipsed an exciting milestone. ADP TotalSource, already the largest PEO in the U.S., now supports more than 400,000 client employees. In fact, if ADP TotalSource were an independent employer, it would rank among the top 5 private employers in the U.S.
On the new product front, while in its early days, we're excited about the progress we're making with our analytics platform called ADP DataCloud. During the quarter, we fully released a benchmarking capability with more than 1,000 job titles, which allows our clients to generate actionable insights from workforce data embedded in their ADP HCM solutions, the benchmarking platform available for U.S. companies throughout aggregated and anonymized information from ADP's large U.S. client base.
And of course, ADP's data advantage is a global one. During the quarter, we introduced the ADP France National Employment Report as part of our commitment to adding deeper insights into the labor markets globally and providing businesses, governments and others with a source of credible and valuable information. Similar to the U.S. report, each month, ADP will publish aggregated employment statistics from an anonymized sample drawing from 1.3 million workers included among ADP's client base in France. These are just a few examples of ADP's leadership in the HCM category, which continues to receive positive external recognition.
Most recently, Ventana Research recognized our ADP Vantage platform with its Technology Innovation Award in the business innovation category. In bestowing this honor, Ventana recognized us for our ability to, and I quote, ""help employees not just be efficient through a modern user experience, but actually enjoy working with the application."" It's always gratifying to see the HCM community recognize the progress we've made with our platforms.
And now I'd like to give you an update on client retention. In the second quarter, ADP experienced a decline in retention of 120 basis points, which marks a sequential improvement over the first quarter. While we are disappointed to see this metric slip from its recent historical high, we are pleased that retention on our strategic platforms remains high.
Consistent with the first quarter, the majority of the retention declines stems from clients on mature technology, and we still believe that market activity from employers choosing their ACA providers has introduced a change event for our clients. Although disappointing, our management team remains focused on this metric, and we are -- we have taken actions to address opportunities we have for improvement.
Our progress on client migrations remains a key area of focus for us. And based on the success we've seen in our Small Business Services unit with all clients now on ADP RUN, we believe these migrations are the right thing for our clients and for the long-term success of our business. As evidence of this, in December, we reached a milestone as we were able to sunset the PCPW platform in the mid-market, a legacy payroll product.
Many clients have chosen ADP for our strength and expertise in compliance. We are in a time when the level of uncertainty in the regulatory environment is higher than it's been in decades. And as a result, our clients are even more reliant on our service teams. As a management team, we remain focused on the client experience, which includes staffing our service teams to the levels appropriate for assisting our clients with these HCM needs. Since last quarter, we have hired over 1,000 associates to assist our clients and expect to receive the benefit of adding these talented people in the coming months. Once again, I want to thank and congratulate these new as well as our tenured associates for their continued contributions to our success.
I'll wrap with just one reflection from our ReThink Global HCM Conference, which I attended last week in Rome. There, we had executive, HR, finance, IT and security leaders together to explore global perspectives around managing and cultivating the foundation of organizational success. It's clear that winning the war for talent as well as handling compliance on a global scale are critical issues facing businesses around the world. What's even clearer to me is that no organization is better positioned to help these clients than we are.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jan for a further review of our second quarter results and an update on our fiscal 2016 outlook."
126269,320081261,925950,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 03, 2016",2016-02-03,"Earnings Calls","Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we realized a gain of $14 million from the sale of a building. My comments on the quarter refer to adjusted results, which exclude the impact of this gain.ADP revenues grew 6%",1115,"Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we realized a gain of $14 million from the sale of a building. My comments on the quarter refer to adjusted results, which exclude the impact of this gain.
ADP revenues grew 6% or 8% on a constant dollar basis. This growth includes approximately 1 percentage point of pressure due to the divestiture of the AdvancedMD business, which occurred at the end of the first quarter.
As Carlos mentioned, our new business bookings remained strong, posting 15% growth for the second quarter. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT grew 2% or 4% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBIT margin decreased about 70 basis points compared to 18.7% in the last year's second quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 4% to $0.72 or 6% on a constant dollar basis and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago.
The slower earnings growth we realized in the second quarter as well as the decline in margins were anticipated as we made planned investments to increase operational resources in support of our service teams and new product implementations. In addition, increased selling expenses resulting from higher-than-anticipated new business bookings also contributed to the slower growth.
In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 3% for the quarter or 6% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was primarily driven by net new business additions in the quarter. As a reminder, new recurring revenue from ACA-related modules is not expected to impact revenue growth until the third fiscal quarter. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 120 basis points for the quarter as we continue to experience elevated losses from clients on legacy platforms.
Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.5% in the second quarter. Average client fund balances grew 4% compared to a year ago or 6% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions from new business as well as increased pays for control. Outside the U.S., growth in our multinational solutions remains strong.
Employer Services margin declined about 30 basis points in the quarter due to planned investments that we have made in operational resources to install new business sold and provide services to our clients as well as higher selling expenses from continued strong new business bookings.
ADP's PEO continues to perform very well, with revenue growth of 18% in the second quarter. As Carlos mentioned, the PEO reached a milestone in the quarter, surpassing 400,000 average client employees to reach 403,000, which represents growth of 14%.
We continue to see an increase in benefit plan participation rates from our worksite employees, a trend we expect to continue for the remainder of the fiscal year. The PEO also continues to drive margin expansion through operating efficiencies, expanding margins by approximately 20 basis points in the quarter.
We are pleased with the progress we have made through fiscal year -- for the first half of fiscal year 2016, particularly with the success we have seen in new business bookings. As Carlos mentioned, we are now forecasting new business bookings growth of at least 12% compared to our prior forecast of at least 10%. As a result of this change to our expectations and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, which occurred towards the end of calendar year 2015, we have updated certain elements of our fiscal year 2016 forecast.
ADP now expects fiscal year 2016 revenue growth of about 7% compared with our prior forecast of 7% to 8%. This change is due to higher-than-anticipated pressure from unfavorable foreign currency translation, which is now expected to impact our revenue growth by about 2 percentage points for the fiscal year.
On a constant dollar basis, ADP now expects revenue growth of 9%, which is the higher end of our previously forecasted range of 8% to 9%. This updated forecast reflects our increased expectations for new business bookings growth as well as our confidence in the recurring revenue, which will start from new solutions sold over the past 3 quarters. And as a reminder, this forecast also includes almost 1 percentage point of expected pressure from the sale of the AdvancedMD business, which occurred towards the end of the first quarter. 
For the Employer Services segment, revenue growth is anticipated to be 4% to 5% compared with our prior forecast of 5% to 6% due to higher than anticipated pressure from unfavorable foreign currency translation. On a constant dollar basis, revenue growth is now expected to be about 7% compared with our prior forecast of 6% to 7%. Due to the strong half performance -- first half performance of the PEO, ADP is now anticipating 16% to 18% growth for this segment compared to our prior forecast of 15% to 17%. 
Our forecast for adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 basis points is unchanged. On a segment level, we are now expecting margin expansion of about 75 basis points in Employer Services compared with our prior forecast of about 100 basis points. Margin expansion -- expectations for the PEO remain unchanged.
ADP has made some minor changes to our forecast for the client funds extended investment strategy to adjust for the December 2015 increase in the Fed funds rate as well as additional pressure anticipated from foreign currency translation that is expected to reduce our balance growth. These changes are not material to our overall forecast and the details can be found in the supplemented slides on our Investor Relations website.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow 11% to 13% from the $2.89 in fiscal year 2015 compared with our prior forecast growth of 12% to 14%. This forecast reflects additional selling expenses anticipated from increased new business bookings, higher-than-anticipated pressure of unfavorable foreign currency translation, which is assumed to have a negative impact of 1 to 2 percentage points on earnings per share growth. On a constant dollar basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be 12% to 14% compared with our prior forecast of 13% to 15% growth.
These changes to our full year outlook reflect the results of our first half and our expectations for the balance of the fiscal year 2016. However, we continue to acknowledge that changing factors in the marketplace due to uncertainty around ACA compliance could put a short-term strain on our earnings growth. We remain committed to our strategy and to our clients, which we believe will yield the best results for ADP over the long run.
So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions."

But over the last 12 months, that was relative to the total size of ADP. And even to the size of our mid-market business, I would say that it would not be a material change. So we have other legacy products that are larger and still have more clients on them that are also underperforming from a retention standpoint that are a greater focus for us than just the mathematical improvement from PCPW retirement because it's not just not mathematically, I think, significant because it's been waning over the last 12 months even as we got close to the final retirement of the final clients."

I think that's what we said in the first quarter. There's really been no material change. And again, I think that consistent with what we said in the first quarter, I think that the pace of migrations was quite accelerated in the first quarter versus the prior year first quarter. And in the second quarter, it was the same, in part because we had a lot of migrations already in the pipeline and we had momentum. And so I think it's safe to say that we're kind of in the same place, if you will, in terms of the pressure that migrations, which with the benefit of hindsight, and I take some accountability or I take all the accountability as the boss for this, that migration is a very big priority for us, but not at any cost. And organizationally, we had put a lot of focus and a lot of pressure and the organization, as usual, responded to the boss. And I think we may have overdone it and created an inordinate amount of pressure on the organization as a result of the pace of migrations. And I think we also have mentioned that I think the ACA decisions that some of our mid-market clients were making -- because in the upmarket, these are not decisions that you can make over the course of 2 or 3 months. And in the low end of the market, it doesn't apply because under -- companies under 50 employees don't have to comply. So it really is a mid-market issue and we think it had an impact, we just don't know really how to measure that. And then lastly, I also acknowledge that I think we exited the last fiscal year with not enough resources to handle everything I just mentioned, the extra activity around migrations and all of the activity and noise around ACA. So as we've mentioned in our comments, we've added resources and we've taken actions. It's not the first time. ACA is definitely a new factor, and the pace of migrations is something that, with the benefit of hindsight, we probably stepped on the accelerator a little too fast. But we've been through this type of event before. It seems similar to prior times where there's really no concentration of any one particular competitor or any pattern that we can see other than self-inflicted wounds that are repairable, and we're in the process of repairing them, and we see some signs of improvement. So despite the fact that we still have 40% of the clients in the mid-market, it doesn't necessarily mean that we will have to continue to see -- and we don't plan on continuing. We obviously have no -- we don't provide a forecast and we don't provide guidance around retention. But I can assure you that we don't believe that we have to accept the retention levels that we have on our legacy platforms today. So we're not just standing idly by and continuing on the same pace of migrations and with the same actions and don't expect the same results going forward."

But I think it's important for you to understand directionally. And so I think the wording we've used, I think it may have been in my comments or in Jan's opening comments is that clearly, ACA added to our new business bookings growth and exceeded our -- allowed us to exceed our expectations in terms of bookings. So I guess, an indirect way of answering your question is that the long term 8% to 10% new bookings growth that we strive for, absent change events like ACA, it would be safe to say that this year, we're on track to achieve that and that performance above and beyond that would be attributable to ACA. And of course, that's only with 6 months done. That could change in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. But I think right now, based on the information we have and what we see in terms of market activity, I think that a fair way to look at it and it's important for all of you to understand that because as Jan said, even though we still have an opportunity in front of us, the opportunity is obviously smaller now than it was in the prior year. And so we don't expect to get as much lift. We hope we do, but we wouldn't expect to get as much lift from ACA in fiscal 2017 in terms of our new bookings growth. Having said all that, the most exciting thing for me around ACA and this event in general is that it should and we hope will drive companies to look at the full HCM bundle. So ACA compliance really requires that you have information not just about how many employees you have and what they're paid, but also about their time, how much -- how many hours they work per week, whether they have benefits or don't have benefits. So having, for example, a Workforce Now platform like we have in the mid-market really helps a lot with ACA compliance. Not to mention that as we roll out analytics tools and other things to help manage people better, those are also attractive features. So I think the combination of the improvements in our user experience, the information that we provide through analytics plus the advantages you get through compliance, we believe and this is our expectation and our hope is that, that will continue to generate new business bookings growth in terms of clients and also sales dollars into the future even if the tailwind that we get from ACA diminishes a little bit in fiscal 2017."

So unless all of a sudden, all of the competitors got together and did something different, there would be nothing in our information that shows that this is a competitive issue in terms of what's driving our retention. So I think that's one answer to the -- one part of the answer to the question. So again, no -- we don't see any changes in the pricing environment or in the competitive environment. The -- in terms of the conversions and the migrations, it is clear, as we're pointing out, that we're getting pressure on legacy platforms. But it doesn't mean that we can't have a better retention rate even on those legacy platforms. So take the example of our downmarket SBS business. In that business, we went through a migration similar to the one that we're describing in majors over the course of multiple years. And as in this case, you have to balance speed with the desire to get done. And in that case, we felt some level of pressure around retention at various points. And when we were done with that migration, our retention rates have definitely improved. So they just didn't stabilize but they improved. But in the case of that client migration, we did not encounter some of these, what we term as self-inflicted wounds that we're having here that we believe we can address and we believe we can correct as we're going through the migration. So again, the problem is there's a lot of uncertainty and it's very -- it would be, I think, irresponsible for us to make definitive statements because we just don't know for sure. But I want to make sure that everyone's very, very clear that we believe that we can impact the retention rates in the mid-market even as we're doing these migrations. And I also want everybody to understand that we're not going to stop doing the migrations, but we will moderate. We still are on track to be finished by the end of fiscal '17, which was our original plan. But the pace at which we do these and the timing of when we do them, I think, we will do on our terms in order to maximize the balance between client retention and also the long-term health of our business and what's right for our clients."

But you should -- again, back to the discussion we had about PCPW, just if you think about this mathematically, clearly, as we continue to migrate clients, the number of clients on legacy platforms becomes smaller and smaller and mathematically it has a smaller and smaller impact on our retention rate. So I would just caution a linear assumption around retention into 2017, even though that's clearly a possibility. But I would caution against making that assumption because that base of clients is becoming smaller and smaller and will have a smaller impact on our overall retention rate. I also just want to reiterate, and I'll let Jan weigh in, what we just said earlier, which is at this point, our new business bookings is more than offsetting the pressure we're having from retention. And our revenue growth rate, we moved up in terms of our guidance for this year, and we're very, very happy with where we are versus our long-term range. We have said in the first quarter and we will say again today that in the second half of this fiscal year, on a constant dollar basis, if you adjust for the AdvancedMD disposition, which typically would have been included in discontinued ops, but because of accounting changes, it is not in discontinued ops.

And if you exclude the pass-throughs from the P&O -- PEO margins, you'll see actually there even slightly ahead of our ES margins. So the characteristic of ADP, and in a very interesting way, is that we have a margin profile that is actually very similar between our product sets. And even our HR BPO products, excluding the pass-throughs, have margin characteristics that are roughly in line for most of the cases with our overall margin profile. So if you think about ADP as a kind of gross margin for an ongoing contribution of the recurring revenue model, the ACA product is to -- expected to have exactly that margin profile. So it will not -- we don't think about it in any way different than the rest of our product set."

And so we do have a chart that shows, and I think we may have even mentioned it in our comments in the script, that the benefits participation rate is trending upwards. So it had been trending downwards several years ago pre-ACA, and now it's trending upward. It's not a dramatic increase, but it's enough to help drive additional difference between our worksite employee growth and our top line revenue growth, which is why it's so important to look at the margin dynamics of that business, excluding those pass-through revenues."

So we definitely don't have any plans to slow it down and to see it slow it down because on a per client or per worksite employee basis, no matter how you look at it, that business is a winner for ADP. And we convert about half of the business that starts in the PEO comes from existing ADP clients that we upsell.

While sales of additional human capital management modules that assist with the Affordable Care Act, or ACA compliance, continue to boost our performance, we were especially pleased to see balance growth contribution across our ACM portfolio. From further penetration of new application into our base, to growth in a number of clients using our Higher Touch HR outsourcing models, we are seeing continued traction for our technology solutions and our robust service offerings. 
During the quarter, ADP continues to focus on implementation of solutions that support ACA reporting requirements in the U.S. At the end of March, importers with 50 or more employees were required to send Form 1095-C to each of their employees, describing the health insurance available to them. This is the most significant employee tax filing form introduced by the U.S. government since the W-2, more than 70 years ago and is significantly more complex for the employer to deliver. More than 25,000 clients, ranging in size from 50 to 50,000 employees trusted ADP to assist them with ACA. As of March 31, ADP delivered nearly 10 million Form 1095-Cs to these client employees. This endeavor was no small task. To put it into perspective, ADP processed nearly 60 million W-2 forms for the 2015 tax year, a form we would have been producing for decades. The W-2 requires 1 system of record, the payroll system, and is therefore, significant be easier to produce than the 1095-C, which can require data from multiple sources. So as you may imagine, producing 10 million Form 1095-Cs in the first reporting year of this new regulations was demanding for us and required a strong partnership with our clients. 
This is another example of the breadth of our capabilities in the complex world of workforce compliance, and I am very proud of the work our teams have done and will continue to do to help these clients navigate the uncharted waters of ACA reporting. 
ADP's global capabilities also continue to be a differentiator for us. ADP first began offering global payroll services more than a decade ago, and we have continuously expanded our offering across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and the Americas. Last month, we announced the expansion of our capabilities to 7 additional locations, including Angola, Tanzania and Zambia. Now in a 111 countries around the globe, ADP is bringing our global client the benefits of integrated payroll solutions from a provider they trust. This ability to support the payroll compliance needs of global firms managing businesses in locales with constant changes in the legal and regulatory landscape is incredibly powerful and unrivaled in our industry. 
Now I'd like to give you an update on client retention. In the third quarter, ADP experienced a decline in retention of 30 basis points. We do believe the sequential improvement as a result of actions we've taken to strengthen our service capabilities. The talented professionals we've added to our service teams are now supporting our clients. And although we have an easier year-over-year comparison, we expect the client experience to continue to improve as these associates gain more experience. Aside from our clients interactions with ADP through service and implementation, a key component of the client experiences our technology. We believe that our strategic platforms deliver best-in-class HCM capabilities in each of the markets they serve. And clients on this platforms generally have higher retention rates than those on our mature technology. So we are continuing to focus on upgrading clients to our modern cloud solutions. As we've previously discussed, we intentionally slowed the pace of migrations in recent months, so we could best assist our clients with ACA compliance. With additional talent in place and the effort of ACA reporting beginning to slow, we intend to return to our migration pace to enable us to complete our midmarket upgrades through the latest version of Workforce Now by the end of fiscal year 2017, which is in line with our previous expectations. 
Upgrading clients for mature technology is an important element of our strategy and the right thing for our clients.
Positive external recognition further bolsters our confidence in our product and service offering. Earlier this quarter, we announced that Everest Group has once again named us a leader and star performer in its annual Everest Group Peak Matrix for Multiprocess HR Outsourcing Providers. The report cites the number of new deals, expanded global service delivery, success of our mobile solutions and the introduction of our analytics and big data solution called ADP Data Cloud as evidence of ADP's continued commitment to providing an enriched scope of solutions to our global clients. It's flattering when influencers recognize our strategic progress, but it's even more rewarding when clients do. I recently had the opportunity to spend time with many clients at our Annual ADP Meeting of the Minds Conference, which we just held in Washington, D.C. Each year, we use this opportunity to update our clients in our developments and share where we are headed while listening and learning more about their challenges. What's clear is that these are challenging times for payroll and HCM professionals. ACA, globalization, regulatory complexity, the fight for top talent and changing workforce dynamics are all having a profound impact on how HR is practiced. We've built our business to help clients through these challenges and many others. We are unique in our ability to deliver capabilities across the HCM spectrum, from recruitment through retirement for businesses of all sizes around the entire globe. This was on display at Meeting of the Minds, and the client response to our progress was gratifying. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for further review of our third quarter results."

For the third quarter, ADP revenues grew 7% or 9% on a constant dollar basis. This solid revenue growth was driven by net new additions to our recurring revenue stream, including the impact of ACA-related revenue, which began contributing to our growth in the third quarter. Earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, grew 9% or 10% on a constant dollar basis. This growth, while stronger than the first half of the fiscal year, continues to reflect additional costs related to selling expenses and incremental operational resources in support of new business sold. EBIT margin increased about 40 basis points compared to 24.4% in last year's third quarter. Diluted earnings per share grew 14% to $1.17, and reflected a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with 1 year ago. In addition to delivering this solid operating performance, we have paid more than $700 million in dividends and returned more than $1 billion through share repurchases in the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year. 
In our employee services segment, revenues grew 5% for the quarter or 7% on a constant dollar basis. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 30 basis points in the third quarter, and we remain focused on the actions that will improve this metric. Our same-store control in the U.S. grew 2.5%, and average client balances grew 2% compared to a year ago or 3% on a constant dollar basis. On a year-to-date basis, we have seen a relative slowing in our pace for control metric compared with the 3% growth last year, which we believe is consistent with the U.S. economy, reaching high employment levels. As a result of improving employment, we couldn't continue to see declines in states' unemployment insurance collections, which had a drag on client fund balances but a lesser rate than last year. This in combination with a week of Mona season and the impact from client losses experienced in the first half has put added pressure on the growth of our client fund balances for the quarter. 
Our business outside the U.S. continues to perform well, driven by the strength of our multinational solutions, which serve businesses of all size, from smaller midmarket clients to very large global corporations. 
Employee Services segment margin declined about 40 basis points for the third quarter. This decline resulted from the impact of planned investments made in operational resources to implement a strong volume of new business sold over the last few quarters. 
ADP's PO posted another quarter of strong performance, with third quarter revenue growth of 16% and growth in the average worksite employees of 14%. The PO also delivered a solid margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points in the third quarter, driven primarily by operating and selling efficiencies as we continue to see good execution and increased productivity. 
I'm pleased with the progress we have made. And we'll now give you an update on our expectations for fiscal year 2016.
For the fiscal year, ADP still expects revenue growth of about 7% or 9% on a constant dollar basis. As a reminder, this forecast includes almost 1 percentage point of expected pressure from the sale of the AdvancedMD business, which occurred towards the end of the first fiscal quarter. For the Employer Services segment, consistent with our prior forecast, revenue growth is anticipated to be 4% to 5% with 7% on a constant dollar basis. For the PEO, ADP is now anticipating revenue growth of about 17% compared with our prior forecast range of 16% to 18%. Our forecast for adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 basis points is unchanged. We are now expecting Employee Services margin expansion of about 50 basis points compared with our prior forecast of margin expansion of about 75 basis points. Margin in the PEO is now expected to expand up to 75 basis points compared with our prior forecast of about 50 basis points. We have narrowed our forecast for average time fund balances and are now expecting 3% growth or 4% on a constant dollar basis. We're also now expecting growth in client funds interest revenue to be about flat to last year compared with our prior forecast with increase of about $5 million. This is a result of the lower interest rate environment from the softening of the global economy. The total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy is still expected to be about flat compared to the $419 million in fiscal year 2015. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are now expected to grow about 12% from the $2.89 in fiscal year 2015 compared with our prior forecasted growth range of 11% to 13%. On a constant dollar basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow about 13% compared with our prior forecasted growth range of 12% to 14%. 
And with that, I now will turn it over to the operator to take your questions."

But the -- when we -- the slowdown in implementation is really around migrations. Just to be clear. And I think after the first quarter, I think, we mentioned that we had began already the slowdown of some of our migrations. Now there continue to be scheduled migrations that spilled over into the second quarter. So it's really towards the end of the second quarter, our fiscal second quarter, that we began to really try to focus more on stabilizing our service organization and also our ACA implementations, and, hence, this third leg that was putting pressure on us and the third leg of the stool, which is an important part of the strategy, but we felt like that  we could in the short-term, slow down or take pressure off of our selves is what we did around the slowdown in the migration. That's exactly what happened. To put it into perspective, the first quarter of the year, our migrations were more than double at the same rate of the previous year's first quarter. We still did some migrations here in the third quarter. But I would say it was at very, very low rates. And we had the desired impact, which has allowed us to focus on the other things that we had from a volume standpoint in ACA and also trying to redirect some of those resources to stabilizing our service environment. And so I think that was -- we did exactly what we had planned to do, and I think what we communicated. And I think we got the desired results. As I mentioned in the first and second quarter, there is no scientific way to know how much each of those 3 things was putting pressure individually on our retention and our client service experience. But we basically had one that we had very -- a lot of control over, which is migrations and we decided to slow it."

But I think as we said over the last couple of quarters, I think it's probably not helpful. Again, these are very identical clients. Everybody knows who their names are. And most of our competitors what platforms they're on. We don't believe it's going to be useful for us to get into a lot of detail around our schedules and which platforms and which clients we're migrating. But you should take from the message that Jan and I just delivered on a previous question that you asked. We still believe this is the right thing to do and a slowdown in the midmarket was really just related to all the other moving parts that we  have not because we believe it's a wrong thing to do. So were still in the same strategy. I think it's consistent with prior quarters. We believe that the migrations and the upgrades in the upmarket are going to take longer that they have taken in the down market and in the mid-market. But we're comfortable with that because that's the different nature of the business in the upmarket."

So our business is actually very stable, very predictable. And those 2 numbers are also relatively stable and relatively predictable, but they have more variability in the rest of our numbers. So we never try to forecast quarter-to-quarter or future quarters on either new business bookings or client retention for that reason. So it's clearly a possibility. But it's not our plan. And so you can tell by our desire, or actually, our actions to reignite our migrations that we don't believe that, that will be the case. And we believe that medium and longer-term, it's the right thing to do, which I think would lead you to the conclusion that the other factors, like the high volumes of ACA and some of the service challenges we had around, which were related to ACA implementations and high volumes. The issues around inadequate service capabilities, I think, were also factors that contribute to our retention issues. And we don't think that it was only because of the client migrations. Otherwise, we wouldn't be a probably following a different path. So I think we're confident that it's still the right thing to do. As you know, we had been doing migrations for several years and had not had the same kinds of issues that we experienced over the past couple of quarters with regards to retention. So I think, again, no scientific evidence. But there are a lot of ways of triangulating where we think it's fundamentally the right thing to do. Went up higher tax rates for our modules in our retention rates right now are higher on a strategic platforms at our legacy platforms. There's a lot of reasons to point to the need and I think the advantages of continuing with the migration strategy."

As now, revenue stream of incremental revenue gets really a full quarter. So we're going to see that.

And secondly, the most important factor is in the fourth quarter, we are anticipating -- we have high investments of selling expense in last year's fourth quarter and easy roll over. So with a confirmation of our new business bookings growth of 12%, you can also see that we're not anticipating, mathematically, a blowout fourth quarter because of that difficult roll over that will help the margins."

Not that you're ask about margins but they're also -- I think now what the size, all of them individually and collectively, where we're getting good contribution, I think, to lower margin -- assuming from a dollar standpoint and in many cases also, from a margin percent standpoint. So I think -- that's why we like our position in terms of where we are around starting with our richest bundles where it's really all inclusive in terms of full HCM bundle. The PEO is unique in a sense that it also us employment and provides health care and workers comp. Some of our other very rich bundles are also very, very comprehensive and growing variable and scaling very well. And we've been able to handle those volumes and have gotten good leverage on the margin side. And then as you  come down to our more traditional product, as we also committed a fair, whether it's in Advantage or Workforce Now or even in a down market, maybe attach rates continue to be better on new business than the penetration of our products in the base.

I think as usual, we have -- you can probably, mathematically, as Jan has probably the math tip of his tongue. But I will tell you just interest and point, mathematically, you can tell that the fourth quarter -- we have a decent amount of visibility, given the nature of our business, as to what is happening quarter-to-quarter. And I think the fourth quarter, I think, again, when you exclude, which I think is the right way to do the comparison, you exclude the AdvancedMD comparable from the previous year. We don't have a lot of -- I think, in fact, our current forecast is to not have much of any foreign currency effect in the fourth quarter. I think you normalize for all those things, and we're actually pretty happy with what our fourth quarter revenue growth implies. And then the third quarter, I don't think it's -- it's not fair to say were disappointing because we're pretty happy. Whenever ADP's revenue growth incrementally moves up 0.5 to 1 percentage point, which again normalize for an normalize for currency, that's what happens. That makes us very happy. Because in a recurring revenue model, in order to accomplish that, you have to, as you just pointed out, you have to have strong new business starts, not just bookings. And you have to have either stable or improving retention. That's exactly what we got. There may have been a little calendar noise and a couple of other things in the third quarter that we don't see in the fourth quarter happening. And so we were actually pretty satisfied with kind of where we are. Assuming that all of these things kind of hold that we just communicated."

But obviously now it's half the opportunity that we had in the previous year. What we don't know yet is how people will react in terms of demand because right now everybody is focused on getting the June deadline passed in terms of the employer portion of the employer, which is the 1094. And so  it is really a little early for us to know exactly how much ACA demand we will not have. And we've been very, very transparent and very clear that this provided tailwind. However, we've also been very clear that we would be satisfied and happy to communicate our sales results, both for the quarter and for the year-to-date, excluding ACA. And that communication would lead you to believe that excluding ACA, it will be the neighborhood of our long-term guidance around new business bookings. And so we believe this is incremental. We hope that we'll get more of it next year. But clearly, the mathematics are such that it's going to create -- I wouldn't call it a hangover or overhang. I would call it a very difficult compare that we as we get further along in the next couple of quarters, we'll be able to hopefully communicate a little bit more clearly in terms of what that exactly means when we provide guidance for the next fiscal year."

I want to be very, very clear that we are managing all of the variables in our business, including the need to continue to invest in our technology, in our associates and a number of things. But if, in fact, as Jan said, if the fourth quarter, our new business bookings growth, because of the growth over the previous year is smaller, that takes pressure off us from a margin standpoint. The same would apply to next year if we're not providing guidance in terms of our new business bookings growth for the next year. But mathematically, if we get back into the long-term range of the new business bookings, that will also provide tailwind and help take pressure off of our margin. So again, I mean, I could go on for a long time in terms of our business model works. But we feel pretty good. In fact, this year, I think, would give us a high degree of encouragement. It was hard. And people worked very, very hard on controlling all controllable expenses in order to still deliver the kind of margin improvement that we are in the face of increased costs we had. But it just shows the power of the business model. And I think the ability of the company to leverage its revenue growth."

And even though I think, as Jan was alluding to, obviously, as the economic cycle matures, at some point, there might be an impact on client retention. But for today, take our comments were really directed at our pace for control growth. This I think the math is very clear there. So what we've seen in Bath economic cycles, you could possibly go for a few years with kind of a foolish employment type of situation which then impacts base for control. That doesn't necessarily impact client retention. But clearly, the economic cycle turns, within very clear and very transparent of our business model works, particularly in a down market. A negative economic cycle has negative impact on our client retention."

Thanks for joining our call and for your continued interest in ADP. This morning, we reported results for our third quarter of fiscal 2016, which included revenue growth of 7% or 9%, excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation. In addition to this solid revenue growth, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions, which is evidenced by our new business bookings growth of 13%. While sales of additional human capital management modules that assist with the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, compliance continue to boost our performance, we are especially pleased to see balanced growth contribution across our HCM portfolio. From further penetration of new applications into our base to growth in the number of clients choosing our higher-touch HR outsourcing models, we are seeing continued traction for our technology solutions and our robust service offerings. 
During the quarter, ADP continued to focus on implementation of solutions that support ACA reporting requirements in the U.S. At the end of March, employers with 50 or more employees were required to send Form 1095-C to each of their employees, describing the health insurance available to them. This is the most significant employee tax filing form introduced by the U.S. government since the W2 more than 7 years ago, and it is significantly more complex for the employer to deliver. More than 25,000 clients, ranging in size from 50 to 50,000 employees trusted ADP to assist them with ACA. As of March 31, ADP delivered nearly 10 million Form 1095-Cs to these client employees. This endeavor was no small task. To put it in perspective, ADP processed nearly 60 million W2 forms for the 2015 tax year, a form we have been producing for decades. The W2 requires one system of record, the payroll system, and is therefore, significantly easier to produce than the 1095-C, which can require data from multiple sources. So as you may imagine, producing 10 million Form 1095-Cs in the first reporting year of these new regulations was demanding for us and required a strong partnership with our clients. 
This is another example of the breadth of our capabilities in the complex world of workforce compliance, and I am very proud of the work our teams have done and will continue to do to help these clients navigate the uncharted waters of ACA reporting. 
ADP's global capabilities also continue to be a differentiator for us. ADP first began offering global payroll services more than a decade ago, and we have continuously expanded our offering across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and the Americas. Last month, we announced the expansion of our capabilities to 7 additional locations, including Angola, Tanzania and Zambia. Now in 111 countries around the globe, ADP is bringing our global client the benefits of integrated payroll solutions from a provider they trust. This ability to support the payroll compliance needs of global firms managing businesses in locales with constant changes in the legal and regulatory landscape is incredibly powerful and unrivaled in our industry. 
Now I'd like to give you an update on client retention. In the third quarter, ADP experienced a decline in retention of 30 basis points. We do believe the sequential improvement is a result of actions we've taken to strengthen our service capabilities. The talented professionals we've added to our service teams are now supporting our clients. And although we have an easier year-over-year comparison, we expect the client experience to continue to improve as these associates gain more experience. Aside from our clients interactions with ADP through service and implementation, a key component of the client experience is our technology. We believe that our strategic platforms deliver best-in-class HCM capabilities in each of the markets they serve. And clients on this platforms generally have higher retention rates than those on our matured technology. So we are continuing to focus on upgrading clients to our modern cloud solutions. As we've previously discussed, we intentionally slowed the pace of migrations in recent months, so we could best assist our clients with ACA compliance. With additional talent in place and the effort of ACA reporting beginning to slow, we intend to return to a migration pace that will enable us to complete our mid-market upgrades to the latest version of Workforce Now by the end of fiscal year 2017, which is in line with our previous expectations. 
Upgrading clients for mature technology is an important element of our strategy and the right thing for our clients.
Positive external recognition further bolsters our confidence in our product and service offering. Earlier this quarter, we announced that Everest Group has once again named us a leader and star performer in its annual Everest Group Peak Matrix for Multi-Process HR Outsourcing Providers. The report cites the number of new deals, expanded global service delivery, success of our mobile solutions and the introduction of our analytics and big data solution called ADP DataCloud as evidence of ADP's continued commitment to providing an enriched scope of solutions to our global clients. It's flattering when influencers recognize our strategic progress, but it's even more rewarding when clients do. I recently had the opportunity to spend time with many clients at our Annual ADP Meeting of the Minds Conference, which we just held in Washington, D.C. Each year, we use this opportunity to update our clients on our developments and share where we are headed, while listening and learning more about their challenges. What's clear is that these are challenging times for payroll and HCM professionals. ACA, globalization, regulatory complexity, their fight for top talent and changing workforce dynamics are all having a profound impact on how HR is practiced. We've built our business to help clients through these challenges and many others. We are unique in our ability to deliver capabilities across the HCM spectrum, from recruitment through retirement for businesses of all sizes around the entire globe. This was on display at Meeting of the Minds, and the client response to our progress was gratifying. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for a further review of our third quarter results."

For the third quarter, ADP revenues grew 7% or 9% on a constant dollar basis. This solid revenue growth was driven by net new additions to our recurring revenue stream, including the impact of ACA-related revenue, which began contributing to our growth in the third quarter. Earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, grew 9% or 10% on a constant dollar basis. This growth, while stronger than the first half of the fiscal year, continues to reflect additional costs related to selling expenses and incremental operational resources in support of new business sold. EBIT margin increased about 40 basis points compared to 24.4% in last year's third quarter. Diluted earnings per share grew 14% to $1.17, and reflected a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. In addition to delivering this solid operating performance, we have paid more than $700 million in dividends and returned more than $1 billion through share repurchases in the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year. 
In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 5% for the quarter or 7% on a constant dollar basis. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 30 basis points in the third quarter, and we remain focused on actions that will improve this metric. Our same-store pay per control in the U.S. grew 2.5%, and average client fund balances grew 2% compared to a year ago or 3% on a constant dollar basis. On a year-to-date basis, we have seen a relative slowing in our pays per control metric compared with the 3% growth last year, which we believe is consistent with the U.S. economy reaching high employment levels. As a result of improving employment, we couldn't continue to see declines in state unemployment insurance collections, which have had a drag on client fund balances, but at a lesser rate than last year. This in combination with a week of bonus season and the impact from client losses experienced in the first half has put added pressure on the growth of our client fund balances for the quarter. 
Our business outside the U.S. continues to perform well, driven by the strength of our multinational solutions, which serve businesses of all size, from smaller mid-market clients to very large global corporations. 
Employer Services segment margin declined about 40 basis points for the third quarter. This decline resulted from the impact of planned investments made in operational resources to implement a strong volume of new business sold over the last few quarters. 
ADP's PEO posted another quarter of strong performance, with third quarter revenue growth of 16% and growth in the average worksite employees of 14%. The PEO also delivered solid margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points in the third quarter, driven primarily by operating and selling efficiencies, as we continue to see good execution and increased productivity. 
I'm pleased with the progress we have made, and we'll now give you an update on our expectations for fiscal year 2016.
For the fiscal year, ADP still expects revenue growth of about 7% or 9% on a constant dollar basis. As a reminder, this forecast includes almost 1 percentage point of expected pressure from the sale of the AdvancedMD business, which occurred towards the end of the first fiscal quarter. For the Employer Services segment, consistent with our prior forecast, revenue growth is anticipated to be 4% to 5% with 7% on a constant dollar basis. For the PEO, ADP is now anticipating revenue growth of about 17% compared with our prior forecast range of 16% to 18%. Our forecast for adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 basis points is unchanged. We are now expecting Employer Services margin expansion of about 50 basis points compared with our prior forecast of margin expansion of about 75 basis points. Margin in the PEO is now expected to expand up to 75 basis points compared with our prior forecast of about 50 basis points. We have narrowed our forecast for average client fund balances and are now expecting 3% growth or 4% on a constant dollar basis. 
We're also now expecting growth in client funds interest revenue to be about flat to last year compared with our prior forecasted increase of up to $5 million. This is a result of the lower interest rate environment from the softening of the global economy. The total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy is still expected to be about flat compared to the $419 million in fiscal year 2015. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share are now expected to grow about 12% from the $2.89 in fiscal year 2015 compared with our prior forecasted growth range of 11% to 13%. On a constant dollar basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow about 13% compared with our prior forecasted growth range of 12% to 14%.

I'll let Jan maybe put in a couple of stats also, but the -- when we -- the slowdown in implementation was really around migrations, just to be clear. And I think after the first quarter, I think we mentioned that we had begun already to slowdown some of our migrations. Now there continued to be some scheduled migrations that spilled over into the second quarter. So it was really towards the end of the second quarter or fiscal second quarter that we began to really try to focus more on stabilizing our service organization and also our ACA implementations, and hence, this third leg that was putting pressure on us, and the third leg of the stool, which is an important part of our strategy, but we felt like we could, in the short-term, slow down or take pressure off of our selves is what we did around the slowdown in the migration. That's exactly what happened. To put it in perspective, the first quarter of the year, our migrations were more than double at the same rate of the previous year's first quarter. We still did some migrations here in the third quarter. But I would say it was very, very low rates, and we had -- we got the desired impact, which has allowed us to focus on the other things that we had from a volume standpoint on ACA and also trying to redirect some of those resources to stabilizing our service environment. And so I think that was -- we did exactly what we had planned to do, and I think what we communicated. And I think we got the desired results. As I mentioned in the first and second quarter, there is no scientific way to know how much each of those 3 things was putting pressure individually on our retention and our client service experience, but we basically had one that we had very -- a lot of control over, which is migrations, and we decided to slow it."

And I think there we are, I think, moving ahead with plans in terms of a similar strategy of what we had in the downmarket and in the mid-market, which is to get our clients onto our strategic platforms over time. But I think as we said over the last couple of quarters, I think it's probably not helpful. And given that these are very identifiable clients, everyone knows who their names are and most of our competitors know what platforms they're on. We don't believe that it's going to be fruitful and useful for us to get into a lot of detail around our schedules and which platforms and which clients we're migrating. But you should take from the message that Jan and I just delivered on the previous question that you asked that we still believe this is the right thing to do and the slowdown in the mid-market was really just related to all the other moving parts that we had, not because we believe it's the wrong thing to do. So we're still on the same strategy. It's, I think, consistent with prior quarters. We believe that the migrations and the upgrades in the upmarket are going to take longer that they have taken in the downmarket and in the mid-market, but we're comfortable with that, because that's just a different nature of the business in the upmarket."

Our business model is actually very stable, very predictable. And those 2 numbers are also relatively stable and relatively predictable, but they have more variability on the rest of our numbers. So we never try to forecast quarter-to-quarter or future quarters on either new business bookings or client retention for that reason. So it's clearly a possibility, but it's not our plan. And so you can tell by our desire, or actually our actions to reignite our migrations that we don't believe that, that will be the case, and we believe that medium and longer-term, it's the right thing to do, which I think would lead you to the conclusion that the other factors like the high volumes of ACA and some of the service challenges we had around -- which were related to ACA implementations and high volumes. Their issues around inadequate service capabilities, I think, were also factors that contributed to our retention issues. And we don't think that it was only because of the client migrations. Otherwise, we obviously wouldn't be -- we would be probably following a different path. So I think we're confident that it's still the right thing to do. As you know, we had been doing migrations for several years and had not had the same kinds of issues that we experienced over the past couple of quarters with regards to retention. So I think, again, no scientific evidence, but I think we have a lot of ways of triangulating to the point where we think it's fundamentally the right thing to do. We ended up having more attach -- higher attach rates for our HCA modules. Our retention rates right now are higher on our strategic platforms and our legacy platforms. There's a lot of reasons that point to the need, and I think the advantages of continuing with the migration strategy."

Implicit revenue acceleration in the fourth quarter when you dissect our full year guidance that we confirmed. That will help. And secondly, the most important factor is, in fourth quarter, we are anticipating -- we had a -- have high investments of selling expense in the last year's fourth quarter and an easier roll over. So with the confirmation of our new business bookings growth of 12%, you can also see that we're not anticipating, mathematically, a blowout fourth quarter because of that difficult roll over and that will help on the margin."

They are all growing faster than our core business. And they all have now, I think, very positive dynamics in terms of their margin. Not that you were asking specifically about margins, but they're also -- I think now at a size, all of them individually and collectively, where we're getting good contribution, I think, to lower margin from a -- certainly from a dollar standpoint and in many cases also, from a margin percent standpoint. So I think we're -- that's why we like our position in terms of where we are around starting with our richest bundles where -- it's really all inclusive in terms of a full HCM bundle. The PEO is unique in the sense that it also has co-employment and provides health care and workers comp. But some of our other very rich bundles also are very, very comprehensive and growing variable, bustling and scaling very well. And we've been able to handle those volumes and have gotten good leverage on the margin side. And then as you come down to our more traditional products, as we've also communicated there, whether it's in Vantage or in Workforce Now or even in the downmarket, the attach rates continue to be better on new business than the penetration of our products in the base. So I think that also bodes very well for us from a revenue growth standpoint and also from a margin leverage standpoint. So we're -- I think we're happy directionally with the -- where we're going and where, frankly, the market is leading us, which is demand for these solutions, which is clearly high versus kind of the traditional simple stand-alone payroll solution. We do sell simple stand-alone payroll solutions, but I think the market is leading us in the direction of more comprehensive solutions."

And I think the fourth quarter, I think, again, when you exclude, which I think is the right way to do the comparison, you exclude the AdvancedMD comparable from the previous year, we don't have a lot of -- I think, in fact, our current forecast is to not have much if any foreign currency effect in the fourth quarter. I think you normalize for all those things, and we're actually pretty happy with what our fourth quarter revenue growth implies. And then the third quarter, I don't think we were -- it's not fair to say we are disappointing, because we're pretty happy like whenever ADP's revenue growth incrementally moves up 0.5 to 1 percentage point, which is when you -- again, you normalize for AdvancedMD and you normalize for currency, that's what happened. That makes us very happy, because in a recurring revenue model, in order to accomplish that, you have to, as you just pointed out, you have to have strong new business starts, not just bookings. And you have to have either stable or improving retention. That's exactly what we got. There may have been a little calendar noise and a couple of other things in the third quarter that we don't see in the fourth quarter happening. And so we were actually pretty satisfied with kind of where we are. Assuming that all of these things kind of hold that we've just communicated."

What we don't know yet is how people will react in terms of demand because right now everybody is focused on getting the June deadline pass them in terms of the employer portion of the reporting, which is the 1094. And so there -- it's really a little early for us to know exactly how much ACA demand we will or we will not have. And we've been very, very transparent and very clear that this provided tailwind. However, we've also been very clear that we would be satisfied and happy to communicate our sales results, both for the quarter and for the year-to-date excluding ACA. And that communication would lead you to believe that excluding ACA, it would be in the neighborhood of our long-term guidance around new business bookings. And so we believe this has been incremental. We hope we will get more of it next year. But clearly, the mathematics are such that it's going to create, I wouldn't call it a hangover or an overhang, I would call it a very difficult compare that we -- as we get further along in the next couple of quarters, we'll be able to hopefully communicate a little bit more clearly in terms of what that exactly means when we provide guidance for the next fiscal year."

But if, in fact, as Jan said, if the fourth quarter, our new business bookings growth, because of the growth over the previous year, is smaller, that takes pressure off of us from a margin standpoint. The same would apply to next year if we're not providing guidance in terms of our new business bookings growth for the next year. But mathematically, if we get back into the long-term range of our new business bookings, that will also provide tailwind and help take pressure off of our margin. So again, we're getting -- I mean, I could go on for a long time in terms of how our business model works, but we feel pretty good. In fact, this year, I think would give us a high degree of encouragement. It was hard. And people worked very, very hard on controlling all controllable expenses in order to still deliver the kind of margin improvement. We are in the face of the increased costs we had, but it just shows the power of the business model, and I think the ability of the company to leverage its revenue growth."

Thanks for joining our call and for your continued interest in ADP. This morning, we reported results for our third quarter of fiscal 2016, which included revenue growth of 7% or 9%, excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation. In addition to this solid revenue growth, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions, which is evidenced by our new business bookings growth of 13%. While sales of additional human capital management modules that assist with the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, compliance continue to boost our performance, we are especially pleased to see balanced growth contribution across our HCM portfolio. From further penetration of new applications into our base to growth in the number of clients choosing our higher-touch HR outsourcing models, we are seeing continued traction for our technology solutions and our robust service offerings. 
During the quarter, ADP continued to focus on implementation of solutions that support ACA reporting requirements in the U.S. At the end of March, employers with 50 or more employees were required to send Form 1095-C to each of their employees, describing the health insurance available to them. This is the most significant employee tax filing form introduced by the U.S. government since the W2 more than 70 years ago, and it is significantly more complex for the employer to deliver. More than 25,000 clients, ranging in size from 50 to 50,000 employees trusted ADP to assist them with ACA. As of March 31, ADP delivered nearly 10 million Form 1095-Cs to these client employees. This endeavor was no small task. To put it in perspective, ADP processed nearly 60 million W2 forms for the 2015 tax year, a form we have been producing for decades. The W2 requires one system of record, the payroll system, and is therefore, significantly easier to produce than the 1095-C, which can require data from multiple sources. So as you may imagine, producing 10 million Form 1095-Cs in the first reporting year of these new regulations was demanding for us and required a strong partnership with our clients. 
This is another example of the breadth of our capabilities in the complex world of workforce compliance, and I am very proud of the work our teams have done and will continue to do to help these clients navigate the uncharted waters of ACA reporting. 
ADP's global capabilities also continue to be a differentiator for us. ADP first began offering global payroll services more than a decade ago, and we have continuously expanded our offering across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and the Americas. Last month, we announced the expansion of our capabilities to 7 additional locations, including Angola, Tanzania and Zambia. Now in 111 countries around the globe, ADP is bringing our global clients the benefits of integrated payroll solutions from a provider they trust. This ability to support the payroll compliance needs of global firms managing businesses in locales with constant changes in the legal and regulatory landscape is incredibly powerful and unrivaled in our industry. 
Now I'd like to give you an update on client retention. In the third quarter, ADP experienced a decline in retention of 30 basis points. We do believe the sequential improvement is a result of actions we've taken to strengthen our service capabilities. The talented professionals we've added to our service teams are now supporting our clients. And although we have an easier year-over-year comparison, we expect the client experience to continue to improve as these associates gain more experience. Aside from our client’s interactions with ADP through service and implementation, a key component of the client experience is our technology. We believe that our strategic platforms deliver best-in-class HCM capabilities in each of the markets they serve. And clients on these platforms generally have higher retention rates than those on our matured technology. So we are continuing to focus on upgrading clients to our modern cloud solutions. As we've previously discussed, we intentionally slowed the pace of migrations in recent months, so we could best assist our clients with ACA compliance. With additional talent in place and the effort of ACA reporting beginning to slow, we intend to return to a migration pace that will enable us to complete our mid-market upgrades to the latest version of Workforce Now by the end of fiscal year 2017, which is in line with our previous expectations. 
Upgrading clients from matured technology is an important element of our strategy and the right thing for our clients.
Positive external recognition further bolsters our confidence in our product and service offering. Earlier this quarter, we announced that Everest Group has once again named us a leader and star performer in its annual Everest Group Peak Matrix for Multi-Process HR Outsourcing Providers. The report cites the number of new deals, expanded global service delivery, success of our mobile solutions and the introduction of our analytics and big data solution called ADP DataCloud as evidence of ADP's continued commitment to providing an enriched scope of solutions to our global clients. It's flattering when influencers recognize our strategic progress, but it's even more rewarding when clients do. I recently had the opportunity to spend time with many clients at our Annual ADP Meeting of the Minds Conference, which we just held in Washington, D.C. Each year, we use this opportunity to update our clients on our developments and share where we are headed, while listening and learning more about their challenges. What's clear is that these are challenging times for payroll and HCM professionals. ACA, globalization, regulatory complexity, the fight for top talent and changing workforce dynamics are all having a profound impact on how HR is practiced. We've built our business to help clients through these challenges and many others. We are unique in our ability to deliver capabilities across the HCM spectrum, from recruitment through retirement for businesses of all sizes around the entire globe. This was on display at Meeting of the Minds and the client response to our progress was gratifying. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for a further review of our third quarter results."

For the third quarter, ADP revenues grew 7% or 9% on a constant dollar basis. This solid revenue growth was driven by net new additions to our recurring revenue stream, including the impact of ACA-related revenue, which began contributing to our growth in the third quarter. Earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, grew 9% or 10% on a constant dollar basis. This growth, while stronger than the first half of the fiscal year, continues to reflect additional costs related to selling expenses and incremental operational resources in support of new business sold. EBIT margin increased about 40 basis points compared to 24.4% in last year's third quarter. Diluted earnings per share grew 14% to $1.17, and reflected a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. In addition to delivering this solid operating performance, we have paid more than $700 million in dividends and returned more than $1 billion through share repurchases in the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year. 
In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 5% for the quarter or 7% on a constant dollar basis. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 30 basis points in the third quarter, and we remain focused on actions that will improve this metric. Our same-stores pay per control in the U.S. grew 2.5%, and average client fund balances grew 2% compared to a year ago or 3% on a constant dollar basis. On a year-to-date basis, we have seen a relative slowing in our pays per control metric compared with the 3% growth last year, which we believe is consistent with the U.S. economy reaching high employment levels. As a result of improving employment, we continue to see declines in state unemployment insurance collections, which have had a drag on client fund balances, but at a lesser rate than last year. This in combination with a week of bonus season and the impact from client losses experienced in the first half has put added pressure on the growth of our client fund balances for the quarter. 
Our business outside the U.S. continues to perform well, driven by the strength of our multinational solutions, which serve businesses of all size, from smaller mid-market clients to very large global corporations. 
Employer Services segment margin declined about 40 basis points for the third quarter. This decline resulted from the impact of planned investments made in operational resources to implement a strong volume of new business sold over the last few quarters. 
ADP's PEO posted another quarter of strong performance, with third quarter revenue growth of 16% and growth in the average worksite employees of 14%. The PEO also delivered solid margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points in the third quarter, driven primarily by operating and selling efficiencies, as we continued to see good execution and increased productivity. 
I'm pleased with the progress we have made and will now give you an update on our expectations for fiscal year 2016.
For the fiscal year, ADP still expects revenue growth of about 7% or 9% on a constant dollar basis. As a reminder, this forecast includes almost 1 percentage point of expected pressure from the sale of the AdvancedMD business, which occurred towards the end of the first fiscal quarter. For the Employer Services segment, consistent with our prior forecast, revenue growth is anticipated to be 4% to 5% with 7% on a constant dollar basis. For the PEO, ADP is now anticipating revenue growth of about 17% compared with our prior forecast range of 16% to 18%. Our forecast for adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 basis points is unchanged. We are now expecting Employer Services margin expansion of about 50 basis points compared with our prior forecast of margin expansion of about 75 basis points. Margin in the PEO is now expected to expand up to 75 basis points compared with our prior forecast of about 50 basis points. We have narrowed our forecast for average client fund balances and are now expecting 3% growth or 4% on a constant dollar basis. 
We're also now expecting growth in client funds interest revenue to be about flat to last year compared with our prior forecasted increase of up to $5 million. This is a result of the lower interest rate environment from the softening of the global economy. The total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy is still expected to be about flat compared to the $419 million in fiscal year 2015. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share are now expected to grow about 12% from the $2.89 in fiscal year 2015 compared with our prior forecasted growth range of 11% to 13%. On a constant dollar basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow about 13% compared with our prior forecasted growth range of 12% to 14%.

I'll let Jan maybe put in a couple of stats also, but the -- when we -- the slowdown in implementation was really around migrations, just to be clear. And I think after the first quarter, I think we mentioned that we had begun already to slow down some of our migrations. Now there continued to be some scheduled migrations that spilled over into the second quarter. So it was really towards the end of the second quarter -- our fiscal second quarter that we began to really try to focus more on stabilizing our service organization and also our ACA implementations, and hence, this third leg that was putting pressure on us, and the third leg of the stool, which is an important part of our strategy, but we felt like we could, in the short-term, slow down or take pressure off of ourselves is what we did around the slowdown in the migrations. And that's exactly what happened. To put it in perspective, in the first quarter of the year, our migrations were more than double at the same rate of the previous year's first quarter. We still did some migrations here in the third quarter. But I would say it was very, very low rates, and we had -- we got the desired impact, which is it allowed us to focus on the other things that we had from a volume standpoint on ACA and also trying to redirect some of those resources to stabilizing our service environment. And so I think that was -- we did exactly what we had planned to do, and I think what we communicated. And I think we got the desired result. As I mentioned in the first and second quarter, there is no scientific way to know how much each of those 3 things was putting pressure individually on our retention and our client service experience, but we basically had one that we had very -- a lot of control over, which is migrations, and we decided to slow it."

And I think there we are, I think, moving ahead with plans in terms of a similar strategy of what we had in the downmarket and in the mid-market, which is to get our clients onto our strategic platforms over time. But I think as we've said over the last couple of quarters, I think it's probably not helpful. And given that these are very identifiable clients, everyone knows who their names are and most of our competitors know what platforms they're on. We don't believe that it's going to be fruitful and useful for us to get into a lot of detail around our schedules and which platforms and which clients we're migrating. But you should take from the message that Jan and I just delivered on the previous question that you asked that we still believe this is the right thing to do and the slowdown in the mid-market was really just related to all of the other moving parts that we had, not because we believe it's the wrong thing to do. So we're still on the same strategy. It's, I think, consistent with prior quarters. We believe that the migrations and the upgrades in the upmarket are going to take longer that they have taken in the downmarket and in the mid-market, but we're comfortable with that, because that's just a different nature of the business in the upmarket."

Our business model is actually very stable, very predictable. And those 2 numbers are also relatively stable and relatively predictable, but they have more variability than the rest of our numbers. So we never try to forecast quarter-to-quarter or future quarters on either new business bookings or client retention for that reason. So it's clearly a possibility, but it's not our plan. And so you can tell by our desire, or actually our actions to reignite our migrations that we don't believe that, that will be the case, and we believe that medium and longer-term, it's the right thing to do, which I think would lead you to the conclusion that the other factors like the high volumes of ACA and some of the service challenges we had around -- which were related to ACA implementations and high volumes. The issues around inadequate service capabilities, I think, were also factors that contributed to our retention issues. And we don't think that it was only because of the client migrations. Otherwise, we obviously wouldn't be -- we would be probably following a different path. So I think we're confident that it's still the right thing to do. As you know, we had been doing migrations for several years and had not had the same kinds of issues that we experienced over the past couple of quarters with regards to retention. So I think, again, no scientific evidence, but I think we have a lot of ways of triangulating to the point where we think it's fundamentally the right thing to do. We ended up having more attach -- higher attach rates for our HCM modules. Our retention rates right now are higher on our strategic platforms than our legacy platforms. There's a lot of reasons that point to the need, and I think the advantages of continuing with the migration strategy."

They are all growing faster than our core business. And they all have now, I think, very positive dynamics in terms of their margin. Not that you were asking specifically about margins, but they're also, I think, now at a size, all of them individually and collectively, where we're getting good contribution, I think, to our margin from a -- certainly from a dollar standpoint and in many cases also, from a margin percent standpoint. So I think we're -- that's why we like our position in terms of where we are around starting with our richest bundles where -- it's really all-inclusive in terms of a full HCM bundle. The PEO is unique in the sense that it also has co-employment and provides health care and workers comp. But some of our other very rich bundles also are very, very comprehensive and growing very robustly and scaling very well. And we've been able to handle those volumes and have gotten good leverage on the margin side. And then as you come down to our more traditional products, as we've also communicated there, whether it's in Vantage or in Workforce Now or even in the downmarket, the attach rates continue to be better on new business than the penetration of our products in the base. So I think that also bodes very well for us from a revenue growth standpoint and also from a margin leverage standpoint. So we're -- I think we're happy directionally with the -- where we're going and where, frankly, the market is leading us, which is demand for these solutions is clearly high versus kind of the traditional simple stand-alone payroll solution. We do sell simple stand-alone payroll solutions, but I think the market is leading us in the direction of more comprehensive solutions."

And I think the fourth quarter, I think, again, when you exclude, which I think is the right way to do the comparison, you exclude the AdvancedMD comparable from the previous year, we don't have a lot of -- I think, in fact, our current forecast is to not have much if any foreign currency effect in the fourth quarter. I think you normalize for all those things, and we're actually pretty happy with what our fourth quarter revenue growth implies. And then the third quarter, I don't think we were -- it's not fair to say we were disappointed, because we're pretty happy like whenever ADP's revenue growth incrementally moves up 0.5 to 1 percentage point, which is when you -- again, you normalize for AdvancedMD and you normalize for currency, that's what happened. That makes us very happy, because in a recurring revenue model, in order to accomplish that, you have to, as you just pointed out, you have to have strong new business starts, not just bookings. And you have to have either stable or improving retention. That's exactly what we got.

What we don't know yet is how people will react in terms of demand because right now everybody is focused on getting the June deadline past them in terms of the employer portion of the reporting, which is the 1094. And so there -- it's really a little early for us to know exactly how much ACA demand we will or we will not have. And we've been very, very transparent and very clear that it has provided tailwind. However, we've also been very clear that we would be satisfied and happy to communicate our sales results, both for the quarter and for the year-to-date excluding ACA. And that communication would lead you to believe that excluding ACA, it would be in the neighborhood of our long-term guidance around new business bookings. And so we believe this has been incremental. We hope we will get more of it next year.

Our comments regarding high employment and the economy were more geared as a general notion to the expectations that we've had a very long positive economic cycle, and we see, overall for the business, potentially a slight slowing from a still growing trend basically. So it's a very nuanced comment that we wanted to make is -- it's ever so slightly we're coming closer to what some people would probably describe as a full employment in the economy."

Thanks for joining our call and for your continued interest in ADP. This morning, we reported results for our third quarter of fiscal 2016, which included revenue growth of 7% or 9%, excluding the impacts of fo",1026,"Thank you, Sara, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call and for your continued interest in ADP. This morning, we reported results for our third quarter of fiscal 2016, which included revenue growth of 7% or 9%, excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation. In addition to this solid revenue growth, we continue to see strong demand for our solutions, which is evidenced by our new business bookings growth of 13%. While sales of additional human capital management modules that assist with the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, compliance continue to boost our performance, we are especially pleased to see balanced growth contribution across our HCM portfolio. From further penetration of new applications into our base to growth in the number of clients choosing our higher-touch HR outsourcing models, we are seeing continued traction for our technology solutions and our robust service offerings. 
During the quarter, ADP continued to focus on implementation of solutions that support ACA reporting requirements in the U.S. At the end of March, employers with 50 or more employees were required to send Form 1095-C to each of their employees describing the health insurance available to them. This is the most significant employee tax filing form introduced by the U.S. government since the W2 more than 70 years ago, and it is significantly more complex for the employer to deliver. More than 25,000 clients ranging in size from 50 to 50,000 employees trusted ADP to assist them with ACA. As of March 31, ADP delivered nearly 10 million Form 1095-Cs to these client employees. This endeavor was no small task. To put it in perspective, ADP processed nearly 60 million W2 forms for the 2015 tax year, a form we have been producing for decades. The W2 requires one system of record, the payroll system, and is therefore significantly easier to produce than the 1095-C, which can require data from multiple sources. So as you may imagine, producing 10 million Form 1095-Cs in the first reporting year of these new regulations was demanding for us and required a strong partnership with our clients. 
This is another example of the breadth of our capabilities in the complex world of workforce compliance, and I am very proud of the work our teams have done and will continue to do to help these clients navigate the uncharted waters of ACA reporting. 
ADP's global capabilities also continue to be a differentiator for us. ADP first began offering global payroll services more than a decade ago, and we have continuously expanded our offering across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and the Americas. Last month, we announced the expansion of our capabilities to 7 additional locations, including Angola, Tanzania and Zambia. Now in 111 countries around the globe, ADP is bringing our global clients the benefits of integrated payroll solutions from a provider they trust. This ability to support the payroll compliance needs of global firms managing businesses in locales with constant changes in the legal and regulatory landscape is incredibly powerful and unrivaled in our industry. 
Now I'd like to give you an update on client retention. In the third quarter, ADP experienced a decline in retention of 30 basis points. We do believe the sequential improvement is a result of actions we've taken to strengthen our service capabilities. The talented professionals we've added to our service teams are now supporting our clients. And although we have an easier year-over-year comparison, we expect the client experience to continue to improve as these associates gain more experience. Aside from our clients' interactions with ADP through service and implementation, a key component of the client experience is our technology. We believe that our strategic platforms deliver best-in-class HCM capabilities in each of the markets they serve. And clients on these platforms generally have higher retention rates than those on our mature technology. So we are continuing to focus on upgrading clients to our modern cloud solutions. As we've previously discussed, we intentionally slowed the pace of migrations in recent months so we could best assist our clients with ACA compliance. With additional talent in place and the effort of ACA reporting beginning to slow, we intend to return to a migration pace that will enable us to complete our mid-market upgrades to the latest version of Workforce Now by the end of fiscal year 2017, which is in line with our previous expectations. 
Upgrading clients from mature technology is an important element of our strategy and the right thing for our clients.
Positive external recognition further bolsters our confidence in our product and service offering. Earlier this quarter, we announced that Everest Group has once again named us a leader and star performer in its annual Everest Group Peak Matrix for Multi-Process HR Outsourcing providers. The report cites the number of new deals, expanded global service delivery, success of our mobile solutions and the introduction of our analytics and big data solution called ADP DataCloud as evidence of ADP's continued commitment to providing an enriched scope of solutions to our global clients. It's flattering when influencers recognize our strategic progress, but it's even more rewarding when clients do. I recently had the opportunity to spend time with many clients at our annual ADP Meeting of the Minds conference, which we just held in Washington, D.C. Each year, we use this opportunity to update our clients on our developments and share where we are headed, while listening and learning more about their challenges. What's clear is that these are challenging times for payroll and HCM professionals. ACA, globalization, regulatory complexity, the fight for top talent and changing workforce dynamics are all having a profound impact on how HR is practiced. We've built our business to help clients through these challenges and many others. We are unique in our ability to deliver capabilities across the HCM spectrum, from recruitment through retirement for businesses of all sizes around the entire globe. This was on display at Meeting of the Minds, and the client response to our progress was gratifying. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for a further review of our third quarter results."
126269,328417596,1007628,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, ADP revenues grew 7% or 9% on a constant dollar basis.

For the third quarter, ADP revenues grew 7% or 9% on a constant dollar basis. This solid revenue growth was driven by net new additions to our recurring revenue stream, including the impact of ACA-related revenue, which began contributing to our growth in the third quarter. Earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, grew 9% or 10% on a constant dollar basis. This growth, while stronger than the first half of the fiscal year, continues to reflect additional costs related to selling expenses and incremental operational resources in support of new business sold. EBIT margin increased about 40 basis points compared to 24.4% in last year's third quarter. Diluted earnings per share grew 14% to $1.17 and reflected a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. In addition to delivering this solid operating performance, we have paid more than $700 million in dividends and returned more than $1 billion through share repurchases in the first 3 quarters of this fiscal year. 
In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 5% for the quarter or 7% on a constant dollar basis. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 30 basis points in the third quarter, and we remain focused on actions that will improve this metric. Our same-stores pay per control in the U.S. grew 2.5%, and average client fund balances grew 2% compared to a year ago or 3% on a constant dollar basis. On a year-to-date basis, we have seen a relative slowing in our pays per control metric compared with the 3% growth last year, which we believe is consistent with the U.S. economy reaching high employment levels. As a result of improving employment, we continue to see declines in state unemployment insurance collections, which have had a drag on client fund balances, but at a lesser rate than last year. This in combination with the weaker bonus season and the impact from client losses experienced in the first half has put added pressure on the growth of our client fund balances for the quarter. 
Our business outside the U.S. continues to perform well, driven by the strength of our multinational solutions, which serve businesses of all size, from smaller mid-market clients to very large global corporations. 
Employer Services segment margin declined about 40 basis points for the third quarter. This decline resulted from the impact of planned investments made in operational resources to implement a strong volume of new business sold over the last few quarters. 
ADP's PEO posted another quarter of strong performance, with third quarter revenue growth of 16% and growth in the average worksite employees of 14%. The PEO also delivered solid margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points in the third quarter, driven primarily by operating and selling efficiencies, as we continue to see good execution and increased productivity. 
I'm pleased with the progress we have made and will now give you an update on our expectations for fiscal year 2016.
For the fiscal year, ADP still expects revenue growth of about 7% or 9% on a constant dollar basis. As a reminder, this forecast includes almost 1 percentage point of expected pressure from the sale of the AdvancedMD business, which occurred towards the end of the first fiscal quarter. For the Employer Services segment, consistent with our prior forecast, revenue growth is anticipated to be 4% to 5%, or 7% on a constant dollar basis. For the PEO, ADP is now anticipating revenue growth of about 17% compared with our prior forecast range of 16% to 18%. Our forecast for adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 basis points is unchanged. We are now expecting Employer Services margin expansion of about 50 basis points compared with our prior forecasted margin expansion of about 75 basis points. Margin in the PEO is now expected to expand up to 75 basis points compared with our prior forecast of about 50 basis points. We have narrowed our forecast for average client fund balances and are now expecting 3% growth or 4% on a constant dollar basis. 
We're also now expecting growth in client funds interest revenue to be about flat to last year compared with our prior forecasted increase of up to $5 million. This is a result of the lower interest rate environment from the softening of the global economy. The total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy is still expected to be about flat compared to the $419 million in fiscal year 2015. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share are now expected to grow about 12% from the $2.89 in fiscal year 2015 compared with our prior forecasted growth range of 11% to 13%. On a constant dollar basis, adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow about 13% compared with our prior forecasted growth range of 12% to 14%.

I'll let Jan maybe put in a couple of stats also, but the -- when we -- the slowdown in implementation was really around migrations, just to be clear. And I think after the first quarter, I think we mentioned that we had begun already to slow down some of our migrations. Now there continued to be some scheduled migrations that spilled over into the second quarter. So it was really towards the end of the second quarter, our fiscal second quarter, that we began to truly try to focus more on stabilizing our service organization and also our ACA implementations, and hence, this third leg that was putting pressure on us, and the third leg of the stool, which is an important part of our strategy, but we felt like we could, in the short term, slow down or take pressure off of ourselves is what we did around the slowdown in the migrations. That's exactly what happened. To put it in perspective, in the first quarter of the year, our migrations were more than double at the same rate of the previous year's first quarter. We still did some migrations here in the third quarter. But I would say it was very, very low rates, and we had -- we got the desired impact, which is it allowed us to focus on the other things that we had from a volume standpoint on ACA and also trying to redirect some of those resources to stabilizing our service environment. So I think that was -- we did exactly what we had planned to do and I think what we communicated. And I think we got the desired result. As I mentioned in the first and second quarter, there is no scientific way to know how much each of those 3 things was putting pressure individually on our retention and our client service experience, but we basically had one that we had very -- a lot of control over, which is migrations, and we decided to slow it."

And I think there we are, I think, moving ahead with plans in terms of a similar strategy of what we had in the downmarket and in the mid-market, which is to get our clients onto our strategic platforms over time. But I think as we've said over the last couple of quarters, I think it's probably not helpful. And given that these are very identifiable clients, everyone knows who their names are, and most of our competitors know what platforms they're on. We don't believe that it's going to be fruitful and useful for us to get into a lot of detail around our schedules and which platforms and which clients we're migrating. But you should take from the messages that Jan and I just delivered on the previous question that you asked that we still believe this is the right thing to do and the slowdown in the mid-market was really just related to all of the other moving parts that we had, not because we believe it's the wrong thing to do. So we're still on the same strategy. It's, I think, consistent with prior quarters. We believe that the migrations and the upgrades in the upmarket are going to take longer than they have taken in the downmarket and in the mid-market, but we're comfortable with that, because that's just the different nature of the business in the upmarket."

Our business model is actually very stable, very predictable. And those 2 numbers are also relatively stable and relatively predictable, but they have more variability than the rest of our numbers. So we never try to forecast quarter-to-quarter or future quarters on either new business bookings or client retention for that reason. So it's clearly a possibility, but it's not our plan. And so you can tell by our desire or actually our actions to reignite our migrations that we don't believe that, that will be the case, and we believe that medium and longer term, it's the right thing to do, which I think would lead you to the conclusion that the other factors like the high volumes of ACA and some of the service challenges we had around -- which were related to ACA implementations and high volumes, the issues around inadequate service capabilities, I think, were also factors that contributed to our retention issues. And we don't think that it was only because of the client migrations. Otherwise, we obviously wouldn't be -- we would be probably following a different path. So I think we're confident that it's still the right thing to do. As you know, we had been doing migrations for several years and had not had the same kinds of issues that we experienced over the past couple of quarters with regards to retention. So I think, again, no scientific evidence, but I think we have a lot of ways of triangulating to the point where we think it's fundamentally the right thing to do. We ended up having more attach -- higher attach rates for our HCM modules. Our retention rates right now are higher on our strategic platforms than our legacy platforms. There's a lot of reasons that point to the need and I think the advantages of continuing with the migration strategy."

I think you're pointing out to one element as now the revenue stream of the incremental revenues gets really a full quarter, so we could see that -- see that revenue -- implicit revenue acceleration in the fourth quarter when you dissect our full year guidance that we confirmed. That will help. And secondly, the most important factor is, in the fourth quarter, we are anticipating -- we had a -- have high investments of selling expense in the last year's fourth quarter and an easier grow over. So with the confirmation of our new business bookings growth of 12%, you can also see that we're not anticipating, mathematically, a blowout fourth quarter because of that difficult grow over and that will help on the margin."

They are all growing faster than our core business. And they all have now, I think, very positive dynamics in terms of their margin. Not that you were asking specifically about margin, but they're also, I think, now at a size, all of them individually and collectively, where we're getting good contribution, I think, to our margin, certainly from a dollar standpoint and in many cases also, from a margin percent standpoint. So I think we're -- that's why we like our position in terms of where we are around starting with our richest bundles where -- it's really all-inclusive in terms of a full HCM bundle. The PEO is unique in the sense that it also has co-employment and provides health care and workers comp. But some of our other very rich bundles also are very, very comprehensive and growing very robustly and scaling very well. And we've been able to handle those volumes and have gotten good leverage on the margin side. And as you come down to our more traditional products, as we've also communicated there, whether it's in Vantage or in Workforce Now or even in a downmarket, the attach rates continue to be better on new business than the penetration of our products in the base. So I think that also bodes very well for us from a revenue growth standpoint and also from a margin leverage standpoint. So we're -- I think we're happy directionally with the -- where we're going and where, frankly, the market is leading us, which is demand for these solutions is clearly high versus kind of the traditional simple stand-alone payroll solution.

I think you normalize for all those things, and we're actually pretty happy with what our fourth quarter revenue growth implies. And then the third quarter, I don't think we were -- it's not fair to say we were disappointed, because we're pretty happy like whenever ADP's revenue growth incrementally moves up 0.5 to 1 percentage point, which is when you -- again, you normalize for AdvancedMD and you normalize for currency, that's what happened. That makes us very happy because in a recurring revenue model, in order to accomplish that, you have to, as you just pointed out, you have to have strong new business starts, not just bookings.

What we don't know yet is how people will react in terms of demand because right now everybody is focused on getting the June deadline past them in terms of the employer portion of the reporting, which is the 1094. And so there -- it's really a little early for us to know exactly how much ACA demand we will or we will not have. And we've been very, very transparent and very clear that it has provided tailwind. However, we've also been very clear that we would be satisfied and happy to communicate our sales results both for the quarter and for the year-to-date excluding ACA. And that communication would lead you to believe that excluding ACA, we'd be in the neighborhood of our long-term guidance around new business bookings. And so we believe this has been incremental. We hope we will get more of it next year. But clearly, the mathematics are such that it's going to create, I wouldn't call it a hangover or an overhang, but I would call it a very difficult compare that we -- as we get further along in the next couple of quarters, we'll be able to hopefully communicate a little bit more clearly in terms of what that exactly means when we provide guidance for the next fiscal year."

I think that, again, when we have the kind of new business bookings growth that we have because of the way our P&L works around implementation expense and commissions and selling expense, it puts a lot of pressure. So honestly, I would probably say that I'm incredibly proud of the organization's ability to, despite a very big ramp up of expenses, some of which was related, obviously, to ACA, both around new business bookings cost as well as implementation expense, I'm actually quite proud of the organization's ability to deliver on our -- based on our forecast for the fourth quarter, what will be some margin improvements that is still kind of in the neighborhood of our long-term guidance. So I think that leads me to believe that even though we still have a lot of investment we want to make in the business, I want to be very, very clear that we are managing all of the variables in our business, including the need to continue to invest in our technology, in our associates and a number of things. But if, in fact, as Jan said, if the fourth quarter, our new business bookings growth, because of the grow-over the previous year is smaller, that takes pressure off of us from a margin standpoint. The same would apply to next year if -- we're not providing guidance in terms of our new business bookings growth for the next year, but mathematically, if we get back into the long-term range of our new business bookings, that will also provide tailwind and help take pressure off of our margin. So again, without getting -- I mean, I could go on for a long time in terms of how our business model works, but we feel pretty good. In fact, this year, I think, would give us a high degree of encouragement. It was hard. And people worked very, very hard on controlling all controllable expenses in order to still deliver the kind of margin improvement we are in the face of the increased costs we had, but it just shows the power of the business model and I think the ability of the company to leverage its revenue growth."

Other than back to Y2K during my tenure here at ADP, this has been probably the most challenging time in terms of need to ramp up resources in terms of implementation and service and be able to absorb the new business bookings that we've had over the last several years. That was a lot of hard work and a lot of dedication on the part of a lot of associates, and I want to thank them specifically for everything they did for our clients. It's -- I don't know if it was clear in the call today, but when you look at our strong new business bookings, which now when you look at the compounded growth rate over the last 5 or 6 years in double digits, coupled with the improving trend on retention, what we've been able to do in terms of these ACA implementations and despite all that, deliver decent margin improvement, it's really a lot to be proud of. So I want to thank all the associates across all of ADP for their hard work and contribution to the success that we had this quarter. And I want to thank all of you for joining us today, and I want to thank you for your interest in ADP."

Thanks for joining our call and for your continued interest in ADP. 
This morning, we reported solid results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2016 with revenue up 8% for the quarter and 7% for the year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation, fiscal 2016 revenue grew 8%. 
Please keep in mind that our 8% growth in fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by about 1 percentage point from the sale of our AdvancedMD business, which occurred at the end of the first fiscal quarter. 
In addition to the solid fiscal 2016 revenue growth, I'm very pleased with the robust new business bookings results we experienced during fiscal 2016, posting 12% growth for the year. This represents $1.75 billion in new recurring revenue generated by our sales force during the fiscal year. 
Strong sales of Human Capital Management modules that assist clients in compliance with Affordable Care Act contributed meaningfully to the out performance we have seen in new business bookings for the past 2 fiscal years. 
This important regulatory change impacted the HCM industry in material ways. ADP responded well and sold our ACA compliance solutions to about half of our addressable base in a relatively short period of time. Because of this very strong recent performance and the resulting difficult compare, we expect fiscal 2017 new business bookings to grow 4% to 6% from the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal 2016. 
If achieved, this will result in a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of 9%, which is within our long term expected range of 8% to 10%. 
Fiscal 2016 was an exciting year that showcased ADP's agility as we continue to adapt to the dynamic needs of our clients. When we look back at our progress, it's clear that the long-term trends we see with respect to the changing nature of how work is done, the increasing complexity of regulatory compliance, the trend toward harnessing the power of big data in HR and the need to work seamlessly across geographic borders are all having positive impacts on our success. We've responded to these trends in many ways during the year. 
For example, across the portfolio, we've dramatically improved the user experience of our clients employees. In doing so, we made our products easy to use and more consistent with how employees engage with consumer technology and social media. 
If your company is an ADP client, I invite you to join the more than 8 million users of ADP's mobile app to experience this for yourself. 
We've leveraged our unique data set of 26 billion payroll records to introduce significant new data analytics capabilities. Since introducing ADP DataCloud just over 1 year ago, we now have more than 2,500 clients using this solution to generate actionable insights that help address workforce productivity, contribute to talent development and assist with employee retention. 
We've expanded our capabilities geographically and can now meet the payroll processing and compliance needs of companies with operation in more than 110 countries and territories, which is a key differentiator in our industry. 
And we met the challenges presented by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the U.S. With strong demand for our ACA solutions, we made investments in operational resources and successfully helped more than 25,000 clients to process more than 10 million Form 1095-Cs, the most significant new employee tax form introduced by the IRS since the W2. 
As we've discussed, we believe our investments to innovate and simplify our portfolio are essential for our long-term success. We believe our strategic platforms now deliver best-in-class HCM capabilities in each of the markets they serve, and we've seen solid retention rates from clients on our strategic platforms. Therefore, continuing to upgrade lines to
continuing to upgrade clients to our modern cloud solutions remains a critical area of focus for us and is the right thing to do for our clients. 
Today, all of our Small Business clients are on the RUN transfer platform. And during the fourth quarter, we increased the pace of our client migrations in the mid-market, and now have about 49,000 clients in our latest versions of Workforce Now. 
With 2/3 of this base now upgraded, we expect the balance of our Workforce Now clients to be transitioned to the current platform by the end of fiscal '17. 
As we continue to move clients on to our strategic platforms and have more clients engaging ADP for multiple services across the HCM spectrum, we are embarking on a path to simply by our service model for our associates and our clients. 
Over the past several years, our technology platforms have evolved to meet the dynamic needs of our clients who are choosing to engage in a more comprehensive way with their HCM providers. 
As a result of this shift, a new approach to service is essential to support the HCM companies that we've become and extend our leadership in this growing market, and am therefore, excited to tell you about a service initiative we are kicking off in fiscal 2017. 
This new initiative is designed to better align our service organization to work across additional lines, leverage best-in-class service tools and processes and establish teams with expertise across the HCM spectrum. We believe this will enhance the client experience and at the same time, allow us to better transfer knowledge amongst the service teams and offer robust career opportunities within the service organization, all of which benefits our clients and our service yields. 
As we begin to build out this new service model, we believe there's a benefit to be gained by co-locating certain U.S. service capabilities at existing and new ADP locations in the U.S. that have the scale to support this strategy. 
We have had positive experiences creating centers like these at sites such as El Paso, Texas, Augusta, Georgia, among other places. We recently selected Norfolk, Virginia and Macon, Florida, near Orlando, as our next 2 locations and has started building cross functional service teams at both sites. We will announce a third new site in the Western part of the U.S. later this year. 
As part of this initiative, we will focus on building service capabilities within these and our existing locations, while streamlining our geographic footprint. 
In connection with these efforts, ADP will be making certain investments in fiscal 2017, which are expected to put some pressure on our margin expansion goals for the year.  Jan will provide more detail when he reviews fiscal 2017 outlook. However, we do expect our margin expansion this fiscal 2017 to be lower than our long-term goal of 50 to 75 basis points as we make these important investments. 
Now I'd spend a few moments on retention. During the fourth quarter, we experienced a retention decline of 80 basis points, and for the full fiscal year, retention declined about 1 point to 19.5%. 
Similar to previous quarters, we continue to see a concentration of losses from clients who are still on legacy technology and while we have seen some of the benefits from investments we've made in service during the early part of fiscal 2016, we continue to experience variability in our retention metrics. 
In closing, fiscal 2016 was an exciting and challenging year for ADP. We achieved strong revenue growth, driven by sales of additional HCM modules to support clients with a new ACA requirements. We've invested implementation and operational resources to support this revenue growth, while still delivering solid margin expansion. And we did this while remaining consistent with our commitment to shareholder-friendly actions. 
During fiscal 2016, we returned about $2.1 billion in cash through dividends and share repurchases and increased our dividend for the 41st consecutive year. 
I'm confident that as we successfully execute against our strategy, we'll continue to drive results for our clients, our associates and our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn over the call to Jan who will review our fiscal 2016 financials and share our fiscal 2017 outlook."

During the fourth quarter, we took a severance charge of $48 million that was related to a broad-based workforce optimization effort. Certain non-GAAP measures in my commentary to follow excludes the impact of this charge as well as certain other onetime items recognized earlier in the fiscal year. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental charts of our Investor Relations website. 
As Carlos mentioned, fiscal year 2016 was a successful year for ADP. New business bookings grew 12% to $1.75 billion sold. Revenues grew 7% to $11.7 billion. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, revenues grew 8% for the year. 
On a reported basis, net earnings grew 8% and diluted earnings per share grew 12%. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT grew 10% or 11% on a constant dollar basis. 
For the year, adjusted EBIT margin expanded 60 basis from the 18.8% in fiscal year 2015. I'm pleased with this solid margin expansion, which includes the impact of investments in operational resources that were made during the fiscal year as we supported our clients through the first year of the ACA related reporting requirements. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $3.26, reflecting a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares of outstanding compared with a year ago. 
In addition to delivering this solid operating performance, we have paid more than $900 million in dividends and returned about $1.2 billion through share repurchases for fiscal year 2016. 
During the fourth quarter, ADP returned $100 million to shareholders through share repurchases, which was at a reduced pace compared with prior quarters. Market conditions were not a factor in our long-standing commitment to returning cash to our shareholders remains unchanged. 
So now for a discussion of our segment results. i Our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 5% for the year or 6% at constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions to new recurring revenues during the fiscal year from strong new business bookings sold. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 80 basis points in the fourth quarter. And for the year, revenue retention declined about 1 point to 19.5%. 
Our same-store pays per control in the U.S. grew 2.5% for the fiscal year. Average client fund balance grew 3% for the year or 4% on constant dollar basis. This growth was slower than prior years, primarily related to the declines of state unemployment insurance collections as a result of an improving labor market in the U.S. 
This, in combination with the impact on client losses experienced into the year, has put added pressure on the client funds balance growth. 
Our business outside of North America continues to perform well despite an uncertain global environment. This performance is driven by continued strong demand for our multinational solutions, which served businesses of all sizes and are now the largest contributor to our sales outside of North America. 
Employer Services segment margin increased about 60 basis points for the fiscal year. This increase was driven by reduced selling expenses in the fourth quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter, partially offset by the negative impact of planned investments made throughout the year to support our clients with the first year of ACA compliance. 
the PEO had a successful year, posting revenue growth of 16% and average worksite employee growth of 13%. 
Let me make a few comments about fourth quarter revenue growth in the PEO, which trended lower at 13% growth compared with the previous 3 quarters in fiscal year 2016. 
This revenue growth deceleration was based on 2 factors. First, regarding our gross revenues which include pass-throughs, our clients experienced a favorable impact from lower health care renewal premiums during our fourth quarter, which contributed to a lower relative growth in our pass-through revenues. 
Second, in the fourth quarter, we noticed some variability in the timing of payrolls run by our clients. This type of timing variability has occurred in the past and should not be viewed as an indicator of any underlying change in the fundamentals of the business. We remain pleased with the performance of our PEO, which have strong worksite employee growth of 13% and we are happy to see that the PEO also delivered strong margin expansion of approximately 70 basis points for fiscal year 2016, which was primarily driven by operating and selling efficiencies from increased productivity. 
This is solid overall performance for fiscal year 2016 with strong new business bookings yielding healthy revenue growth and solid margin expansion despite the additional investments we've made during the year. I'm pleased with our results and will now take you through our expectations for fiscal year 2017. 
As Carlos mentioned, for fiscal year 2017, we're  expecting new business bookings growth of 4% to 6% from $1.75 billion sold in fiscal year 2016. We anticipate total revenue growth of 7% to 9% for the year, which is not expected to be significantly impacted by foreign currency translation based on current rates. This forecast assumes 4% to 5% revenue growth in the Employer Services segment and growth in pays per control of 2.5%. Revenue growth for the PEO is expected to be 14% to 16%. 
ADP's adjusted EBIT margin is expected to expand 25 to 50 basis points from the 19.5% in fiscal year 2016, which is below our goal of 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion over the longer run. We are still committed to this margin improvement goal over the longer term, but as Carlos mentioned, we are making investments in fiscal year 2017 to align our service model and support of our technology strategy. We expect this operational investments will put about 20 basis points of pressure on our fiscal year 2017 margins. And as a result of these buildout of the new facilities, total expenditures capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 are expected to be about $250 million. 
In addition to these investments, we also anticipate certain onetime charges of $100 million to $125 million throughout fiscal year 2018. 
Of this, $45 million is expected to be incurred during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and $45 million in the latter part of the year with the remainder expected in fiscal year 2018. These charges are excluded from our fiscal year 2017 forecast for adjusted EBIT margin expansion and from our adjusted diluted earnings per share forecast. A reconciliation of these metrics can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our investor relations website. 
On a segment level, we anticipate pretax margin expansion of about 50 basis points for Employer Services and 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion in the PEO. 
On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 6% to 8% compared with the $3.25 in fiscal year 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow at 10% to 12% from the adjusted $3.26 in fiscal year 2016 and contemplates an adjusted effective tax rate of 33.3%, consistent with the 33.3% at fiscal year 2016. 
In accordance with our continued shareholder-friendly actions and our intention to return excess cash to shareholders, our earnings per share forecast assumes that access cash of $1.0 billion to $1.4 billion will be returned via share repurchases during the fiscal year 2017. This forecasted range includes anticipated share repurchases requires to offset employee benefit plan issuance and the timing of these share repurchases is dependent upon market conditions. 
So with that, I will take you through our forecast for the client funds extended investment strategy. First, a reminder that the objectives of our investment strategy remain the safety, liquidity and diversification of our assets. 
As of the end of the fiscal year, approximately 80% of our fixed income portfolio was invested in AAA and AA rated securities. In a typical year, our strategy results in about 15% to 20% or our fixed income investments maturing and this year, we expect a percentage of maturities will be closer to the lower end of this range. We continue to base the interest assumptions in our forecast on the Fed Funds' future contracts for the client short and corporate cash portfolios and forward yield curve of the 3.5- and 5-year U.S. government agency forward yield curves for the client and corporate extended and decline loan portfolios, respectively. 
And as we do not believe it is possible to accurately predict future interest rates, the shape of the yield curve and the new bond issuance behavior of corporate and other issuers. 
For fiscal year 2017, we anticipate growth in the average client funds balances of 2% to 4% from the $22.4 billion in fiscal year 2016. 
We anticipate that the yield of decline fund portfolio will remain about flat at 1.7% compared with fiscal year 2016. 
These factors are expected to result in an increase of up to $5 million decline fund interest revenue. The total contribution from the client funds extended investment strategy is expected to be about flat to fiscal year 2016. 
The detail of this forecast is available in the supplemental slides on our website.

So a lot of work was done during what we call our year-end blackout because we really prefer not to do migrations anyway in the call it November to January, February time frame because there's a many things going on at the calendar year in a typical HCM payroll company. And so that gives a little bit of time for those folks to focus kind of stabilizing that organization and rethinking what the proper pace is and to put in perspective, we migrated approximately 4,000 clients during the quarter. And when we experienced challenges with some of the migrations, we were up as high as 7,000 in a quarter. This is back in the beginning of this fiscal year. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color. And I think the overall comment is clearly, I think our competitors are fishing in those waters because we see them in the numbers in terms of our losses being concentrated in our legacy platforms, and we're trying to reduce the size of the fishing pond so there's still some variability there in the retention, but I think we've gotten better at how we're doing the migrations and I think our pace is more manageable and I think easier for us to control at this point."

I think you're right that the losses that we experienced this year obviously have an effect this year, and they have an effect on the following year as well. But again, back to kind of simplistic math for government work, I think we're  probably, plus or minus half a point in terms of ES revenue growth. So maybe some of that is rounding, but we don't feel any weakness, I guess, to be clear and the ACA revenues, Jan probably has the exact number. That clearly provided lift in our new business bookings and thus, provide lift to revenue and also presents somewhat of a grow over. It's not as pronounced as grow over because it's a revenue number versus the new business bookings number, but it does have the same impact. But we feel -- like where we are right now Employer Services feels like a pretty good place in terms of trend, in terms of trajectory as well."

Just a follow up question on retention. So last quarter, you had mentioned you're taking some steps that are improving the service capability which you some more confidence around retention, but we still saw the retention go or decline. Now my question was when you think about the mid-market customer base, you still have 25,000 customers remaining, which are going to be migrated over the next 4 quarters and normally you don't do the migration in November, December, which would imply like around north of 6,000 customers being migrated every quarter versus 4,000 that you signed the last quarter. So with this elevated level of migration, how should we think about retention going forward? Could we see retention get worse before it starts to get better? So any clarity that you could provide on the retention front, that would be helpful."

The only thing I would add to that math is you do have to apply a retention or a loss factor to that 25,000 itself. Over the course of 12 months, we naturally -- even if we weren't migrating, we'd lose -- call it, 10% of those clients. It might be a little bit higher than that just because the legacy type clients so the absolute number that you're starting with, that you had to divide over 4 quarters is a little bit smaller, but you're in the right ballpark. It's probably around 5,000-or-so clients that will be migrated for quarter. We feel pretty comfortable with the pace given the infrastructure that we've created, the process we have for migrations. In terms of additional color, as you're  pointing out, the results didn't cooperate with our desires and with our intentions and in part, that's because our retention is a reflection of the overall company's results and there's variability of a lot of other businesses, so I wouldn't read too it even though we still have a concentration of our retentions issues in the mid-market, and they have been for this fiscal year. There is another $8 billion to $9 billion of revenue in ADP that also has experienced variability in retention. But having said that, to give you specifics around why our confidence level was high that things would get better and why we still remains high, we have a number of -- in specifically, the mid-market issues that we were experiencing with regard to retention, we have a lot of metric as you can imagine that we look at that are leading indicators versus retention, which is a lagging indicator. For example, the speed to answer phone calls, the number of cases that are unresolved in a backlog, there's just -- we have a number of escalations in terms of people escalating client service issues. And the metrics are most of the metrics in the mid-market regarding service experience our clients are even back-to-back they were prior to our retention issues or in some cases, better. And so we feel confident that you have some kind of a lag in the sense that some clients may have already been in process due to a poor service experience at looking at alternative and the fact that there are other parts of ADP that have variability in retention as well, notwithstanding all those things, I think my confidence in the improvements in service stability and service experience in the mid-market remained quite high actually."

So hence, the candy variability in the quarterly shift of the retention numbers in this case back to a relatively low loss volume that we typically experience in the fourth quarter. So my general council would be to observe those retention changes that we report, but not to get overly analytical and mathematical quarter-by-quarter. It is a better indicator to think about basically our retention number of 100 basis points decline so for the fiscal year, we're aiming to be better. We don't guide to retention, but as you might imagine as a company, we clearly have aspirations to improve."

That is basically included in the 20 basis points in our guidance. We clearly hope that the outcome of this service alignment initiative is multi-folded. I believe strongly it will enhance our service value proposition because we're going to have larger centers with bigger capabilities, leveraging ADP's strengths in compliance and service and offering a better value proposition to our clients, which is the most exciting part for the service alignment initiative. Hopefully resulting in better competitiveness and high retention rates and also as you can see, these centers are located in geographies of the U.S. that offer certain advantages relative to the cost that where they operate. So there should be in the longer run also contribution to our margins. We're a little bit hesitant to specify this for '18 because the initiative will actually bleed over into fiscal year '18.

And I think what we're talking about in terms of new service element initiative is a broad strategic objective across the entire company. It's partly driven by the fact that the industry has evolved and I think the clients need to evolve and the product have it both. And so as an example, 10 years ago, having 3 or 4 different products that were serviced differently and different databases was not an issue. Our platforms know are single database integrated solutions that provide an HCM solution if the way -- if the client wants to buy it that way in a comprehensive and seamless way. The service model had not moved in the same direction. And I think that this initiative really intended to have our service implementation really aligned with the way the market is going, the way buyers are buying and the way clients want to be serviced. So we've done similar things that our sales organization where that also requires that our sales force be trained and equipped to be able to sell in a new environment.

But as Jan said, conceptually, it's something really fit into our technology road map and accelerated our progress, we'd use our capital, but we're not going to use our capital to have something that for lack of a better term, fits next to everything else that it so just to be able to beat the integrated rapidly and seamlessly into what we already are pursuing to move our product strategy. It's a little bit of a departure from call it, 6, 7 years ago when it was really more about leveraging our distribution and adding capabilities and products without as much necessarily regard to how they fit tightly into the technology road map. And that's really nothing so much a change in strategy. It's a change in market the way people want to buy and the way products behave, which makes it very, very important to have tight alignment and seamlessness in your products. And then the just actual comment I'll make to Jan's point is because we have capital, if something accelerated our progress, we would do it no different than we're doing some of these internal organic things that we're investing in to accelerate our progress. So there's an external opportunity to use or capital, we would. But the fact is over the last couple of years, when you look at the balance of the capital deployment, Jan and I have this discussion all the time, they're consciously avoided doing acquisitions. It's just been hard to find one that makes sense and fit in what we're doing in terms of our strategy. But net-net, when you get down to it, we're spending, call it $300 million to $400 million less on acquisitions, and we're spending more on things like internally developed products, capital expenditures and the investments that we're talking about for fiscal year '17. So it wasn't necessarily planned that way, but it just so happens that we're not necessarily deploying any more capital, but we're just deploying it in a slightly different way. But we do retain the right to deploy capital towards acquisitions as well."

We'll give you a little bit of color, and it may be Jan can add in terms of what he's hearing out in the field. So it's interesting the term dedicated reps because we do have parts of our business obviously in the an upmarket and national accounts where we have very specific people service specific clients and then when you get into the Small Business market, we tend to have a model where the execution and the delivery is very important, but the person that you reach isn't as important. We believe that's the right model. We believe our retention rates and our growth in the Small Business market prove that our model works as long as you execute well. And would also argue that in today's world, having a dedicated rep works who 8 hours a day might not be the best service model for a small company or any other company. So we prefer to focus on how and what's the best way to deliver the best service to the client in the way they want it delivered. And it varies from Small Business, up to the upmarket in terms of where you need a dedicated person or not. But I would encourage you to kind of visualize the service realignment as being more around teams rather than dedicated people. So having alignment around teams. So as an example, given the attach rates that we've discussed over multiple quarters that we're experiencing now in the mid-market and in the upmarket around additional HCM modules, in other words, clients are rarely buying just payroll by itself or just benefits demonstration by itself. So this business model really is intended to be able to provide a group of people or a team of people who work together who are co-located and can deliver service across the entire HCM spectrum. That obviously requires some cross-training, but also some ability for people who have special skills to be available and close to people who need to support our clients on a multiple number of issues. So we have reasonable amount of experience and experimenting with what we call intact teams or with co-located teams. And we feel pretty good about the results when it comes to retention, when it comes to client. And by the way, in our business, when you have those 2 things, margin follows. So this is primarily led by quality and experience for the client and also by the way, opportunity for our associates. So what we have found also in some of our subscale locations has very, very limited mobility and opportunity for associates to progress from a career standpoint. And we now have a number of opportunities across our business for people to learn new things and to move in a different areas, whether it's time and attendance and payroll, benefits administration, talent management, we really run the whole gamut on HCM, and we have need to cross the entire business. And when we have people scattered across the entire country in small subscale locations, it just doesn't, I think, makes sense from a talent management standpoint for ourselves internally either. So on all those fronts, we think that this service alignment strategy makes sense."

If you think about centers of excellence for our tax filing operations and so forth so it allows us also to create buckets of scale that are very hard to create in smaller locations. So it really, I believe, will transform of how are our associates be perceiving, A, the value of the job they're in and the job opportunities that they can reach in the future and allows us to deliver additional service capabilities to our clients, which is the strategic benefit that's leaping out of it."

So may be the only spot that has been a little bit harder was Europe as you might imagine and our best-of-breed solutions but that's is really more balanced like a good demand for multinational solutions. So when we look at the plan other than specific grow-over challenges that we have because ACA sales were concentrated in the mid-market and in the upmarket, if you take that out, it's really -- each of the business units continues with very good performance. And just as a reminder, it is -- was $1.75 billion of recurring revenue that the sales force generated for ADP and even if the growth is a few percentage points slower, it's kind of still a very significant number."

You had a drag this year from selling the business that was no longer be a drag in 2017 and retention was a drag, I guess, you're not saying specifically, but maybe still a drag, but it sounds like a lesser one potentially in 2017. So why don't -- -- you've already said the current year bookings don't do a lot to revenue. Why wouldn't we see some acceleration? Is it as simple as PEO you're calling for that to be slower? It just feels like there should be a bit better revenue growth from -- take you through all these moving parts."

We do, again, even though we don't get specific guidance, we do expect less of a drag, for example, from retention because we expect thing to get better. We have some metrics and some things underlying I think data that it gives us hope with these right because don't know for sure that, that will improve your math, the comments you made about new business bookings. So all those things are correct. I think I would just encourage you to maybe spend some time off line with us in terms of kind of the math and how the revenue works. One of the interesting things about this business, this is an incredibly stable and predictable business model. It's also very, very hard to move the numbers dramatically one way or the other over the course of 1 year. So over the course of 4, 5 years, we had double-digit new business bookings. And this year, we had a blip with retention, but retention has also been fairly stable. That's allowed us to accelerate our revenue growth by about 0.5 to 1 percentage point from call it, 5 years ago in Employer Services. The PEO, as you said, also happen to be a factor because it's growing faster and it's becoming a larger portion of the overall results so if it slows slightly that has an impact, too. So we'll spend the time to make sure that we do the math. But what I can tell you is you're right that this year if you exclude the impact of the divestiture or if you don't factor the divestiture in, we were close to 9% revenue growth. We're really proud of that. And next year, we're slightly below that because there's one day less because this year was a leap year, whatever the issues are in with a little bit of a drag still from -- even the retention is getting better, it's still not a good as it used to be. We still going to be pretty damn happy and pretty damn proud because we're going to be in, I think, still in the high end of our guidance from a revenue standpoint. And in this business, when you get into that range, given who are in terms of -- because we understand have a very keen insight into who we are as a company in terms of where we want to be in terms of growth rates, the margin improvement, the balance of those things, I think we're satisfied with that outcome. It obviously makes it easier as you pick up additional revenue growth because of the nice leverage ability of our operating model, but that's part of why we're also doing some things about what we're doing around servicing limit because we know that we're really not I think satisfied with just the results that we have today. On the other hand, we're not going to sit here and tell you that we're trying to aim for 10%, 12%, 15% revenue growth. That's not really not who we are. So 7% to 9% is our long-term guidance for revenue growth with some margin improvement, with a healthy dividend. We share buyback, that's our model, that's what we're executing against and I'm proud of the organization, the results they've delivered this year and I think if we deliver the results that we put out there for next year, we're going to be just as proud of that as well."

Thanks for joining our call and for your continued interest in ADP. This morning, we reported solid results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2016 with revenue up 8% for the quarter and 7% for the year. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, fiscal 2016 revenue grew 8%. 
Please keep in mind that our 8% growth in fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by about 1 percentage point from the sale of our AdvancedMD business, which occurred at the end of the first fiscal quarter. 
In addition to the solid fiscal 2016 revenue growth, I'm very pleased with the robust new business bookings results we experienced during fiscal 2016, posting 12% growth for the year. This represents $1.75 billion in new recurring revenue generated by our sales force during the fiscal year. 
Strong sales of Human Capital Management modules that assist clients in compliance with Affordable Care Act contributed meaningfully to the outperformance we have seen in new business bookings for the past 2 fiscal years. 
This important regulatory change impacted the HCM industry in material ways. ADP responded well and sold our ACA compliance solutions to about half of our addressable base in a relatively short period of time. Because of this very strong recent performance and the resulting difficult compare, we expect fiscal 2017 new business bookings to grow 4% to 6% from the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal 2016. If achieved, this will result in a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of 9%, which is within our long-term expected range of 8% to 10%. 
Fiscal 2016 was an exciting year that showcased ADP's agility as we continue to adapt to the dynamic needs of our clients. When we look back at our progress, it's clear that the long-term trends we see with respect to the changing nature of how work is done, the increasing complexity of regulatory compliance, the trend toward harnessing the power of big data in HR and the need to work seamlessly across geographic borders are all having positive impacts on our success. We've responded to these trends in many ways during the year. For example, across the portfolio, we've dramatically improved the user experience of our clients employees. In doing so, we've made our products easy to use and more consistent with how employees engage with consumer technology and social media. 
If your company is an ADP client, I invite you to join the more than 8 million users of ADP's mobile app to experience this for yourself. 
We've leveraged our unique data set of 26 billion payroll records to introduce significant new data analytics capabilities. Since introducing ADP DataCloud just over 1 year ago, we now have more than 2,500 clients using this solution to generate actionable insights that help address workforce productivity, contribute to talent development and assist with employee retention. 
We've expanded our capabilities geographically and can now meet the payroll processing and compliance needs of companies with operation in more than 110 countries and territories, which is a key differentiator in our industry. 
And we met the challenges presented by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the U.S. With strong demand for our ACA solutions, we made investments in operational resources and successfully helped more than 25,000 clients, process more than 10 million Form 1095-Cs, the most significant new employee tax form introduced by the IRS since the W2. 
As we've discussed, we believe our investments to innovate and simplify our portfolio are essential for our long-term success. We believe our strategic platforms now deliver best-in-class HCM capabilities in each of the markets they serve, and we've seen solid retention rates from clients on our strategic platforms. Therefore, continuing to upgrade clients 
to our modern cloud solutions remains a critical area of focus for us and is the right thing to do for our clients. 
Today, all of our Small Business clients are on the RUN transfer platform. And during the fourth quarter, we increased the pace of our client migrations in the mid-market, and now have about 49,000 clients in the latest versions of Workforce Now. With 2/3 of this base now upgraded, we expect the balance of our Workforce Now clients to be transitioned to the current platform by the end of fiscal '17.
As we continue to move clients on to our strategic platforms and have more clients engaging ADP for multiple services across the HCM spectrum, we are embarking on a path to simplify our service model for our associates and our clients. 
Over the past several years, our technology platforms have evolved to meet the dynamic needs of our clients who are choosing to engage in a more comprehensive way with their HCM providers. 
As a result of this shift, a new approach to service is essential to support the HCM companies that we've become and extend our leadership in this growing market. And I'm, therefore, excited to tell you about a service initiative we are kicking off in fiscal 2017. 
This new initiative is designed to better align our service organization to work across traditional lines, leverage best-in-class service tools and processes and establish teams with expertise across the HCM spectrum. We believe this will enhance the client experience and at the same time, allow us to better transfer knowledge among these service teams and offer robust career opportunities within the service organization, all of which benefits our clients and our associates. 
As we begin to build out this new service model, we believe there's a benefit to be gained by co-locating certain U.S. service capabilities at existing and new ADP locations in the U.S. that have the scale to support this strategy. 
We have had positive experiences creating centers like these at sites such as El Paso, Texas; Augusta, Georgia, among other places. We've recently selected Norfolk, Virginia and Macon, Florida, near Orlando, as our next 2 locations and has started building cross functional service teams at both sites. We will announce a third new site in the Western part of the U.S. later this year. 
As part of this initiative, we will focus on building service capabilities within these and our existing other locations, while streamlining our geographic footprint. 
In connection with these efforts, ADP will be making certain investments in fiscal 2017, which are expected to put some pressure on our margin expansion goals for the year. Jan will provide more detail when he reviews fiscal 2017 outlook. However, we do expect our margin expansion this fiscal 2017 to be lower than our long-term goal of 50 to 75 basis points as we make these important investments. 
Now I'll spend a few moments on retention. During the fourth quarter, we experienced a retention decline of 80 basis points, and for the full fiscal year, retention declined about a point to 90.5%. 
Similar to previous quarters, we continue to see a concentration of losses from clients who are still on legacy technology. And while we have seen some of the benefits from investments we've made in service during the early part of fiscal 2016, we continue to experience variability in our retention metric. 
In closing, fiscal 2016 was an exciting and challenging year for ADP. We achieved strong revenue growth, driven by sales of additional HCM modules to support clients with the new ACA requirements. We invested in implementation and operational resources to support this revenue growth, while still delivering solid margin expansion. And we did this while remaining consistent with our commitment to shareholder-friendly actions. 
During fiscal 2016, we returned about $2.1 billion in cash through dividends and share repurchases and increased our dividend for the 41st consecutive year. 
I'm confident that as we successfully execute against our strategy, we'll continue to drive results for our clients, our associates and our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn over the call to Jan, who will review our fiscal 2016 financials and share our fiscal 2017 outlook."

During the fourth quarter, we took a severance charge of $48 million that was related to a broad-based workforce optimization effort. Certain non-GAAP measures in my commentary to follow exclude the impact of this charge as well as certain other onetime items recognized earlier in the fiscal year. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental charts of our Investor Relations website. 
As Carlos mentioned, fiscal year 2016 was a successful year for ADP. New business bookings grew 12% to $1.75 billion sold. Revenues grew 7% to $11.7 billion. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, revenues grew 8% for the year.
On a reported basis, net earnings grew 8% and diluted earnings per share grew 12%. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT grew 10% or 11% on a constant dollar basis. 
For the year, adjusted EBIT margin expanded 60 basis from the 18.8% in fiscal year 2015. I'm pleased with this solid margin expansion, which includes the impact of investments in operational resources that were made during the fiscal year as we supported our clients through the first year of the ACA-related reporting requirements. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $3.26, reflecting a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. 
In addition to delivering this solid operating performance, we have paid more than $900 million in dividends and returned about $1.2 billion through share repurchases for fiscal year 2016. 
During the fourth quarter, ADP returned $100 million to shareholders through share repurchases, which was at a reduced pace compared with prior quarters. Market conditions were not a factor, and our long-standing commitment to return cash to our shareholders remains unchanged. 
So now for a discussion of our segment results. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 5% for the year with 6% at constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions to new recurring revenues during the fiscal year from strong new business bookings sold. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 80 basis points in the fourth quarter. And for the year, revenue retention declined about 1 point to 90.5%. 
Our same-store pays per control in the U.S. grew 2.5% for the fiscal year. Average client fund balances grew 3% for the year or 4% on constant dollar basis. This growth was slower than in prior years, primarily related to the declines of state unemployment insurance collections as a result of an improving labor market in the U.S. This, in combination with the impact on client losses experienced into the year, has put added pressure on the client funds balance growth. 
Our business outside of North America continues to perform well despite an uncertain global environment. This performance is driven by continued strong demand for our multinational solutions, which served businesses of all sizes and are now the largest contributor to our sales outside of North America. 
Employer Services segment margin increased about 60 basis points for the fiscal year. This increase was driven by reduced selling expenses in the fourth quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter, partially offset by the negative impact of planned investments made throughout the year to support our clients with the first year of ACA compliance. 
The PEO had a successful year, posting revenue growth of 16% and average worksite employee growth of 13%. 
Let me make a few comments about fourth quarter revenue growth in the PEO, which trended lower at 13% growth compared with the previous 3 quarters in fiscal year 2016. 
This revenue growth deceleration was based on 2 factors. First, regarding our gross revenues, which include pass-throughs, our clients experienced a favorable impact from lower health care renewal premiums during our fourth quarter, which contributed to a lower relative growth in our pass-through revenues. 
Second, in the fourth quarter, we noticed some variability in the timing of payrolls run by our clients. This type of timing variability has occurred in the past and should not be viewed as an indicator of any underlying change in the fundamentals of the business. We remain pleased with the performance of our PEO, which have strong worksite employee growth of 13%, and we are happy to see that the PEO also delivered strong margin expansion of approximately 70 basis points for fiscal year 2016, which was primarily driven by operating and selling efficiencies from increased productivity. 
This is solid overall performance for fiscal year 2016 with strong new business bookings, yielding healthy revenue growth and solid margin expansion despite the additional investments we made during the year. I'm pleased with our results and will now take you through our expectations for fiscal year 2017. 
As Carlos mentioned, for fiscal year 2017, we are  expecting new business bookings growth of 4% to 6% from $1.75 billion sold in fiscal year 2016. We anticipate total revenue growth of 7% to 9% for the year, which is not expected to be significantly impacted by foreign currency translation based on current rates. This forecast assumes 4% to 5% revenue growth in the Employer Services segment and growth in pays per control of 2.5%. Revenue growth for the PEO is expected to be 14% to 16%.
ADP's adjusted EBIT margin is expected to expand 25 to 50 basis points from the 19.5% in fiscal year 2016, which is below our goal of 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion over the longer run. We are still committed to this margin improvement goal over the longer term, but as Carlos mentioned, we are making investments in fiscal year 2017 to align our service model and support of our technology strategy. We expect this operational investments will put about 20 basis points of pressure on our fiscal year 2017 margins. And as a result of these buildout of the new facilities, total expenditures -- capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 are expected to be about $250 million. 
In addition to these investments, we also anticipate certain onetime charges of $100 million to $125 million throughout fiscal year 2018. Of this, $45 million is expected to be incurred during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and $45 million in the latter part of the year with the remainder expected in fiscal year 2018. These charges are excluded from our fiscal year 2017 forecast for adjusted EBIT margin expansion and from our adjusted diluted earnings per share forecast. A reconciliation of these metrics can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our investor relations website. 
On a segment level, we anticipate pretax margin expansion of about 50 basis points for Employer Services and 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion in the PEO. 
On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 6% to 8% compared with the $3.25 in fiscal year 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow at 10% to 12% from the adjusted $3.26 in fiscal year 2016 and contemplates an adjusted effective tax rate of 33.3%, consistent with the 33.3% at fiscal year 2016. 
In accordance with our continued shareholder-friendly actions and our intention to return excess cash to shareholders, our earnings per share forecast assumes that access cash of $1 billion to $1.4 billion will be returned via share repurchases during the fiscal year 2017. This forecasted range includes anticipated share repurchases requires to offset employee benefit plan issuance, and the timing of these share repurchases is dependent upon market conditions. 
So with that, I will take you through our forecast for the client fund extended investment strategy. First, a reminder that the objectives of our investment strategy remain the safety, liquidity and diversification of our assets. 
As of the end of the fiscal year, approximately 80% of our fixed income portfolio was invested in AAA and AA rated securities. In a typical year, our strategy results in about 15% to 20% of our fixed income investments maturing. And this year, we expect the percentage of maturities will be closer to the lower end of this range. We continue to base the interest rate assumptions in our forecast on the Fed Funds future contracts for the client short and corporate cash portfolios and the forward yield curves of the 3.5- and 5-year U.S. government agency forward yield curves for the client and corporate extended and the client loan portfolios, respectively. And as we do not believe it is possible to accurately predict future interest rates, the shape of the yield curve and the new bond issuance behavior of corporate and other issuers. 
For fiscal year 2017, we anticipate growth in the average client funds balances of 2% to 4% from the $22.4 billion in fiscal year 2016. 
We anticipate that the yield of the client fund portfolio will remain about flat at 1.7% compared with fiscal year 2016.
These factors are expected to result in an increase of up to $5 million to client fund interest revenue. The total contribution from the client funds extended investment strategy is expected to be about flat to fiscal year 2016. The detail of this forecast is available in the supplemental slides on our website. 
And before we take your questions, I wanted to let you know that Sara will be taking a new role within ADP Finance as a CFO of one of our business units. I want to thank Sara for her contributions, leading our Investor Relations program and welcome our new Head of Investor Relations, Christian Greyenbuhl, who was recently -- who has recently led ADP's global accounting team. 
So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions."

In terms of the other questions, the -- we did have some time to kind of reset how we were doing migrations and the pace is also based on -- I mentioned that there were 3 factors that I think impacted our retention back over the last 3 quarters, and we think one of them was the pace of migrations and also the execution around migration. So a lot of work was done during what we call our year-end blackout because we really prefer not to do migrations anyway in the, call it, in November to January, February time frame because there's so many things going on at the calendar year and in a typical HCM payroll company. And so that gives a little bit of time for those folks to focus on kind of stabilizing that organization and rethinking what the proper pace is. And to put it in perspective, we migrated approximately 4,000 clients during the quarter. And when we experienced challenges with some of the migrations, we were up as high as 7,000 in a quarter. This is back in the beginning of this fiscal year. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color. And I think the overall comment is, clearly, I think our competitors are fishing in those waters because we see them in the numbers in terms of our losses being concentrated in our legacy platforms, and we're trying to reduce the size of the fishing pond. So there's still some variability there in the retention, but I think we've gotten better at how we're doing the migrations and I think our pace is more manageable and I think easier for us to control at this point."

That creates a mathematical grow over issue for us. So I'll let maybe Jan comment on the math. But I think the message you'd hear from us is that we believe, over the course of the 3 years, as you can imagine, we look very carefully about, is the sales strength coming from core operations, is it coming from additional business, is it coming from ACA, and we feel pretty good on a 3-year compounded basis about where our new business bookings growth is right now."

So we have to make assumptions about that. And so both are in line within a percentage point plus minus. So this is for government work and estimate that our future is intact."

And just the strong new business bookings growth has created a bigger gap between our starts, we call our starts and our losses, and I think that has contributed to this accelerating growth in Employer Services. I think you're right that the losses that we experienced this year obviously have an effect this year, and they have an effect on the following year as well. But again, back to kind of simplistic math for government work, I think we're  probably plus or minus half a point in terms of ES revenue growth. So maybe some of that is rounding, but we don't feel any weakness, I guess, to be clear and the ACA revenues, Jan probably has the exact number. That clearly provided lift in our new business bookings and thus, provide lift to revenues that then also presents somewhat of a grow with this. It's not as pronounced to grow over because it's a revenue number versus the new business bookings number, but it does have the same impact.

Just a follow-up question on the retention. So last quarter, you had mentioned you're taking some steps that are improving the service capability, which gave you some more confidence around retention, but we still saw the retention go or decline. Now my question was when you think about the mid-market customer base, you still have 25,000 customers remaining, which are going to be migrated over the next 4 quarters. And normally, you don't do the migration in November, December, which would imply like around north of 6,000 customers being migrated every quarter versus 4,000 that you signed in the last quarter. So with this elevated level of migration, how should we think about retention going forward? Could we see retention get worse before it starts to get better? So any clarity that you can provide on the retention front? That would be helpful."

The only thing I would add to that math is that you do have to apply a retention or a loss factor to that 25,000 itself. Over the course of 12 months, we naturally -- even if we weren't migrating, we'd lose, call it, 10% of those clients. It might be a little bit higher than that just because they are legacy-type clients. So the absolute number that you're starting with that you have to divide over 4 quarters is a little bit smaller, but you're in the right ballpark. It's probably around 5,000-or-so clients that will be migrated per quarter. We feel pretty comfortable with that pace given the infrastructure that we've created and the new process we have for migrations. In terms of additional color, as you're pointing out, the results didn't cooperate with our desires and with our intentions. And in part, that's because our retention is a reflection of the overall company's results, and there's variability across a lot of other businesses. So I wouldn't read into it even though we still have a concentration of our retention issues in the mid-market, and they have been for this fiscal year. There is another $8 billion to $9 billion of revenue in ADP that also has experience in variability in retention. But having said that, to give you specifics around why our confidence level was high that things would get better and why it still remains high, we have a number of -- in specifically, the mid-market issues that we were experiencing with regards to retention, we have a lot of metrics, as you can imagine, that we look at that are leading indicators versus retention, which is a lagging indicator. For example, the speed to answer phone calls, the number of cases that are unresolved in a backlog, there's just -- we have a number of escalations in terms of people escalating client service issues. And the metrics are -- most of the metrics in the mid-market regarding service experience for our clients are either back to where they were prior to our retention issues or in some cases, better. And so we feel confident that even if there's some kind of lag in the sense that some clients may have already been in process due to a poor service experience at looking at alternatives and the fact that there are other parts of ADP that have variability in retention as well, I think notwithstanding all those things, I think my confidence in the improvements in service stability and service experience in the mid-market remained quite high actually."

And so year-end -- calendar year-end on the third quarter for us, fiscal year are traditionally higher loss months and the fourth quarter month is a lower loss month. So hence, the candy variability in the quarterly shifts of the retention numbers, in this case, it impacted a relatively low loss volume that we typically experience in the fourth quarter. So my general council would be to observe those retention changes that we report, but not to get overly analytical and mathematical quarter-by-quarter. It is a better indicator to think about basically our retention number of 100 basis points decline. So the fiscal year, [indiscernible] we're aiming to be better. We don't guide to retention. But as you might imagine as a company, we clearly have aspirations to improve."

So as a consequence, approximately 5% of our employee population is going to be transferring or moving or at work, we'll be moving and impacting about 5% of our associate population in this fiscal year. And there are costs that are related to this, which we are non-GAAP-ing, which are related in essence to employee cost to facilitate the transfer of the work. That is basically included in the 20 basis points of our guidance. And we clearly hope that the outcome of this service alignment initiative is multi-folded. I believe strongly it will enhance our service value proposition because we're going to have larger centers with bigger capabilities, leveraging ADP's strength in compliance and service and offering a better value proposition to our clients, which is the most exciting part for the service alignment initiative, hopefully resulting in better competitiveness and high retention rates. And also as you can see, these centers are located in geographies of the U.S. that offer certain advantages relative to the cost that where they operate. So there should be, in the longer run, also contribution to our margins. We're a little bit hesitant to specify this for '18 because the initiative will actually bleed over into fiscal year of '18. We mentioned, in particular, center in the west is going to come on later in '17 and will bleed over '18. So in '18 will still have some impact, but we are clearly hoping that it will guarantee basically that we can fulfill our commitment to the 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion in the long run.

And so the service delivery issues that we experience were concentrated in a particular part of our business in the mid-market, and they were execution-related. And I think what we are talking about in terms of our new service alignment initiative is a broad strategic objective across the entire company. It's partly driven by the fact that the industry has evolved, and I think the clients need to have evolved and the products have evolved, too. As an example, 10 years ago, having 3 or 4 different products that were serviced differently in different databases was not an issue. Our platforms now are single-database integrated solutions that provide an HCM solution if the way -- if a client wants to buy it that way in a comprehensive and seamless way. The service model had not moved in the same direction, and I think that this initiative is really intended to have our service implementation really aligned with the way the market is going, the way buyers are buying and the way clients want to be serviced. So we've done similar things in our sales organization, where that also requires that our sales force be trained and equipped to be able to sell in a new environment. So our belief is that now we will have our products, our service and our distribution all aligned."

And as you might imagine, we did have -- we have tested these service models and components of our organization at smaller scale, and we have seen great results out of those pilots."

But we evaluate M&A opportunities in light of our strategic priorities, which is -- which are focused, at this point of time, on reduction on complexity and aligning and focus on our client needs. So any acquisitions that support that drive, we will actively and aggressively pursue. But it has played out over the last 3 years to a more organic growth pattern that has seen great results. And so I think that stand stays the same. I would not expect any dramatic shift in our added towards M&A from what you have seen in the last 3 years. And relative to divestitures and adjusting the portfolio, I think the large portfolio alignment initiatives have happened with the spin-off of CDK, and I think our larger -- last large divestiture was vast empty. There will be here and there smaller type of things as we continually to evaluate the performance of our product portfolio. And if we see opportunities to enhance shareholder value, we will pursue it as we have done so in the past. But it's really an essence. I would anticipate fiscal year '17 to run under the same guidepost as in the last 3 years."

And I would just add that, back to the discussion about capital and -- or the seriousness in which we take capital deployment, we do have a strong balance sheet. So we have capital that we can deploy. But as Jan said, conceptually, it's something really fit into our technology roadmap and accelerated our progress. We'd use our capital, but we're not going to use our capital to have something that, for lack of a better term, fits next to everything else that we have. So it has to be able to be integrated rapidly and seamlessly into what we already are pursuing in terms of our product strategy. It's a little bit of a departure from, call it, 6, 7 years ago when it was really more about leveraging our distribution and adding capabilities and products without as much necessarily regard to how they fit tightly into the technology road map. And that's really nothing so much a change in strategy. It's a change in the market in the way people want to buy and the way products behave, which makes it very, very important to have tight alignment and seamlessness in your products. And then the last, just actual comment I'll make to Jan's point, is because we have capital, if something accelerated our progress, we would do it no different than we're doing some of these internal organic things that we're investing in to accelerate our progress. So if there's an external opportunity to use or capital, we would. But the fact is that, over the last couple of years, when you look at the balance of capital deployment, Jan and I have this discussion all the time, we haven't consciously avoided doing acquisitions. It's just been hard to find one that makes sense and fit in what we're doing in terms of our strategy. But net-net, when you get down to it, we're spending, call it $300 million to $400 million less on acquisitions, and we're spending more on things like internally developed products, capital expenditures and the investments that we're talking about for fiscal year '17. So it wasn't necessarily planned that way, but it just so happens that we're not necessarily deploying any more capital, but we're just deploying it in a slightly different way. But we do retain the right to deploy capital towards acquisitions as well."

We'll give you a little bit of color, then maybe Jan can add in terms of what he's hearing out in the field. So it's interesting the term dedicated reps because we do have parts of our business obviously in the upmarket and national accounts will be a very specific people that service specific clients. And then when you get into the Small Business market, we tend to have a model where the execution and the delivery is very important, but the person that you reach isn't as important. We believe that's the right model. We believe our retention rates and our growth in the Small Business market prove that our model works as long as you execute well. And we would also argue that, in today's world, having a dedicated rep who works for 8 hours a day might not be the best service model for a small company or any other company. So we prefer to focus on how and what's the best way to deliver the best service to the client in the way they want it delivered. And it varies from Small Business up to the upmarket in terms of whether you need a dedicated person or not. But I would encourage you to kind of visualize the service realignment as being more around teams rather than dedicated people. So having alignment around teams. So as an example, given the attach rates that we've discussed over multiple quarters that we're experiencing now in the mid-market and in the upmarket around additional HCM modules, in other words, clients are rarely buying just payroll by itself or just benefits administration by itself. So this service business model really is intended to be able to provide a group of people or a team of people who work together who are co-located and can deliver service across the entire HCM spectrum. That obviously requires some cross-training, but also some ability for people who have special skills to be available and close to people who need to support our clients on a multiple number of issues. So we have reasonable amount of experience in experimenting with what we call intact teams or with co-located teams. And we feel pretty good about the results when it comes to retention, when it comes to client satisfaction. And by the way, in our business, when you have those 2 things, margin follows. So this is primarily led by quality and experience for the client and also, by the way, opportunity for our associates. So what we have found also is in some of our subscale locations has very, very limited mobility and opportunity for associates to progress from a career standpoint. And we now have a number of opportunities across our business for people to learn new things and to move in a different areas, whether it's time and attendance and payroll, benefits administration, talent management, we really run the whole gamut on HCM, and we have needs across the entire business. And when we have people scattered across the entire country in small subscale locations, it just doesn't, I think, make sense from a talent management standpoint for ourselves internally either. And so on all those fronts, we think that this service alignment strategy makes sense."

We have seen a rise in our associate engagement scores as a consequence for those who work in those intact teams, and it reflects probably better of how in a modern team environment our associates want to work. So that's really exciting for our associates as well. And I have one additional component that is strategic move on locations allows you to plan for is also a coordinated effort between our market segments, small, medium and large. So I think we mentioned it in the call. So now we have co-location between those market segments and can be natural growth and exchange our best practices between the different platforms. And for some of the platforms, the back end is fairly similar. If you think about centers of excellence for our tax filing operation and so forth, so it allows us also to create buckets of scale that are very hard to create in smaller locations. So it really, I believe, will transform of how our associates be perceiving, A, the value of the job they're in and the job opportunities that they can reach in the future and allows us to deliver additional service capabilities to our clients, which is the strategic benefit that's leaping out of it."

So when we look at the plan other than specific grow-over challenges that we had because ACA sales were concentrated in the mid-market and in the upmarket, if you take that out, it's really -- each of the business units continues with very good performance. And just as a reminder, it is -- it was $1.75 billion of recurring revenue that sales force generated for ADP. And even if the growth is a few percentage points slower, it's kind of still a very significant number."

So why don't -- you've always said the current year bookings don't do a lot to revenue. Why wouldn't we see some acceleration? Is it as simple as PEO, you're calling for that to be slower?

Again, even though we don't get specific guidance, we do expect less of a drag, for example, from retention because we expect things to get better. We have some metrics and some things underlying, I think, data that gives us hope at least, right, because don't know for sure that, that will improve your math, the comments you made about new business bookings. So all those things are correct. I think I would just encourage you to maybe spend some time off-line with us in terms of kind of the math and how the revenue works. One of the interesting things about this business, this is an incredibly stable and predictable business model. It's also very, very hard to move the numbers dramatically one way or the other over the course of 1 year. So over the course of 4, 5 years, we had double-digit new business bookings. And this year, we had a blip with retention, but retention has also been fairly stable. That's allowed us to accelerate our revenue growth by about 0.5 to 1 percentage point from, call it, 5 years ago in Employer Services. The PEO, as you said, also happens to be a factor because it's growing faster and it's becoming a larger portion of the overall results. So if it slows slightly, that has an impact, too. So we'll spend the time to make sure that we do the math. But what I can tell you is that you're right that, this year, if you exclude the impact of the divestiture or if you don't factor the divestiture in, we were close to 9% revenue growth. We're really proud of that. And next year, we're slightly below that because there's 1 day less because this year was a leap year or whatever the issues are. And we have a little bit of a drag still from -- even the retention is getting better, it's still not a good as it used to be. We're still going to be pretty damn happy and pretty damn proud because we're going to be in, I think, still in the high end of our guidance from a revenue standpoint. And in this business, when you get into that range, given who we are in terms of -- because we understand have a very keen insight into who we are like as a company in terms of where we want to be in terms of our growth rates and our margin improvement and the balance of those things, I think we're satisfied with that outcome. It obviously makes it easier as you pick up additional revenue growth because of the nice leverage ability of our operating model, but we're -- that's part of why we're also doing some of the things we're doing around service limit because we know that we're really not, I think, satisfied with just the results that we have today. On the other hand, we're not going to sit here and tell you that we're trying to aim for 10%, 12%, 15% revenue growth. That's really not who we are. So 7% to 9% is our long-term guidance for revenue growth with some margin improvement, with a healthy dividend. We share buybacks, that's our model, that's what we're executing against. And I'm proud of the organization and the results they've delivered this year. And I think if we deliver the results that we put out there for next year, we're going to be just as proud of that as well."

Please keep in mind that our 8% growth in fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by about 1 percentage point from the sale of our AdvancedMD business, which occurred at the end of the first fiscal quarter. 
In addition to the solid fiscal 2016 revenue growth, I'm very pleased with the robust new business bookings results we experienced during fiscal 2016, posting 12% growth for the year. This represents $1.75 billion in new recurring revenue generated by our sales force during the fiscal year. 
Strong sales of Human Capital Management modules that assist clients in compliance with Affordable Care Act contributed meaningfully to the outperformance we have seen in new business bookings for the past 2 fiscal years. 
This important regulatory change impacted the HCM industry in material ways. ADP responded well and sold our ACA compliance solutions to about half of our addressable base in a relatively short period of time. Because of this very strong recent performance and the resulting difficult compare, we expect fiscal 2017 new business bookings to grow 4% to 6% from the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal 2016. If achieved, this will result in a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of 9%, which is within our long-term expected range of 8% to 10%. 
Fiscal 2016 was an exciting year that showcased ADP's agility as we continue to adapt to the dynamic needs of our clients. When we look back at our progress, it's clear that the long-term trends we see with respect to the changing nature of how work is done, the increasing complexity of regulatory compliance, the trend toward harnessing the power of big data in HR and the need to work seamlessly across geographic borders are all having positive impacts on our success. We've responded to these trends in many ways during the year. For example, across the portfolio, we've dramatically improved the user experience of our clients employees. In doing so, we've made our products easy to use and more consistent with how employees engage with consumer technology and social media. 
If your company is an ADP client, I invite you to join the more than 8 million users of ADP's mobile app to experience this for yourself. 
We've leveraged our unique data set of 26 billion payroll records to introduce significant new data analytics capabilities. Since introducing ADP DataCloud just over 1 year ago, we now have more than 2,500 clients using this solution to generate actionable insights that help address workforce productivity, contribute to talent development and assist with employee retention. 
We've expanded our capabilities geographically and can now meet the payroll processing and compliance needs of companies with operation in more than 110 countries and territories, which is a key differentiator in our industry. 
And we met the challenges presented by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the U.S. With strong demand for our ACA solutions, we made investments in operational resources and successfully helped more than 25,000 clients, process more than 10 million Form 1095-Cs, the most significant new employee tax form introduced by the IRS since the W2. 
As we've discussed, we believe our investments to innovate and simplify our portfolio are essential for our long-term success. We believe our strategic platforms now deliver best-in-class HCM capabilities in each of the markets they serve, and we've seen solid retention rates from clients on our strategic platforms. Therefore, continuing to upgrade clients to our modern cloud solutions remains a critical area of focus for us and is the right thing to do for our clients. 
Today, all of our Small Business clients are on the RUN platform. And during the fourth quarter, we increased the pace of our client migrations in the mid-market, and now have about 49,000 clients on the latest versions of Workforce Now. With 2/3 of this base now upgraded, we expect the balance of our Workforce Now clients to be transitioned to the current platform by the end of fiscal '17.
As we continue to move clients on to our strategic platforms and have more clients engaging ADP for multiple services across the HCM spectrum, we are embarking on a path to simplify our service model for our associates and our clients. 
Over the past several years, our technology platforms have evolved to meet the dynamic needs of our clients who are choosing to engage in a more comprehensive way with their HCM providers. 
As a result of this shift, a new approach to service is essential to support the HCM companies that we've become and extend our leadership in this growing market. And I'm, therefore, excited to tell you about a service initiative we are kicking off in fiscal 2017. 
This new initiative is designed to better align our service organization to work across traditional lines, leverage best-in-class service tools and processes and establish teams with expertise across the HCM spectrum. We believe this will enhance the client experience and at the same time, allow us to better transfer knowledge among these service teams and offer robust career opportunities within the service organization, all of which benefits our clients and our associates. 
As we begin to build out this new service model, we believe there's a benefit to be gained by co-locating certain U.S. service capabilities at existing and new ADP locations in the U.S. that have the scale to support this strategy. 
We have had positive experiences creating centers like these at sites such as El Paso, Texas; Augusta, Georgia, among other places. We've recently selected Norfolk, Virginia and Macon, Florida, near Orlando, as our next 2 locations and have started building cross functional service teams at both sites. We will announce a third new site in the Western part of the U.S. later this year. 
As part of this initiative, we will focus on building service capabilities within these and our existing other locations, while streamlining our geographic footprint. 
In connection with these efforts, ADP will be making certain investments in fiscal 2017, which are expected to put some pressure on our margin expansion goals for the year. Jan will provide more detail when he reviews fiscal 2017 outlook. However, we do expect our margin expansion this fiscal 2017 to be lower than our long-term goal of 50 to 75 basis points as we make these important investments. 
Now I'll spend a few moments on retention. During the fourth quarter, we experienced a retention decline of 80 basis points, and for the full fiscal year, retention declined about a point to 90.5%. 
Similar to previous quarters, we continue to see a concentration of losses from clients who are still on legacy technology. And while we have seen some of the benefits from investments we've made in service during the early part of fiscal 2016, we continue to experience variability in our retention metric. 
In closing, fiscal 2016 was an exciting and challenging year for ADP. We achieved strong revenue growth, driven by sales of additional HCM modules to support clients with the new ACA requirements. We invested in implementation and operational resources to support this revenue growth, while still delivering solid margin expansion. And we did this while remaining consistent with our commitment to shareholder-friendly actions. 
During fiscal 2016, we returned about $2.1 billion in cash through dividends and share repurchases and increased our dividend for the 41st consecutive year. 
I'm confident that as we successfully execute against our strategy, we'll continue to drive results for our clients, our associates and our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn over the call to Jan, who will review our fiscal 2016 financials and share our fiscal 2017 outlook."

During the fourth quarter, we took a severance charge of $48 million that was related to a broad-based workforce optimization effort. Certain non-GAAP measures in my commentary to follow exclude the impact of this charge as well as certain other onetime items recognized earlier in the fiscal year. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental charts of our Investor Relations website. 
As Carlos mentioned, fiscal year 2016 was a successful year for ADP. New business bookings grew 12% to $1.75 billion sold. Revenues grew 7% to $11.7 billion. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, revenues grew 8% for the year.
On a reported basis, net earnings grew 8% and diluted earnings per share grew 12%. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT grew 10% or 11% on a constant dollar basis. 
For the year, adjusted EBIT margin expanded 60 basis from the 18.8% in fiscal year 2015. I'm pleased with this solid margin expansion, which includes the impact of investments in operational resources that were made during the fiscal year as we supported our clients through the first year of the ACA-related reporting requirements. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $3.26, reflecting a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. 
In addition to delivering this solid operating performance, we have paid more than $900 million in dividends and returned about $1.2 billion through share repurchases for fiscal year 2016. 
During the fourth quarter, ADP returned $100 million to shareholders through share repurchases, which was at a reduced pace compared with prior quarters. Market conditions were not a factor, and our long-standing commitment to return cash to our shareholders remains unchanged. 
So now for a discussion of our segment results. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 5% for the year with 6% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions to new recurring revenues during the fiscal year from strong new business bookings sold. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 80 basis points in the fourth quarter. And for the year, revenue retention declined about 1 point to 90.5%. 
Our same-store pays per control in the U.S. grew 2.5% for the fiscal year. Average client fund balances grew 3% for the year or 4% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was slower than in prior years, primarily related to the declines of state unemployment insurance collections as a result of an improving labor market in the U.S. This, in combination with the impact on client losses experienced into the year, has put added pressure on the client funds balance growth. 
Our business outside of North America continues to perform well despite an uncertain global environment. This performance is driven by continued strong demand for our multinational solutions, which served businesses of all sizes and are now the largest contributor to our sales outside of North America. 
Employer Services segment margin increased about 60 basis points for the fiscal year. This increase was driven by reduced selling expenses in the fourth quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter, partially offset by the negative impact of planned investments made throughout the year to support our clients with the first year of ACA compliance. 
The PEO had a successful year, posting revenue growth of 16% and average worksite employee growth of 13%. 
Let me make a few comments about fourth quarter revenue growth in the PEO, which trended lower at 13% growth compared with the previous 3 quarters in fiscal year 2016. 
This revenue growth deceleration was based on 2 factors. First, regarding our gross revenues, which include pass-throughs, our clients experienced a favorable impact from lower health care renewal premiums during our fourth quarter, which contributed to a lower relative growth in our pass-through revenues. 
Second, in the fourth quarter, we noticed some variability in the timing of payrolls run by our clients. This type of timing variability has occurred in the past and should not be viewed as an indicator of any underlying change in the fundamentals of the business. We remain pleased with the performance of our PEO, which have strong worksite employee growth of 13%, and we are happy to see that the PEO also delivered strong margin expansion of approximately 70 basis points for fiscal year 2016, which was primarily driven by operating and selling efficiencies from increased productivity. 
This is solid overall performance for fiscal year 2016 with strong new business bookings, yielding healthy revenue growth and solid margin expansion despite the additional investments we made during the year. I'm pleased with our results and will now take you through our expectations for fiscal year 2017. 
As Carlos mentioned, for fiscal year 2017, we are  expecting new business bookings growth of 4% to 6% from $1.75 billion sold in fiscal year 2016. We anticipate total revenue growth of 7% to 9% for the year, which is not expected to be significantly impacted by foreign currency translation based on current rates. This forecast assumes 4% to 5% revenue growth in the Employer Services segment and growth in pays per control of 2.5%. Revenue growth for the PEO is expected to be 14% to 16%.
ADP's adjusted EBIT margin is expected to expand 25 to 50 basis points from the 19.5% in fiscal year 2016, which is below our goal of 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion over the longer run. We are still committed to this margin improvement goal over the longer term, but as Carlos mentioned, we are making investments in fiscal year 2017 to align our service model and support of our technology strategy. We expect this operational investments will put about 20 basis points of pressure on our fiscal year 2017 margins. And as a result of these buildout of the new facilities, total expenditures -- capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 are expected to be about $250 million. 
In addition to these investments, we also anticipate certain onetime charges of $100 million to $125 million throughout fiscal year 2018. Of this, $45 million is expected to be incurred during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and $45 million in the latter part of the year with the remainder expected in fiscal year 2018. These charges are excluded from our fiscal year 2017 forecast for adjusted EBIT margin expansion and from our adjusted diluted earnings per share forecast. A reconciliation of these metrics can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our investor relations website. 
On a segment level, we anticipate pretax margin expansion of about 50 basis points for Employer Services and 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion in the PEO. 
On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 6% to 8% compared with the $3.25 in fiscal year 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow at 10% to 12% from the adjusted $3.26 in fiscal year 2016 and contemplates an adjusted effective tax rate of 33.3%, consistent with the 33.3% at fiscal year 2016. 
In accordance with our continued shareholder-friendly actions and our intention to return excess cash to shareholders, our earnings per share forecast assumes that access cash of $1 billion to $1.4 billion will be returned via share repurchases during the fiscal year 2017. This forecasted range includes anticipated share repurchases requires to offset employee benefit plan issuance, and the timing of these share repurchases is dependent upon market conditions. 
So with that, I will take you through our forecast for the client fund extended investment strategy. First, a reminder that the objectives of our investment strategy remain the safety, liquidity and diversification of our assets. 
As of the end of the fiscal year, approximately 80% of our fixed income portfolio was invested in AAA and AA rated securities. In a typical year, our strategy results in about 15% to 20% of our fixed income investments maturing. And this year, we expect the percentage of maturities will be closer to the lower end of this range. We continue to base the interest rate assumptions in our forecast on the Fed Funds future contracts for the client short and corporate cash portfolios and the forward yield curves of the 3.5- and 5-year U.S. government agency forward yield curves for the client and corporate extended and the client loan portfolios, respectively. And as we do not believe it is possible to accurately predict future interest rates, the shape of the yield curve and the new bond issuance behavior of corporate and other issuers. 
For fiscal year 2017, we anticipate growth in the average client funds balances of 2% to 4% from the $22.4 billion in fiscal year 2016. 
We anticipate that the yield of the client fund portfolio will remain about flat at 1.7% compared with fiscal year 2016.
These factors are expected to result in an increase of up to $5 million to client fund interest revenue. The total contribution from the client funds extended investment strategy is expected to be about flat to fiscal year 2016. The detail of this forecast is available in the supplemental slides on our website. 
And before we take your questions, I wanted to let you know that Sara will be taking a new role within ADP Finance as a CFO of one of our business units. I want to thank Sara for her contributions, leading our Investor Relations program and welcome our new Head of Investor Relations, Christian Greyenbuhl, who was recently -- who has recently led ADP's global accounting team.

In terms of the other questions, the -- we did have some time to kind of reset how we were doing migrations and the pace also based on -- I mentioned that there were 3 factors that I think impacted our retention back over the last 3 quarters, and we think one of them was the pace of migrations and also the execution around migration. So a lot of work was done during what we call our year-end blackout because we really prefer not to do migrations anyway in the, call it, in November to January, February time frame because there's so many things going on at the calendar year end in a typical HCM payroll company. And so that gives a little bit of time for those folks to focus on kind of stabilizing that organization and rethinking what the proper pace is. And to put it in perspective, we migrated approximately 4,000 clients during the quarter. And when we experienced challenges with some of the migrations, we were up as high as 7,000 in a quarter. This is back in the beginning of this fiscal year. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color. And I think the overall comment is, clearly, I think our competitors are fishing in those waters because we see them in the numbers in terms of our losses being concentrated in our legacy platforms, and we're trying to reduce the size of the fishing pond. So there's still some variability there in the retention, but I think we've gotten better at how we're doing the migrations and I think our pace is more manageable and I think easier for us to control at this point."

That creates a mathematical grow over issue for us. So I'll let maybe Jan comment on the math. But I think the message you'd hear from us is that we believe, over the course of the 3 years, as you can imagine, we look very carefully about, is the sales strength coming from core operations, is it coming from additional business, is it coming from ACA, and we feel pretty good on a 3-year compounded basis about where our new business bookings growth is right now."

And that is yes, because we have addressed already half of our business opportunity in the first year, and we don't expect to close -- cover 100% of the sales opportunity in fiscal year '17. So we have to make assumptions about that. And so both are in line within a percentage point plus minus. So this is for government work and estimate that our future is intact."

I think you're right that the losses that we experienced this year obviously have an effect this year, and they have an effect on the following year as well. But again, back to kind of simplistic math for government work, I think we're  probably plus or minus half a point in terms of ES revenue growth. So maybe some of that is rounding, but we don't feel any weakness, I guess, to be clear and the ACA revenues, Jan probably has the exact number. That clearly provided lift in our new business bookings and thus, provide lift to revenues that then also presents somewhat of a grow with this. It's not as pronounced to grow over because it's a revenue number versus the new business bookings number, but it does have the same impact.

Now my question was when you think about the mid-market customer base, you still have 25,000 customers remaining, which are going to be migrated over the next 4 quarters. And normally, you don't do the migration in November, December, which would imply like around north of 6,000 customers being migrated every quarter versus 4,000 that you saw in the last quarter. So with this elevated level of migration, how should we think about retention going forward? Could we see retention get worse before it starts to get better?

The only thing I would add to that math is that you do have to apply a retention or a loss factor to that 25,000 itself. Over the course of 12 months, we naturally -- even if we weren't migrating, we'd lose, call it, 10% of those clients. It might be a little bit higher than that just because they are legacy-type clients. So the absolute number that you're starting with that you have to divide over 4 quarters is a little bit smaller, but you're in the right ballpark. It's probably around 5,000-or-so clients that need to be migrated per quarter. We feel pretty comfortable with that pace given the infrastructure that we've created and the new process we have for migrations. In terms of additional color, as you're pointing out, the results didn't cooperate with our desires and with our intentions. And in part, that's because our retention is a reflection of the overall company's results, and there's variability across a lot of other businesses. So I wouldn't read into it even though we still have a concentration of our retention issues in the mid-market, and they have been for this fiscal year. There is another $8 billion to $9 billion of revenue in ADP that also has experience in variability in retention. But having said that, to give you specifics around why our confidence level was high that things would get better and why it still remains high, we have a number of -- in specifically, the mid-market issues that we were experiencing with regards to retention, we have a lot of metrics, as you can imagine, that we look at that are leading indicators versus retention, which is a lagging indicator. For example, the speed to answer phone calls, the number of cases that are unresolved in a backlog, there's just -- we have a number of escalations in terms of people escalating client service issues. And the metrics are -- most of the metrics in the mid-market regarding service experience for our clients are either back to where they were prior to our retention issues or in some cases, better. And so we feel confident that even if there's some kind of lag in the sense that some clients may have already been in process due to a poor service experience at looking at alternatives and the fact that there are other parts of ADP that have variability in retention as well, I think notwithstanding all those things, I think my confidence in the improvements in service stability and service experience in the mid-market remained quite high actually."

And so year-end -- calendar year-end on the third quarter for us, fiscal year are traditionally higher loss months and the fourth quarter month is a lower loss month. So hence, the candy variability in the quarterly shifts of the retention numbers, in this case, it impacted a relatively low loss volume that we typically experience in the fourth quarter. So my general council would be to observe those retention changes that we report, but not to get overly analytical and mathematical quarter-by-quarter. It is a better indicator to think about basically our retention number of 100 basis points decline. So the fiscal year, because we're aiming to be better. We don't guide to retention. But as you might imagine as a company, we clearly have aspirations to improve."

And there are costs that are related to this, which we are non-GAAP-ing, which are related in essence to employee cost to facilitate the transfer of the work. That is basically included in the 20 basis points of our guidance. And we clearly hope that the outcome of this service alignment initiative is multi-folded. I believe strongly it will enhance our service value proposition because we're going to have larger centers with bigger capabilities, leveraging ADP's strength in compliance and service and offering a better value proposition to our clients, which is the most exciting part for the service alignment initiative, hopefully resulting in better competitiveness and high retention rates. And also as you can see, these centers are located in geographies of the U.S. that offer certain advantages relative to the cost that where they operate. So there should be, in the longer run, also contribution to our margins. We're a little bit hesitant to specify this for '18 because the initiative will actually bleed over into fiscal year of '18. We mentioned, in particular, center in the west is going to come on later in '17 and will bleed over '18. So in '18 will still have some impact, but we are clearly hoping that it will guarantee basically that we can fulfill our commitment to the 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion in the long run. So this is an important supporting initiative for that."

And so the service delivery issues that we experience were concentrated in a particular part of our business in the mid-market, and they were execution-related. And I think what we are talking about in terms of our new service alignment initiative is a broad strategic objective across the entire company. It's partly driven by the fact that the industry has evolved, and I think the clients needs have evolved and the products have evolved, too. As an example, 10 years ago, having 3 or 4 different products that were serviced differently in different databases was not an issue. Our platforms now are single-database integrated solutions that provide an HCM solution if the way -- if a client wants to buy it that way in a comprehensive and seamless way. The service model had not moved in the same direction, and I think that this initiative is really intended to have our service implementation really aligned with the way the market is going, the way buyers are buying and the way clients want to be serviced. So we've done similar things in our sales organization, where that also requires that our sales force be trained and equipped to be able to sell in a new environment. So our belief is that now we will have our products, our service and our distribution all aligned."

So any acquisitions that support that drive, we will actively and aggressively pursue. But it has played out over the last 3 years to a more organic growth pattern that has seen great results. And so I think that stand stays the same. I would not expect any dramatic shift in our attitude towards M&A from what you have seen in the last 3 years. And relative to divestitures and adjusting the portfolio, I think the large portfolio alignment initiatives have happened with the spin-off of CDK, and I think our larger -- last large divestiture was vast empty.

And I would just add that, back to the discussion about capital and -- or the seriousness in which we take capital deployment, we do have a strong balance sheet. So we have capital that we can deploy. But as Jan said, conceptually, it's something really fit into our technology roadmap and accelerated our progress. We'd use our capital, but we're not going to use our capital to have something that, for lack of a better term, fits next to everything else that we have. So it has to be able to be integrated rapidly and seamlessly into what we already are pursuing in terms of our product strategy. It's a little bit of a departure from, call it, 6, 7 years ago when it was really more about leveraging our distribution and adding capabilities and products without as much necessarily regard to how they fit tightly into the technology road map. And that's really nothing so much a change in strategy. It's a change in the market in the way people want to buy and the way products behave, which makes it very, very important to have tight alignment and seamlessness in your products. And then the last, just actual comment I'll make to Jan's point, is because we have capital, if something accelerated our progress, we would do it no different than we're doing some of these internal organic things that we're investing in to accelerate our progress. So if there's an external opportunity to use or capital, we would. But the fact is that, over the last couple of years, when you look at the balance of capital deployment, Jan and I have this discussion all the time, we haven't consciously avoided doing acquisitions. It's just been hard to find one that makes sense and fit in what we're doing in terms of our strategy. But net-net, when you get down to it, we're spending, call it $300 million to $400 million less on acquisitions, and we're spending more on things like internally developed products, capital expenditures and the investments that we're talking about for fiscal year '17. So it wasn't necessarily planned that way, but it just so happens that we're not necessarily deploying any more capital, but we're just deploying it in a slightly different way. But we do retain the right to deploy capital towards acquisitions as well."

We'll give you a little bit of color, then maybe Jan can add in terms of what he's hearing out in the field. So it's interesting the term dedicated reps because we do have parts of our business obviously in the upmarket and national accounts will have very specific people that service specific clients. And then when you get into the Small Business market, we tend to have a model where the execution and the delivery is very important, but the person that you reach isn't as important. We believe that's the right model. We believe our retention rates and our growth in the Small Business market prove that our model works as long as you execute well. And we would also argue that, in today's world, having a dedicated rep who works for 8 hours a day might not be the best service model for a small company or any other company. So we prefer to focus on how and what's the best way to deliver the best service to the client in the way they want it delivered. And it varies from Small Business up to the upmarket in terms of whether you need a dedicated person or not. But I would encourage you to kind of visualize the service realignment as being more around teams rather than dedicated people. So having alignment around teams. So as an example, given the attach rates that we've discussed over multiple quarters that we're experiencing now in the mid-market and in the upmarket around additional HCM modules, in other words, clients are rarely buying just payroll by itself or just benefits administration by itself. So this service model really is intended to be able to provide a group of people or a team of people who work together who are co-located and can deliver service across the entire HCM spectrum. That obviously requires some cross-training, but also some ability for people who have special skills to be available and close to people who need to support our clients on a multiple number of issues. So we have reasonable amount of experience in experimenting with what we call intact teams or with co-located teams. And we feel pretty good about the results when it comes to retention, when it comes to client satisfaction. And by the way, in our business, when you have those 2 things, margin follows. So this is primarily led by quality and experience for the client and also, by the way, opportunity for our associates. So what we have found also is in some of our subscale locations has very, very limited mobility and opportunity for associates to progress from a career standpoint. And we now have a number of opportunities across our business for people to learn new things and to move in a different areas, whether it's time and attendance and payroll, benefits administration, talent management, we really run the whole gamut on HCM, and we have needs across the entire business. And when we have people scattered across the entire country in small subscale locations, it just doesn't, I think, make sense from a talent management standpoint for ourselves internally either. And so on all those fronts, we think that this service alignment strategy makes sense."

So that's really exciting for our associates as well. And I have one additional component that is strategic move on locations allows you to plan for is also a coordinated effort between our market segments, small, medium and large. So I think we mentioned it in the call. So now we have co-location between those market segments and can be natural growth and exchange our best practices between the different platforms. And for some of the platforms, the back end is fairly similar. If you think about centers of excellence for our tax filing operation and so forth, so it allows us also to create buckets of scale that are very hard to create in smaller locations. So it really, I believe, will transform of how our associates be perceiving, A, the value of the job they're in and the job opportunities that they can reach in the future and allows us to deliver additional service capabilities to our clients, which is the strategic benefit that's leaping out of it."

So why don't -- you've always said the current year bookings don't do a lot to revenue. Why wouldn't we see some acceleration? Is it as simple as PEO, you're calling for that to be slower? It just feels like there should be a bit better revenue growth from -- think it through all these moving parts."

Again, even though we don't get specific guidance, we do expect less of a drag, for example, from retention because we expect things to get better. We have some metrics and some things underlying, I think, data that gives us hope at least, right, because don't know for sure that, that will improve your math, the comments you made about new business bookings. So all those things are correct. I think I would just encourage you to maybe spend some time off-line with us in terms of kind of the math and how the revenue works. One of the interesting things about this business, this is an incredibly stable and predictable business model. It's also very, very hard to move the numbers dramatically one way or the other over the course of 1 year. So over the course of 4, 5 years, we had double-digit new business bookings. And this year, we had a blip with retention, but retention has also been fairly stable. That's allowed us to accelerate our revenue growth by about 0.5 to 1 percentage point from, call it, 5 years ago in Employer Services. The PEO, as you said, also happens to be a factor because it's growing faster and it's becoming a larger portion of the overall results. So if it slows slightly, that has an impact, too. So we'll spend the time to make sure that we do the math. But what I can tell you is that you're right that, this year, if you exclude the impact of the divestiture or if you don't factor the divestiture in, we were close to 9% revenue growth. We're really proud of that. And next year, we're slightly below that because there's 1 day less because this year was a leap year or whatever the issues are. And we have a little bit of a drag still from -- even the retention is getting better, it's still not a good as it used to be. We're still going to be pretty damn happy and pretty damn proud because we're going to be in, I think, still in the high end of our guidance from a revenue standpoint. And in this business, when you get into that range, given who we are in terms of -- because we understand have a very keen insight into who we are like as a company in terms of where we want to be in terms of our growth rates and our margin improvement and the balance of those things, I think we're satisfied with that outcome. It obviously makes it easier as you pick up additional revenue growth because of the nice leverage ability of our operating model, but we're -- that's part of why we're also doing some of the things we're doing around service limit because we know that we're really not, I think, satisfied with just the results that we have today. On the other hand, we're not going to sit here and tell you that we're trying to aim for 10%, 12%, 15% revenue growth. That's really not who we are. So 7% to 9% is our long-term guidance for revenue growth with some margin improvement, with a healthy dividend. We share buybacks, that's our model, that's what we're executing against. And I'm proud of the organization and the results they've delivered this year. And I think if we deliver the results that we put out there for next year, we're going to be just as proud of that as well."

Thanks for joining our call and for your continued interest in ADP. This morning, we reported solid results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2016 with revenue up 8% for the quarter and 7% for the year. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, fiscal 2016 revenue grew 8%. 
Please keep in mind that our 8% growth in fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by about 1 percentage point from the sale of our AdvancedMD business, which occurred at the end of the first fiscal quarter. 
In addition to the solid fiscal 2016 revenue growth, I'm very pleased with the robust new business bookings results we experienced during fiscal 2016, posting 12% growth for the year. This represents $1.75 billion in new recurring revenue generated by our sales force during the fiscal year. 
Strong sales of Human Capital Management modules that assist clients in compliance with Affordable Care Act contributed meaningfully to the outperformance we have seen in new business bookings for the past 2 fiscal years. 
This important regulatory change impacted the HCM industry in material ways. ADP responded well and sold our ACA compliance solutions to about half of our addressable base in a relatively short period of time. Because of this very strong recent performance and the resulting difficult compare, we expect fiscal 2017 new business bookings to grow 4% to 6% from the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal 2016. If achieved, this will result in a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of 9%, which is within our long-term expected range of 8% to 10%. 
Fiscal 2016 was an exciting year that showcased ADP's agility as we continue to adapt to the dynamic needs of our clients. When we look back at our progress, it's clear that the long-term trends we see with respect to the changing nature of how work is done, the increasing complexity of regulatory compliance, the trend toward harnessing the power of big data in HR and the need to work seamlessly across geographic borders are all having positive impacts on our success. We've responded to these trends in many ways during the year. For example, across the portfolio, we've dramatically improved the user experience of our clients employees. In doing so, we've made our products easy to use and more consistent with how employees engage with consumer technology and social media. 
If your company is an ADP client, I invite you to join the more than 8 million users of ADP's mobile app to experience this for yourself. 
We've leveraged our unique data set of 26 billion payroll records to introduce significant new data analytics capabilities. Since introducing ADP DataCloud just over 1 year ago, we now have more than 2,500 clients using this solution to generate actionable insights that help address workforce productivity, contribute to talent development and assist with employee retention. 
We've expanded our capabilities geographically and can now meet the payroll processing and compliance needs of companies with operation in more than 110 countries and territories, which is a key differentiator in our industry. 
And we met the challenges presented by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the U.S. With strong demand for our ACA solutions, we made investments in operational resources and successfully helped more than 25,000 clients, process more than 10 million Form 1095-Cs, the most significant new employee tax form introduced by the IRS since the W2. 
As we've discussed, we believe our investments to innovate and simplify our portfolio are essential for our long-term success. We believe our strategic platforms now deliver best-in-class HCM capabilities in each of the markets they serve, and we've seen solid retention rates from clients on our strategic platforms. Therefore, continuing to upgrade clients to our modern cloud solutions remains a critical area of focus for us and is the right thing to do for our clients. 
Today, all of our Small Business clients are on the RUN platform. And during the fourth quarter, we increased the pace of our client migrations in the mid-market, and now have about 49,000 clients on the latest versions of Workforce Now. With 2/3 of this base now upgraded, we expect the balance of our Workforce Now clients to be transitioned to the current platform by the end of fiscal '17.
As we continue to move clients on to our strategic platforms and have more clients engaging ADP for multiple services across the HCM spectrum, we are embarking on a path to simplify our service model for our associates and our clients. 
Over the past several years, our technology platforms have evolved to meet the dynamic needs of our clients who are choosing to engage in a more comprehensive way with their HCM providers. 
As a result of this shift, a new approach to service is essential to support the HCM companies that we've become and extend our leadership in this growing market. And I'm, therefore, excited to tell you about a service initiative we are kicking off in fiscal 2017. 
This new initiative is designed to better align our service organization to work across traditional lines, leverage best-in-class service tools and processes and establish teams with expertise across the HCM spectrum. We believe this will enhance the client experience and at the same time, allow us to better transfer knowledge among these service teams and offer robust career opportunities within the service organization, all of which benefits our clients and our associates. 
As we begin to build out this new service model, we believe there's a benefit to be gained by co-locating certain U.S. service capabilities at existing and new ADP locations in the U.S. that have the scale to support this strategy. 
We have had positive experiences creating centers like these at sites such as El Paso, Texas; Augusta, Georgia, among other places. We've recently selected Norfolk, Virginia and Macon, Florida, near Orlando, as our next 2 locations and have started building cross functional service teams at both sites. We will announce a third new site in the Western part of the U.S. later this year. 
As part of this initiative, we will focus on building service capabilities within these and our existing other locations, while streamlining our geographic footprint. 
In connection with these efforts, ADP will be making certain investments in fiscal 2017, which are expected to put some pressure on our margin expansion goals for the year. Jan will provide more detail when he reviews fiscal 2017 outlook. However, we do expect our margin expansion this fiscal 2017 to be lower than our long-term goal of 50 to 75 basis points as we make these important investments. 
Now I'll spend a few moments on retention. During the fourth quarter, we experienced a retention decline of 80 basis points, and for the full fiscal year, retention declined about a point to 90.5%. 
Similar to previous quarters, we continue to see a concentration of losses from clients who are still on legacy technology. And while we have seen some of the benefits from investments we've made in service during the early part of fiscal 2016, we continue to experience variability in our retention metric. 
In closing, fiscal 2016 was an exciting and challenging year for ADP. We achieved strong revenue growth, driven by sales of additional HCM modules to support clients with the new ACA requirements. We invested in implementation and operational resources to support this revenue growth, while still delivering solid margin expansion. And we did this while remaining consistent with our commitment to shareholder-friendly actions. 
During fiscal 2016, we returned about $2.1 billion in cash through dividends and share repurchases and increased our dividend for the 41st consecutive year. 
I'm confident that as we successfully execute against our strategy, we'll continue to drive results for our clients, our associates and our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn over the call to Jan, who will review our fiscal 2016 financials and share our fiscal 2017 outlook."

During the fourth quarter, we took a severance charge of $48 million that was related to a broad-based workforce optimization effort. Certain non-GAAP measures in my commentary to follow exclude the impact of this charge as well as certain other onetime items recognized earlier in the fiscal year. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental charts of our Investor Relations website. 
As Carlos mentioned, fiscal year 2016 was a successful year for ADP. New business bookings grew 12% to $1.75 billion sold. Revenues grew 7% to $11.7 billion. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, revenues grew 8% for the year.
On a reported basis, net earnings grew 8% and diluted earnings per share grew 12%. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT grew 10% or 11% on a constant dollar basis. 
For the year, adjusted EBIT margin expanded 60 basis from the 18.8% in fiscal year 2015. I'm pleased with this solid margin expansion, which includes the impact of investments in operational resources that were made during the fiscal year as we supported our clients through the first year of the ACA-related reporting requirements. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $3.26, reflecting a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. 
In addition to delivering this solid operating performance, we have paid more than $900 million in dividends and returned about $1.2 billion through share repurchases for fiscal year 2016. 
During the fourth quarter, ADP returned $100 million to shareholders through share repurchases, which was at a reduced pace compared with prior quarters. Market conditions were not a factor, and our long-standing commitment to return cash to our shareholders remains unchanged. 
So now for a discussion of our segment results. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 5% for the year with 6% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions to new recurring revenues during the fiscal year from strong new business bookings sold. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 80 basis points in the fourth quarter. And for the year, revenue retention declined about 1 point to 90.5%. 
Our same-store pays per control in the U.S. grew 2.5% for the fiscal year. Average client fund balances grew 3% for the year or 4% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was slower than in prior years, primarily related to the declines of state unemployment insurance collections as a result of an improving labor market in the U.S. This, in combination with the impact on client losses experienced into the year, has put added pressure on the client funds balance growth. 
Our business outside of North America continues to perform well despite an uncertain global environment. This performance is driven by continued strong demand for our multinational solutions, which served businesses of all sizes and are now the largest contributor to our sales outside of North America. 
Employer Services segment margin increased about 60 basis points for the fiscal year. This increase was driven by reduced selling expenses in the fourth quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter, partially offset by the negative impact of planned investments made throughout the year to support our clients with the first year of ACA compliance. 
The PEO had a successful year, posting revenue growth of 16% and average worksite employee growth of 13%. 
Let me make a few comments about fourth quarter revenue growth in the PEO, which trended lower at 13% growth compared with the previous 3 quarters in fiscal year 2016. 
This revenue growth deceleration was based on 2 factors. First, regarding our gross revenues, which include pass-throughs, our clients experienced a favorable impact from lower health care renewal premiums during our fourth quarter, which contributed to a lower relative growth in our pass-through revenues. 
Second, in the fourth quarter, we noticed some variability in the timing of payrolls run by our clients. This type of timing variability has occurred in the past and should not be viewed as an indicator of any underlying change in the fundamentals of the business. We remain pleased with the performance of our PEO, which have strong worksite employee growth of 13%, and we are happy to see that the PEO also delivered strong margin expansion of approximately 70 basis points for fiscal year 2016, which was primarily driven by operating and selling efficiencies from increased productivity. 
This is solid overall performance for fiscal year 2016 with strong new business bookings, yielding healthy revenue growth and solid margin expansion despite the additional investments we made during the year. I'm pleased with our results and will now take you through our expectations for fiscal year 2017. 
As Carlos mentioned, for fiscal year 2017, we are  expecting new business bookings growth of 4% to 6% from $1.75 billion sold in fiscal year 2016. We anticipate total revenue growth of 7% to 9% for the year, which is not expected to be significantly impacted by foreign currency translation based on current rates. This forecast assumes 4% to 5% revenue growth in the Employer Services segment and growth in pays per control of 2.5%. Revenue growth for the PEO is expected to be 14% to 16%.
ADP's adjusted EBIT margin is expected to expand 25 to 50 basis points from the 19.5% in fiscal year 2016, which is below our goal of 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion over the longer run. We are still committed to this margin improvement goal over the longer term, but as Carlos mentioned, we are making investments in fiscal year 2017 to align our service model and support of our technology strategy. We expect this operational investments will put about 20 basis points of pressure on our fiscal year 2017 margins. And as a result of these buildout of the new facilities, total expenditures -- capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 are expected to be about $250 million. 
In addition to these investments, we also anticipate certain onetime charges of $100 million to $125 million throughout fiscal year 2018. Of this, $45 million is expected to be incurred during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and $45 million in the latter part of the year with the remainder expected in fiscal year 2018. These charges are excluded from our fiscal year 2017 forecast for adjusted EBIT margin expansion and from our adjusted diluted earnings per share forecast. A reconciliation of these metrics can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our investor relations website. 
On a segment level, we anticipate pretax margin expansion of about 50 basis points for Employer Services and 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion in the PEO. 
On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 6% to 8% compared with the $3.25 in fiscal year 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow at 10% to 12% from the adjusted $3.26 in fiscal year 2016 and contemplates an adjusted effective tax rate of 33.3%, consistent with the 33.3% at fiscal year 2016. 
In accordance with our continued shareholder-friendly actions and our intention to return excess cash to shareholders, our earnings per share forecast assumes that access cash of $1 billion to $1.4 billion will be returned via share repurchases during the fiscal year 2017. This forecasted range includes anticipated share repurchases requires to offset employee benefit plan issuance, and the timing of these share repurchases is dependent upon market conditions. 
So with that, I will take you through our forecast for the client fund extended investment strategy. First, a reminder that the objectives of our investment strategy remain the safety, liquidity and diversification of our assets. 
As of the end of the fiscal year, approximately 80% of our fixed income portfolio was invested in AAA and AA rated securities. In a typical year, our strategy results in about 15% to 20% of our fixed income investments maturing. And this year, we expect the percentage of maturities will be closer to the lower end of this range. We continue to base the interest rate assumptions in our forecast on the Fed Funds future contracts for the client short and corporate cash portfolios and the forward yield curves of the 3.5- and 5-year U.S. government agency forward yield curves for the client and corporate extended and the client loan portfolios, respectively. And as we do not believe it is possible to accurately predict future interest rates, the shape of the yield curve and the new bond issuance behavior of corporate and other issuers. 
For fiscal year 2017, we anticipate growth in the average client funds balances of 2% to 4% from the $22.4 billion in fiscal year 2016. 
We anticipate that the yield of the client fund portfolio will remain about flat at 1.7% compared with fiscal year 2016.
These factors are expected to result in an increase of up to $5 million to client fund interest revenue. The total contribution from the client funds extended investment strategy is expected to be about flat to fiscal year 2016. The detail of this forecast is available in the supplemental slides on our website.

In terms of the other questions, the -- we did have some time to kind of reset how we were doing migrations and the pace also based on -- I mentioned that there were 3 factors that I think impacted our retention back over the last 3 quarters, and we think one of them was the pace of migrations and also the execution around migration. So a lot of work was done during what we call our year-end blackout because we really prefer not to do migrations anyway in the, call it, in November to January, February time frame because there's so many things going on at the calendar year end in a typical HCM payroll company. And so that gives a little bit of time for those folks to focus on kind of stabilizing that organization and rethinking what the proper pace is. And to put it in perspective, we migrated approximately 4,000 clients during the quarter. And when we experienced challenges with some of the migrations, we were up as high as 7,000 in a quarter. This is back in the beginning of this fiscal year. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color. And I think the overall comment is, clearly, I think our competitors are fishing in those waters because we see them in the numbers in terms of our losses being concentrated in our legacy platforms, and we're trying to reduce the size of the fishing pond. So there's still some variability there in the retention, but I think we've gotten better at how we're doing the migrations and I think our pace is more manageable and I think easier for us to control at this point."

That creates a mathematical grow over issue for us. So I'll let maybe Jan comment on the math. But I think the message you'd hear from us is that we believe, over the course of the 3 years, as you can imagine, we look very carefully about, is the sales strength coming from core operations, is it coming from additional business, is it coming from ACA, and we feel pretty good on a 3-year compounded basis about where our new business bookings growth is right now."

I think you're right that the losses that we experienced this year obviously have an effect this year, and they have an effect on the following year as well. But again, back to kind of simplistic math for government work, I think we're  probably plus or minus half a point in terms of ES revenue growth. So maybe some of that is rounding, but we don't feel any weakness, I guess, to be clear and the ACA revenues, Jan probably has the exact number. That clearly provided lift in our new business bookings and thus, provide lift to revenues that then also presents somewhat of a grow with this. It's not as pronounced to grow over because it's a revenue number versus the new business bookings number, but it does have the same impact.

Just a follow-up question on the retention. So last quarter, you had mentioned you're taking some steps that are improving the service capability, which gave you some more confidence around retention, but we still saw the retention go or decline. Now my question was when you think about the mid-market customer base, you still have 25,000 customers remaining, which are going to be migrated over the next 4 quarters. And normally, you don't do the migration in November, December, which would imply like around north of 6,000 customers being migrated every quarter versus 4,000 that you saw in the last quarter. So with this elevated level of migration, how should we think about retention going forward? Could we see retention get worse before it starts to get better? So any clarity that you can provide on the retention front? That would be helpful."

The only thing I would add to that math is that you do have to apply a retention or a loss factor to that 25,000 itself. Over the course of 12 months, we naturally -- even if we weren't migrating, we'd lose, call it, 10% of those clients. It might be a little bit higher than that just because they are legacy-type clients. So the absolute number that you're starting with that you have to divide over 4 quarters is a little bit smaller, but you're in the right ballpark. It's probably around 5,000-or-so clients that need to be migrated per quarter. We feel pretty comfortable with that pace given the infrastructure that we've created and the new process we have for migrations. In terms of additional color, as you're pointing out, the results didn't cooperate with our desires and with our intentions. And in part, that's because our retention is a reflection of the overall company's results, and there's variability across a lot of other businesses. So I wouldn't read into it even though we still have a concentration of our retention issues in the mid-market, and they have been for this fiscal year. There is another $8 billion to $9 billion of revenue in ADP that also has experience in variability in retention. But having said that, to give you specifics around why our confidence level was high that things would get better and why it still remains high, we have a number of -- in specifically, the mid-market issues that we were experiencing with regards to retention, we have a lot of metrics, as you can imagine, that we look at that are leading indicators versus retention, which is a lagging indicator. For example, the speed to answer phone calls, the number of cases that are unresolved in a backlog, there's just -- we have a number of escalations in terms of people escalating client service issues. And the metrics are -- most of the metrics in the mid-market regarding service experience for our clients are either back to where they were prior to our retention issues or in some cases, better. And so we feel confident that even if there's some kind of lag in the sense that some clients may have already been in process due to a poor service experience at looking at alternatives and the fact that there are other parts of ADP that have variability in retention as well, I think notwithstanding all those things, I think my confidence in the improvements in service stability and service experience in the mid-market remained quite high actually."

So hence, the candy variability in the quarterly shifts of the retention numbers, in this case, it impacted a relatively low loss volume that we typically experience in the fourth quarter. So my general council would be to observe those retention changes that we report, but not to get overly analytical and mathematical quarter-by-quarter. It is a better indicator to think about basically our retention number of 100 basis points decline. So the fiscal year, because we're aiming to be better. We don't guide to retention. But as you might imagine as a company, we clearly have aspirations to improve."

So as a consequence, approximately 5% of our employee population is going to be transferring or moving or at work, we'll be moving and impacting about 5% of our associate population in this fiscal year. And there are costs that are related to this, which we are non-GAAP-ing, which are related in essence to employee cost to facilitate the transfer of the work. That is basically included in the 20 basis points of our guidance. And we clearly hope that the outcome of this service alignment initiative is multi-folded. I believe strongly it will enhance our service value proposition because we're going to have larger centers with bigger capabilities, leveraging ADP's strength in compliance and service and offering a better value proposition to our clients, which is the most exciting part for the service alignment initiative, hopefully resulting in better competitiveness and high retention rates. And also as you can see, these centers are located in geographies of the U.S. that offer certain advantages relative to the cost that where they operate. So there should be, in the longer run, also contribution to our margins. We're a little bit hesitant to specify this for '18 because the initiative will actually bleed over into fiscal year of '18. We mentioned, in particular, center in the west is going to come on later in '17 and will bleed over '18. So in '18 will still have some impact, but we are clearly hoping that it will guarantee basically that we can fulfill our commitment to the 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion in the long run.

It's partly driven by the fact that the industry has evolved, and I think the client’s needs have evolved and the products have evolved, too.

Our platforms now are single-database integrated solutions that provide an HCM solution if the way -- if a client wants to buy it that way in a comprehensive and seamless way. The service model had not moved in the same direction, and I think that this initiative is really intended to have our service implementation really aligned with the way the market is going, the way buyers are buying and the way clients want to be serviced.

We have a very solid balance sheet, we have the capital to invest in the industry and we continue to evaluate opportunities. But we evaluate M&A opportunities in light of our strategic priorities, which is -- which are focused, at this point in time, on reduction on complexity and aligning and focus on our client needs. So any acquisitions that support that drive, we will actively and aggressively pursue. But it has played out over the last 3 years to a more organic growth pattern that has seen great results. And so I think that stand stays the same. I would not expect any dramatic shift in our attitude towards M&A from what you have seen in the last 3 years. And relative to divestitures and adjusting the portfolio, I think the large portfolio alignment initiatives have happened with the spin-off of CDK, and I think our larger -- last large divestiture was vast empty. There will be here and there smaller type of things as we continually to evaluate the performance of our product portfolio. And if we see opportunities to enhance shareholder value, we will pursue it as we have done so in the past. But it's really an essence. I would anticipate fiscal year '17 to run under the same guidepost as in the last 3 years."

And I would just add that, back to the discussion about capital and -- or the seriousness in which we take capital deployment, we do have a strong balance sheet. So we have capital that we can deploy. But as Jan said, conceptually, it's something really fit into our technology roadmap and accelerated our progress. We'd use our capital, but we're not going to use our capital to have something that, for lack of a better term, fits next to everything else that we have. So it has to be able to be integrated rapidly and seamlessly into what we already are pursuing in terms of our product strategy. It's a little bit of a departure from, call it, 6, 7 years ago when it was really more about leveraging our distribution and adding capabilities and products without as much necessarily regard to how they fit tightly into the technology road map. And that's really nothing so much a change in strategy. It's a change in the market in the way people want to buy and the way products behave, which makes it very, very important to have tight alignment and seamlessness in your products. And then the last, just actual comment I'll make to Jan's point, is because we have capital, if something accelerated our progress, we would do it no different than we're doing some of these internal organic things that we're investing in to accelerate our progress. So if there's an external opportunity to use or capital, we would. But the fact is that, over the last couple of years, when you look at the balance of capital deployment, Jan and I have this discussion all the time, we haven't consciously avoided doing acquisitions. It's just been hard to find one that makes sense and fit in what we're doing in terms of our strategy. But net-net, when you get down to it, we're spending, call it $300 million to $400 million less on acquisitions, and we're spending more on things like internally developed products, capital expenditures and the investments that we're talking about for fiscal year '17. So it wasn't necessarily planned that way, but it just so happens that we're not necessarily deploying any more capital, but we're just deploying it in a slightly different way. But we do retain the right to deploy capital towards acquisitions as well."

We'll give you a little bit of color, then maybe Jan can add in terms of what he's hearing out in the field. So it's interesting the term dedicated reps because we do have parts of our business obviously in the upmarket and national accounts will have very specific people that service specific clients. And then when you get into the Small Business market, we tend to have a model where the execution and the delivery is very important, but the person that you reach isn't as important. We believe that's the right model. We believe our retention rates and our growth in the Small Business market prove that our model works as long as you execute well. And we would also argue that, in today's world, having a dedicated rep who works for 8 hours a day might not be the best service model for a small company or any other company. So we prefer to focus on how and what's the best way to deliver the best service to the client in the way they want it delivered. And it varies from Small Business up to the upmarket in terms of whether you need a dedicated person or not. But I would encourage you to kind of visualize the service realignment as being more around teams rather than dedicated people. So having alignment around teams. So as an example, given the attach rates that we've discussed over multiple quarters that we're experiencing now in the mid-market and in the upmarket around additional HCM modules, in other words, clients are rarely buying just payroll by itself or just benefits administration by itself. So this service model really is intended to be able to provide a group of people or a team of people who work together who are co-located and can deliver service across the entire HCM spectrum. That obviously requires some cross-training, but also some ability for people who have special skills to be available and close to people who need to support our clients on a multiple number of issues. So we have reasonable amount of experience in experimenting with what we call intact teams or with co-located teams. And we feel pretty good about the results when it comes to retention, when it comes to client satisfaction. And by the way, in our business, when you have those 2 things, margin follows. So this is primarily led by quality and experience for the client and also, by the way, opportunity for our associates. So what we have found also is in some of our subscale locations has very, very limited mobility and opportunity for associates to progress from a career standpoint. And we now have a number of opportunities across our business for people to learn new things and to move in a different areas, whether it's time and attendance and payroll, benefits administration, talent management, we really run the whole gamut on HCM, and we have needs across the entire business. And when we have people scattered across the entire country in small subscale locations, it just doesn't, I think, make sense from a talent management standpoint for ourselves internally either. And so on all those fronts, we think that this service alignment strategy makes sense."

We have seen a rise in our associate engagement scores as a consequence for those who work in those intact teams, and it reflects probably better of how in a modern team environment our associates want to work. So that's really exciting for our associates as well. And I have one additional component that is strategic move on locations allows you to plan for is also a coordinated effort between our market segments, small, medium and large. So I think we mentioned it in the call. So now we have co-location between those market segments and can be natural growth and exchange our best practices between the different platforms. And for some of the platforms, the back end is fairly similar. If you think about centers of excellence for our tax filing operation and so forth, so it allows us also to create buckets of scale that are very hard to create in smaller locations. So it really, I believe, will transform of how our associates be perceiving, A, the value of the job they're in and the job opportunities that they can reach in the future and allows us to deliver additional service capabilities to our clients, which is the strategic benefit that's leaping out of it."

And just as a reminder, it is -- it was $1.75 billion of recurring revenue that sales force generated for ADP.

So why don't -- you've always said the current year bookings don't do a lot to revenue. Why wouldn't we see some acceleration? Is it as simple as PEO, you're calling for that to be slower?

Again, even though we don't get specific guidance, we do expect less of a drag, for example, from retention because we expect things to get better. We have some metrics and some things underlying, I think, data that gives us hope at least, right, because don't know for sure that, that will improve your math, the comments you made about new business bookings. So all those things are correct. I think I would just encourage you to maybe spend some time off-line with us in terms of kind of the math and how the revenue works. One of the interesting things about this business, this is an incredibly stable and predictable business model. It's also very, very hard to move the numbers dramatically one way or the other over the course of 1 year. So over the course of 4, 5 years, we had double-digit new business bookings. And this year, we had a blip with retention, but retention has also been fairly stable. That's allowed us to accelerate our revenue growth by about 0.5 to 1 percentage point from, call it, 5 years ago in Employer Services. The PEO, as you said, also happens to be a factor because it's growing faster and it's becoming a larger portion of the overall results. So if it slows slightly, that has an impact, too. So we'll spend the time to make sure that we do the math. But what I can tell you is that you're right that, this year, if you exclude the impact of the divestiture or if you don't factor the divestiture in, we were close to 9% revenue growth. We're really proud of that. And next year, we're slightly below that because there's 1 day less because this year was a leap year or whatever the issues are. And we have a little bit of a drag still from -- even the retention is getting better, it's still not a good as it used to be. We're still going to be pretty damn happy and pretty damn proud because we're going to be in, I think, still in the high end of our guidance from a revenue standpoint. And in this business, when you get into that range, given who we are in terms of -- because we understand have a very keen insight into who we are like as a company in terms of where we want to be in terms of our growth rates and our margin improvement and the balance of those things, I think we're satisfied with that outcome. It obviously makes it easier as you pick up additional revenue growth because of the nice leverage ability of our operating model, but we're -- that's part of why we're also doing some of the things we're doing around service limit because we know that we're really not, I think, satisfied with just the results that we have today. On the other hand, we're not going to sit here and tell you that we're trying to aim for 10%, 12%, 15% revenue growth. That's really not who we are. So 7% to 9% is our long-term guidance for revenue growth with some margin improvement, with a healthy dividend. We share buybacks, that's our model, that's what we're executing against. And I'm proud of the organization and the results they've delivered this year. And I think if we deliver the results that we put out there for next year, we're going to be just as proud of that as well."

Thank you for joining us for our first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call and webcast. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.
I also want to highlight for you that the quarterly history of revenue and pretax earnings for our reportable segments is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website. These schedules have been updated to include the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and have been adjusted to align with recent changes in our segment reporting to align our financial reporting with how management now views the business. Most notably, effective this quarter, we are now allocating stock-based compensation to the segments and have made some changes to the allocation methodology for certain corporate-level allocations. Accordingly, prior periods presented have been restated, and our segment guidance reflects the impact of these changes.
Before Carlos begins, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.

We appreciate your interest in ADP.
This morning, we reported our first quarter fiscal 2017 results with revenue up 7% to $2.9 billion despite 1 percentage point of combined pressure from foreign currency translation and the impact of the sale of the AdvancedMD business at the end of our fiscal 2016 first quarter. We are pleased with this revenue growth, which was in line with our expectations, and we continue to see the benefits from our recent new business bookings helping to drive growth in the quarter. In addition to this solid revenue growth, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 26% to $0.86 per share. Overall, our earnings growth exceeded our expectations this quarter, and we are very pleased with our results. There were a number of contributing factors to our strong earnings performance. John will walk through this shortly.
On the new business bookings front, during the quarter, we were flat compared to the first quarter of 2016, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to forecast 4% to 6% bookings growth for the year. I want to remind you of the tailwinds we experienced in fiscal 2016 from the sale of additional modules related to the Affordable Care Act. Our anticipated fiscal 2017 performance, if achieved, would lead to a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of 9%, which remains in line with our long-term new business bookings guidance of 8% to 10%.
Overall, our revenue growth was solid this quarter. And while we do not expect all of the margin expansion we saw this quarter to continue through the remainder of the year, we are pleased with our overall results.
Before I continue, I wanted to share a little more insight regarding retention. During the quarter, we experienced a decline in retention of 100 basis points, which was due to the loss of a contract pertaining to our CHSA business, which we announced today, has been sold to WageWorks. Excluding the impact of this single-client loss, retention would've been flat in the quarter. We continue to see the benefits of our efforts to upgrade clients to the most appropriate strategic cloud-based platforms. These upgrade efforts remain on track and progressed nicely during the quarter.
As I just mentioned, today we announced that WageWorks was acquiring 2 nonstrategic ADP businesses, namely our CHSA and COBRA businesses, for $235 million. In selling to a top-tier provider in these markets, we believe this agreement will truly unlock the potential of these businesses while allowing us to sharpen our focus on ADP's core benefits administration offering.
In conjunction with these dispositions, ADP entered into a partnership with WageWorks that will allow us to continue offering their COBRA and CHSA solutions to ADP clients in an integrated fashion. This is a great example of ADP continuing to build an ecosystem of complementary services that allow clients to extend the value of their core ADP Human Capital Management solutions.
Last quarter, we shared details of our service alignment initiative, which is part of our strategy to simplify the service organization by aligning ADP's service operations to our strategic platforms. In addition to improving the client service experience, this initiative is expected to enhance ADP's service capabilities and contribute to operating efficiencies over the long term. We are pleased with the progress we are making at our new strategic locations in Macon, Florida; and Norfolk, Virginia. Efforts to staff and operate from these locations have commenced and are proceeding according to plan. We will soon announce the location of our third new site in the western part of the U.S., which we anticipate being operational toward the latter part of this fiscal year.
Our results this quarter reflect the strength of our business model and give us momentum as we stay focused on delivering an outstanding client experience through a great -- through great service and innovative solutions, many of which are exceeding a wealth of external recognition.
Recently, we shared that ADP was named a leader in payroll business process outsourcing by Gartner for the fifth consecutive year. Gartner's study analyzed vendors across all regions, employer sizes and service delivery models, evaluating both their ability to execute and completeness of vision. In naming ADP a leader, Gartner recognized us for combining a clear view of the market's direction and a deep understanding of client needs with the capabilities and expertise to deliver against them. Payroll outsourcing is core to who we are and is part of delivering outstanding HCM solutions. We are extremely proud of the sustained recognition for our leadership in this area.
Today, ADP is delivering HCM solutions to more than 650,000 clients and 39 million employees worldwide. These data points are important for a number of reasons. They clearly demonstrate our unique reach and marketplace success over a sustained period of time, but they also represent a unique differentiator for ADP. The scale and the data that this client base represents allows us to deliver a suite of new capabilities that we believe hold the potential to transform the strategic value of the HR function. Because we pay 1 and 6 quarters [ph] in the U.S., we are in a unique -- in the unique position to deliver advanced analytics capabilities that can help clients to address workforce productivity, talent development and retention. Leveraging this data, we introduced the ADP data cloud to allow business leaders and HR professionals to generate actionable insights from the workforce data embedded in their ADP HCM solutions. And today, more than 3,200 clients are using our analytics platform.
About 1 year ago, we introduced benchmarking to this platform. The benchmarking capability provides users with a unique competitive advantage by delivering insight from actual live data to help clients evaluate their workforce against other companies in their market space. Our benchmarking capability puts key industry workforce metrics at our clients' fingertips, avoiding the inherent time lag or inaccuracy associated with salary and other types of survey-based data. A few weeks ago, at the HR Technology Conference in Chicago, we received 2 distinctive recognitions for our data cloud benchmarking capability. At the show, HR Executive magazine named us one of its top products for 2016 and recognized it as one of the year's awesome new technologies for HR. I should note, this is the second year in a row that we've received these distinguished awards. We received them both last year for the ADP Marketplace, the first and largest ATM app ecosystem in the market.
I said before that innovation is a job that's never done, but we are proud of the progress to date and the external recognition we are receiving. We believe that innovations like these and the investments we are making to simplify our portfolio are essential to our long-term success.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for a further review of our first quarter results."

During the quarter, we recorded a restructuring charge of about $40 million related to our service alignment initiative. Certain non-GAAP measures in my commentary to follow exclude the impact of this charge as well as certain other onetime items recognized in the prior fiscal year. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.
Before I begin reviewing this quarter's results, I wanted to highlight some additional detail regarding the disposition of our COBRA and CHSA businesses. We currently expect the sale to be completed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 for a pretax gain of approximately $200 million, subject to normal and customary closing conditions. The results of operations of these 2 businesses are currently included in the Employer Services segment and will not be reflected as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, we have factored the operational impacts from these dispositions into our updated fiscal year 2017 outflow.
As Carlos mentioned, ADP revenues grew 7% in the quarter to $2.9 billion or 8% on a constant dollar basis. On a reported basis, net earnings grew 10% or 9% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, grew 21% or 20% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBIT margin increased about 230 basis points compared to the 17.6% in the last year's first quarter. This increase was driven by operational efficiencies and a slower growth in our selling expenses. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 26% to $0.86 and 26% on a constant dollar basis and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago.
Our adjusted effective tax rate was positively impacted following the adoption of a new stock compensation-related accounting pronouncement in our first quarter, which helped drive a decrease of our adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 290 basis points to 30.8% or 3% on an EPS -- $0.03, I apologize, $0.03 on an EPS basis for the quarter.
As you read this morning's press release, new business bookings growth was flat for the quarter but in line with our own expectations, following 2 years of excesses, double-digit growth and with meaningful contribution from human capital management modules that assist clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act.
Overall, our results in the quarter were very good, yielding solid revenue growth with the better-than-expected margin growth. Although we still have a lot of work ahead of us, I'm also pleased with the progress to date on our service alignment initiative.
Now our Employee Services segment. Revenues grew 6% for the quarter and 6% on a constant dollar basis. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.7% in the first quarter. Average client fund balances grew 4% compared to a year ago and 4% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions of net new business and increased wage levels compared to the prior year's first quarter. Outside the U.S., we continue to see solid revenue growth and margin growth, driven largely by the success of our multinational solutions, which continued to perform well. 
Employee Services margin increased about 230 basis points in the quarter. This increase was driven by operational efficiencies and a slower growth in our selling expenses, following on from the difficult selling compare in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016.
The PEO continues to perform well, growing revenues by 13% in the quarter, with average worksite employees growing 13% to 439,000 employees. A portion of the 13% revenue growth was impacted by slower growth in our benefit pass-through costs resulting from lower health care renewal premiums, which outweighed growth from higher benefit plan participation from our worksite employees during the quarter. Along with this revenue growth, the PEO delivered approximately 90 basis points of margin expansion this quarter through increased operating efficiencies.
Both of our segments performed well in the quarter. And as Carlos mentioned, we are off to a good start, but we also see a mix of factors that impact our fiscal year 2017 outlook. And I will now take the moment to walk you through our revised outlook with you.
First, as I mentioned, our new business bookings growth in the quarter was in line with our plans, coming off a difficult compare in the first -- prior year first quarter. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of 4% to 6% growth on the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal year 2016. We are reaffirming our ES revenue guidance of 4% to 5% and our remaining -- and maintaining our PEO revenue guidance at 16% -- 14% to 16%. With the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, which were included for the full fiscal year 2016 but expected to be owning our results for about the first half of fiscal year 2017, we have reduced our revenue expectations for the year by almost 1 percentage point. As a result, we are now forecasting revenue growth of 7% to 8% compared with our prior forecast of 7% to 9%, which is not expected to be significantly impacted by foreign currency translation based on our current rates.
As a reminder, during the first fiscal year -- the first half of fiscal 2016, we made certain investments to support our business through the ACA onboarding process by also continuing to invest in our sales force to leverage the strong tailwinds from the sales of human capital management modules that assist clients in complying with the ACA. And we have seen the benefits of these investments help drive our margin expansion this quarter. I want to caution you, though, against [ph] assuming that this momentum will carry through the remainder of our fiscal year as we begin to lap these easier compares while continuing to execute on various strategic initiatives, including our client upgrade efforts, investing in innovation and making selected additional service investments.
On a segment level, we therefore continue to anticipate margin expansion in ES of about 50 basis points, and we are now forecasting about 70 basis -- 75 basis points of margin expansion in the PEO.
On a consolidated basis, we have revised our adjusted EBIT margin expansion to about 50 basis points from our previous guidance of 25 to 50 basis points. Please also note that this margin expansion continues to include about 20 basis points of pressure from a dual operation pertaining to our service alignment initiative.
We are also now expecting growth in our client fund interest revenue to increase $5 million to $10 million compared with our prior forecast of increase of up to $5 million. The total impact from the client fund extended investments strategy is now expected to be up $5 million compared to the prior forecast of flat growth. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.
With the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, we now expect growth in our adjusted diluted earnings per share of 11% to 13% compared with the $3.26 in fiscal year 2016, aided by about 1% from the first quarter tax benefit related to the stock-based compensation accounting change, which is offset by about 1 percentage points of earnings impact from the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses. On a constant dollar basis, our adjusted diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be 11% to 13%. 
Our forecast continues to contemplate the return of excess cash to shareholders, we have share repurchases of $1 billion to $1.4 billion during fiscal year 2017. And this includes any repurchases required to offset any dilution related to employee benefit plans.
We believe the adjustments we have made to our fiscal year 2017 forecast reflect the impact of our planned investment, particular through the year-end process as we work to grow our strong fiscal year 2016 sales performance and execute against our strategic initiatives.
So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions."

So some of the things that we traditionally have been strong on in service, I think, still are a key part of our value proposition. So as an example, we have a very effective, very value-added tax business that helps clients with compliance should they get notices from either federal, state or local agencies regarding tax payments. And so those are the types of services that I think we remain committed to continuing to provide but also to make better and enhance. But obviously, with the evolution of technology and the evolution of the markets, I think there are opportunities for us to redefine service. And I think some of the service alignment initiative, I think, is intended to go exactly in that direction. So another example I would give is given the increased penetration of multiple HCM modules when clients purchase our products, particularly in the mid-market or in the upmarket, I think the integration of not only our products but of our service experience becomes very important. And so you heard us talk about creating intact teams in some of these new strategic locations that I think is intended to support this evolution of this new service approach, a new service model."

So that's a -- I think you have that right. Probably 40%, I would allocate it just for sake of modeling to 40-60. So 40% maybe first half, 60% second half, but overall, 20 basis points for the year. And again, as Jan pointed out, just because of the way the accounting rules work, that is built into our operating expense versus the restructuring costs that were really more intended for things like severance and facilities closure that were directly related to the restructuring and that our non-GAAP."

As we were going through the materials for the earnings call, we get a lot of detail by market segment and also by product. And we have seen better sales and more interest in our time and attendance product. I think that the challenge for us is scale. Given the size of our sales number, we sold $1.75 billion last year. We're expecting to grow 4% to 6% this year. It just doesn't have the same scale and magnitude of, as an example, ACA. So for us to really achieve our sales results, we have to have across-the-board strength in our sales, excluding ACA and excluding our time and attendance product. So I guess the long and short of it is, yes, it helped, but it wasn't material in the grand scheme of things. And the deadline is approaching. So it's likely that will continue like a lot of these changes in regulations and complexity, no different than ACA. We expected to continue to help with sales and help drive demand for our products even after the deadline, which I believe is in December of this year. But it just doesn't feel like it's having the same magnitude and same kind of scale impact that we had with ACA. And part of that might be that the ACA rules were really deadline-driven. And there was a form that needed to be filled out and filed. In this case, these are just changes in rules, and so it's a slightly different decision for clients and prospects around -- in some cases, if they go 6 months without the right tools to be able to manage the new environment, there's really no consequences other than the risk of a potential investigation or a fine or whatnot, which is obviously a real risk. But it's just different from a deadline-driven event like ACA."

But in Q1 of '14, we had 1% sales growth, and that was following on Q1 of '13, 15% growth. And so this -- the scenario this quarter was we have flat growth over last year's first quarter of around 14% sales growth. And so I think that when you look at kind of just the size and the scale of these numbers and you look at the way we laid out our forecast for the year, then I think that you can probably deduce that the second half we expect mathematically to be stronger from a growth rate standpoint than the first half. And I also just want to ace [ph] and add that we have the same kind of issue in the second quarter where we had sequential increase last year's second quarter, the 15%. So we had -- I think it was 13% to 14% growth in the first quarter, and then we had 15% in the second quarter. So we will have another difficult compare.

So the businesses that we said [ph] some challenges with last year, which I think we were clear that was concentrated in the mid-market, have shown, I think, improvement for several quarters, including this quarter. But as you know, like -- or we have a number of different businesses. We're a global company. We have downmarket, mid-market, upmarket, multinational. Some of our businesses are also lumpy, particularly our upmarket businesses and our BPO businesses. And so we feel good about the progress we've made where we made the investments to stabilize and the investments we made in service. As you know, we're making some longer-term investments in terms of some of these new locations. But that's a longer-term -- we did a lot of short-term things to stabilize and improve. And we've seen results from that. But again, sometimes, retention can be uneven just because of the lumpiness, it's just the math works. But we feel pretty good about where we are. We believe that we are on a good trajectory here in terms of continuing to do migrations and upgrades, which allows us to stay on track for what our objectives are without putting additional incremental pressure on retention. So the fact that we've gone back to -- this is now probably the second quarter where we've gone back and started our upgrades at a, I would call, normal reasonable pace. And we've been able to continue to make improvements in our midmarket retention rates. So that tells me that part of the issue was related to the upgrades themselves. But it was also related to just the service challenges, pressure from ACA just because of volumes of work and a couple of other factors. We believe the offender right things and we feel like we're on the right track, and we're also sticking to our plans around over Mac rations and our upgrades of our client. Because I think it's is competitively over the long-term."

And clearly, we had great margin expansion this first quarter. But we are trying to send a signal that, that might not continuing throughout the year and the pass-through might actually play a big role. So we had -- stature your first question directly, the operational scale that we saw in the PEO was solid, with 90 basis points. Clearly, that's ahead of our long-term kind of expectation. So we do see I want to make progress in the and efficiencies but was probably a very good quarter for them I would caution you to anticipate that type of level of productivity improvement in the long run. But clearly, all our business to deliver scale sticking with our own long-term expectations of driving the margin in the company of 50 to 75 basis points. Now relative to the performance in this quarter, you will be able to dissect this once you go through the QR diluted more detail. But the pass-through pressure that we had this year because that PO was growing actually faster than the overall company, was actually depressing ADP's margin by about 85 basis points. Now the pass-through pressure is typically actually higher. And if you calculated as between 150 and 20 basis points of pressure, we call this as a portfolio effect. The lower margin business of PO is growing faster than ES. And this quarter, we were helped because the typical higher margin pressure that the pass-through gave abated due to that good renewal. That renewal we expected to grow out of it by the second half of the year. So that is going to be a big contributor to slower margin expenses for the second half of the year. You will also see that -- and we mentioned it in our call that we had planned sales growth and long-standing that sales are growing slower, our marketing and sales expenses is growing slower. So that contributed to the chunk of scale that we anticipate clearly per Carlos' discussion in the a prior question to abate as we accelerate our sales in the second half of the year. And then the scaling of our ACA business plays an important role. Clearly, you are all aware that the revenue stream started really in the second half of the ACA business. While in the first half of last fiscal year '16, we made implementation and operational investments to build a business. So we started to see the revenue contribution kick in. And the pressure -- the building of the ACA business exceeded in the business in the first half of last fiscal year has abated. We are reaping the revenue and the business is profitable. And so the scaling of the ACA business also had a meaningful impact on the margin expansion this quarter. And clearly, we expect that actually to abate also in the second half of the year because the business started to generate revenue in the second half of last fiscal year."

I don't remember the last time that our PEO worksite employee growth was the same as our revenue growth. And so that obviously very first point that Jan made. I think that helps obviously mathematically, make it easier for the PEO greater margin improvement where they have slower pass-through cost growth. We generally see that as having been that business for many years that slower pass-through growth is related to lower health care benefit renewals, which is, should be a very big positive from a competitive standpoint. So you're hearing a lot of headlines about increasing health inflation and the discipline that our business has around selling and renewing clients, I think has as of this last open enrollment for the PEO, led to very, very competitive renewal rates that are having this impact on the revenue growth. But it's a very, very big positive effect for that business."

And they won it -- it was one of the factors in our decision to sell the business of them because we got to know each other as a result of them winning that contract, which is a government contract from the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, which is a government entity. As you know, we don't have a lot of public sector government business. We have some, and we like that business but we just don't have a lot of it. It was really don't have a lot of contracts of that size in that scale with or without the government. And so the original of that account was it came through an acquisition of a company called shifts that we acquired several years back, where we acquired other benefits administration assets that we were interested in. And this account came with it. And with it came the risk of when these contracts get put out to bid, you don't always win. And so we took a calculated risk when we made that acquisition. Not just with this account but like with all the acquisitions and that was one of the items that came along with that acquisition. But it was also an account that I can't remember how many months ago that it was, but I believe there was a public release by WageWorks regarding the winning of that account. And I think some people speculated that it come from us, and we can now confirm that it did come from us."

We have done a historic analysis of our performance under this, so to speak, a pro forma backwards. And historically, we have experienced benefit out of those accounting rules.

But there's obviously always -- you have to manage through that kind of transition risk as well. To be clear, this is not -- we're not moving 90% of our associates. We're moving -- I think we're between 5% and 10% of our associates. So, we expect that to have the kind of positive impacts were talking about in terms of incremental revenue growth, improved service, et cetera. But this is not a onetime overnight dramatic move that has intended to create an enormous amount of fiscal or friendly disruption for our associates. Because we had a long history of treating our people right. We have highly associates that have been very loyal to the company And so we've been very, very careful when I would do this and I would communicate to our associates so that we can move him in our business plans but also treat people right way. But having said all that, the idea, as we said, I think previously, is the most importantly, deliver better integrated service through intact teams of multiple modules of ATM. And so the intention would be that there would be a benefit for retention. We don't have a scientific way of forecasting that. We're telling you when that'll happen and it's certainly not expect that to happen this year because were just in the process of getting these places all wrapped up in scale. And obviously, the effect of having better service, a better reputation and  being able to cross easily should have some impact on our ability to sell and our revenue growth as well. But again, those are hypothetical and very hard to forecast and we're certainly not building anything into our forecast for this year. But we're not doing it just to take risk.

But if you look at our sales results and take a general swag at -- if you took out -- if you could somehow back out the ACA sales from last year, we had, I would say, good sales results for the quarter. So I would say that through the first quarter, the answer would be -- we didn't see a lot of that. But I think you should be -- you should not hear in my comments and a level of confidence that there isn't that happening because large events like we saw with the 2011 and 2013 are a couple of budget battles and a couple of issues around government shutdowns. So we did seem that there were some kind of delays in terms of decision-making and a market place. But back then and today, we have no way of measuring that other than anecdotal stores."

In terms we have a lot more experience obviously now in migrating clients. In particular, the experience we developed last year when our volumes upbraided, stumble when we're trying to move clients over to the new platform in order to be able to give them the ACA product. That really created an enormous amount of learning opportunity for us in terms of how to do it better and how to do it at scale and what not to do around these upgrades. Because they're intended to be positive and create a better experience and deliver better products to declines. And so I think on one side, of the scale, you would say huge, we have an enormous amount of body of knowledge now and how to do this better. On the other side of the scale, human Nader nature is such that no one constantly does this then when you go through the stacks of event, you realize, oh, that looks like we have the toughest ones waiting towards the end because there might be clients. For example, when we approach and ask them to upgrade and say I do want to do with now, call me in 1 quarter. And we're getting to a point now that we're going to have to migrate them or upgrade them. And so we probably have some of that as well. So I do think there's an enormous amount of that. It's not like we only have the hard ones left in the wasn't didn't want to go. So just being realistic in the sense that and also to our associates are still have all the hard work the next 3 quarters or so because it's not going to be easy to getting across the finish line that are volumes no in a more manageable level where I think redoing a much higher-quality job.

Thank you for joining us for our first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call and webcast. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.
I also want to highlight for you that the quarterly history of revenue and pretax earnings for our reportable segments is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website. These schedules have been updated to include the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and have been adjusted to align with recent changes in our segment reporting to align our financial reporting with how management now views the business. Most notably, effective this quarter, we are now allocating stock-based compensation to the segments and have made some changes to the allocation methodology for certain corporate-level allocations. Accordingly, prior periods presented have been restated, and our segment guidance reflects the impact of these changes.
Before Carlos begins, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.
Now let me turn the call over to Carlos."

We appreciate your interest in ADP.
This morning, we reported our first quarter fiscal 2017 results, with revenue up 7% to $2.9 billion despite 1 percentage point of combined pressure from foreign currency translation and the impact of the sale of the AdvancedMD business at the end of our fiscal 2016 first quarter. We are pleased with this revenue growth, which was in line with our expectations, and we continue to see the benefits from our recent new business bookings helping to drive growth in the quarter.
In addition to this solid revenue growth, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 26% to $0.86 per share. Overall, our earnings growth exceeded our expectations this quarter, and we are very pleased with our results. There were a number of contributing factors to our strong earnings performance. Jan will walk through these shortly.
On the new business bookings front, during the quarter, we were flat compared to the first quarter of 2016, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to forecast 4% to 6% bookings growth for the year. I want to remind you of the tailwinds we experienced in fiscal 2016 from the sale of additional modules related to the Affordable Care Act. Our anticipated fiscal 2017 performance, if achieved, would lead to a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of 9%, which remains in line with our long-term new business bookings guidance of 8% to 10%.
Overall, our revenue growth was solid this quarter. And while we do not expect all of the margin expansion we saw this quarter to continue through the remainder of the year, we are pleased with our overall results.
Before I continue, I wanted to share a little more insight regarding retention. During the quarter, we experienced a decline in retention of 100 basis points, which was due to the loss of a contract pertaining to our CHSA business, which we announced today has been sold to WageWorks. Excluding the impact of this single client loss, retention would've been flat in the quarter.
We continue to see the benefits of our efforts to upgrade clients to the most appropriate strategic cloud-based platforms. These upgrade efforts remain on track and progressed nicely during the quarter. As I just mentioned, today we announced that WageWorks was acquiring 2 nonstrategic ADP businesses, namely our CHSA and COBRA businesses, for $235 million. In selling to a top-tier provider in these markets, we believe this agreement will truly unlock the potential of these businesses while allowing us to sharpen our focus on ADP's core benefits administration offering.
In conjunction with these dispositions, ADP entered into a partnership with WageWorks that will allow us to continue offering their COBRA and CHSA solutions to ADP clients in an integrated fashion. This is a great example of ADP continuing to build an ecosystem of complementary services that allow clients to extend the value of their core ADP Human Capital Management solutions.
Last quarter, we shared details of our service alignment initiative, which is part of our strategy to simplify the service organization by aligning ADP's service operations to our strategic platforms. In addition to improving the client service experience, this initiative is expected to enhance ADP's service capabilities and contribute to operating efficiencies over the long term.
We are pleased with the progress we are making at our new strategic locations in Maitland, Florida; and Norfolk, Virginia. Efforts to staff and operate from these locations have commenced and are proceeding according to plan. We will soon announce the location of our third new site in the western part of the U.S., which we anticipate being operational toward the latter part of this fiscal year.
Our results this quarter reflect the strength of our business model and give us momentum as we stay focused on delivering an outstanding client experience through a great -- through great service and innovative solutions, many of which are exceeding a wealth of external recognition.
Recently, we shared that ADP was named a leader in payroll business process outsourcing by Gartner for the fifth consecutive year. Gartner's study analyzed vendors across all regions, employer sizes and service delivery models, evaluating both their ability to execute and completeness of vision. In naming ADP a leader, Gartner recognized us for combining a clear view of the market's direction and a deep understanding of client needs with the capabilities and expertise to deliver against them. Payroll outsourcing is core to who we are and is part of delivering outstanding HCM solutions. We are extremely proud of the sustained recognition for our leadership in this area.
Today, ADP is delivering HCM solutions to more than 650,000 clients and 39 million employees worldwide. These data points are important for a number of reasons. They clearly demonstrate our unique reach and marketplace success over a sustained period of time, but they also represent a unique differentiator for ADP. The scale and the data that this client base represents allows us to deliver a suite of new capabilities that we believe hold the potential to transform the strategic value of the HR function. Because we pay 1 in 6 quarters [ph] in the U.S., we are in a unique -- in the unique position to deliver advanced analytics capabilities that can help clients address workforce productivity, talent development and retention. Leveraging this data, we introduced the ADP data cloud to allow business leaders and HR professionals to generate actionable insights from the workforce data embedded in their ADP HCM solutions. And today, more than 3,200 clients are using our analytics platform.
About a year ago, we introduced benchmarking to this platform. The benchmarking capability provides users with a unique competitive advantage by delivering insight from actual live data to help clients evaluate their workforce against other companies in their market space. Our benchmarking capability puts key industry workforce metrics at our clients' fingertips, avoiding the inherent time lag or inaccuracy associated with salary and other types of survey-based data. A few weeks ago, at the HR Technology Conference in Chicago, we received 2 distinctive recognitions for our data cloud benchmarking capability. At the show, HR Executive magazine named us one of its top products for 2016 and recognized it as one of the year's awesome new technologies for HR. I should note, this is the second year in a row that we've received these distinguished awards. We received them both last year for the ADP Marketplace, the first and largest ATM app ecosystem in the market.
I said before that innovation is a job that's never done, but we are proud of the progress to date and the external recognition we are receiving. We believe that innovations like these and the investments we are making to simplify our portfolio are essential to our long-term success.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for a further review of our first quarter results."
126269,401973578,1070053,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone.During the quarter, we recorded a restructuring charge of about $40 million related to our service alignment initiative.

During the quarter, we recorded a restructuring charge of about $40 million related to our service alignment initiative. Certain non-GAAP measures in my commentary to follow exclude the impact of this charge as well as certain other onetime items recognized in the prior fiscal year. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.
Before I begin reviewing this quarter's results, I wanted to highlight some additional detail regarding the disposition of our COBRA and CHSA businesses. We currently expect the sale to be completed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 for a pretax gain of approximately $200 million, subject to normal and customary closing conditions. The results of operations of these 2 businesses are currently included in the Employer Services segment and will not be reflected as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, we have factored the operational impacts from these dispositions into our updated fiscal year 2017 outlook.
As Carlos mentioned, ADP revenues grew 7% in the quarter to $2.9 billion or 8% on a constant dollar basis. On a reported basis, net earnings grew 10% or 9% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, grew 21% or 20% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBIT margin increased about 230 basis points compared to the 17.6% in the last year's first quarter. This increase was driven by operational efficiencies and a slower growth in our selling expenses. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 26% to $0.86 and 26% on a constant dollar basis and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago.
Our adjusted effective tax rate was positively impacted following the adoption of a new stock compensation-related accounting pronouncement in our first quarter, which helped drive a decrease of our adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 290 basis points to 30.8% or 3% on an EPS -- $0.03, I apologize, $0.03 on an EPS basis for the quarter.
As you read this morning's press release, new business bookings growth was flat for the quarter but in line with our own expectations, following 2 years of successes, double-digit growth and with meaningful contribution from human capital management modules that assist clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act.
Overall, our results in the quarter were very good, yielding solid revenue growth with the better-than-expected margin growth. Although we still have a lot of work ahead of us, I'm also pleased with the progress to date on our service alignment initiative.
Now our Employee Services segment. Revenues grew 6% for the quarter and 6% on a constant dollar basis. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.7% in the first quarter. Average client fund balances grew 4% compared to a year ago and 4% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions of net new business and increased wage levels compared to the prior year's first quarter. Outside the U.S., we continue to see solid revenue growth and margin growth, driven largely by the success of our multinational solutions, which continued to perform well. 
Employee Services margin increased about 230 basis points in the quarter. This increase was driven by operational efficiencies and a slower growth in our selling expenses, following on from the difficult selling compare in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016.
The PEO continues to perform well, growing revenues by 13% in the quarter, with average worksite employees growing 13% to 439,000 employees. A portion of the 13% revenue growth was impacted by slower growth in our benefit pass-through costs resulting from lower health care renewal premiums, which outweighed growth from higher benefit plan participation from our worksite employees during the quarter. Along with this revenue growth, the PEO delivered approximately 90 basis points of margin expansion this quarter through increased operating efficiencies.
Both of our segments performed well in the quarter. And as Carlos mentioned, we are off to a good start, but we also see a mix of factors that impact our fiscal year 2017 outlook. And I will now take a moment to walk you through our revised outlook with you.
First, as I mentioned, our new business bookings growth in the quarter was in line with our plans, coming off a difficult compare in the first -- prior year first quarter. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of 4% to 6% growth on the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal year 2016. We are reaffirming our ES revenue guidance of 4% to 5% and our remaining -- and maintaining our PEO revenue guidance at 16% -- 14% to 16%. With the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, which were included for the full fiscal year 2016 but expected to be owning our results for about the first half of fiscal year 2017, we have reduced our revenue expectations for the year by almost 1 percentage point. As a result, we are now forecasting revenue growth of 7% to 8% compared with our prior forecast of 7% to 9%, which is not expected to be significantly impacted by foreign currency translation based on our current rates.
As a reminder, during the first fiscal year -- the first half of fiscal 2016, we made certain investments to support our business through the ACA onboarding process by also continuing to invest in our sales force to leverage the strong tailwinds from the sales of human capital management modules that assist clients in complying with the ACA. And we have seen the benefits of these investments help drive our margin expansion this quarter. I want to caution you, though, against assuming that this momentum will carry through the remainder of our fiscal year as we begin to lap these easier compares while continuing to execute on various strategic initiatives, including our client upgrade efforts, investing in innovation and making selected additional service investments.
On a segment level, we therefore continue to anticipate margin expansion in ES of about 50 basis points, and we are now forecasting about 70 basis -- 75 basis points of margin expansion in the PEO.
On a consolidated basis, we have revised our adjusted EBIT margin expansion to about 50 basis points from our previous guidance of 25 to 50 basis points. Please also note that this margin expansion continues to include about 20 basis points of pressure from a dual operation pertaining to our service alignment initiative.
We are also now expecting growth in our client fund interest revenue to increase $5 million to $10 million compared with our prior forecast of increase of up to $5 million. The total impact from the client fund extended investments strategy is now expected to be up $5 million compared to the prior forecast of flat growth. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.
With the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, we now expect growth in our adjusted diluted earnings per share of 11% to 13% compared with the $3.26 in fiscal year 2016, aided by about 1% from the first quarter tax benefit related to the stock-based compensation accounting change, which is offset by about 1 percentage points of earnings impact from the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses. On a constant dollar basis, our adjusted diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be 11% to 13%. 
Our forecast continues to contemplate the return of excess cash to shareholders, we have share repurchases of $1 billion to $1.4 billion during fiscal year 2017. And this includes any repurchases required to offset any dilution related to employee benefit plan.
We believe the adjustments we have made to our fiscal year 2017 forecast reflect the impact of our planned investment, particular through the year-end process as we work to grow our strong fiscal year 2016 sales performance and execute against our strategic initiatives.
So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions."

And so those are the types of services that I think we remain committed to continuing to provide but also to make better and enhance. But obviously, with the evolution of technology and the evolution of the markets, I think there are opportunities for us to redefine service. And I think some of the service alignment initiative, I think, is intended to go exactly in that direction. So another example I would give is given the increased penetration of multiple HCM modules when clients purchase our products, particularly in the mid-market or in the upmarket, I think the integration of not only our products but of our service experience becomes very important. And so you've heard us talk about creating intact teams in some of these new strategic locations that I think is intended to support this evolution of this new service approach, a new service model."

As we were going through the materials for the earnings call, we get a lot of detail by market segment and also by product. And we have seen better sales and more interest in our time and attendance product. So I think that the challenge for us is scale. Given the size of our sales number, we sold $1.75 billion last year, we're expecting to grow 4% to 6% this year, it just doesn't have the same scale and magnitude of, as an example, ACA. So for us to really achieve our sales results, we have to have across-the-board strength in our sales, excluding ACA and excluding our time and attendance product. So I guess the long and short of it is, yes, it helped, but it wasn't material in the grand scheme of things. And the deadline is approaching. So it's likely that will continue like a lot of these changes in regulations and complexity, no different than ACA. We expect it to continue to help with sales and help drive demand for our products even after the deadline, which I believe is in December of this year. But it just doesn't feel like it's having the same magnitude and same kind of scale impact that we had with ACA. And part of that might be that the ACA rules were really deadline driven, and there was a form that needed to be filled out and filed. In this case, these are just changes in rules, and so it's a slightly different decision for clients and prospects around -- in some cases, if they go 6 months without the right tools to be able to manage the new environment, there's really no consequences other than the risk of a potential investigation or a fine or whatnot, which is obviously a real risk. But it's just different from a deadline-driven event like ACA."

But in Q1 of '14, we had 1% sales growth, and that was following on Q1 of '13, 15% growth. And so this -- the scenario this quarter was we have flat growth over last year's first quarter of around 14% sales growth. And so I think that when you look at kind of just the size and the scale of these numbers and you look at the way we laid out our forecast for the year, then I think that you can probably deduce that the second half we expect mathematically to be stronger from a growth rate standpoint than the first half. I also just want to ace and add that we have the same kind of issue in the second quarter where we had sequential increase last year's second quarter, the 15%.

So the businesses that we've had some challenges with last year, which I think we were clear that was concentrated in the mid-market, have shown, I think, improvement for several quarters, including this quarter. But as you know, like -- or we have a number of different businesses. We're a global company. We have downmarket, mid-market, upmarket, multinationals. Some of our businesses are also lumpy, particularly our upmarket businesses and our BPO businesses. And so we feel good about the progress we've made where we made the investments to stabilize and the investments we made in service. As you know, we're making some longer-term investments in terms of some of these new locations. But that's a longer-term -- we did a lot of short-term things to stabilize and improve, and we've seen results from that. But again, sometimes, retention can be uneven just because of the lumpiness. It's just the way the math works. But we feel pretty good about where we are. We believe that we are on a good trajectory here in terms of continuing to do migrations and upgrades, which allows us to stay on track for what our objectives are without putting additional incremental pressure on retention. So the fact that we've gone back to -- this is now probably the second quarter where we've gone back and started our upgrades at a, I would call, normal reasonable pace, and we've been able to continue to make improvements in our mid-market retention rates. So that tells me that part of the issue was related to the upgrades themselves. But it was also related to just the service challenges, pressure from ACA just because of volumes of work and a couple of other factors. So we believe we've done the right things, and we feel like we're on the right track. And we're also sticking to our plans around our migrations and our upgrades of our clients, because I think it just strengthens us competitively over the long term."

And I will answer directly to your PEO question but also put the margin question in a little -- bigger project -- bigger picture because there's a lot going on, on margin. And clearly, we had great margin expansion this first quarter, but we are trying to send a signal that, that might not be continuing throughout the year, and the pass-through actually play a big role in it. So we had -- to answer your first question directly, the operational scale that we saw in the PEO was solid, about 90 basis points. Clearly, that's ahead of our long-term kind of expectation. So we do see and want to make progress on the efficiencies, but it was probably a very good quarter for them. And I would caution you to anticipate that type of level of productivity improvement in the long run. But clearly, all our businesses need to deliver scale, and we're sticking with our own long-term expectations of driving the margin in the company of 50 to 75 basis points. Now relative to the performance in this quarter, you will be able to dissect this once you go through the Q a little bit more detail. But the pass-through pressure that we had this year, because the PEO was growing actually faster than the overall company, was actually depressing ADP's margin by about 85 basis points. Now the pass-through pressure is typically actually higher. And if you calculate that as between 150 and 200 basis points of pressure, we call this a portfolio effect, the lower-margin business of PEO is growing faster than ES. And this quarter, we were helped because that typical -- that higher margin pressure that the pass-throughs give us abated due to that good renewal. That renewal, we're expecting to grow out of it by the second half of the year. So that is going to be a big contributor to slower margin expansion for the second half of the year. You will also see that -- and we mentioned it on our call that we had flat sales growth. And it's a long-standing tradition that if sales are growing slower, our marketing and sales expense is growing slower. So that contributed to the chunk of scale that we anticipate, clearly, per Carlos' discussion, just the prior question, to abate as we accelerate our sales in the second half of the year. And then the scaling of our ACA business plays an important role. Clearly, you're all aware that the revenue stream started really in the second half of the ACA business, while in the first half of last fiscal year '16, we made implementation and operational investments to build the business. So we started to see the revenue contribution kick in. And the pressure that the building of the ACA business exuded on the business in the first half of last fiscal year is -- has abated. We are reaping the revenue, and the business is profitable. And so the scaling of the ACA business also had a meaningful impact on the margin expansion this quarter. And clearly, we expect that actually to abate also in the second half of the year because the business started to generate revenue in the second half of last fiscal year."

And so that obviously -- the very first point that Jan made, I think that helps -- obviously, mathematically, it makes it easier for the PEO to achieve greater margin improvement when they have slower pass-through cost growth. We generally see that as having been that business for many years that slower pass-through growth is related to lower health care benefit renewals, which is -- should be a very big positive from a competitive standpoint. So as you're hearing, seeing a lot of headlines about increasing health inflation and the discipline that our business has around selling and renewing clients I think has, as of this last open enrollment for the PEO, led to very, very competitive renewal rates that are having this impact on the revenue growth, but it's a very, very big positive effect for that business."

And they won it -- it was one of the factors in our decision to sell the business to them because we got to know each other as a result of them winning that contract, which is a government contract from the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, which is a government entity. As you know, we don't have a lot of public sector, government business. We have some, and we like that business, but we just don't have a lot of it. And we certainly don't have a lot of contracts of that size and that scale with or without the government. And so the original genesis of that account was it came through an acquisition of a company called SHPS that we acquired several years back, where we acquired other benefits administration assets that we were interested in. And this account came with it. And with it came the risk of when these contracts get put out to bid, you don't always win. And so we took a calculated risk when we made that acquisition, not just with this account but like with all acquisitions, and that was one of the items that came along with that acquisition. But it was also an account that -- I can't remember how many months ago it was, but I believe there was a public release by WageWorks regarding the winning of that account.

As you heard from our comments, we did build in what we're calling dual operations costs to avoid the last part that you mentioned, which is transition challenges you also -- we want to make sure that we have people trained and ready before we move work. But there's obviously always -- you have to manage through that kind of transition risk as well. To be clear, this is not -- we're not moving 90% of our associates. We're moving -- I think we're between 5% and 10% of our associates. So over time, we expect that to have the kind of positive impacts we're talking about in terms of incremental revenue growth, improved service, et cetera. But this is a -- not a onetime, overnight dramatic move that is intended to create an enormous amount of risk or, frankly, disruption for our associates because we had a long history of treating our people right. We have highly tenured associates who have been very loyal to the company. And so we're being very, very careful in the [indiscernible] on how we do this and how we communicate to our associates so that we can move on with our business plans but also treat people the right way. But having said all that, the idea, as we said, I think previously, is to, most importantly, deliver better integrated service through intact teams of multiple modules of HCM. And so the intention would be that there would be a benefit to retention. We don't have a scientific way of forecasting that. We're telling you when that will happen, and it certainly is not expected to happen this year because we're just in the process of getting these places all ramped up and scaled. And obviously, the effect of having better service, a better reputation and being able to cross some more easily should have some impact on our ability to sell and on our revenue growth as well. But again, those are hypothetical that are very hard to forecast, and we're certainly not building anything into our forecast for this year. But we're not doing it just to take risk. We're doing it because we see benefits in terms of operational efficiencies, potential retention and potential growth down the line."

So -- and 2 things that are important. So if you look at based on units, we're almost 90% migrated, but that's mainly because we've moved all of our clients onto our RUN platform in the downmarket. So from a revenue standpoint, we're a little bit less than half, I think, of the revenues for the company. So if you look at it by segment, we're done in the downmarket. I think we are -- should be done by the end of this fiscal year. I think that's consistent with what we've said in the past that we're on track, and we're seeing it now that we're on track to have our mid-market clients on our WFN current version platform by the end of this fiscal year or within a month or 2 after that. And then when you move up into the upmarket, we have migrated some clients over to Vantage. And we have plans underway to continue those migrations. But those are literally one at a time, whereas in the downmarket and in the RUN, they are just large groups of clients that we would migrate every week. In the upmarket, it's one at a time, talking to each client individually, creating a schedule and creating a path. But we have done migrations, and we will continue to do migrations in the upmarket, but that will take considerably longer than what we did in our downmarket business, which took us probably over the course of 2 to 3 years to migrate all of those clients. So we're very happy with the progress. We believe that when we migrate our clients, we're creating more defensible bigger mote against competition. We believe that it creates an opportunity for us to sell additional products and services. And we believe it strengthens our relationships with our clients. And most importantly, we think it's the right thing for our clients. So we're still on track, and we're continuing to move ahead."

And I think the -- as usual, the answer is I think it's mix in terms of -- we have a lot more experience, obviously, now in migrating clients. In particular, the experience we developed last year when our volumes have upgraded almost doubled as we were trying to move clients over to the new platform in order to be able to give them the ACA product. That really created an enormous amount of learning opportunity for us in terms of how to do it better and how to do it at scale and what not to do around these upgrades, because they're intended to be a positive and to create a better experience and a better -- and deliver a better product to the clients. And so I think on one side of the scale, you would say huge -- we have an enormous amount of body of knowledge now on how to do this better. On the other side of the scale, human nature is such that no one consciously does this. But then when you go through these types of events, you realize, oh, it looks like we have some of the toughest ones waiting towards the end, because there may be clients, for example, that we approach and ask them to upgrade and they say, well, I don't want to do it now, call me in a quarter. And then we are getting to a point now where -- that we're going to have to migrate them or upgrade them. And so we probably have some of that as well. So I don't think there's an enormous amount of that. It's not like we only have the hard ones left and the ones who didn't want to go. But just being realistic in the sense that -- and also deferent to our associates who have still all the hard work ahead of them over the next 3 quarters or so because it's not going to be easy getting across the finish line. But our volumes now at a -- are at a more manageable level where I think we're doing a much higher-quality job. So we feel good about our ability to do it.

The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.
I also want to highlight for you that the quarterly history of revenue and pretax earnings for our reportable segments is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website. These schedules have been updated to include the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and have been adjusted to align with recent changes in our segment reporting to align our financial reporting with how management now views the business. Most notably, effective this quarter, we are now allocating stock-based compensation to the segments and have made some changes to the allocation methodology for certain corporate-level allocations. Accordingly, prior periods presented have been restated, and our segment guidance reflects the impact of these changes.
Before Carlos begins, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.
Now let me turn the call over to Carlos."

We appreciate your interest in ADP.
This morning, we reported our first quarter fiscal 2017 results, with revenue up 7% to $2.9 billion despite 1 percentage point of combined pressure from foreign currency translation and the impact of the sale of the AdvancedMD business at the end of our fiscal 2016 first quarter. We are pleased with this revenue growth, which was in line with our expectations, and we continue to see the benefits from our recent new business bookings helping to drive growth in the quarter.
In addition to this solid revenue growth, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 26% to $0.86 per share. Overall, our earnings growth exceeded our expectations this quarter, and we are very pleased with our results. There were a number of contributing factors to our strong earnings performance. Jan will walk through these shortly.
On the new business bookings front, during the quarter, we were flat compared to the first quarter of 2016, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to forecast 4% to 6% bookings growth for the year. I want to remind you of the tailwinds we experienced in fiscal 2016 from the sale of additional modules related to the Affordable Care Act. Our anticipated fiscal 2017 performance, if achieved, would lead to a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of 9%, which remains in line with our long-term new business bookings guidance of 8% to 10%.
Overall, our revenue growth was solid this quarter. And while we do not expect all of the margin expansion we saw this quarter to continue through the remainder of the year, we are pleased with our overall results.
Before I continue, I wanted to share a little more insight regarding retention. During the quarter, we experienced a decline in retention of 100 basis points, which was due to the loss of a contract pertaining to our CHSA business, which we announced today has been sold to WageWorks. Excluding the impact of this single client loss, retention would've been flat in the quarter.
We continue to see the benefits of our efforts to upgrade clients to the most appropriate strategic cloud-based platforms. These upgrade efforts remain on track and progressed nicely during the quarter. As I just mentioned, today we announced that WageWorks was acquiring 2 nonstrategic ADP businesses, namely our CHSA and COBRA businesses, for $235 million. In selling to a top-tier provider in these markets, we believe this agreement will truly unlock the potential of these businesses while allowing us to sharpen our focus on ADP's core benefits administration offering.
In conjunction with these dispositions, ADP entered into a partnership with WageWorks that will allow us to continue offering their COBRA and CHSA solutions to ADP clients in an integrated fashion. This is a great example of ADP continuing to build an ecosystem of complementary services that allow clients to extend the value of their core ADP Human Capital Management solutions.
Last quarter, we shared details of our service alignment initiative, which is part of our strategy to simplify the service organization by aligning ADP's service operations to our strategic platforms. In addition to improving the client service experience, this initiative is expected to enhance ADP's service capabilities and contribute to operating efficiencies over the long term.
We are pleased with the progress we are making at our new strategic locations in Maitland, Florida; and Norfolk, Virginia. Efforts to staff and operate from these locations have commenced and are proceeding according to plan. We will soon announce the location of our third new site in the western part of the U.S., which we anticipate being operational toward the latter part of this fiscal year.
Our results this quarter reflect the strength of our business model and give us momentum as we stay focused on delivering an outstanding client experience through a great -- through great service and innovative solutions, many of which are exceeding a wealth of external recognition.
Recently, we shared that ADP was named a leader in payroll business process outsourcing by Gartner for the fifth consecutive year. Gartner's study analyzed vendors across all regions, employer sizes and service delivery models, evaluating both their ability to execute and completeness of vision. In naming ADP a leader, Gartner recognized us for combining a clear view of the market's direction and a deep understanding of client needs with the capabilities and expertise to deliver against them. Payroll outsourcing is core to who we are and is part of delivering outstanding HCM solutions. We are extremely proud of the sustained recognition for our leadership in this area.
Today, ADP is delivering HCM solutions to more than 650,000 clients and 39 million employees worldwide. These data points are important for a number of reasons. They clearly demonstrate our unique reach and marketplace success over a sustained period of time, but they also represent a unique differentiator for ADP. The scale and the data that this client base represents allows us to deliver a suite of new capabilities that we believe hold the potential to transform the strategic value of the HR function. Because we pay 1 in 6 workers in the U.S., we are in a unique -- in the unique position to deliver advanced analytics capabilities that can help clients address workforce productivity, talent development and retention. Leveraging this data, we introduced the ADP data cloud to allow business leaders and HR professionals to generate actionable insights from the workforce data embedded in their ADP HCM solutions. And today, more than 3,200 clients are using our analytics platform.
About a year ago, we introduced benchmarking to this platform. The benchmarking capability provides users with a unique competitive advantage by delivering insight from actual live data to help clients evaluate their workforce against other companies in their market space. Our benchmarking capability puts key industry workforce metrics at our clients' fingertips, avoiding the inherent time lag or inaccuracy associated with salary and other types of survey-based data. A few weeks ago, at the HR Technology Conference in Chicago, we received 2 distinctive recognitions for our data cloud benchmarking capability. At the show, HR Executive magazine named us one of its top products for 2016 and recognized it as one of the year's awesome new technologies for HR. I should note, this is the second year in a row that we've received these distinguished awards. We received them both last year for the ADP Marketplace, the first and largest ATM app ecosystem in the market.
I said before that innovation is a job that's never done, but we are proud of the progress to date and the external recognition we are receiving. We believe that innovations like these and the investments we are making to simplify our portfolio are essential to our long-term success.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for a further review of our first quarter results."

During the quarter, we recorded a restructuring charge of about $40 million related to our service alignment initiative. Certain non-GAAP measures in my commentary to follow exclude the impact of this charge as well as certain other onetime items recognized in the prior fiscal year. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.
Before I begin reviewing this quarter's results, I wanted to highlight some additional detail regarding the disposition of our COBRA and CHSA businesses. We currently expect the sale to be completed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 for a pretax gain of approximately $200 million, subject to normal and customary closing conditions. The results of operations of these 2 businesses are currently included in the Employer Services segment and will not be reflected as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, we have factored the operational impacts from these dispositions into our updated fiscal year 2017 outlook.
As Carlos mentioned, ADP revenues grew 7% in the quarter to $2.9 billion or 8% on a constant dollar basis. On a reported basis, net earnings grew 10% or 9% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, grew 21% or 20% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBIT margin increased about 230 basis points compared to the 17.6% in the last year's first quarter. This increase was driven by operational efficiencies and a slower growth in our selling expenses. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 26% to $0.86 and 26% on a constant dollar basis and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago.
Our adjusted effective tax rate was positively impacted following the adoption of a new stock compensation-related accounting pronouncement in our first quarter, which helped drive a decrease of our adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 290 basis points to 30.8% or 3% on an EPS -- $0.03, I apologize, $0.03 on an EPS basis for the quarter.
As you read this morning's press release, new business bookings growth was flat for the quarter but in line with our own expectations, following 2 years of successes, double-digit growth and with meaningful contribution from human capital management modules that assist clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act.
Overall, our results in the quarter were very good, yielding solid revenue growth with the better-than-expected margin growth. Although we still have a lot of work ahead of us, I'm also pleased with the progress to date on our service alignment initiative.
Now our Employee Services segment. Revenues grew 6% for the quarter and 6% on a constant dollar basis. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.7% in the first quarter. Average client fund balances grew 4% compared to a year ago and 4% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions of net new business and increased wage levels compared to the prior year's first quarter. Outside the U.S., we continue to see solid revenue growth and margin growth, driven largely by the success of our multinational solutions, which continued to perform well. 
Employee Services margin increased about 230 basis points in the quarter. This increase was driven by operational efficiencies and a slower growth in our selling expenses, following on from the difficult selling compare in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016.
The PEO continues to perform well, growing revenues by 13% in the quarter, with average worksite employees growing 13% to 439,000 employees. A portion of the 13% revenue growth was impacted by slower growth in our benefit pass-through costs resulting from lower health care renewal premiums, which outweighed growth from higher benefit plan participation from our worksite employees during the quarter. Along with this revenue growth, the PEO delivered approximately 90 basis points of margin expansion this quarter through increased operating efficiencies.
Both of our segments performed well in the quarter. And as Carlos mentioned, we are off to a good start, but we also see a mix of factors that impact our fiscal year 2017 outlook. And I will now take a moment to walk you through our revised outlook with you.
First, as I mentioned, our new business bookings growth in the quarter was in line with our plans, coming off a difficult compare in the first -- prior year first quarter. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of 4% to 6% growth on the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal year 2016. We are reaffirming our ES revenue guidance of 4% to 5% and our remaining -- and maintaining our PEO revenue guidance at 16% -- 14% to 16%. With the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, which were included for the full fiscal year 2016 but expected to be owning our results for about the first half of fiscal year 2017, we have reduced our revenue expectations for the year by almost 1 percentage point. As a result, we are now forecasting revenue growth of 7% to 8% compared with our prior forecast of 7% to 9%, which is not expected to be significantly impacted by foreign currency translation based on our current rates.
As a reminder, during the first fiscal year -- the first half of fiscal 2016, we made certain investments to support our business through the ACA onboarding process by also continuing to invest in our sales force to leverage the strong tailwinds from the sales of human capital management modules that assist clients in complying with the ACA. And we have seen the benefits of these investments help drive our margin expansion this quarter. I want to caution you, though, against assuming that this momentum will carry through the remainder of our fiscal year as we begin to lap these easier compares while continuing to execute on various strategic initiatives, including our client upgrade efforts, investing in innovation and making selected additional service investments.
On a segment level, we therefore continue to anticipate margin expansion in ES of about 50 basis points, and we are now forecasting about 70 basis -- 75 basis points of margin expansion in the PEO.
On a consolidated basis, we have revised our adjusted EBIT margin expansion to about 50 basis points from our previous guidance of 25 to 50 basis points. Please also note that this margin expansion continues to include about 20 basis points of pressure from a dual operation pertaining to our service alignment initiative.
We are also now expecting growth in our client fund interest revenue to increase $5 million to $10 million compared with our prior forecast of increase of up to $5 million. The total impact from the client fund extended investments strategy is now expected to be up $5 million compared to the prior forecast of flat growth. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.
With the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, we now expect growth in our adjusted diluted earnings per share of 11% to 13% compared with the $3.26 in fiscal year 2016, aided by about 1% from the first quarter tax benefit related to the stock-based compensation accounting change, which is offset by about 1 percentage points of earnings impact from the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses. On a constant dollar basis, our adjusted diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be 11% to 13%. 
Our forecast continues to contemplate the return of excess cash to shareholders, we have share repurchases of $1 billion to $1.4 billion during fiscal year 2017. And this includes any repurchases required to offset any dilution related to employee benefit plans.
We believe the adjustments we have made to our fiscal year 2017 forecast reflect the impact of our planned investment, particular through the year-end process as we work to grow our strong fiscal year 2016 sales performance and execute against our strategic initiatives.
So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions."

So some of the things that we traditionally have been strong on in service, I think, still are a key part of our value proposition. So as an example, we have a very effective, very value-added tax business that helps clients with compliance should they get notices from either federal, state or local agencies regarding tax payments. And so those are the types of services that I think we remain committed to continuing to provide but also to make better and enhance. But obviously, with the evolution of technology and the evolution of the markets, I think there are opportunities for us to redefine service. And I think some of the service alignment initiative, I think, is intended to go exactly in that direction. So another example I would give is given the increased penetration of multiple HCM modules when clients purchase our products, particularly in the mid-market or in the upmarket, I think the integration of not only our products but of our service experience becomes very important. And so you've heard us talk about creating intact teams in some of these new strategic locations that I think is intended to support this evolution of this new service approach, a new service model."

So that's a -- I think you have that right. Probably 40% -- I would allocate it just for sake of modeling to 40-60. So 40% maybe first half, 60% second half, but overall, 20 basis points for the year. And again, as Jan pointed out, just because of the way the accounting rules work, that is built into our operating expense versus the restructuring costs that were really more intended for things like severance and facilities closure that were directly related to the restructuring and that are non-GAAP."

As we were going through the materials for the earnings call, we get a lot of detail by market segment and also by product. And we have seen better sales and more interest in our time and attendance product. So I think that the challenge for us is scale. Given the size of our sales number, we sold $1.75 billion last year, we're expecting to grow 4% to 6% this year, it just doesn't have the same scale and magnitude of, as an example, ACA. So for us to really achieve our sales results, we have to have across-the-board strength in our sales, excluding ACA and excluding our time and attendance product. So I guess the long and short of it is, yes, it helped, but it wasn't material in the grand scheme of things. And the deadline is approaching. So it's likely that will continue like a lot of these changes in regulations and complexity, no different than ACA. We expect it to continue to help with sales and help drive demand for our products even after the deadline, which I believe is in December of this year. But it just doesn't feel like it's having the same magnitude and same kind of scale impact that we had with ACA. And part of that might be that the ACA rules were really deadline driven, and there was a form that needed to be filled out and filed. In this case, these are just changes in rules, and so it's a slightly different decision for clients and prospects around -- in some cases, if they go 6 months without the right tools to be able to manage the new environment, there's really no consequences other than the risk of a potential investigation or a fine or whatnot, which is obviously a real risk. But it's just different from a deadline-driven event like ACA."

And I think just by way of comparison, we went back and looked historically outside, of course, times where we had recessions and other economic challenges. But in Q1 of '14, we had 1% sales growth, and that was following on Q1 of '13, 15% growth. And so this -- the scenario this quarter was we have flat growth over last year's first quarter of around 14% sales growth. And so I think that when you look at kind of just the size and the scale of these numbers and you look at the way we laid out our forecast for the year, then I think that you can probably deduce that the second half we expect mathematically to be stronger from a growth rate standpoint than the first half. I also just want to ace and add that we have the same kind of issue in the second quarter where we had sequential increase last year's second quarter, the 15%. So we had -- I think it was 13% to 14% growth in the first quarter, and then we had 15% in the second quarter. So we will have another difficult compare.

So the businesses that we've had some challenges with last year, which I think we were clear that was concentrated in the mid-market, have shown, I think, improvement for several quarters, including this quarter. But as you know, like -- or we have a number of different businesses. We're a global company. We have downmarket, mid-market, upmarket, multinationals. Some of our businesses are also lumpy, particularly our upmarket businesses and our BPO businesses. And so we feel good about the progress we've made where we made the investments to stabilize and the investments we made in service. As you know, we're making some longer-term investments in terms of some of these new locations. But that's a longer-term -- we did a lot of short-term things to stabilize and improve, and we've seen results from that. But again, sometimes, retention can be uneven just because of the lumpiness. It's just the way the math works. But we feel pretty good about where we are. We believe that we are on a good trajectory here in terms of continuing to do migrations and upgrades, which allows us to stay on track for what our objectives are without putting additional incremental pressure on retention. So the fact that we've gone back to -- this is now probably the second quarter where we've gone back and started our upgrades at a, I would call, normal reasonable pace, and we've been able to continue to make improvements in our mid-market retention rates. So that tells me that part of the issue was related to the upgrades themselves. But it was also related to just the service challenges, pressure from ACA just because of volumes of work and a couple of other factors. So we believe we've done the right things, and we feel like we're on the right track. And we're also sticking to our plans around our migrations and our upgrades of our clients, because I think it just strengthens us competitively over the long term."

And I will answer directly to your PEO question but also put the margin question in a little -- bigger project -- bigger picture because there's a lot going on, on margin. And clearly, we had great margin expansion this first quarter, but we are trying to send a signal that, that might not be continuing throughout the year, and the pass-through actually play a big role in it. So we had -- to answer your first question directly, the operational scale that we saw in the PEO was solid, about 90 basis points. Clearly, that's ahead of our long-term kind of expectation. So we do see and want to make progress on the efficiencies, but it was probably a very good quarter for them. And I would caution you to anticipate that type of level of productivity improvement in the long run. But clearly, all our businesses need to deliver scale, and we're sticking with our own long-term expectations of driving the margin in the company of 50 to 75 basis points. Now relative to the performance in this quarter, you will be able to dissect this once you go through the Q a little bit more detail. But the pass-through pressure that we had this year, because the PEO was growing actually faster than the overall company, was actually depressing ADP's margin by about 85 basis points. Now the pass-through pressure is typically actually higher. And if you calculate that as between 150 and 200 basis points of pressure, we call this a portfolio effect, the lower-margin business of PEO is growing faster than ES. And this quarter, we were helped because that typical -- that higher margin pressure that the pass-throughs give us abated due to that good renewal. That renewal, we're expecting to grow out of it by the second half of the year. So that is going to be a big contributor to slower margin expansion for the second half of the year. You will also see that -- and we mentioned it on our call that we had flat sales growth. And it's a long-standing tradition that if sales are growing slower, our marketing and sales expense is growing slower. So that contributed to the chunk of scale that we anticipate, clearly, per Carlos' discussion, just the prior question, to abate as we accelerate our sales in the second half of the year. And then the scaling of our ACA business plays an important role. Clearly, you're all aware that the revenue stream started really in the second half of the ACA business, while in the first half of last fiscal year '16, we made implementation and operational investments to build the business. So we started to see the revenue contribution kick in. And the pressure that the building of the ACA business exuded on the business in the first half of last fiscal year is -- has abated. We are reaping the revenue, and the business is profitable. And so the scaling of the ACA business also had a meaningful impact on the margin expansion this quarter. And clearly, we expect that actually to abate also in the second half of the year because the business started to generate revenue in the second half of last fiscal year."

I think this is -- I don't remember the last time that our PEO worksite employee growth was the same as our revenue growth. And so that obviously -- the very first point that Jan made, I think that helps -- obviously, mathematically, it makes it easier for the PEO to achieve greater margin improvement when they have slower pass-through cost growth. We generally see that as having been that business for many years that slower pass-through growth is related to lower health care benefit renewals, which is -- should be a very big positive from a competitive standpoint. So as you're hearing, seeing a lot of headlines about increasing health inflation and the discipline that our business has around selling and renewing clients I think has, as of this last open enrollment for the PEO, led to very, very competitive renewal rates that are having this impact on the revenue growth, but it's a very, very big positive for that business."

And they won it -- it was one of the factors in our decision to sell the business to them because we got to know each other as a result of them winning that contract, which is a government contract from the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, which is a government entity. As you know, we don't have a lot of public sector, government business. We have some, and we like that business, but we just don't have a lot of it. And we certainly don't have a lot of contracts of that size and that scale with or without the government. And so the original genesis of that account was it came through an acquisition of a company called SHPS that we acquired several years back, where we acquired other benefits administration assets that we were interested in. And this account came with it. And with it came the risk of when these contracts get put out to bid, you don't always win. And so we took a calculated risk when we made that acquisition, not just with this account but like with all acquisitions, and that was one of the items that came along with that acquisition. But it was also an account that -- I can't remember how many months ago it was, but I believe there was a public release by WageWorks regarding the winning of that account. And I think some people speculated that it come from us, and we can now confirm that it did come from us."

But there's obviously always -- you have to manage through that kind of transition risk as well. To be clear, this is not -- we're not moving 90% of our associates. We're moving -- anywhere between 5% and 10% of our associates. So over time, we expect that to have the kind of positive impacts we're talking about in terms of incremental revenue growth, improved service, et cetera. But this is a -- not a onetime, overnight dramatic move that is intended to create an enormous amount of risk or, frankly, disruption for our associates because we had a long history of treating our people right. We have highly tenured associates who have been very loyal to the company. And so we're being very, very careful and methodical on how we do this and how we communicate to our associates so that we can move on with our business plans but also treat people the right way. But having said all that, the idea, as we said, I think previously, is to, most importantly, deliver better integrated service through intact teams of multiple modules of HCM. And so the intention would be that there would be a benefit to retention. We don't have a scientific way of forecasting that. We're telling you when that will happen, and it certainly is not expected to happen this year because we're just in the process of getting these places all ramped up and scaled. And obviously, the effect of having better service, a better reputation and being able to cross some more easily should have some impact on our ability to sell and on our revenue growth as well. But again, those are hypothetical that are very hard to forecast, and we're certainly not building anything into our forecast for this year. But we're not doing it just to take risk. We're doing it because we see benefits in terms of operational efficiencies, potential retention and potential growth down the line."

And I think the -- as usual, the answer is I think it's mixed in terms of -- we have a lot more experience, obviously, now in migrating clients. In particular, the experience we developed last year when our volumes have upgraded almost doubled as we were trying to move clients over to the new platform in order to be able to give them the ACA product. That really created an enormous amount of learning opportunity for us in terms of how to do it better and how to do it at scale and what not to do around these upgrades, because they're intended to be a positive and to create a better experience and a better -- and deliver a better product to the clients. And so I think on one side of the scale, you would say huge -- we have an enormous amount of body of knowledge now on how to do this better. On the other side of the scale, human nature is such that no one consciously does this. But then when you go through these types of events, you realize, oh, it looks like we have some of the toughest ones waiting towards the end, because there may be clients, for example, that we approach and ask them to upgrade and they say, well, I don't want to do it now, call me in a quarter. And then we are getting to a point now where -- that we're going to have to migrate them or upgrade them. And so we probably have some of that as well. So I don't think there's an enormous amount of that. It's not like we only have the hard ones left and the ones who didn't want to go. But just being realistic in the sense that -- and also deferent to our associates who have still all the hard work ahead of them over the next 3 quarters or so because it's not going to be easy getting across the finish line. But our volumes now at a -- are at a more manageable level where I think we're doing a much higher-quality job. So we feel good about our ability to do it.

Thank you for joining us for our first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call and webcast. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors. The reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.
I also want to highlight for you that the quarterly history of revenue and pretax earnings for our reportable segments is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website. These schedules have been updated to include the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and have been adjusted to align with recent changes in our segment reporting to align our financial reporting with how management now views the business. Most notably, effective this quarter, we are now allocating stock-based compensation to the segments and have made some changes to the allocation methodology for certain corporate-level allocations. Accordingly, prior periods presented have been restated, and our segment guidance reflects the impact of these changes.
Before Carlos begins, I'd like to remind everyone that today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.

We appreciate your interest in ADP.
This morning, we reported our first quarter fiscal 2017 results, with revenue up 7% to $2.9 billion despite 1 percentage point of combined pressure from foreign currency translation and the impact of the sale of the AdvancedMD business at the end of our fiscal 2016 first quarter. We are pleased with this revenue growth, which was in line with our expectations, and we continue to see the benefits from our recent new business bookings helping to drive growth in the quarter.
In addition to this solid revenue growth, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 26% to $0.86 per share. Overall, our earnings growth exceeded our expectations this quarter, and we are very pleased with our results. There were a number of contributing factors to our strong earnings performance. Jan will walk through these shortly.
On the new business bookings front, during the quarter, we were flat compared to the first quarter of 2016, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to forecast 4% to 6% bookings growth for the year. I want to remind you of the tailwinds we experienced in fiscal 2016 from the sale of additional modules related to the Affordable Care Act. Our anticipated fiscal 2017 performance, if achieved, would lead to a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of 9%, which remains in line with our long-term new business bookings guidance of 8% to 10%.
Overall, our revenue growth was solid this quarter. And while we do not expect all of the margin expansion we saw this quarter to continue through the remainder of the year, we are pleased with our overall results.
Before I continue, I wanted to share a little more insight regarding retention. During the quarter, we experienced a decline in retention of 100 basis points, which was due to the loss of a contract pertaining to our CHSA business, which we announced today has been sold to WageWorks. Excluding the impact of this single client loss, retention would've been flat in the quarter.
We continue to see the benefits of our efforts to upgrade clients to the most appropriate strategic cloud-based platforms. These upgrade efforts remain on track and progressed nicely during the quarter. As I just mentioned, today we announced that WageWorks was acquiring 2 nonstrategic ADP businesses, namely our CHSA and COBRA businesses, for $235 million. In selling to a top-tier provider in these markets, we believe this agreement will truly unlock the potential of these businesses while allowing us to sharpen our focus on ADP's core benefits administration offering.
In conjunction with these dispositions, ADP entered into a partnership with WageWorks that will allow us to continue offering their COBRA and CHSA solutions to ADP clients in an integrated fashion. This is a great example of ADP continuing to build an ecosystem of complementary services that allow clients to extend the value of their core ADP Human Capital Management solutions.
Last quarter, we shared details of our service alignment initiative, which is part of our strategy to simplify the service organization by aligning ADP's service operations to our strategic platforms. In addition to improving the client service experience, this initiative is expected to enhance ADP's service capabilities and contribute to operating efficiencies over the long term.
We are pleased with the progress we are making at our new strategic locations in Maitland, Florida; and Norfolk, Virginia. Efforts to staff and operate from these locations have commenced and are proceeding according to plan. We will soon announce the location of our third new site in the western part of the U.S., which we anticipate being operational toward the latter part of this fiscal year.
Our results this quarter reflect the strength of our business model and give us momentum as we stay focused on delivering an outstanding client experience through a great -- through great service and innovative solutions, many of which are exceeding a wealth of external recognition.
Recently, we shared that ADP was named a leader in payroll business process outsourcing by Gartner for the fifth consecutive year. Gartner's study analyzed vendors across all regions, employer sizes and service delivery models, evaluating both their ability to execute and completeness of vision. In naming ADP a leader, Gartner recognized us for combining a clear view of the market's direction and a deep understanding of client needs with the capabilities and expertise to deliver against them. Payroll outsourcing is core to who we are and is part of delivering outstanding HCM solutions. We are extremely proud of the sustained recognition for our leadership in this area.
Today, ADP is delivering HCM solutions to more than 650,000 clients and 39 million employees worldwide. These data points are important for a number of reasons. They clearly demonstrate our unique reach and marketplace success over a sustained period of time, but they also represent a unique differentiator for ADP. The scale and the data that this client base represents allows us to deliver a suite of new capabilities that we believe hold the potential to transform the strategic value of the HR function. Because we pay 1 in 6 workers in the U.S., we are in a unique -- in the unique position to deliver advanced analytics capabilities that can help clients address workforce productivity, talent development and retention. Leveraging this data, we introduced the ADP data cloud to allow business leaders and HR professionals to generate actionable insights from the workforce data embedded in their ADP HCM solutions. And today, more than 3,200 clients are using our analytics platform.
About a year ago, we introduced benchmarking to this platform. The benchmarking capability provides users with a unique competitive advantage by delivering insight from actual live data to help clients evaluate their workforce against other companies in their market space. Our benchmarking capability puts key industry workforce metrics at our clients' fingertips, avoiding the inherent time lag or inaccuracy associated with salary and other types of survey-based data. A few weeks ago, at the HR Technology Conference in Chicago, we received 2 distinctive recognitions for our data cloud benchmarking capability. At the show, HR Executive magazine named us one of its top products for 2016 and recognized it as one of the year's awesome new technologies for HR. I should note, this is the second year in a row that we've received these distinguished awards. We received them both last year for the ADP Marketplace, the first and largest ATM app ecosystem in the market.
I said before that innovation is a job that's never done, but we are proud of the progress to date and the external recognition we are receiving. We believe that innovations like these and the investments we are making to simplify our portfolio are essential to our long-term success.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jan for a further review of our first quarter results."
126269,401973578,1071307,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2016",2016-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Automatic Data Processing, Inc.","Executives","Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone.During the quarter, we recorded a restructuring charge of about $40 million related to our service alignment initiative.

During the quarter, we recorded a restructuring charge of about $40 million related to our service alignment initiative. Certain non-GAAP measures in my commentary to follow exclude the impact of this charge as well as certain other onetime items recognized in the prior fiscal year. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.
Before I begin reviewing this quarter's results, I wanted to highlight some additional detail regarding the disposition of our COBRA and CHSA businesses. We currently expect the sale to be completed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 for a pretax gain of approximately $200 million, subject to normal and customary closing conditions. The results of operations of these 2 businesses are currently included in the Employer Services segment and will not be reflected as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, we have factored the operational impacts from these dispositions into our updated fiscal year 2017 outlook.
As Carlos mentioned, ADP revenues grew 7% in the quarter to $2.9 billion or 8% on a constant dollar basis. On a reported basis, net earnings grew 10% or 9% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, grew 21% or 20% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBIT margin increased about 230 basis points compared to the 17.6% in the last year's first quarter. This increase was driven by operational efficiencies and a slower growth in our selling expenses. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 26% to $0.86 and 26% on a constant dollar basis and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago.
Our adjusted effective tax rate was positively impacted following the adoption of a new stock compensation-related accounting pronouncement in our first quarter, which helped drive a decrease of our adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 290 basis points to 30.8% or 3% on an EPS -- $0.03, I apologize, $0.03 on an EPS basis for the quarter.
As you read this morning's press release, new business bookings growth was flat for the quarter but in line with our own expectations, following 2 years of successes, double-digit growth and with meaningful contribution from human capital management modules that assist clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act.
Overall, our results in the quarter were very good, yielding solid revenue growth with the better-than-expected margin growth. Although we still have a lot of work ahead of us, I'm also pleased with the progress to date on our service alignment initiative.
Now our Employee Services segment. Revenues grew 6% for the quarter and 6% on a constant dollar basis. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.7% in the first quarter. Average client fund balances grew 4% compared to a year ago and 4% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions of net new business and increased wage levels compared to the prior year's first quarter. Outside the U.S., we continue to see solid revenue growth and margin growth, driven largely by the success of our multinational solutions, which continued to perform well. 
Employee Services margin increased about 230 basis points in the quarter. This increase was driven by operational efficiencies and a slower growth in our selling expenses, following on from the difficult selling compare in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016.
The PEO continues to perform well, growing revenues by 13% in the quarter, with average worksite employees growing 13% to 439,000 employees. A portion of the 13% revenue growth was impacted by slower growth in our benefit pass-through costs resulting from lower health care renewal premiums, which outweighed growth from higher benefit plan participation from our worksite employees during the quarter. Along with this revenue growth, the PEO delivered approximately 90 basis points of margin expansion this quarter through increased operating efficiencies.
Both of our segments performed well in the quarter. And as Carlos mentioned, we are off to a good start, but we also see a mix of factors that impact our fiscal year 2017 outlook. And I will now take a moment to walk you through our revised outlook with you.
First, as I mentioned, our new business bookings growth in the quarter was in line with our plans, coming off a difficult compare in the first -- prior year first quarter. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of 4% to 6% growth on the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal year 2016. We are reaffirming our ES revenue guidance of 4% to 5% and our remaining -- and maintaining our PEO revenue guidance at 16% -- 14% to 16%. With the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, which were included for the full fiscal year 2016 but expected to be owning our results for about the first half of fiscal year 2017, we have reduced our revenue expectations for the year by almost 1 percentage point. As a result, we are now forecasting revenue growth of 7% to 8% compared with our prior forecast of 7% to 9%, which is not expected to be significantly impacted by foreign currency translation based on our current rates.
As a reminder, during the first fiscal year -- the first half of fiscal 2016, we made certain investments to support our business through the ACA onboarding process by also continuing to invest in our sales force to leverage the strong tailwinds from the sales of human capital management modules that assist clients in complying with the ACA. And we have seen the benefits of these investments help drive our margin expansion this quarter. I want to caution you, though, against assuming that this momentum will carry through the remainder of our fiscal year as we begin to lap these easier compares while continuing to execute on various strategic initiatives, including our client upgrade efforts, investing in innovation and making selected additional service investments.
On a segment level, we therefore continue to anticipate margin expansion in ES of about 50 basis points, and we are now forecasting about 70 basis -- 75 basis points of margin expansion in the PEO.
On a consolidated basis, we have revised our adjusted EBIT margin expansion to about 50 basis points from our previous guidance of 25 to 50 basis points. Please also note that this margin expansion continues to include about 20 basis points of pressure from a dual operation pertaining to our service alignment initiative.
We are also now expecting growth in our client fund interest revenue to increase $5 million to $10 million compared with our prior forecast of increase of up to $5 million. The total impact from the client fund extended investments strategy is now expected to be up $5 million compared to the prior forecast of flat growth. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website.
With the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, we now expect growth in our adjusted diluted earnings per share of 11% to 13% compared with the $3.26 in fiscal year 2016, aided by about 1% from the first quarter tax benefit related to the stock-based compensation accounting change, which is offset by about 1 percentage points of earnings impact from the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses. On a constant dollar basis, our adjusted diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be 11% to 13%. 
Our forecast continues to contemplate the return of excess cash to shareholders, we have share repurchases of $1 billion to $1.4 billion during fiscal year 2017. And this includes any repurchases required to offset any dilution related to employee benefit plans.
We believe the adjustments we have made to our fiscal year 2017 forecast reflect the impact of our planned investment, particular through the year-end process as we work to grow our strong fiscal year 2016 sales performance and execute against our strategic initiatives.

So some of the things that we traditionally have been strong on in service, I think, still are a key part of our value proposition. So as an example, we have a very effective, very value-added tax business that helps clients with compliance should they get notices from either federal, state or local agencies regarding tax payments. And so those are the types of services that I think we remain committed to continuing to provide but also to make better and enhance. But obviously, with the evolution of technology and the evolution of the markets, I think there are opportunities for us to redefine service. And I think some of the service alignment initiative, I think, is intended to go exactly in that direction. So another example I would give is given the increased penetration of multiple HCM modules when clients purchase our products, particularly in the mid-market or in the upmarket, I think the integration of not only our products but of our service experience becomes very important. And so you've heard us talk about creating intact teams in some of these new strategic locations that I think is intended to support this evolution of this new service approach, a new service model."

As we were going through the materials for the earnings call, we get a lot of detail by market segment and also by product. And we have seen better sales and more interest in our time and attendance product. So I think that the challenge for us is scale. Given the size of our sales number, we sold $1.75 billion last year, we're expecting to grow 4% to 6% this year, it just doesn't have the same scale and magnitude of, as an example, ACA. So for us to really achieve our sales results, we have to have across-the-board strength in our sales, excluding ACA and excluding our time and attendance product. So I guess the long and short of it is, yes, it helped, but it wasn't material in the grand scheme of things. And the deadline is approaching. So it's likely that will continue like a lot of these changes in regulations and complexity, no different than ACA. We expect it to continue to help with sales and help drive demand for our products even after the deadline, which I believe is in December of this year. But it just doesn't feel like it's having the same magnitude and same kind of scale impact that we had with ACA. And part of that might be that the ACA rules were really deadline driven, and there was a form that needed to be filled out and filed. In this case, these are just changes in rules, and so it's a slightly different decision for clients and prospects around -- in some cases, if they go 6 months without the right tools to be able to manage the new environment, there's really no consequences other than the risk of a potential investigation or a fine or whatnot, which is obviously a real risk. But it's just different from a deadline-driven event like ACA."

And I think just by way of comparison, we went back and looked historically outside, of course, times where we had recessions and other economic challenges. But in Q1 of '14, we had 1% sales growth, and that was following on Q1 of '13, 15% growth. And so this -- the scenario this quarter was we have flat growth over last year's first quarter of around 14% sales growth. And so I think that when you look at kind of just the size and the scale of these numbers and you look at the way we laid out our forecast for the year, then I think that you can probably deduce that the second half we expect mathematically to be stronger from a growth rate standpoint than the first half. I also just want to ace and add that we have the same kind of issue in the second quarter where we had sequential increase last year's second quarter, the 15%.

So the businesses that we've had some challenges with last year, which I think we were clear that was concentrated in the mid-market, have shown, I think, improvement for several quarters, including this quarter. But as you know, like -- or we have a number of different businesses. We're a global company. We have downmarket, mid-market, upmarket, multinationals. Some of our businesses are also lumpy, particularly our upmarket businesses and our BPO businesses. And so we feel good about the progress we've made where we made the investments to stabilize and the investments we made in service. As you know, we're making some longer-term investments in terms of some of these new locations. But that's a longer-term -- we did a lot of short-term things to stabilize and improve, and we've seen results from that. But again, sometimes, retention can be uneven just because of the lumpiness. It's just the way the math works. But we feel pretty good about where we are. We believe that we are on a good trajectory here in terms of continuing to do migrations and upgrades, which allows us to stay on track for what our objectives are without putting additional incremental pressure on retention. So the fact that we've gone back to -- this is now probably the second quarter where we've gone back and started our upgrades at a, I would call, normal reasonable pace, and we've been able to continue to make improvements in our mid-market retention rates. So that tells me that part of the issue was related to the upgrades themselves. But it was also related to just the service challenges, pressure from ACA just because of volumes of work and a couple of other factors. So we believe we've done the right things, and we feel like we're on the right track. And we're also sticking to our plans around our migrations and our upgrades of our clients, because I think it just strengthens us competitively over the long term."

And I will answer directly to your PEO question but also put the margin question in a little -- bigger project -- bigger picture because there's a lot going on, on margin. And clearly, we had great margin expansion this first quarter, but we are trying to send a signal that, that might not be continuing throughout the year, and the pass-through actually play a big role in it. So we had -- to answer your first question directly, the operational scale that we saw in the PEO was solid, about 90 basis points. Clearly, that's ahead of our long-term kind of expectation. So we do see and want to make progress on the efficiencies, but it was probably a very good quarter for them. And I would caution you to anticipate that type of level of productivity improvement in the long run. But clearly, all our businesses need to deliver scale, and we're sticking with our own long-term expectations of driving the margin in the company of 50 to 75 basis points. Now relative to the performance in this quarter, you will be able to dissect this once you go through the Q a little bit more detail. But the pass-through pressure that we had this year, because the PEO was growing actually faster than the overall company, was actually depressing ADP's margin by about 85 basis points. Now the pass-through pressure is typically actually higher. And if you calculate that as between 150 and 200 basis points of pressure, we call this a portfolio effect, the lower-margin business of PEO is growing faster than ES. And this quarter, we were helped because that typical -- that higher margin pressure that the pass-throughs give us abated due to that good renewal. That renewal, we're expecting to grow out of it by the second half of the year. So that is going to be a big contributor to slower margin expansion for the second half of the year. You will also see that -- and we mentioned it on our call that we had flat sales growth. And it's a long-standing tradition that if sales are growing slower, our marketing and sales expense is growing slower. So that contributed to the chunk of scale that we anticipate, clearly, per Carlos' discussion, just the prior question, to abate as we accelerate our sales in the second half of the year. And then the scaling of our ACA business plays an important role. Clearly, you're all aware that the revenue stream started really in the second half of the ACA business, while in the first half of last fiscal year '16, we made implementation and operational investments to build the business. So we started to see the revenue contribution kick in. And the pressure that the building of the ACA business exuded on the business in the first half of last fiscal year is -- has abated. We are reaping the revenue, and the business is profitable. And so the scaling of the ACA business also had a meaningful impact on the margin expansion this quarter. And clearly, we expect that actually to abate also in the second half of the year because the business started to generate revenue in the second half of last fiscal year."

And so that obviously -- the very first point that Jan made, I think that helps -- obviously, mathematically, it makes it easier for the PEO to achieve greater margin improvement when they have slower pass-through cost growth. We generally see that as having been that business for many years that slower pass-through growth is related to lower health care benefit renewals, which is -- should be a very big positive from a competitive standpoint. So as you're hearing, seeing a lot of headlines about increasing health inflation and the discipline that our business has around selling and renewing clients I think has, as of this last open enrollment for the PEO, led to very, very competitive renewal rates that are having this impact on the revenue growth, but it's a very, very big positive for that business."

And we certainly don't have a lot of contracts of that size and that scale with or without the government. And so the original genesis of that account was it came through an acquisition of a company called SHPS that we acquired several years back, where we acquired other benefits administration assets that we were interested in. And this account came with it. And with it came the risk of when these contracts get put out to bid, you don't always win. And so we took a calculated risk when we made that acquisition, not just with this account but like with all acquisitions, and that was one of the items that came along with that acquisition. But it was also an account that -- I can't remember how many months ago it was, but I believe there was a public release by WageWorks regarding the winning of that account.

So we think there's a number of ways that we could benefit from this in terms of stronger sales, additional revenues, as an add-on module, halo effect in terms of marketing and thought leadership.

So our plan is, every quarter, to let basically that tax benefit fall through to the bottom line, and we would update our guidance for the total EPS growth one-on-one as the tax benefit or the tax hurt is incurred. We have done a historic analysis of our performance under this, so to speak, a pro forma backwards. And historically, we have experienced benefit out of those accounting rules.

As you heard from our comments, we did build in what we're calling dual operations costs to avoid the last part that you mentioned, which is transition challenges you also -- we want to make sure that we have people trained and ready before we move work. But there's obviously always -- you have to manage through that kind of transition risk as well. To be clear, this is not -- we're not moving 90% of our associates. We're moving -- anywhere between 5% and 10% of our associates. So over time, we expect that to have the kind of positive impacts we're talking about in terms of incremental revenue growth, improved service, et cetera. But this is a -- not a onetime, overnight dramatic move that is intended to create an enormous amount of risk or, frankly, disruption for our associates because we had a long history of treating our people right. We have highly tenured associates who have been very loyal to the company. And so we're being very, very careful and methodical on how we do this and how we communicate to our associates so that we can move on with our business plans but also treat people the right way. But having said all that, the idea, as we said, I think previously, is to, most importantly, deliver better integrated service through intact teams of multiple modules of HCM. And so the intention would be that there would be a benefit to retention. We don't have a scientific way of forecasting that. We're telling you when that will happen, and it certainly is not expected to happen this year because we're just in the process of getting these places all ramped up and scaled. And obviously, the effect of having better service, a better reputation and being able to cross some more easily should have some impact on our ability to sell and on our revenue growth as well. But again, those are hypothetical that are very hard to forecast, and we're certainly not building anything into our forecast for this year. But we're not doing it just to take risk. We're doing it because we see benefits in terms of operational efficiencies, potential retention and potential growth down the line."

I think that's consistent with what we've said in the past that we're on track, and we're seeing it now that we're on track to have our mid-market clients on our WFN current version platform by the end of this fiscal year or within a month or 2 after that. And then when you move up into the upmarket, we have migrated some clients over to Vantage. And we have plans underway to continue those migrations. But those are literally one at a time, whereas in the downmarket and in the RUN, they are just large groups of clients that we would migrate every week. In the upmarket, it's one at a time, talking to each client individually, creating a schedule and creating a path. But we have done migrations, and we will continue to do migrations in the upmarket, but that will take considerably longer than what we did in our downmarket business, which took us probably over the course of 2 to 3 years to migrate all of those clients. So we're very happy with the progress. We believe that when we migrate our clients, we're creating more defensible bigger mote against competition. We believe that it creates an opportunity for us to sell additional products and services. And we believe it strengthens our relationships with our clients.

And then we are getting to a point now where -- that we're going to have to migrate them or upgrade them. And so we probably have some of that as well. So I don't think there's an enormous amount of that. It's not like we only have the hard ones left and the ones who didn't want to go. But just being realistic in the sense that -- and also deferent to our associates who have still all the hard work ahead of them over the next 3 quarters or so because it's not going to be easy getting across the finish line. But our volumes now at a -- are at a more manageable level where I think we're doing a much higher-quality job. So we feel good about our ability to do it. But your questions are, I think, fair, and I think the answer is the scales are balanced."

Thanks for joining our call and for your continued interest in ADP. This morning, we reported solid results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2016 with revenue up 8% for the quarter and 7% for the year. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, fiscal 2016 revenue grew 8%. 
Please keep in mind that our 8% growth in fiscal 2016 was negatively impacted by about 1 percentage point from the sale of our AdvancedMD business, which occurred at the end of the first fiscal quarter. 
In addition to the solid fiscal 2016 revenue growth, I'm very pleased with the robust new business bookings results we experienced during fiscal 2016, posting 12% growth for the year. This represents $1.75 billion in new recurring revenue generated by our sales force during the fiscal year. 
Strong sales of Human Capital Management modules that assist clients in compliance with Affordable Care Act contributed meaningfully to the outperformance we have seen in new business bookings for the past 2 fiscal years. 
This important regulatory change impacted the HCM industry in material ways. ADP responded well and sold our ACA compliance solutions to about half of our addressable base in a relatively short period of time. Because of this very strong recent performance and the resulting difficult compare, we expect fiscal 2017 new business bookings to grow 4% to 6% from the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal 2016. If achieved, this will result in a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of 9%, which is within our long-term expected range of 8% to 10%. 
Fiscal 2016 was an exciting year that showcased ADP's agility as we continue to adapt to the dynamic needs of our clients. When we look back at our progress, it's clear that the long-term trends we see with respect to the changing nature of how work is done, the increasing complexity of regulatory compliance, the trend toward harnessing the power of big data in HR and the need to work seamlessly across geographic borders are all having positive impacts on our success. We've responded to these trends in many ways during the year. For example, across the portfolio, we've dramatically improved the user experience of our clients employees. In doing so, we've made our products easy to use and more consistent with how employees engage with consumer technology and social media. 
If your company is an ADP client, I invite you to join the more than 8 million users of ADP's mobile app to experience this for yourself. 
We've leveraged our unique data set of 26 billion payroll records to introduce significant new data analytics capabilities. Since introducing ADP DataCloud just over 1 year ago, we now have more than 2,500 clients using this solution to generate actionable insights that help address workforce productivity, contribute to talent development and assist with employee retention. 
We've expanded our capabilities geographically and can now meet the payroll processing and compliance needs of companies with operation in more than 110 countries and territories, which is a key differentiator in our industry. 
And we met the challenges presented by the implementation of the Affordable Care Act in the U.S. With strong demand for our ACA solutions, we made investments in operational resources and successfully helped more than 25,000 clients, process more than 10 million Form 1095-Cs, the most significant new employee tax form introduced by the IRS since the W2. 
As we've discussed, we believe our investments to innovate and simplify our portfolio are essential for our long-term success. We believe our strategic platforms now deliver best-in-class HCM capabilities in each of the markets they serve, and we've seen solid retention rates from clients on our strategic platforms. Therefore, continuing to upgrade clients to our modern cloud solutions remains a critical area of focus for us and is the right thing to do for our clients. 
Today, all of our Small Business clients are on the RUN platform. And during the fourth quarter, we increased the pace of our client migrations in the mid-market, and now have about 49,000 clients on the latest versions of Workforce Now. With 2/3 of this base now upgraded, we expect the balance of our Workforce Now clients to be transitioned to the current platform by the end of fiscal '17.
As we continue to move clients on to our strategic platforms and have more clients engaging ADP for multiple services across the HCM spectrum, we are embarking on a path to simplify our service model for our associates and our clients. 
Over the past several years, our technology platforms have evolved to meet the dynamic needs of our clients who are choosing to engage in a more comprehensive way with their HCM providers. 
As a result of this shift, a new approach to service is essential to support the HCM companies that we've become and extend our leadership in this growing market. And I'm, therefore, excited to tell you about a service initiative we are kicking off in fiscal 2017. 
This new initiative is designed to better align our service organization to work across traditional lines, leverage best-in-class service tools and processes and establish teams with expertise across the HCM spectrum. We believe this will enhance the client experience and at the same time, allow us to better transfer knowledge among these service teams and offer robust career opportunities within the service organization, all of which benefits our clients and our associates. 
As we begin to build out this new service model, we believe there's a benefit to be gained by co-locating certain U.S. service capabilities at existing and new ADP locations in the U.S. that have the scale to support this strategy. 
We have had positive experiences creating centers like these at sites such as El Paso, Texas; Augusta, Georgia, among other places. We've recently selected Norfolk, Virginia and Macon, Florida, near Orlando, as our next 2 locations and have started building cross functional service teams at both sites. We will announce a third new site in the Western part of the U.S. later this year. 
As part of this initiative, we will focus on building service capabilities within these and our existing other locations, while streamlining our geographic footprint. 
In connection with these efforts, ADP will be making certain investments in fiscal 2017, which are expected to put some pressure on our margin expansion goals for the year. Jan will provide more detail when he reviews fiscal 2017 outlook. However, we do expect our margin expansion this fiscal 2017 to be lower than our long-term goal of 50 to 75 basis points as we make these important investments. 
Now I'll spend a few moments on retention. During the fourth quarter, we experienced a retention decline of 80 basis points, and for the full fiscal year, retention declined about a point to 90.5%. 
Similar to previous quarters, we continue to see a concentration of losses from clients who are still on legacy technology. And while we have seen some of the benefits from investments we've made in service during the early part of fiscal 2016, we continue to experience variability in our retention metric. 
In closing, fiscal 2016 was an exciting and challenging year for ADP. We achieved strong revenue growth, driven by sales of additional HCM modules to support clients with the new ACA requirements. We invested in implementation and operational resources to support this revenue growth, while still delivering solid margin expansion. And we did this while remaining consistent with our commitment to shareholder-friendly actions. 
During fiscal 2016, we returned about $2.1 billion in cash through dividends and share repurchases and increased our dividend for the 41st consecutive year. 
I'm confident that as we successfully execute against our strategy, we'll continue to drive results for our clients, our associates and our shareholders. 
And with that, I'll turn over the call to Jan, who will review our fiscal 2016 financials and share our fiscal 2017 outlook."

During the fourth quarter, we took a severance charge of $48 million that was related to a broad-based workforce optimization effort. Certain non-GAAP measures in my commentary to follow exclude the impact of this charge as well as certain other onetime items recognized earlier in the fiscal year. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental charts of our Investor Relations website. 
As Carlos mentioned, fiscal year 2016 was a successful year for ADP. New business bookings grew 12% to $1.75 billion sold. Revenues grew 7% to $11.7 billion. Excluding the impacts of foreign currency translation, revenues grew 8% for the year.
On a reported basis, net earnings grew 8% and diluted earnings per share grew 12%. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT grew 10% or 11% on a constant dollar basis. 
For the year, adjusted EBIT margin expanded 60 basis from the 18.8% in fiscal year 2015. I'm pleased with this solid margin expansion, which includes the impact of investments in operational resources that were made during the fiscal year as we supported our clients through the first year of the ACA-related reporting requirements. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $3.26, reflecting a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. 
In addition to delivering this solid operating performance, we have paid more than $900 million in dividends and returned about $1.2 billion through share repurchases for fiscal year 2016. 
During the fourth quarter, ADP returned $100 million to shareholders through share repurchases, which was at a reduced pace compared with prior quarters. Market conditions were not a factor, and our long-standing commitment to return cash to our shareholders remains unchanged. 
So now for a discussion of our segment results. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 5% for the year with 6% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions to new recurring revenues during the fiscal year from strong new business bookings sold. As Carlos discussed, client revenue retention decreased 80 basis points in the fourth quarter. And for the year, revenue retention declined about 1 point to 90.5%. 
Our same-store pays per control in the U.S. grew 2.5% for the fiscal year. Average client fund balances grew 3% for the year or 4% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was slower than in prior years, primarily related to the declines of state unemployment insurance collections as a result of an improving labor market in the U.S. This, in combination with the impact on client losses experienced into the year, has put added pressure on the client funds balance growth. 
Our business outside of North America continues to perform well despite an uncertain global environment. This performance is driven by continued strong demand for our multinational solutions, which served businesses of all sizes and are now the largest contributor to our sales outside of North America. 
Employer Services segment margin increased about 60 basis points for the fiscal year. This increase was driven by reduced selling expenses in the fourth quarter compared to last year's fourth quarter, partially offset by the negative impact of planned investments made throughout the year to support our clients with the first year of ACA compliance. 
The PEO had a successful year, posting revenue growth of 16% and average worksite employee growth of 13%. 
Let me make a few comments about fourth quarter revenue growth in the PEO, which trended lower at 13% growth compared with the previous 3 quarters in fiscal year 2016. 
This revenue growth deceleration was based on 2 factors. First, regarding our gross revenues, which include pass-throughs, our clients experienced a favorable impact from lower health care renewal premiums during our fourth quarter, which contributed to a lower relative growth in our pass-through revenues. 
Second, in the fourth quarter, we noticed some variability in the timing of payrolls run by our clients. This type of timing variability has occurred in the past and should not be viewed as an indicator of any underlying change in the fundamentals of the business. We remain pleased with the performance of our PEO, which have strong worksite employee growth of 13%, and we are happy to see that the PEO also delivered strong margin expansion of approximately 70 basis points for fiscal year 2016, which was primarily driven by operating and selling efficiencies from increased productivity. 
This is solid overall performance for fiscal year 2016 with strong new business bookings, yielding healthy revenue growth and solid margin expansion despite the additional investments we made during the year. I'm pleased with our results and will now take you through our expectations for fiscal year 2017. 
As Carlos mentioned, for fiscal year 2017, we are  expecting new business bookings growth of 4% to 6% from $1.75 billion sold in fiscal year 2016. We anticipate total revenue growth of 7% to 9% for the year, which is not expected to be significantly impacted by foreign currency translation based on current rates. This forecast assumes 4% to 5% revenue growth in the Employer Services segment and growth in pays per control of 2.5%. Revenue growth for the PEO is expected to be 14% to 16%.
ADP's adjusted EBIT margin is expected to expand 25 to 50 basis points from the 19.5% in fiscal year 2016, which is below our goal of 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion over the longer run. We are still committed to this margin improvement goal over the longer term, but as Carlos mentioned, we are making investments in fiscal year 2017 to align our service model and support of our technology strategy. We expect this operational investments will put about 20 basis points of pressure on our fiscal year 2017 margins. And as a result of these buildout of the new facilities, total expenditures -- capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 are expected to be about $250 million. 
In addition to these investments, we also anticipate certain onetime charges of $100 million to $125 million throughout fiscal year 2018. Of this, $45 million is expected to be incurred during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and $45 million in the latter part of the year with the remainder expected in fiscal year 2018. These charges are excluded from our fiscal year 2017 forecast for adjusted EBIT margin expansion and from our adjusted diluted earnings per share forecast. A reconciliation of these metrics can be found in this morning's press release and in the supplemental slides on our investor relations website. 
On a segment level, we anticipate pretax margin expansion of about 50 basis points for Employer Services and 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion in the PEO. 
On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share is expected to grow 6% to 8% compared with the $3.25 in fiscal year 2015. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow at 10% to 12% from the adjusted $3.26 in fiscal year 2016 and contemplates an adjusted effective tax rate of 33.3%, consistent with the 33.3% at fiscal year 2016. 
In accordance with our continued shareholder-friendly actions and our intention to return excess cash to shareholders, our earnings per share forecast assumes that excess cash of $1 billion to $1.4 billion will be returned via share repurchases during the fiscal year 2017. This forecasted range includes anticipated share repurchases requires to offset employee benefit plan issuance, and the timing of these share repurchases is dependent upon market conditions. 
So with that, I will take you through our forecast for the client fund extended investment strategy. First, a reminder that the objectives of our investment strategy remain the safety, liquidity and diversification of our assets. 
As of the end of the fiscal year, approximately 80% of our fixed income portfolio was invested in AAA and AA rated securities. In a typical year, our strategy results in about 15% to 20% of our fixed income investments maturing. And this year, we expect the percentage of maturities will be closer to the lower end of this range. We continue to base the interest rate assumptions in our forecast on the Fed Funds future contracts for the client short and corporate cash portfolios and the forward yield curves of the 3.5- and 5-year U.S. government agency forward yield curves for the client and corporate extended and the client loan portfolios, respectively. And as we do not believe it is possible to accurately predict future interest rates, the shape of the yield curve and the new bond issuance behavior of corporate and other issuers. 
For fiscal year 2017, we anticipate growth in the average client funds balances of 2% to 4% from the $22.4 billion in fiscal year 2016. 
We anticipate that the yield of the client fund portfolio will remain about flat at 1.7% compared with fiscal year 2016.
These factors are expected to result in an increase of up to $5 million to client fund interest revenue. The total contribution from the client funds extended investment strategy is expected to be about flat to fiscal year 2016. The detail of this forecast is available in the supplemental slides on our website.

In terms of the other questions, the -- we did have some time to kind of reset how we were doing migrations and the pace also based on -- I mentioned that there were 3 factors that I think impacted our retention back over the last 3 quarters, and we think one of them was the pace of migrations and also the execution around migration. So a lot of work was done during what we call our year-end blackout because we really prefer not to do migrations anyway in the, call it, in November to January, February time frame because there's so many things going on at the calendar year end in a typical HCM payroll company. And so that gives a little bit of time for those folks to focus on kind of stabilizing that organization and rethinking what the proper pace is. And to put it in perspective, we migrated approximately 4,000 clients during the quarter. And when we experienced challenges with some of the migrations, we were up as high as 7,000 in a quarter. This is back in the beginning of this fiscal year. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color. And I think the overall comment is, clearly, I think our competitors are fishing in those waters because we see them in the numbers in terms of our losses being concentrated in our legacy platforms, and we're trying to reduce the size of the fishing pond. So there's still some variability there in the retention, but I think we've gotten better at how we're doing the migrations and I think our pace is more manageable and I think easier for us to control at this point."

But I think that it does -- the math, I think it does kind of work within maybe 0.5 point to 1 point one way or the other, depending on your perspective because we don't provide exact numbers, but we want to reiterate that we had strong growth in new business bookings this year, excluding ACA. And then mathematically, with that, creates grow over for next year because we -- I think, we've previously said and will say it today that we don't expect the same level of new business bookings from ACA since we've already sold half of our addressable market even if we assume that we sell half of the remaining half next year. That creates a mathematical grow over issue for us. So I'll let maybe Jan comment on the math. But I think the message you'd hear from us is that we believe, over the course of the 3 years, as you can imagine, we look very carefully about, is the sales strength coming from core operations, is it coming from additional business, is it coming from ACA, and we feel pretty good on a 3-year compounded basis about where our new business bookings growth is right now."

And you can also look at, is the decline driven by slowing of ACA sales in fiscal year '17. And that is yes, because we have addressed already half of our business opportunity in the first year, and we don't expect to close -- cover 100% of the sales opportunity in fiscal year '17. So we have to make assumptions about that. And so both are in line within a percentage point plus minus. So this is for government work and estimate that our future is intact."

And just the strong new business bookings growth has created a bigger gap between our starts, we call our starts and our losses, and I think that has contributed to this accelerating growth in Employer Services. I think you're right that the losses that we experienced this year obviously have an effect this year, and they have an effect on the following year as well. But again, back to kind of simplistic math for government work, I think we're  probably plus or minus half a point in terms of ES revenue growth. So maybe some of that is rounding, but we don't feel any weakness, I guess, to be clear and the ACA revenues, Jan probably has the exact number. That clearly provided lift in our new business bookings and thus, provide lift to revenues that then also presents somewhat of a grow with this. It's not as pronounced to grow over because it's a revenue number versus the new business bookings number, but it does have the same impact.

Just a follow-up question on the retention. So last quarter, you had mentioned you're taking some steps that are improving the service capability, which gave you some more confidence around retention, but we still saw the retention go or decline. Now my question was when you think about the mid-market customer base, you still have 25,000 customers remaining, which are going to be migrated over the next 4 quarters. And normally, you don't do the migration in November, December, which would imply like around north of 6,000 customers being migrated every quarter versus 4,000 that you saw in the last quarter. So with this elevated level of migration, how should we think about retention going forward? Could we see retention get worse before it starts to get better? So any clarity that you can provide on the retention front? That would be helpful."

The only thing I would add to that math is that you do have to apply a retention or a loss factor to that 25,000 itself. Over the course of 12 months, we naturally -- even if we weren't migrating, we'd lose, call it, 10% of those clients. It might be a little bit higher than that just because they are legacy-type clients. So the absolute number that you're starting with that you have to divide over 4 quarters is a little bit smaller, but you're in the right ballpark. It's probably around 5,000-or-so clients that need to be migrated per quarter. We feel pretty comfortable with that pace given the infrastructure that we've created and the new process we have for migrations. In terms of additional color, as you're pointing out, the results didn't cooperate with our desires and with our intentions. And in part, that's because our retention is a reflection of the overall company's results, and there's variability across a lot of other businesses. So I wouldn't read into it even though we still have a concentration of our retention issues in the mid-market, and they have been for this fiscal year. There is another $8 billion to $9 billion of revenue in ADP that also has experience in variability in retention. But having said that, to give you specifics around why our confidence level was high that things would get better and why it still remains high, we have a number of -- in specifically, the mid-market issues that we were experiencing with regards to retention, we have a lot of metrics, as you can imagine, that we look at that are leading indicators versus retention, which is a lagging indicator. For example, the speed to answer phone calls, the number of cases that are unresolved in a backlog, there's just -- we have a number of escalations in terms of people escalating client service issues. And the metrics are -- most of the metrics in the mid-market regarding service experience for our clients are either back to where they were prior to our retention issues or in some cases, better. And so we feel confident that even if there's some kind of lag in the sense that some clients may have already been in process due to a poor service experience at looking at alternatives and the fact that there are other parts of ADP that have variability in retention as well, I think notwithstanding all those things, I think my confidence in the improvements in service stability and service experience in the mid-market remained quite high actually."

And so year-end -- calendar year-end on the third quarter for us, fiscal year are traditionally higher loss months and the fourth quarter month is a lower loss month. So hence, the candy variability in the quarterly shifts of the retention numbers, in this case, it impacted a relatively low loss volume that we typically experience in the fourth quarter. So my general council would be to observe those retention changes that we report, but not to get overly analytical and mathematical quarter-by-quarter. It is a better indicator to think about basically our retention number of 100 basis points decline. So the fiscal year, because we're aiming to be better. We don't guide to retention. But as you might imagine as a company, we clearly have aspirations to improve."

So as a consequence, approximately 5% of our employee population is going to be transferring or moving or at work, we'll be moving and impacting about 5% of our associate population in this fiscal year. And there are costs that are related to this, which we are non-GAAP-ing, which are related in essence to employee cost to facilitate the transfer of the work. That is basically included in the 20 basis points of our guidance. And we clearly hope that the outcome of this service alignment initiative is multi-folded. I believe strongly it will enhance our service value proposition because we're going to have larger centers with bigger capabilities, leveraging ADP's strength in compliance and service and offering a better value proposition to our clients, which is the most exciting part for the service alignment initiative, hopefully resulting in better competitiveness and high retention rates. And also as you can see, these centers are located in geographies of the U.S. that offer certain advantages relative to the cost that where they operate. So there should be, in the longer run, also contribution to our margins. We're a little bit hesitant to specify this for '18 because the initiative will actually bleed over into fiscal year of '18. We mentioned, in particular, center in the west is going to come on later in '17 and will bleed over '18. So in '18 will still have some impact, but we are clearly hoping that it will guarantee basically that we can fulfill our commitment to the 50 to 75 basis points of margin expansion in the long run.

And so the service delivery issues that we experience were concentrated in a particular part of our business in the mid-market, and they were execution-related. And I think what we are talking about in terms of our new service alignment initiative is a broad strategic objective across the entire company. It's partly driven by the fact that the industry has evolved, and I think the client’s needs have evolved and the products have evolved, too. As an example, 10 years ago, having 3 or 4 different products that were serviced differently in different databases was not an issue. Our platforms now are single-database integrated solutions that provide an HCM solution if the way -- if a client wants to buy it that way in a comprehensive and seamless way. The service model had not moved in the same direction, and I think that this initiative is really intended to have our service implementation really aligned with the way the market is going, the way buyers are buying and the way clients want to be serviced. So we've done similar things in our sales organization, where that also requires that our sales force be trained and equipped to be able to sell in a new environment.

So any acquisitions that support that drive, we will actively and aggressively pursue. But it has played out over the last 3 years to a more organic growth pattern that has seen great results. And so I think that stand stays the same. I would not expect any dramatic shift in our attitude towards M&A from what you have seen in the last 3 years.

And I would just add that, back to the discussion about capital and -- or the seriousness in which we take capital deployment, we do have a strong balance sheet. So we have capital that we can deploy. But as Jan said, conceptually, it's something really fit into our technology roadmap and accelerated our progress. We'd use our capital, but we're not going to use our capital to have something that, for lack of a better term, fits next to everything else that we have. So it has to be able to be integrated rapidly and seamlessly into what we already are pursuing in terms of our product strategy. It's a little bit of a departure from, call it, 6, 7 years ago when it was really more about leveraging our distribution and adding capabilities and products without as much necessarily regard to how they fit tightly into the technology road map. And that's really nothing so much a change in strategy. It's a change in the market in the way people want to buy and the way products behave, which makes it very, very important to have tight alignment and seamlessness in your products. And then the last, just actual comment I'll make to Jan's point, is because we have capital, if something accelerated our progress, we would do it no different than we're doing some of these internal organic things that we're investing in to accelerate our progress. So if there's an external opportunity to use or capital, we would. But the fact is that, over the last couple of years, when you look at the balance of capital deployment, Jan and I have this discussion all the time, we haven't consciously avoided doing acquisitions. It's just been hard to find one that makes sense and fit in what we're doing in terms of our strategy. But net-net, when you get down to it, we're spending, call it $300 million to $400 million less on acquisitions, and we're spending more on things like internally developed products, capital expenditures and the investments that we're talking about for fiscal year '17. So it wasn't necessarily planned that way, but it just so happens that we're not necessarily deploying any more capital, but we're just deploying it in a slightly different way.

We'll give you a little bit of color, then maybe Jan can add in terms of what he's hearing out in the field. So it's interesting the term dedicated reps because we do have parts of our business obviously in the upmarket and national accounts will have very specific people that service specific clients. And then when you get into the Small Business market, we tend to have a model where the execution and the delivery is very important, but the person that you reach isn't as important. We believe that's the right model. We believe our retention rates and our growth in the Small Business market prove that our model works as long as you execute well. And we would also argue that, in today's world, having a dedicated rep who works for 8 hours a day might not be the best service model for a small company or any other company. So we prefer to focus on how and what's the best way to deliver the best service to the client in the way they want it delivered. And it varies from Small Business up to the upmarket in terms of whether you need a dedicated person or not. But I would encourage you to kind of visualize the service realignment as being more around teams rather than dedicated people. So having alignment around teams. So as an example, given the attach rates that we've discussed over multiple quarters that we're experiencing now in the mid-market and in the upmarket around additional HCM modules, in other words, clients are rarely buying just payroll by itself or just benefits administration by itself. So this service model really is intended to be able to provide a group of people or a team of people who work together who are co-located and can deliver service across the entire HCM spectrum. That obviously requires some cross-training, but also some ability for people who have special skills to be available and close to people who need to support our clients on a multiple number of issues. So we have reasonable amount of experience in experimenting with what we call intact teams or with co-located teams. And we feel pretty good about the results when it comes to retention, when it comes to client satisfaction. And by the way, in our business, when you have those 2 things, margin follows. So this is primarily led by quality and experience for the client and also, by the way, opportunity for our associates. So what we have found also is in some of our subscale locations has very, very limited mobility and opportunity for associates to progress from a career standpoint. And we now have a number of opportunities across our business for people to learn new things and to move in a different areas, whether it's time and attendance and payroll, benefits administration, talent management, we really run the whole gamut on HCM, and we have needs across the entire business. And when we have people scattered across the entire country in small subscale locations, it just doesn't, I think, make sense from a talent management standpoint for ourselves internally either. And so on all those fronts, we think that this service alignment strategy makes sense."

We have seen a rise in our associate engagement scores as a consequence for those who work in those intact teams, and it reflects probably better of how in a modern team environment our associates want to work. So that's really exciting for our associates as well. And I have one additional component that is strategic move on locations allows you to plan for is also a coordinated effort between our market segments, small, medium and large. So I think we mentioned it in the call. So now we have co-location between those market segments and can be natural growth and exchange our best practices between the different platforms. And for some of the platforms, the back end is fairly similar. If you think about centers of excellence for our tax filing operation and so forth, so it allows us also to create buckets of scale that are very hard to create in smaller locations. So it really, I believe, will transform of how our associates be perceiving, A, the value of the job they're in and the job opportunities that they can reach in the future and allows us to deliver additional service capabilities to our clients, which is the strategic benefit that's leaping out of it."

So maybe the only spot that has been a little bit harder was Europe, as you might imagine, and our best-of-breed solutions, but that was really more balanced like a good demand for multinational solutions. So when we look at the plan other than specific grow-over challenges that we had because ACA sales were concentrated in the mid-market and in the upmarket, if you take that out, it's really -- each of the business units continues with very good performance. And just as a reminder, it is -- it was $1.75 billion of recurring revenue that sales force generated for ADP. And even if the growth is a few percentage points slower, it's kind of still a very significant number."

So you've had 2 years of above-trend bookings, you got pays per control continuing to click along at a similar pace. You had a drag this year from selling the business that will no longer be a drag in 2017, and retention was a drag. I guess, you're not saying specifically, but maybe still a drag, but it sounds like a lesser one potentially in 2017. So why don't -- you've always said the current year bookings don't do a lot to revenue. Why wouldn't we see some acceleration? Is it as simple as PEO, you're calling for that to be slower? It just feels like there should be a bit better revenue growth from -- think it through all these moving parts."

Again, even though we don't get specific guidance, we do expect less of a drag, for example, from retention because we expect things to get better. We have some metrics and some things underlying, I think, data that gives us hope at least, right, because don't know for sure that, that will improve your math, the comments you made about new business bookings. So all those things are correct. I think I would just encourage you to maybe spend some time off-line with us in terms of kind of the math and how the revenue works. One of the interesting things about this business, this is an incredibly stable and predictable business model. It's also very, very hard to move the numbers dramatically one way or the other over the course of 1 year. So over the course of 4, 5 years, we had double-digit new business bookings. And this year, we had a blip with retention, but retention has also been fairly stable. That's allowed us to accelerate our revenue growth by about 0.5 to 1 percentage point from, call it, 5 years ago in Employer Services. The PEO, as you said, also happens to be a factor because it's growing faster and it's becoming a larger portion of the overall results. So if it slows slightly, that has an impact, too. So we'll spend the time to make sure that we do the math. But what I can tell you is that you're right that, this year, if you exclude the impact of the divestiture or if you don't factor the divestiture in, we were close to 9% revenue growth. We're really proud of that. And next year, we're slightly below that because there's 1 day less because this year was a leap year or whatever the issues are. And we have a little bit of a drag still from -- even the retention is getting better, it's still not a good as it used to be. We're still going to be pretty damn happy and pretty damn proud because we're going to be in, I think, still in the high end of our guidance from a revenue standpoint. And in this business, when you get into that range, given who we are in terms of -- because we understand have a very keen insight into who we are like as a company in terms of where we want to be in terms of our growth rates and our margin improvement and the balance of those things, I think we're satisfied with that outcome. It obviously makes it easier as you pick up additional revenue growth because of the nice leverage ability of our operating model, but we're -- that's part of why we're also doing some of the things we're doing around service limit because we know that we're really not, I think, satisfied with just the results that we have today. On the other hand, we're not going to sit here and tell you that we're trying to aim for 10%, 12%, 15% revenue growth. That's really not who we are. So 7% to 9% is our long-term guidance for revenue growth with some margin improvement, with a healthy dividend. We share buybacks, that's our model, that's what we're executing against. And I'm proud of the organization and the results they've delivered this year. And I think if we deliver the results that we put out there for next year, we're going to be just as proud of that as well."
