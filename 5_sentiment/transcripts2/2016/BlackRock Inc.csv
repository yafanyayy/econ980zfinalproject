It's my pleasure to be here to present the fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and busin",1809,"Good morning. Thanks, Chris. Happy new year to everybody. It's my pleasure to be here to present the fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As usual, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. In a year characterized by significant market and FX volatility, 2015 was another strong year for BlackRock as we generated industry-leading organic growth, maintained stable operating margins while continuing to invest in our business and returned approximately $2.6 billion of capital to our shareholders, representing a total payout ratio of 77%. The differentiation and strength of BlackRock's diverse global investment platform once again enabled us to generate consistent and stable financial results, allowing us to continue playing offense despite global macro uncertainty. We saw strong results from our core business areas and remain committed to investing in a variety of strategic initiatives that will further enhance our client value proposition and generate long-term value for our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated operating income of $1.1 billion and earnings per share of $4.75. Full year operating income of $4.7 billion increased 3% versus a year ago and earnings per share of $19.60 were up 1%, which included the impact of higher tax rate in 2015. Nonoperating results for the quarter included $46 million of net investment gains, primarily driven by $35 million unrealized gain on a strategic private equity investment. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 30% compared to a tax rate of 25.4% a year ago that reflected $39 million of nonrecurring discrete tax benefits. We continued to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for 2016, reflecting changes in our geographic business mix, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring items that could arise during the year. 
BlackRock's fourth quarter results were driven by $54 billion of long-term net new business, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 5% and the third highest flow quarter in BlackRock's history and reflects resilience of our differentiated business model. For the full year 2015, BlackRock generated long-term net new business of $152 billion, representing a 4% long-term organic AUM growth rate and a 6% organic base fee growth rate as faster growth in our higher-fee Retail and iShares businesses contributed to a favorable overall change from our base fee mix. Long-term net inflows were diversified by asset class and investment style with positive flows across these categories for the full year. 
BlackRock continued to deliver top line growth despite the challenging market as fourth quarter revenue of $2.9 billion and full year revenue of $11.4 billion were both 3% higher than a year ago. Organic growth and improved investment performance drove increases in base fees, performance fees and Aladdin revenue, all of which reached record levels in 2015. 
Fourth quarter and full year base fees each rose 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by organic growth despite over $150 billion of negative FX impact and market depreciation on our AUM over the last 12 months. FX was a significant drag in 2015, and we estimate that full year base fees grew 6% versus 2014 levels on a constant-currency basis. Sequentially, quarterly base fees were essentially flat despite positive organic growth due to a lower fourth quarter AUM entry rate, the continued impact of divergent beta on our fee rate as emerging and commodities markets once again underperformed developed markets and ongoing dollar appreciation against foreign currencies. Performance fees for the fourth quarter were $169 million, up 17% from a year ago, driven by our broad suite of active offerings, but down $39 million sequentially due to a single hedge funds that delivered exceptional full year performance and lapped in the third quarter. Full year performance fees of $621 million rose 13% versus 2014, evidencing strong alpha generation across our diverse investment platform. 
Fourth quarter BlackRock Solutions revenue of $171 million was up 1% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Full year 2015 Aladdin revenue of $528 million, which represented 82% of BRS revenue grew 11% year-over-year driven by severable sizable client implementations and has more than doubled since 2009. We expect continued business momentum in Aladdin driven by transferring global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset business solutions. Our financial markets advisory business ended 2015 with $118 million in revenue. Despite lower levels of opportunistic revenue post-financial crisis, FMA is benefiting from a more stable revenue profile driven by increased number of mandates and more repeat engagements in the current market environment. 
Total expense for the fourth quarter was $90 million year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in compensation and G&A expense. For the full year 2015, compensation expense increased $184 million or 5% due to higher headcount associated with our growth initiatives, higher incentive and deferred compensation, partly offset by the impact of the stronger dollar. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full year basis. 
Fourth quarter G&A expense increased $23 million year-over-year or 6%, primarily driven by $23 million of deal-related expense associated with strategic transactions executed in the quarter. Sequentially, quarterly G&A expense increased $91 million, primarily reflected a planned uptake in year-end marketing and promotional spend, higher technology expense and the previously mentioned $23 million in deal-related expense. Full year G&A expense of $1.4 billion was 2% below 2014 levels, reflecting expense awareness in a volatile market environment, notwithstanding the G&A spend in the fourth quarter. If markets stabilize and given the impact of recent acquisitions on our run rate, we would anticipate a higher level -- higher annual level of G&A spend during 2016. Overall, total expense for 2015 increased 3% from a year ago compared to a similar increase in revenue over the same period, resulting in an as-adjusted operating margin of 42.9% for the full year, flat to our 2014 level. We remain committed to generating operating leverage in our business and have expanded our operating margin by over 450 basis points since closing the BGI acquisition at the end of 2009. However, as we stated in the past, we also do not manage the business to a specific margin target, either quarter to quarter or year to year. The diversification and stability of our business model affords us the option of investing through end market cycles to grow share. We remain keenly focused on delivering long-term value for our shareholders by striking an appropriate balance between organically investing for future growth and practical discretionary expenses. 
At times, our strategic investments will also be inorganic. During 2015, BlackRock closed several transactions, including Blackrock Kelso Capital Advisors, a domestic middle market lending platform; E Quadrata, a Latin American infrastructure investor; and Future Adviser, a digital wealth manager. In addition, on November 3, BlackRock announced an agreement to assume investment management responsibilities for approximately $87 billion of cash and liquidity AUM currently managed by Bank of America Global Capital Management. We expect that transaction to close in the first half of 2016. 
During 2015, we also returned approximately $2.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As we entered 2016, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.29 per share of common stock, representing an increase of 5% over the prior level. Since instituting a dividend in 2003, BlackRock has grown its dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 22%. We repurchased $1.1 billion of our shares in 2015 and have now repurchased approximately 10 million shares since we instituted a consistent and predictable approach to capital management in 2013. We remain committed to this approach and a similar level of share repurchase in 2016, but could increase such amounts based on potential changes to the relative valuation of our stock price. 
Our 2015 financial results reflect the benefits of our differentiated global business model. Fourth quarter and full year net inflows of $54 billion and $152 billion, respectively, were positive in both our active and indexed franchises and benefited from significant flows into iShares. Global iShares generated $60 billion of net new business in the fourth quarter and record flows of $130 billion [ph] for the year, representing full year organic growth of 13%. IShares captured the #1 share of global, U.S. and European ETF industry flows for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Record fourth quarter equity iShares inflows of $48 billion were driven by demand for U.S. equities and a broad array of developed market exposures. Fourth quarter fixed income iShares inflows of $12 billion reflected flows into core, high-yield, investment-grade corporate bond funds. 
BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw fourth quarter inflows of $7 billion, reflecting the seasonal impact of capital gains distributions. Full year 2015 net flows of $38 billion, representing 7% organic asset growth, were driven by diversified flows across our top-performing fixed income platform. International retail net inflows totaled $20 billion in 2015 and were paced by strong flows into international equities and unconstrained fixed income, allowing BlackRock to maintain its year-to-date #1 ranking in cross-border mutual fund flows. U.S. retail net flows of $19 billion in 2015 demonstrated resilience in a challenging year for the U.S. mutual fund industry. BlackRock's institutional franchise had long-term net outflows of $13 billion for the quarter and $16 billion for the year as we continue to see sizable asset allocation-driven flows both into and out of low-fee institutional index products. However, we also continue to benefit from demand for higher-fee active offerings as clients recognize the value added alpha-generating platform we had built across traditional and alternative active strategies. The positive fee impact of this mix shift is in line with our growth strategy and enable BlackRock's institutional business to deliver organic base fee growth of 4% in 2015. We generated $4 billion of institutional flows into core alternatives during the year. Flows were broad-based across a diverse alternatives platform, including infrastructure, fund of hedge funds, fund of private equity funds and alternative solutions offerings. We ended 2015 with another strong fundraising quarter for liquid alternatives, raising $1 billion in new commitments. Over the last 3 years, we've raised more than $17 billion in commitment and have nearly $11 billion of committed capital to deploy for our clients. Committed capital translated to flows and AUM as those dollars are invested and will be a source of future revenue growth. 
In summary, in a year marked by periods of increased market volatility, divergent data and significant currency movements, our diversified business model delivered consistent financial results and allowed us to continue investing for future growth. We remain confident that BlackRock's differentiated platform is well positioned to meet the needs of our clients and shareholders in the years to come. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrated that in times of rapid change and market volatility, BlackRock's diverse business model can consistently generate strong results. Over the last year, energy",2086,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Gary. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrated that in times of rapid change and market volatility, BlackRock's diverse business model can consistently generate strong results. 
Over the last year, energy prices have deteriorated significantly and the price of oil dropping to levels not seen in more than a decade. Growth in China remains sluggish. So emerging markets, including Brazil, face difficult political and economic challenges and divergence of developed market -- monetary policy and driving heightened volatility in rates, currency and equity markets. The Federal Reserve's action to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly 10 years marked the end of a historical period of monetary policy in combination in the U.S. and the beginning of an extended gradual tightening cycle. All of these factors are leading to a much more divergent world in 2016, while higher levels of volatility ahead, as already witnessed in the first few weeks of the year. And as the investment landscape changes, our clients need change as well. 
The differentiation of BlackRock's 4 business model drives consistency in resilience in our results. This positions BlackRock to invest in our platform, investing in technology, investing in people, even in the most challenging and volatile times and to anticipate and adapt ahead of change so that we are positioned to provide our clients with investment solutions to meet their evolving needs. In a more fragmented investment landscape impacted by continual lower rates, modest beta-driven returns, investors will search for income. They'll search for capital appreciation through a combination of both active and alternative investments, factors, smart beta strategies and hybrid solutions. No other firm in the world can provide all of these capabilities on a single platform supported by superior risk management, technology and investment performance. And this is what's driving a deeper connectivity with our clients than ever before and what once again drove BlackRock's fourth quarter and full year results. 
BlackRock generated $54 billion of long-term net flows in the fourth quarter and $152 billion for the year, representing annualized organic growth of 5% and 4%, respectively. Flows were driven by client demands for both active and indexed solutions across asset categories, asset classes, across regions. We saw $61 billion in growth in a year. When most people talked about there's not demand for active strategies, we saw $61 billion in growth in our active strategies and $92 billion of growth in index and iShares flows. We generated flows of $53 billion in equities, $77 billion in fixed income, $17 billion in multi-asset and $5 billion in alternatives. We raised $38 billion in our retail platform, $130 billion in our iShares platforms. And in our institutional platform, we raised $27 billion of active strategies that was offset by $43 billion of low-fee institutional index outflows. 
What I'm particularly very pleased with is the platform and how broad it is and it's evident in 2015 in 13 countries where we had net inflows in excess of $1 billion. In addition, in 2015, we had a record amount of 65 different retail and iShare products generating more than $1 billion in net inflows. Our industry-leading organic growth story at BlackRock that we delivered in 2015 is in addition that we raised 11% growth rates in our Aladdin product. Alpha-driven performance fees and expense awareness translated to positive results in both the top and bottom line, even in the face of tremendous headwinds that we saw in global equity markets and FX. BlackRock is committed in having a deep and broad understanding of the world in which we and our clients operate and invest in. Our commitment in being truly local in more than 30 countries that we operate in worldwide completely positions BlackRock to understand our clients' needs and their specific investment requirements to better help them navigate these markets. And we're in a better position, I believe, than any other firm in the world to do that. The BlackRock Investment Institute provides a platform across regions, across asset classes, across investment styles for our investors to exchange the knowledge they built in local markets, debate investment topics, share expertise with the goal of generating better alpha and managing risks for our clients. This connectivity, this worldwide connectivity, also has enabled us to have a deeper dialogue and level of trust with clients around the world. This year, the BlackRock Investment Institute touched nearly 20,000 clients globally through in-person meetings, hosted conference calls and critical market events and in in-depth publications. This knowledge and the connective tissue, combined with the talent of our investment teams, has contributed to a strong performance across our active platform. As of the end of the fourth quarter, 91% of our active taxable fixed-income assets and 90% of our scientific active equity assets are above benchmark for peer medium for the last 3 years. Throughout 2015, we continue to make progress on the reinvigoration and globalization of our fundamental active equity business, generating strong results for our clients with 76% of our fundamental active equity assets above benchmark for peer medium for the 1-year period, highlighted by strong turnaround we've seen in our flagship Equity Dividend Fund. 
The strength of our active performance has translated into flows, as I said early in -- we saw $61 billion of flows in 2015 in our active strategies, despite a challenging year for active fund flows across our industry. We continue to diversify our institutional active platform and deepen existing client relationships by creating hybrid solution-based strategies to solve our clients' most complex investment needs. Institutional active net flows of $27 billion in 2015 were primarily driven by fixed income and multi-asset solutions, as institutions looked to BlackRock to solve their most complex investment challenges. 
On the retail side, the diversification of our EMEA retail business was a significant driver of results in 2015, and BlackRock saw active net inflows from retail clients led by our European equity and income, our unconstrained fixed-income products, our high-yield products and our multi-asset income products. In the United States, the breadth of BlackRock's product suite across active index and iShares resonated with our retail clients. We remain focused on growing globalize iShares market share and driving global market expansion, which translated into strong flows in 2050. The fourth quarter was a record quarter for iShares as investors continue to turn to BlackRock's iShares franchise, which generated $60 billion in net inflows across asset classes. For the quarter and for the year, iShares captured the #1 share of flows in the U.S., Europe, globally, with 37% global market share for the full year. 2015 iShares flow was $130 billion, primarily driven by developed market equities and fixed income. The global Core Series saw flows of $46 billion, representing a 23% organic growth. And record fixed income flows of $50 billion was concentrated in our high-yield products, including investment-grade corporate bonds and our high-yield bonds. Fixed income is a strategic priority for iShares, which led the industry and fixed income ETF flows for the quarter and for the year, driven by iShares' consistency of having 15 of the top 25 fixed income ETFs by net flows in 2015. 
Fixed income market volatility rose in December. And during this time, the market stressed BlackRock's flagship high-yield ETF, HYG, enable clients to transact directly with one another at known, transparent, minute-by-minute pricing, with ample liquidity. More than $20 billion of HYG traded in the 2 weeks ending December 18, with less than $1 billion of net redemptions, providing our markets and our clients substantial liquidity with limited impact on the underlying markets. As we look back in 2015, despite these spikes in market volatility, ETFs, and specifically iShares, are increasingly being relied upon by clients for transparent, liquid, cost-effective investment solutions. We continue to find opportunities to learn from market events to educate investors and focus on the long-term needs of our clients in iShares and across BlackRock's platform by investing in areas that we believe will result in a more complete solutions offering for our clients and deliver value for our shareholders. Being aware of what is going on in the world around us, anticipating change and having the willingness to adapt is a critical part of our responsibility as a fiduciary to our clients. 
Throughout the year, BlackRock has made significant enhancements to our platform through a combination of investments for organic growth, for acquisitions and the evolution of our talent. Technology is increasingly impacting our clients and our business. In 2015, we made investments to utilize technology to gain new investment insights and to reach our clients more effectively. We're investing in big data and text analysis to make better portfolio management decisions across our broad platform of quantitative and fundamental investment styles. Factor-based analysis will become more prevalent as market dispersion increases. We made significant enhancements to our smart beta and factor-based investing platform, including the hiring of Andrew Ang. And BlackRock generated nearly $10 billion of smart beta net inflows in 2015, driven by iShares minimum funds. We're investing in retail technology to empower our intermediary partners for a high-quality, technological-enabled advice capabilities to improve our clients' investment experiences. 
We closed on the acquisition of Future Adviser in the fourth quarter, and we recently signed our first 2 clients, representing the first B2B contracts of their kind in the U.S., digital wealth management space. We continue to see strong demand for alternative solutions as investors move beyond the boundaries of traditional strategies to investments in real estate, infrastructure, other forms of real assets across the liquid platform. Our hedge fund platform has grown 9% annually over the past 5 years and now stands at $31 billion in AUM, and we continue to invest to broaden our platform and leveraging our top-performing internal talent to deliver products organically as well as bringing in new managers. We remain focused on our responsibility to partner with clients and simultaneously generating long-term returns and create positive social outcomes. Over the past several years, we've grown our infrastructure platform to more than $7 billion. This includes the industry-leading renewable power franchise, a strong infrastructure debt capability and meaningful investments in Latin America like our acquisition and our partnership with PEMEX. These activities are for long-term benefits to both investors and economies, where they contribute to economic growth, it contributes to the country's job creation and most importantly, it contributes to a positive environmental impact. 2015, we continue to invest in the BlackRock Impact platform, which manages now more than $200 billion to provide investors with the opportunity to generate long-term competitive financial returns and positively impact society. At BlackRock, embracing change has always been a core part of who we are. Nearly every year, we take a fresh look at the organization and reflect on ways to improve it. We then evolved the organization in anticipation of changes of our clients' needs and anticipation of the global markets. Together with our Board of Directors, we undertake a deliberate process and effort to continually position our leaders and roles that can broaden their experience and maximize their potential both for BlackRock and our clients. This is critical in building a truly global firm. We did this in 2012 and 2014 with very positive benefits. This week, again, we announced a number of enhancements to our leadership team that are part of this consistent process of developing our people and evolving our organization to meet these challenging needs. Looking at the quality of the leaders, taking on new or expanded roles, I'm incredibly proud of the depth of the talent that we have. And I believe, today, we have the strongest leadership team we've ever had in the history of BlackRock. And it is the quality and talent of this team that allows BlackRock to deliver the performance we did in 2015, despite the volatile markets, and positions us very well for 2016. And it's this team, they are the reason that we've forged such a trusting relationship with our clients and why our clients are increasingly turning to BlackRock to solve their biggest financial challenges. As we head into 2016, we will continue to make investments in our future. We will continue to develop our talent and seeking ways to leverage and grow our diverse platform to meet our fiduciary responsibilities to our clients, our fiduciary responsibilities to our societies where we operate and to deliver the returns for our shareholders. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

Insurance companies are adding to their fixed income exposures now. As I've commented in the past, the whole insurance industry, or a good part of it, is short-term liability duration and are hoping for higher rates. We haven't seen higher rates. Obviously, we're sitting here with a very low 10-year treasury rate, but we most certainly seen a widening in credit spreads. And I think, as evidence of a few large bond issues that went public this week, we saw huge demand. And so as spreads widen, we expect to see more demand institutionally. And as you suggested, some of the widening of the spreads and the fears of high rates are going to produce some selling possibly from retail, but we haven't seen anything dramatic yet. We haven't seen really any dramatic outflows in iShares yet. So I don't think there is any real massive change. And I think, one thing you should be aware of, Craig, at this time, this is when you have the institutions sitting down on their -- this year's asset allocation. You're going to start seeing behavior changes probably in February and March when they start doing their reallocation maybe. And most certainly, one would think, in some cases, some pension funds because the decline in equities, that will rebalance out of fixed income back into equities as they -- they want to have consistent asset allocations. But our performance in fixed income, I think we had 91% of our products above peer medium over the last 3 years. And so -- and that's across all our European fixed income, our U.S. fixed income, our unconstrained products, our low-duration products, mortgage products, high yield. And so we're in a pretty good position to have flat base conversations with our clients."

And I would say that was a function initially of timing. And as the markets became more volatile during the year, frankly, overall, expense awareness. As the fourth quarter G&A was clearly higher. And in fact, we booked roughly 1/3 of our annual spend in the quarter alone. And as you saw, we incurred about $23 million of onetime deal expenses. Given that elevated level of G&A, the fourth quarter is clearly not representative of a good run rate for next year. Notwithstanding that, as you saw, G&A expense was 2% below last year. And I think that reflects our ability to manage the discretionary portion of our G&A expense in an uncertain market environment. And we continue to remain conscious of the trade-off between growth and margin, especially as we think about that discretionary portion of our spending and the current market. That being said, I think that if market stabilized, and given the impact of recent acquisitions on our run rate, we would anticipate a high level of G&A spend during the year, but there's obviously some discretion tied to that, and we'll be watching it very carefully."

A, I think it is appropriate as an industry that we identify risk associated with the liquidity of every product. I think there",609,"This is a real difficult issue that I don't -- I think the SEC is going to have be brought in how they think about this issue. A, I think it is appropriate as an industry that we identify risk associated with the liquidity of every product. I think there should be an appropriate measurement that is consistent, and they should be probably different variances by product as how you think about liquidity. And I think it's an important for our investors worldwide to have some form of measurement tools so they can assess the liquidity risks associated with any one product. And then you can see if there's a sharp divergence between one fund and another in terms of liquidity. I think we learned that with the Third Avenue episode earlier in the -- late last year, with their divergency related to liquidity and their product. So to me, that is a great example where you could -- if we had some form of measurement tool, the investors who invested in products like that our funds, like they could have assessed, is it -- ""I am getting the concerns necessary to offset the illiquidity that is a component of that investment strategy?"" So we're pretty sympathetic to all these things. And the dilemma really arises for the SEC because if there is some assessment of some sort of a large liquidity for every product, it really then will reduce investment dollars into the markets. It's going to put -- it will degrade returns for retail investors. The last thing you would want is having retail investors having degradation in their returns because we are all going to be assessed some type of liquidity threshold, and then all the institutional managers will go to separate accounts and may have only 30-day redemption features. So I -- the last thing you want to do is hurt retail. So I think a measurement tool of some sort is probably correct. Beyond some type of measurement tool of having some type of cash holding, I'm kind of -- I don't have a hard, fast opinion in it, but I do believe that it represents some risk. And then I think there are different characteristics between liquidity of an ETF and liquidity of an open-ended fund. I think our application has asked that they assess and look at the characteristics, differences between ETFs and open-ended mutual funds. And we recommended to the SEC to develop a separate and comprehensive rule in addressing those different investment product types and their associated risks. This is going to be addressed probably sometime in 2016. I think there's going to be quite a bit of time for comment period and discussion, and we'll see where this goes. But I think this is -- we are in favor of this. I mean one thing is important, especially in an environment where markets are really unpleasant, like what we're experiencing now. One of the big issues is, what are Americans knowing now with their big energy savings? Are they investing for retirement? Are they sitting with more of their cash in cash? If we can have more and more investors feel comfortable that they can invest safely and soundly and then they have a better understanding of the risks and characteristics of investing and understanding the liquidity of a lot of products, if that can then translate into more clients feeling good about investing for the outcome of retirement, this is all good. So this is why we are in favor of this type of narrative and dialogue. Obviously, we'll have opinions on how that will play out."

I mean I wish I could give you a better answer than you're probably looking for here, Michael. But obviously, from an MP standpoint, we plan a spend level during the year, but frankly, we react during the year and maintain appropriate flexibility to make sure that we can get the biggest bang for our dollar and make sure that we're not simply spending money in a time period where we don't think people are going to be receptive to a lot of the messages. I think Larry has talked about in volatility. A lot of investors basically based on the sidelines almost nothing you're going to tell them or communicate to them is really going to change their mind. So there is an element that is kind of managing it real-time, and we're going to continue to do that. So I can't really give you a whole lot of guidance there. But I think important in terms of thinking about broader margin trends, I know you're tired of hearing me say this, but we really aren't managing the business to a margin target either quarter to quarter or year to year. We are absolutely committed as part of our financial framework to growing and delivering operating leverage. And I think we've shown you that we've done that, right? When I go back, I've said this in my opening remarks, but we've expanded the margin by 450-plus basis points since BGI. We've reinvested probably $1 billion back into the business, and we're going to continue to commit to striking the right balance between strategic investments and managing our spend. It's a lot easier for everyone sitting around this stable, candidly, to cut costs that it is to invest for growth. That's the hard part. And I think the diversification of our model at the moment gives us the option to continue to invest through a market cycle when many other people are forced to pull back. But we're not going to be blind to that. I think the key is honestly kind of watching what's going on here and trying to determine at what point it kind of more becomes a near-term item and more of a mid-to-long term and then obviously we'll react appropriately."

And certainly, for the retail customer, they're looking for the Core Series to get more specific allocations to the generic product. And we're going to respond, and we'll respond as far as the fees go as well. But we see that continuing to grow as it gives you -- gives the client much better access to that precision instrument that they're looking for. Institutions, on the other hand, I think will see. We're seeing they're expressing first in the high-yield because they are yield hogs and they're looking for yield. But as we expand the product set, I think they'll be looking to invest in a Core Series as well, but I don't really think that's going to put pressure on our fees, quite frankly, because the institutional set looks differently at the ETF market than the buy-and-hold set. They're looking for liquidity. So it's important that we grow these particular products that they have the liquidity and they're willing to pay for the liquidity and access into those sectors. So it started out, the global Core Series, which has been very successful for us this year, and we raised a significant amount of assets, about $46 billion. I think that is going to expand institutionally, and we're going to also buffer that with other products that institutions are looking at to get that precision investment."

And we find that there's a tremendous amount of crossover between the 2 and overlap. And so rather than let our own internal bureaucracy get in the way of the returns for the clients, we have these groups now working very closely together and understanding where the overlap is and utilizing that overlap, add additional alpha into the portfolios. So I think by having these 2 teams really merged together, you will see better results and better alpha from the active equity business. And it will be much less confusing to our clients as to when they come in, how we are driving alpha, and I think that will add to also increased interest in the BlackRock portfolio. And my goal is to make sure that we are considered a very formidable manager of active equities. So there will be no one that will have the span of equity products that we have across both the quantitative and the fundamental offerings. So yes, I'm very excited about it. And I think having these groups work together has already shown some very good results in this year. Our equity performance is better than it's ever been.

We call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. 
So with that, let's begin."

It's my pleasure to be here to present our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and bus",1808,"Good morning. Thanks, Chris. Happy New Year to everybody. It's my pleasure to be here to present our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. 
Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As usual, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. In a year characterized by significant market and FX volatility, 2015 was another strong year for BlackRock as we generated industry-leading organic growth, maintained stable operating margins while continuing to invest in our business and returned approximately $2.6 billion of capital to our shareholders, representing a total payout ratio of 77%. The differentiation and strength of BlackRock's diverse global investment platform once again enabled us to generate consistent and stable financial results, allowing us to continue playing offense despite global macro uncertainty. 
We saw strong results from our core business areas and remain committed to investing in a variety of strategic initiatives that will further enhance our client value proposition and generate long-term value for our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated operating income of $1.1 billion and earnings per share of $4.75. Full year operating income of $4.7 billion increased 3% versus a year ago and earnings per share of $19.60 were up 1%, which included the impact of a higher tax rate in 2015.  
Nonoperating results for the quarter included $46 million of net investment gains, primarily driven by a $35 million unrealized gain on a strategic private equity investment.  Our as-adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 30% compared to a tax rate of 25.4% a year ago that reflected $39 million of nonrecurring discrete tax benefits. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for 2016, reflecting changes in our geographic business mix, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring items that could arise during the year. 
BlackRock's fourth quarter results were driven by $54 billion of long-term net new business, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 5% and the third highest flow quarter on BlackRock's history and reflects resilience of our differentiated business model. For the full year 2015, BlackRock generated long-term net new business of $152 billion, representing a 4% long-term organic AUM growth rate and a 6% organic base fee growth rate as faster growth in our higher-fee Retail and iShares businesses contributed to a favorable overall change in our base fee mix. Long-term net inflows were diversified by asset class and investment style with positive flows across these categories for the full year. 
BlackRock continued to deliver top line growth despite the challenging market as fourth quarter revenue of $2.9 billion and full year revenue of $11.4 billion were both 3% higher than a year ago. Organic growth and improved investment performance drove increases in base fees, performance fees and Aladdin revenue, all of which reached record levels in 2015. 
Fourth quarter and full year base fees each rose 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by organic growth despite over $150 billion of negative FX impact and market depreciation on our AUM over the last 12 months. FX was a significant drag in 2015, and we estimate that full year base fees grew 6% versus 2014 levels on a constant-currency basis. Sequentially, quarterly base fees were essentially flat despite positive organic growth due to a lower fourth quarter AUM entry rate, the continued impact of divergent beta on our fee rate as emerging and commodities markets once again underperformed developed markets and ongoing dollar appreciation against foreign currencies. 
Performance fees for the fourth quarter were $169 million, up 17% from a year ago, driven by our broad suite of active offerings, but down $39 million sequentially due to a single hedge fund that delivered exceptional full year performance and a loss in the third quarter. Full year performance fees of $621 million rose 13% versus 2014, evidencing strong alpha generation across our diverse investment platform. 
Fourth quarter BlackRock Solutions revenue of $171 million was up 1% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Full year 2015 Aladdin revenue of $528 million, which represented 82% of BRS revenue grew 11% year-over-year driven by several sizable client implementations and has more than doubled since 2009. We expect continued business momentum in Aladdin driven by transferring global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset business solutions. 
Our financial markets advisory business ended 2015 with $118 million in revenue. Despite lower levels of opportunistic revenue post-financial crisis, FMA is benefiting from a more stable revenue profile driven by an increased number of mandates and more repeat engagements in the current market environment. 
Total expense for the fourth quarter was up $90 million year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in compensation and G&A expense. For the full year 2015, compensation expense increased $184 million or 5% due to higher headcount associated with our growth initiatives, higher incentive and deferred compensation, partly offset by the impact of the stronger dollar. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full year basis. 
Fourth quarter G&A expense increased $23 million year-over-year or 6%, primarily driven by $23 million of deal-related expense associated with strategic transactions executed in the quarter. Sequentially, quarterly G&A expense increased $91 million, primarily reflecting a planned uptake in year-end marketing and promotional spend, higher technology expense and the previously mentioned $23 million in deal-related expense. Full year G&A expense of $1.4 billion was 2% below 2014 levels, reflecting expense awareness in a volatile market environment, notwithstanding the G&A spend in the fourth quarter. If markets stabilize and given the impact of recent acquisitions on our run rate, we would anticipate a higher level -- a higher annual level of G&A spend during 2016. 
Overall, total expense for 2015 increased 3% from a year ago compared to a similar increase in revenue over the same period, resulting in an as-adjusted operating margin of 42.9% for the full year, flat to our 2014 level. We remain committed to generating operating leverage in our business and have expanded our operating margin by over 450 basis points since closing the BGI acquisition at the end of 2009. However, as we've stated in the past, we also do not manage the business to a specific margin target, either quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. The diversification and stability of our business model affords us the option of investing through end market cycles to grow share. We remain keenly focused on delivering long-term value for our shareholders by striking an appropriate balance between organically investing for future growth and practical discretionary expenses. 
At times, our strategic investments will also be inorganic. During 2015, BlackRock closed several transactions, including BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors, a domestic middle market lending platform; I Cuadrada, a Latin American infrastructure investor; and FutureAdvisor, a digital wealth manager. In addition, on November 3, BlackRock announced an agreement to assume investment management responsibilities for approximately $87 billion of cash and liquidity AUM currently managed by Bank of America Global Capital Management. We expect that transaction to close in the first half of 2016. 
During 2015, we also returned approximately $2.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As we entered 2016, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.29 per share of common stock, representing an increase of 5% over the prior level. Since instituting a dividend in 2003, BlackRock has grown its dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 22%. We repurchased $1.1 billion of our shares in 2015 and have now repurchased approximately 10 million shares since we instituted a consistent and predictable approach to capital management in 2013. We remain committed to this approach and a similar level of share repurchase in 2016, but could increase such amounts based on potential changes to the relative valuation of our stock price. 
Our 2015 financial results reflect the benefits of our differentiated global business model. Fourth quarter and full year net inflows of $54 billion and $152 billion, respectively, were positive in both our active and indexed franchises and benefited from significant flows into iShares. Global iShares generated $60 billion of net new business in the fourth quarter and record flows of $130 billion for the year, representing full year organic growth of 13%. 
iShares captured the #1 share of global, U.S. and European ETF industry flows for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Record fourth quarter equity iShares inflows of $48 billion were driven by demand for U.S. equities and a broad array of developed market exposures. Fourth quarter fixed income iShares inflows of $12 billion reflected flows into core, high-yield and investment-grade corporate bond funds. 
BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw fourth quarter inflows of $7 billion, reflecting the seasonal impact of capital gains distributions. Full year 2015 net flows of $38 billion, representing 7% organic asset growth, were driven by diversified flows across our top-performing fixed income platform. International retail net inflows totaled $20 billion in 2015 and were paced by strong flows into international equities and unconstrained fixed income, allowing BlackRock to maintain its year-to-date #1 ranking in cross-border mutual fund flows. U.S. retail net flows of $19 billion in 2015 demonstrated resilience in a challenging year for the U.S. mutual fund industry. 
BlackRock's institutional franchise had long-term net outflows of $13 billion for the quarter and $16 billion for the year as we continue to see sizable asset allocation-driven flows both into and out of low-fee institutional index products. However, we also continue to benefit from demand for higher-fee active offerings as clients recognize the value-added, alpha-generating platform we have built across traditional and alternative active strategies. The positive fee impact of this mix shift is in line with our growth strategy and enable BlackRock's institutional business to deliver organic base fee growth of 4% in 2015. 
We generated $4 billion of institutional flows into core alternatives during the year. Flows were broad-based across a diverse alternatives platform, including infrastructure, fund of hedge funds, fund of private equity funds and alternative solutions offerings. We ended 2015 with another strong fundraising quarter for liquid alternatives, raising $1 billion in new commitments. Over the last 3 years, we've raised more than $17 billion in commitments and have nearly $11 billion of committed capital to deploy for our clients. Committed capital translated to flows and AUM as those dollars are invested and will be a source of future revenue growth. 
In summary, in a year marked by periods of increased market volatility, divergent data and significant currency movements, our diversified business model delivered consistent financial results and allowed us to continue investing for future growth.We remain confident that BlackRock's differentiated platform is well positioned to meet the needs of our clients and shareholders in the years to come. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrated that in times of rapid change and market volatility, BlackRock's diverse business model can consistently generate strong results. Over the last year, energy",2092,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Gary. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrated that in times of rapid change and market volatility, BlackRock's diverse business model can consistently generate strong results. 
Over the last year, energy prices have deteriorated significantly, with the price of oil dropping to levels not seen in more than a decade. Growth in China remains sluggish. Some emerging markets, including Brazil, face significant political and economic challenges and divergence of developed market -- monetary policies and driving heightened volatility in rates, currency and equity markets. The Federal Reserve's action to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly 10 years marked the end of a historical period of monetary policy in combination in the U.S. and the beginning of an extended gradual tightening cycle. All of these factors are leading to a much more divergent world in 2016, with higher levels of volatility ahead, as already witnessed in the first few weeks of the year. And as the investment landscape changes, our clients need change as well. 
The differentiation of BlackRock's core business model drives consistency in resilience in our results. This positions BlackRock to invest in our platform, investing in technology, investing in people, even in the most challenging and volatile times and to anticipate and adapt ahead of change so that we're positioned to provide our clients with investment solutions to meet their evolving needs. 
In a more fragmented investment landscape impacted by continued low rates, modest beta-driven returns, investors will search for income, they'll search for capital appreciation through a combination of both active and alternative investments, factors, smart beta strategies and hybrid solutions. No other firm in the world can provide all of these capabilities on a single platform supported by superior risk management, technology and investment performance, and this is what's driving a deeper connectivity with our clients than ever before and what once again drove BlackRock's fourth quarter and our full year results. 
BlackRock generated $54 billion of long-term net flows in the fourth quarter and $152 billion for the year, representing annualized organic growth of 5% and 4%, respectively. Flows were driven by client demand for both active and indexed solutions across asset categories, asset classes, across regions. We saw $61 billion in growth -- in a year when most people talked about there's not demand for active strategies, we saw $61 billion in growth in our active strategies and $92 billion of growth in index and iShares flows. We generated flows of $53 billion in equities, $77 billion in fixed income, $17 billion in multi-asset and $5 billion in alternatives. We raised $38 billion in our retail platform, $130 billion in our iShares platforms, and in our institutional platform, we raised $27 billion of active strategies that was offset by $43 billion of low-fee institutional index outflows. 
What I'm particularly very pleased with is the platform and how broad it is, and it's evident in 2015 in over 13 countries where we had net inflows in excess of $1 billion. In addition, in 2015, we had a record amount of 65 different retail and iShare products generating more than $1 billion in net inflows. The industry-leading organic growth story at BlackRock that we delivered in 2015 is, in addition that we raised 11% growth rates in our Aladdin product, alpha-driven performance fees and expense awareness translated to positive results in both the top and bottom line, even in the face of tremendous headwinds that we saw in global equity markets and FX. 
BlackRock is committed into having a deep and broad understanding of the world in which we and our clients operate and invest in. Our commitment in being truly local in more than 30 countries that we operate in worldwide completely positions BlackRock to understand our clients' needs and their specific investment requirements to better help them navigate these markets, and we're in a better position, I believe, than any other firm in the world to do that. 
The BlackRock Investment Institute provides a platform across regions, across asset classes, across investment styles for our investors to exchange the knowledge they built in local markets, debate investment topics, share expertise with a goal of generating better alpha and managing risk for our clients. This connectivity, this worldwide connectivity, also has enabled us to have a deeper dialogue and level of trust with clients around the world. This year, the BlackRock Investment Institute touched nearly 20,000 clients globally through in-person meetings, hosted conference calls and critical market events and in in-depth publications.  This knowledge and the connective tissue, combined with the talent of our investment teams, has contributed to a strong performance across our active platform. 
As of the end of the fourth quarter, 91% of our active taxable fixed-income assets and 90% of our scientific active equity assets are above benchmark or peer median for the last 3 years. Throughout 2015, we continue to make progress on the reinvigoration and globalization of our fundamental active equity business, generating strong results for our clients with 76% of our fundamental active equity assets above benchmark or peer median for the 1-year period, highlighted by the strong turnaround we've seen in the performance in our flagship Equity Dividend Fund. 
The strength of our active performance has translated into flows. As I said earlier, in -- we saw $61 billion of flows in 2015 in our active strategies, despite a challenging year for active fund flows across our industry. We continue to diversify our institutional active platform and deepen existing client relationships by creating hybrid solution-based strategies to solve our clients' most complex investment needs. Institutional active net flows of $27 billion in 2015 were primarily driven by fixed income and multi-asset solutions as institutions looked to BlackRock to solve their most complex investment challenges. 
On the retail side, the diversification of our EMEA retail business was a significant driver of results in 2015, and BlackRock saw active net inflows from retail clients, led by our European equity and income, our unconstrained fixed-income products, our high-yield products and our multi-asset income products. In the United States, the breadth of BlackRock's product suite across active index and iShares resonated with our retail clients. We remain focused on growing global iShares market share and driving market -- global market expansion, which translated into strong flows in 2015. 
The fourth quarter was a record quarter for iShares as investors continue to turn to BlackRock iShares franchise, which generated $60 billion in net inflows across asset classes. For the quarter and for the year, iShares captured the #1 share of flows in the U.S., Europe, globally, with 37% global market share for the full year. 2015 iShares flows was $130 billion, primarily driven by developed market equities and fixed income. 
The global Core Series saw flows of $46 billion, representing a 23% organic growth. And record fixed income flows of $50 billion was concentrated in our high-yield products, including investment-grade corporate bonds and our high-yield bonds. Fixed income is a strategic priority for iShares, which led the industry in fixed income ETF flows for the quarter and for the year, driven by iShares' consistency of having 15 of the top 25 fixed income ETFs by net flows in 2015. 
Fixed income market volatility rose in December, and during this  time, a market-stressed BlackRock flagship high-yield ETF, HYG, enabled clients to transact directly with one another at known, transparent, minute-by-minute pricing with ample liquidity. More than $20 billion HYG traded in the 2 weeks ending December 18, with less than $1 billion of net redemptions, providing our markets and our clients substantial liquidity with limited impact on the underlying markets. 
As we look back in 2015, despite these spikes in market volatility, ETFs, and specifically iShares, are increasingly being relied upon by clients for transparent, liquid, cost-effective investment solutions. We continue to find opportunities to learn from market events, to educate investors and focus on the long-term needs of our clients in iShares and across BlackRock's platform by investing in areas that we believe will result in a more complete solutions offering for our clients and deliver value for our shareholders. Being aware of what is going on in the world around us, anticipating change and having the willingness to adapt is a critical part of our responsibility as a fiduciary to our clients. 
Throughout the year, BlackRock has made significant enhancements to our platform through a combination of investment for organic growth, for acquisitions and the evolution of our talent. Technology is increasingly impacting our clients and our business. In 2015, we made investments to utilize technology to gain new investment insights and to reach our clients more effectively. We're investing in big data and text analysis to make better portfolio management decisions across our broad platform of quantitative and fundamental investment styles. 
Factor-based analysis will become more prevalent as market dispersion increases. We made significant enhancements to our smart beta and factor-based investing platform, including the hiring of Andrew Ang. And BlackRock generated nearly $10 billion of smart beta net inflows in 2015, driven by iShares minimum vol funds. 
We're investing in retail technology to empower our intermediary partners for a high-quality, technological-enabled advice capabilities to improve our clients' investment experiences. We closed on the acquisition of FutureAdvisor in the fourth quarter, and we recently signed our first 2 clients, representing the first B2B contracts of their kind in the U.S. Digital wealth management space. 
We continue to see strong demand for alternative solutions as investors move beyond the boundaries of traditional strategies to investments in real estate, infrastructure, other forms of real assets across the liquid platform. Our hedge fund platform has grown 9% annually over the past 5 years and now stands at $31 billion in AUM, and we continue to invest to broaden our platform and leveraging our top-performing internal talent to develop products organically as well as bringing in new managers. 
We remain focused on our responsibility to partner with clients and simultaneously generating long-term returns and create positive social outcomes. Over the past several years, we've grown our infrastructure platform to more than $7 billion. This includes the industry-leading renewable power franchise, a strong infrastructure debt capability and meaningful investments in Latin America like our acquisition and our partnership with PEMEX. These activities are for long-term benefits to both investors and the economies, where they contribute to economic growth, it contributes to the country's job creation and, most importantly, it contributes to a positive environmental impact. 
2015, we continued to invest in the BlackRock Impact platform, which manages now more than $200 billion to provide investors with the opportunity to generate long-term competitive financial returns and positively impact society. At BlackRock, embracing change has always been a core part of who we are. Nearly every year, we take a fresh look at the organization and reflect on ways to improve it. We then evolved the organization in anticipation of changes of our clients' needs and anticipation of the global markets. 
Together with our Board of Directors, we undertake a deliberate process and effort to continually position our leaders in roles that can broaden their experience and maximize their potential both for BlackRock and our clients. This is critical in building a truly global firm. We did this in 2012 and 2014 with very positive benefits. This week, again, we announced a number of enhancements to our leadership team that are part of this consistent process of developing our people and evolving our organization to meet these challenging needs. 
Looking at the quality of the leaders taking on new or expanded roles, I'm incredibly proud of the depth of the talent that we have, and I believe, today, we have the strongest leadership team we've ever had in the history of BlackRock. And it is the quality and talent of this team that allows BlackRock to deliver the performance we did in 2015 despite the volatile markets and positions us very well for 2016. This team, they are the reason that we have forged such a trusting relationship with our clients and why our clients are increasingly turning to BlackRock to solve their biggest financial challenges. As we head into 2016, we will continue to make investments in our future. We will continue to develop our talent and seeking ways to leverage and grow our diverse platform to meet our fiduciary responsibilities to our clients, our fiduciary responsibilities to our societies where we operate and to deliver the returns for our shareholders. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

Insurance companies are adding to their fixed income exposures now. As I've commented in the past, the whole insurance industry or a good part of it has short-term liability duration and are hoping for higher rates. We haven't seen higher rates. Obviously, we're sitting here with a very low 10-year treasury rate, but we most certainly have seen a widening in credit spreads. And I think as evidence of a few large bond issues that went public this week, we saw huge demand. And so as spreads widen, we expect to see more demand institutionally. And as you suggested, some of the widening of spreads and the fears of high rates are going to produce some selling possibly from retail, but we haven't seen anything dramatic yet. We haven't seen really any dramatic outflows on iShares yet. So I don't think there is any real massive change. And I think one thing you should be aware of, Craig, at this time, this is when you have the institutions sitting down on their -- this year's asset allocation. You're going to start seeing behavior changes probably in February and March when they start doing their reallocation maybe. And so most certainly, one would think, in some cases, some pension funds, because of decline in equities, will rebalance out of fixed income back into equities as they -- if they want to have consistent asset allocations. But our performance in fixed income, I think we had 91% of our products above peer median over the last 3 years. And so -- and that's across all our European fixed income, our U.S. fixed income, our unconstrained products, our low-duration products, mortgage products, high yield. And so we're in a pretty good position to have a lot of broad-based conversations with our clients."

And I would say that was a function initially of timing and, as the markets became more volatile during the year, frankly, overall expense awareness. So the fourth quarter G&A was clearly higher, and in fact, we booked roughly 1/3 of our annual M&P spend in the quarter alone. And as you saw, we incurred about $23 million of onetime deal expenses. Given that elevated level of G&A, the fourth quarter is clearly not representative of a good run rate for next year. Notwithstanding that, as you saw, G&A expense was 2% below last year, and I think that reflects our ability to manage the discretionary portion of our G&A expense in an uncertain market environment. And we continue to remain conscious of the trade-off between growth and margin, especially as we think about that discretionary portion of our spending and the current market. That being said, I think that if market stabilized and given the impact of recent acquisitions on our run rate, we would anticipate a higher level of G&A spend during the year, but there's obviously some discretion tied to that. And we'll be watching it very carefully."

A, I think it is appropriate as an industry that we identify the risk associated to liquidity of every product. I think there should be an appropriate measurement that is consistent, and there should be probably different variances by product as how you think about liquidity. And I think it's an important for our investors worldwide to have some form of measurement tools so they could assess the liquidity risk associated with any one product. And then you could see if there is a sharp divergence between one fund and another in terms of liquidity. I think we learned that with the Third Avenue episode earlier -- late last year, with their divergency related to liquidity in their product. So to me, that is a great example where you could -- if we had some form of measurement tool, the investors who invested in products like debtor funds like that could have assessed, ""Is it -- am I getting the returns necessary to offset the illiquidity that is a component of that investment strategy?"" So we're pretty sympathetic to all these things. And the dilemma really arises for the SEC because if there is some assessment of some sort of a large liquidity for every product, it really then will reduce investment dollars into the markets. It's going to put -- it will degrade returns for retail investors. The last thing you would want is having retail investors having degradation in their returns because we are all going to be assessed to some type of liquidity threshold and then all the institutional managers will go to separate accounts that may have only 30-day redemption features. So I -- the last thing we want to do is hurt retail. So I think a measurement tool of some sort is probably correct. Beyond some type of measurement tool of having some type of cash holding, I'm kind of -- I don't have a hard fast opinion on it, but I do believe that it represents some risk. And then I think there are different characteristics between liquidity of an ETF and liquidity of an open-ended fund. I think our application has asked that they assess and look at the characteristics, differences between ETFs and open-ended mutual funds, and we've recommended to the SEC to develop a separate and comprehensive rule addressing those different investment product types and their associated risk. So this is going to be addressed probably some time in 2016. I think there's going to be quite a bit of time for comment period and discussion, and we'll see where this goes. But I think this is -- we are in favor of this. I mean one thing that's important -- especially in an environment where markets are really unpleasant like what we're experiencing now, one of the big issues is, what are Americans doing now with their big energy savings? Are they investing for retirement? Are they sitting with more of their cash in cash? If we can have more and more investors feel comfortable that they can invest safely and soundly and they have a better understanding of the risks and the characteristics of investing and understanding the liquidity of a lot of products, if that can then translate into more clients feeling good about investing for the outcome of retirement, this is all good. So this is why we are in favor of this type of narrative and dialogue. Obviously, we'll have opinions on how that will play out."

I mean, I wish I could give you a better answer than you're probably looking for here, Michael. But I think we obviously are -- from an M&P standpoint, we plan a spend level during the year, but, frankly, we react during the year and maintain appropriate flexibility to make sure that we can get the biggest bang for our dollar and make sure that we're not simply spending money in a time period where we don't think people are going to be receptive to a lot of the messages. I think Larry has talked about, in volatility, a lot of investors basically makes it on the sidelines. Almost nothing you're going to tell them or communicate to them is really going to change their mind. So there is an element of kind of managing it real time, and we're going to continue to do that. So I can't really give you a whole lot of guidance there. But I think important in terms of thinking about broader margin trends, I know you're tired of hearing me say this, but we really aren't managing the business to a margin target, either quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. We are absolutely committed as part of our financial framework to growing and delivering operating leverage. And I think we've shown you that we've done that, right? I'll go back, I've said this on my opening remarks, but we've expanded the margin by 450-plus basis points since BGI. We've reinvested probably $1 billion back into the business, and we're going to continue to commit to striking the right balance between strategic investments and managing our spend. It's a lot easier for everyone sitting around this table, candidly, to cut costs than it is to invest for growth. That's the hard part. And I think that the diversification of our model at the moment gives us the option to continue to invest through a market cycle when many others may be forced to pull back, but we're not going to be blind to that. And I think the key is obviously kind of watching what's going on here and trying to determine at what point it really becomes more of a near-term item and more of a mid- to long term, and then, obviously, we'll react appropriately."

And however, as we -- as you witnessed when -- as shareholders in 2008 and '09, we managed expenses quite extraordinarily at times when you had to do that. So it's going to be a mix. But we do have a mindset of growing the business, and that's the differentiating factor. As Gary said, it's a lot easier to just -- in cutting expenses or cutting headcount, it's a lot more bold to make the investments at the time when everybody is running away from investments, and we will continue to look at both."

And we're going to respond, and we'll respond as far as the fees go as well. But we see that continuing to grow as it gives you -- gives the client much better access to that precision instrument that they're looking for. Institutions, on the other hand, I think we'll see. We're seeing they're expressing first in the high yield because they're yield hogs and they're looking for yield. But as we expand out the product set, I think they'll be looking to invest in a Core Series as well, but I don't really think that's going to put pressure on our fees, quite frankly, because the institutional set looks differently at the ETF market than the buy-and-hold set. They're looking for liquidity so it's important that we grow these particular products so they have the liquidity, and they're willing to pay for the liquidity and access into those sectors. So it started out, the global Core Series, which has been very successful for us this year, and we raised a significant amount of assets, about $46 billion. I think that is going to expand institutionally, and we're going to also buffer that with other products that institutions are looking at to get that precision investment."

In the scientific active equity business, it's a business that we use signals, data and a lot of quantitative screens for. And in the fundamental business, we relied more upon our long-term views of the market, management, the product, et cetera. And we find that there's a tremendous amount of crossover between the 2, an overlap, and so rather than let our own internal bureaucracy get in the way of the returns for the clients, we have these groups now working very closely together and understanding where the overlap is and utilizing that overlap to add additional alpha into the portfolios. So I think by having these 2 teams really merged together, you will see better results and better alpha from the active equity business, and it will be much less confusing to our clients as to when they come in, how we are driving alpha. And I think that will add to also increased interest in the BlackRock portfolio, and my goal is to make sure that we are considered a very formidable manager of active equities. So there will be no one that will have the span of equity products that we have across both the quantitative and the fundamental offerings. So yes, I'm very excited about it, and I think having this group work together has already shown some very good results in this year. Our equity performance is better than it's ever been. So we're going to continue working on coming up with new ways in the market to add alpha. So very, very positive on this change that we made."

In a year characterized by significant market and FX volatility, 2015 was another strong year for BlackRock as we generated industry-leading organic growth, maintained stable operating margins while continuing to invest in our business and returned approximately $2.6 billion of capital to our shareholders, representing a total payout ratio of 77%. The differentiation and strength of BlackRock's diverse global investment platform once again enabled us to generate consistent and stable financial results, allowing us to continue playing offense despite global macro uncertainty. 
We saw strong results from our core business areas and remain committed to investing in a variety of strategic initiatives that will further enhance our client value proposition and generate long-term value for our shareholders. In the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated operating income of $1.1 billion and earnings per share of $4.75. Full year operating income of $4.7 billion increased 3% versus a year ago and earnings per share of $19.60 were up 1%, which included the impact of a higher tax rate in 2015.  
Nonoperating results for the quarter included $46 million of net investment gains, primarily driven by a $35 million unrealized gain on a strategic private equity investment.  Our as-adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter was 30% compared to a tax rate of 25.4% a year ago that reflected $39 million of nonrecurring discrete tax benefits. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for 2016, reflecting changes in our geographic business mix, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring items that could arise during the year. 
BlackRock's fourth quarter results were driven by $54 billion of long-term net new business, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 5% and the third highest flow quarter in BlackRock's history and reflects resilience of our differentiated business model. For the full year 2015, BlackRock generated long-term net new business of $152 billion, representing a 4% long-term organic AUM growth rate and a 6% organic base fee growth rate as faster growth in our higher-fee Retail and iShares businesses contributed to a favorable overall change in our base fee mix. Long-term net inflows were diversified by asset class and investment style with positive flows across these categories for the full year. 
BlackRock continued to deliver top line growth despite the challenging market as fourth quarter revenue of $2.9 billion and full year revenue of $11.4 billion were both 3% higher than a year ago. Organic growth and improved investment performance drove increases in base fees, performance fees and Aladdin revenue, all of which reached record levels in 2015. 
Fourth quarter and full year base fees each rose 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by organic growth despite over $150 billion of negative FX impact and market depreciation on our AUM over the last 12 months. FX was a significant drag in 2015, and we estimate that full year base fees grew 6% versus 2014 levels on a constant-currency basis. Sequentially, quarterly base fees were essentially flat despite positive organic growth due to a lower fourth quarter AUM entry rate, the continued impact of divergent beta on our fee rate as emerging and commodities markets once again underperformed developed markets and ongoing dollar appreciation against foreign currencies. 
Performance fees for the fourth quarter were $169 million, up 17% from a year ago, driven by our broad suite of active offerings, but down $39 million sequentially due to a single hedge fund that delivered exceptional full year performance and a loss in the third quarter. Full year performance fees of $621 million rose 13% versus 2014, evidencing strong alpha generation across our diverse investment platform. 
Fourth quarter BlackRock Solutions revenue of $171 million was up 1% year-over-year and 2% sequentially. Full year 2015 Aladdin revenue of $528 million, which represented 82% of BRS revenue, grew 11% year-over-year driven by several sizable client implementations and has more than doubled since 2009. We expect continued business momentum in Aladdin driven by transferring global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset business solutions. 
Our financial markets advisory business ended 2015 with $118 million in revenue. Despite lower levels of opportunistic revenue post-financial crisis, FMA is benefiting from a more stable revenue profile driven by an increased number of mandates and more repeat engagements in the current market environment. 
Total expense for the fourth quarter rose $90 million year-over-year, driven primarily by an increase in compensation and G&A expense. For the full year 2015, compensation expense increased $184 million or 5% due to higher headcount associated with our growth initiatives, higher incentive and deferred compensation, partly offset by the impact of the stronger dollar. Recall that year-over-year comparisons of fourth quarter compensation expense are less relevant because we determine compensation on a full year basis. 
Fourth quarter G&A expense increased $23 million year-over-year or 6%, primarily driven by $23 million of deal-related expense associated with strategic transactions executed in the quarter. Sequentially, quarterly G&A expense increased $91 million, primarily reflecting a planned uptake in year-end marketing and promotional spend, higher technology expense and the previously mentioned $23 million in deal-related expense. Full year G&A expense of $1.4 billion was 2% below 2014 levels, reflecting expense awareness in a volatile market environment, notwithstanding the G&A spend in the fourth quarter. If markets stabilize and given the impact of recent acquisitions on our run rate, we would anticipate a higher level -- a higher annual level of G&A spend during 2016. 
Overall, total expense for 2015 increased 3% from a year ago compared to a similar increase in revenue over the same period, resulting in an as-adjusted operating margin of 42.9% for the full year, flat to our 2014 level. We remain committed to generating operating leverage in our business and have expanded our operating margin by over 450 basis points since closing the BGI acquisition at the end of 2009. However, as we've stated in the past, we also do not manage the business to a specific margin target, either quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. The diversification and stability of our business model affords us the option of investing through end market cycles to grow share. We remain keenly focused on delivering long-term value for our shareholders by striking an appropriate balance between organically investing for future growth and practical discretionary expenses. 
At times, our strategic investments will also be inorganic. During 2015, BlackRock closed several transactions, including BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors, a domestic middle market lending platform; I Cuadrada, a Latin American infrastructure investor; and FutureAdvisor, a digital wealth manager. In addition, on November 3, BlackRock announced an agreement to assume investment management responsibilities for approximately $87 billion of cash and liquidity AUM currently managed by Bank of America Global Capital Management. We expect that transaction to close in the first half of 2016. 
During 2015, we also returned approximately $2.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. As we enter 2016, our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly cash dividend of $2.29 per share of common stock, representing an increase of 5% over the prior level. Since instituting a dividend in 2003, BlackRock has grown its dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 22%. We repurchased $1.1 billion of our shares in 2015 and have now repurchased approximately 10 million shares since we instituted a consistent and predictable approach to capital management in 2013. We remain committed to this approach and a similar level of share repurchase in 2016, but could increase such amounts based on potential changes to the relative valuation of our stock price. 
Our 2015 financial results reflect the benefits of our differentiated global business model. Fourth quarter and full year net inflows of $54 billion and $152 billion, respectively, were positive in both our active and indexed franchises and benefited from significant flows into iShares. Global iShares generated $60 billion of net new business in the fourth quarter and record flows of $130 billion for the year, representing full year organic growth of 13%. 
iShares captured the #1 share of global, U.S. and European ETF industry flows for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Record fourth quarter equity iShares inflows of $48 billion were driven by demand for U.S. equities and a broad array of developed market exposures. Fourth quarter fixed income iShares inflows of $12 billion reflected flows into core, high-yield and investment-grade corporate bond funds. 
BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw fourth quarter inflows of $7 billion, reflecting the seasonal impact of capital gains distributions. Full year 2015 net flows of $38 billion, representing 7% organic asset growth, were driven by diversified flows across our top-performing fixed income platform. International retail net inflows totaled $20 billion in 2015 and were paced by strong flows into international equities and unconstrained fixed income, allowing BlackRock to maintain its year-to-date #1 ranking in cross-border mutual fund flows. U.S. retail net flows of $19 billion in 2015 demonstrated resilience in a challenging year for the U.S. mutual fund industry. 
BlackRock's institutional franchise had long-term net outflows of $13 billion for the quarter and $16 billion for the year as we continue to see sizable asset allocation-driven flows both into and out of low-fee institutional index products. However, we also continue to benefit from demand for higher-fee active offerings as clients recognize the value-added, alpha-generating platform we have built across traditional and alternative active strategies. The positive fee impact of this mix shift is in line with our growth strategy and enable BlackRock's institutional business to deliver organic base fee growth of 4% in 2015. 
We generated $4 billion of institutional flows into core alternatives during the year. Flows were broad-based across a diverse alternatives platform, including infrastructure, fund of hedge funds, fund of private equity funds and alternative solutions offerings. We ended 2015 with another strong fundraising quarter for liquid alternatives, raising $1 billion in new commitments. Over the last 3 years, we've raised more than $17 billion in commitments and have nearly $11 billion of committed capital to deploy for our clients. Committed capital translated to flows and AUM as those dollars are invested and will be a source of future revenue growth. 
In summary, in a year marked by periods of increased market volatility, divergent data and significant currency movements, our diversified business model delivered consistent financial results and allowed us to continue investing for future growth. We remain confident that BlackRock's differentiated platform is well positioned to meet the needs of our clients and shareholders in the years to come. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."
403413,319742547,918984,"BlackRock, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 15, 2016",2016-01-15,"Earnings Calls","BlackRock, Inc.","Executives","Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Gary. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrated that in times of rapid change and market volatility, BlackRock's diverse business model can consistently generate strong results. Over the last year, energy",2095,"Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Gary. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrated that in times of rapid change and market volatility, BlackRock's diverse business model can consistently generate strong results. 
Over the last year, energy prices have deteriorated significantly, with the price of oil dropping to levels not seen in more than a decade. Growth in China remains sluggish. Several emerging markets, including Brazil, face significant political and economic challenges and divergence of developed market -- monetary policies driving heightened volatility in rates, currency and equity markets. The Federal Reserve's action to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly 10 years marked the end of a historical period of monetary policy in combination in the U.S. and the beginning of an extended gradual tightening cycle. All of these factors are leading to a much more divergent world in 2016, while [ph] higher levels of volatility ahead, as already witnessed in the first few weeks of the year. And as the investment landscape changes, our clients need change as well. 
The differentiation of BlackRock's core business model drives consistency and resilience in our results. This positions BlackRock to invest in our platform, investing in technology, investing in people, even in the most challenging and volatile times and to anticipate and adapt ahead of change so that we're positioned to provide our clients with investment solutions to meet their evolving needs. 
In a more fragmented investment landscape impacted by continued low rates, modest beta-driven returns, investors will search for income, they'll search for capital appreciation through a combination of both active and alternative investments, factors, smart beta strategies and hybrid solutions. No other firm in the world can provide all of these capabilities on a single platform supported by superior risk management, technology and investment performance, and this is what's driving a deeper connectivity with our clients than ever before and what once again drove BlackRock's fourth quarter and our full year results. 
BlackRock generated $54 billion of long-term net flows in the fourth quarter and $152 billion for the year, representing annualized organic growth of 5% and 4%, respectively. Flows were driven by client demand for both active and indexed solutions across asset categories, asset classes, across regions. We saw $61 billion in growth -- in a year when most people talked about there's not demand for active strategies, we saw $61 billion in growth in our active strategies and $92 billion of growth in index and iShares flows. We generated flows of $53 billion in equities, $77 billion in fixed income, $17 billion in multi-asset and $5 billion in alternatives. We raised $38 billion in our retail platform, $130 billion in our iShares platforms, and in our institutional platform, we raised $27 billion of active strategies that was offset by $43 billion of low-fee institutional index outflows. 
What I'm particularly very pleased with is the platform and how broad it is, and it's evident in 2015 in over 13 countries where we had net inflows in excess of $1 billion. In addition, in 2015, we had a record amount of 65 different retail and iShare products generating more than $1 billion in net inflows. The industry-leading organic growth story at BlackRock that we delivered in 2015 is, in addition that we raised 11% growth rates in our Aladdin product, alpha-driven performance fees and expense awareness translated to positive results in both the top and bottom line, even in the face of tremendous headwinds that we saw in global equity markets and FX. 
BlackRock is committed into having a deep and broad understanding of the world in which we and our clients operate and invest in. Our commitment in being truly local in more than 30 countries that we operate in worldwide completely positions BlackRock to understand our clients' needs and their specific investment requirements to better help them navigate these markets, and we're in a better position, I believe, than any other firm in the world to do that. 
The BlackRock Investment Institute provides a platform across regions, across asset classes, across investment styles for our investors to exchange the knowledge they built in local markets, debate investment topics, share expertise with a goal of generating better alpha and managing risk for our clients. This connectivity, this worldwide connectivity, also has enabled us to have a deeper dialogue and level of trust with clients around the world. This year, the BlackRock Investment Institute touched nearly 20,000 clients globally through in-person meetings, hosted conference calls on critical market events and in in-depth publications.  This knowledge and the connective tissue, combined with the talent of our investment teams, has contributed to a strong performance across our active platform. 
As of the end of the fourth quarter, 91% of our active taxable fixed-income assets and 90% of our scientific active equity assets are above benchmark for our peer medium for the last 3 years. Throughout 2015, we continue to make progress on the reinvigoration and globalization of our fundamental active equity business, generating strong results for our clients with 76% of our fundamental active equity assets above benchmark or peer medium for the 1-year period, highlighted by the strong turnaround we've seen in the performance in our flagship Equity Dividend Fund. 
The strength of our active performance has translated into flows. As I said earlier, in -- we saw $61 billion of flows in 2015 in our active strategies, despite a challenging year for active fund flows across our industry. We continue to diversify our institutional active platform and deepen existing client relationships by creating hybrid solution-based strategies to solve our clients' most complex investment needs. Institutional active net flows of $27 billion in 2015 were primarily driven by fixed income and multi-asset solutions as institutions looked to BlackRock to solve their most complex investment challenges. 
On the retail side, the diversification of our EMEA retail business was a significant driver of results in 2015, and BlackRock saw active net inflows from retail clients, led by our European equity and income, our unconstrained fixed-income products, our high-yield products and our multi-asset income products. In the United States, the breadth of BlackRock's product suite across active index and iShares resonated with our retail clients. We remain focused on growing global iShares market share and driving market -- global market expansion, which translated into strong flows in 2015. 
The fourth quarter was a record quarter for iShares as investors continue to turn to BlackRock iShares franchise, which generated $60 billion in net inflows across asset classes. For the quarter and for the year, iShares captured the #1 share of flows in the U.S., Europe, globally, with 37% global market share for the full year. 2015 iShares flows was $130 billion, primarily driven by developed market equities and fixed income. 
The global Core Series saw flows of $46 billion, representing a 23% organic growth. And record fixed income flows of $50 billion was concentrated in our high-yield products, including investment-grade corporate bonds and our high-yield funds. Fixed income is a strategic priority for iShares, which led the industry in fixed income ETF flows for the quarter and for the year, driven by iShares' consistency of having 15 of the top 25 fixed income ETFs by net flows in 2015. 
Fixed income market volatility rose in December, and during this time, a market-stressed BlackRock flagship high-yield ETF, HYG, enabled clients to transact directly with one another at known, transparent, minute-by-minute pricing with ample liquidity. More than $20 billion of HYG traded in the 2 weeks ending December 18, with less than $1 billion of net redemptions, providing our markets and our clients substantial liquidity with limited impact on the underlying markets. 
As we look back in 2015, despite these spikes in market volatility, ETFs, and specifically iShares, are increasingly being relied upon by clients for transparent, liquid, cost-effective investment solutions. We continue to find opportunities to learn from market events, to educate investors and focus on the long-term needs of our clients in iShares and across BlackRock's platform by investing in areas that we believe will result in a more complete solutions offering for our clients and deliver value for our shareholders. Being aware of what is going on in the world around us, anticipating change and having the willingness to adapt is a critical part of our responsibility as a fiduciary to our clients. 
Throughout the year, BlackRock has made significant enhancements to our platform through a combination of investment for organic growth, for acquisitions and the evolution of our talent. Technology is increasingly impacting our clients and our business. In 2015, we made investments to utilize technology to gain new investment insights and to reach our clients more effectively. We're investing in Big Data and text analysis to make better portfolio management decisions across our broad platform of quantitative and fundamental investment styles. 
Factor-based analysis will become more prevalent as market dispersion increases. We made significant enhancements to our smart beta and factor-based investing platform, including the hiring of Andrew Ang. And BlackRock generated nearly $10 billion of smart beta net inflows in 2015, driven by iShares minimum vol funds. 
We're investing in retail technology to empower our intermediary partners for a high-quality, technological-enabled advice capabilities to improve our clients' investment experiences. We closed on the acquisition of FutureAdvisor in the fourth quarter, and we recently signed our first 2 clients, representing the first B2B contracts of their kind in the U.S. Digital wealth management space. 
We continue to see strong demand for alternative solutions as investors move beyond the boundaries of traditional strategies to investments in real estate, infrastructure, other forms of real assets across the liquid platform. Our hedge fund platform has grown 9% annually over the past 5 years and now stands at $31 billion in AUM, and we continue to invest to broaden our platform and leveraging our top-performing internal talent to develop products organically as well as bringing in new managers. 
We remain focused on our responsibility to partner with clients and simultaneously generating long-term returns and create positive social outcomes. Over the past several years, we've grown our infrastructure platform to more than $7 billion. This includes the industry-leading renewable power franchise, a strong infrastructure debt capability and meaningful investments in Latin America like our acquisition and our partnership with PEMEX. These activities offer long-term benefits to both investors and the economies, where they contribute to economic growth, it contributes to the country's job creation and, most importantly, it contributes to a positive environmental impact. 
2015, we continued to invest in the BlackRock Impact platform, which manages now more than $200 billion to provide investors with the opportunity to generate long-term competitive financial returns and positively impact society. At BlackRock, embracing change has always been a core part of who we are. Nearly every year, we take a fresh look at the organization and reflect on ways to improve it. We then evolved the organization in anticipation of changes of our clients' needs and anticipation of the global markets. 
Together with our Board of Directors, we undertake a deliberate process and effort to continually position our leaders in roles that can broaden their experience and maximize their potential both for BlackRock and our clients. This is critical in building a truly global firm. We did this in 2012 and 2014 with very positive benefits. This week, again, we announced a number of enhancements to our leadership team that are part of this consistent process of developing our people and evolving our organizations to meet these challenging needs. 
Looking at the quality of the leaders taking on new or expanded roles, I'm incredibly proud of the depth of the talent that we have, and I believe, today, we have the strongest leadership team we've ever had in the history of BlackRock. And it is the quality and talent of this team that allows BlackRock to deliver the performance we did in 2015 despite the volatile markets and positions us very well for 2016. It is this team, they are the reason that we have forged such a trusting relationship with our clients and why our clients are increasingly turning to BlackRock to solve their biggest financial challenges. As we head into 2016, we will continue to make investments in our future. We will continue to develop our talent and seeking ways to leverage and grow our diverse platform to meet our fiduciary responsibilities to our clients, our fiduciary responsibilities to our societies where we operate and to deliver the returns for our shareholders. 
With that, let's open it up for questions."

Insurance companies are adding to their fixed income exposures now. As I've commented in the past, the whole insurance industry or a good part of it has short-term liability duration and are hoping for higher rates. We haven't seen higher rates. Obviously, we're sitting here with a very low 10-year treasury rate, but we most certainly have seen a widening in credit spreads. And I think as evidence of a few large bond issues that went public this week, we saw huge demand. And so as spreads widen, we expect to see more demand institutionally. And as you suggested, some of the widening of spreads and the fears of high rates are going to produce some selling possibly from retail, but we haven't seen anything dramatic yet. We haven't seen really any dramatic outflows on iShares yet. So I don't think there is any real massive change. And I think one thing you should be aware of, Craig, at this time, this is when you have the institutions sitting down on their -- this year's asset allocation. You're going to start seeing behavior changes probably in February and March when they start doing their reallocation maybe. And so most certainly, one would think, in some cases, some pension funds, because of decline in equities, it will rebalance out of fixed income back into equities as they -- if they want to have consistent asset allocations. But our performance in fixed income, I think we had 91% of our products above peer medium over the last 3 years. And so -- and that's across all our European fixed income, our U.S. fixed income, our unconstrained products, our low-duration products, mortgage products, high yield. And so we're in a pretty good position to have a lot of broad-based conversations with our clients."

And I would say that was a function initially of timing and, as the markets became more volatile during the year, frankly, overall expense awareness. So the fourth quarter G&A was clearly higher, and in fact, we booked roughly 1/3 of our annual M&P spend in the quarter alone. And as you saw, we incurred about $23 million of onetime deal expenses. Given that elevated level of G&A, the fourth quarter is clearly not representative of a good run rate for next year. Notwithstanding that, as you saw, G&A expense was 2% below last year, and I think that reflects our ability to manage the discretionary portion of our G&A expense in an uncertain market environment. And we continue to remain conscious of the trade-off between growth and margin, especially as we think about that discretionary portion of our spending and the current markets. That being said, I think that if markets stabilize and given the impact of recent acquisitions on our run rate, we would anticipate a higher level of G&A spend during the year, but there's obviously some discretion tied to that. And we'll be watching it very carefully."

A, I think it is appropriate as an industry that we identify the risk associated to liquidity of every product. I think there should be an appropriate measurement that is consistent, and there should be probably different variances by product as how you think about liquidity. And I think it's an important for our investors worldwide to have some form of measurement tools so they could assess the liquidity risk associated with any one product. And then you could see if there is a sharp divergence between one fund and another in terms of liquidity. I think we learned that with the Third Avenue episode earlier -- late last year, with their divergency related to liquidity in their product. So to me, that is a great example where you could -- if we had some form of measurement tool, the investors who invested in products like debtor funds like that could have assessed, ""Is it -- am I getting the returns necessary to offset the illiquidity that is a component of that investment strategy?"" So we're pretty sympathetic to all these things. And the dilemma really arises for the SEC because if there is some assessment of some sort of a large liquidity pool for every product, it really then will reduce investment dollars into the markets. It's going to put -- it will degrade returns for retail investors. The last thing you would want is having retail investors having degradation in their returns because we are all going to be assessed some type of liquidity threshold and then all the institutional managers will go to separate accounts that may have only 30-day redemption features. So I -- the last thing we want to do is hurt retail. So I think a measurement tool of some sort is probably correct. Beyond some type of measurement tool of having some type of cash holding, I'm kind of -- I don't have a hard fast opinion on it, but I do believe that it represents some risk. And then I think there are different characteristics between liquidity of an ETF and liquidity of an open-ended fund. I think our application has asked that they assess and look at the characteristics, differences between ETFs and open-end mutual funds, and we've recommended to the SEC to develop a separate and comprehensive rule addressing those different investment product types and their associated risk. So this is going to be addressed probably some time in 2016. I think there's going to be quite a bit of time for comment period and discussion, and we'll see where this goes. But I think this is -- we are in favor of this. I mean one thing that's important -- especially in an environment where markets are really unpleasant like what we're experiencing now, one of the big issues is, what are Americans doing now with their big energy savings? Are they investing for retirement? Are they sitting with more of their cash in cash? If we can have more and more investors feel comfortable that they can invest safely and soundly and they have a better understanding of the risks and the characteristics of investing and understanding the liquidity of a lot of products, if that can then translate into more clients feeling good about investing for the outcome of retirement, this is all good. So this is why we are in favor of this type of narrative and dialogue. Obviously, we'll have opinions on how that will play out."

Just so we kind of understand. And you guys do that every year, meaning from the first to the fourth, but I just want to make sure we get that. And then if the markets do remain volatile and pretty challenging, is there any way of guiding in terms of the expense base, whether it's G&A or overall, what's more variable, meaning you have more discretion there?"

I mean, I wish I could give you a better answer than you're probably looking for here, Michael. But I think we obviously are -- from an M&P standpoint, we plan a spend level during the year, but, frankly, we react during the year and maintain appropriate flexibility to make sure that we can get the biggest bang for our dollar and make sure that we're not simply spending money in a time period where we don't think people are going to be receptive to a lot of the messages. I think Larry has talked about, in volatility, a lot of investors basically makes it [ph] on the sidelines. Almost nothing you're going to tell them or communicate to them is really going to change their mind. So there is an element of kind of managing it real time, and we're going to continue to do that. So I can't really give you a whole lot of guidance there. But I think important in terms of thinking about broader margin trends, I know you're tired of hearing me say this, but we really aren't managing the business to a margin target, either quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year. We are absolutely committed as part of our financial framework to growing and delivering operating leverage. And I think we've shown you that we've done that, right? I'll go back, I've said this on my opening remarks, but we've expanded the margin by 450-plus basis points since BGI. We've reinvested probably $1 billion back into the business, and we're going to continue to commit to striking the right balance between strategic investments and managing our spend. It's a lot easier for everyone sitting around this table, candidly, to cut costs than it is to invest for growth. That's the hard part. And I think that the diversification of our model at the moment gives us the option to continue to invest through a market cycle when many others may be forced to pull back, but we're not going to be blind to that. And I think the key is obviously kind of watching what's going on here and trying to determine at what point it really becomes more of a near-term item and more of a mid- to long term, and then, obviously, we'll react appropriately."

And however, as we -- as you witnessed when -- as shareholders in 2008 and '09, we managed expenses quite extraordinarily at times when you had to do that. So it's going to be a mix. But we do have a mindset of growing the business, and that's the differentiating factor. As Gary said, it's a lot easier to just -- in cutting expenses or cutting headcount, it's a lot more bold to make the investments at the time when everybody is running away from investments, and we will continue to look at both."

And we're going to respond, and we'll respond as far as the fees go as well. But we see that continuing to grow as it gives you -- gives the client much better access to that precision instrument that they're looking for. Institutions, on the other hand, I think we'll see. We're seeing they're expressing first in the high yield because they're yield hogs and they're looking for yield. But as we expand out the product set, I think they'll be looking to invest in a Core Series as well, but I don't really think that's going to put pressure on our fees, quite frankly, because the institutional set looks differently at the ETF market than the buy-and-hold set. They're looking for liquidity so it's important that we grow these particular products so they have the liquidity, and they're willing to pay for the liquidity and access into those sectors. So it started out, the global Core Series, which has been very successful for us this year, and we raised a significant amount of assets, about $46 billion. I think that is going to expand institutionally, and we're going to also buffer that with other products that institutions are looking at to get that precision investment."

And we find that there's a tremendous amount of crossover between the 2, an overlap, and so rather than let our own internal bureaucracy get in the way of the returns for the clients, we have these groups now working very closely together and understanding where the overlap is and utilizing that overlap to add additional alpha into the portfolios. So I think by having these 2 teams really merged together, you will see better results and better alpha from the active equity business, and it will be much less confusing to our clients as to when they come in, how we are driving alpha. And I think that will add to also increased interest in the BlackRock portfolio, and my goal is to make sure that we are considered a very formidable manager of active equities. So there will be no one that will have the span of equity products that we have across both the quantitative and the fundamental offerings. So yes, I'm very excited about it, and I think having this group work together has already shown some very good results in this year. Our equity performance is better than it's ever been.

It's my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2016. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results.

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As usual, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
In the context of continued market challenges over the last 12 months, including global equity markets down high single digits, emerging markets and natural resources each down over 20%, and continuation of a low, and in many cases, negative rate environment, the differentiation and strength of BlackRock's broad, global investment platform enabled us to deliver another quarter of positive organic asset growth. While we are not immune to market headwinds, consistent organic growth and prudent expense had allowed us to deliver relatively stable-based fees and increased margins from a year ago and continue to consistently return capital to shareholders. 
Our first quarter results highlight the value of the investments we've made to assemble the industry's broadest offering of active and indexed investment products and to deliver differentiated customized investment solutions to our clients. The diversity of our platform positions us to serve our clients' needs in a variety of market environments, helping to drive consistent and differentiated organic growth. As we stated last quarter, we remain committed to investing in a number of strategic initiatives that will further enhance our client value proposition and generate long-term value for shareholders. Doing so requires us to make smarter -- to be smarter about reallocating resources in challenging markets. With that in mind, this quarter, we undertook a restructuring to streamline and simplify the organization with a goal of efficiently optimizing growth. It will also create new opportunities for our strongest people. This resulted in a restructuring charge of $76 million during the quarter, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards for approximately 400 impacted employees. This charge appears as a single line expense item on our GAAP income statement and has been excluded from our as-adjusted results. 
First quarter revenue of $2.6 billion was 4% lower than a year ago while operating income of $1 billion was down 3%. Earnings per share of $4.25 declined more significantly versus the prior year quarter, driven by a onetime nonoperating gain and a lower effective tax rate a year ago. 
Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $8 million of net investment gains and a decrease from the first quarter of 2015 due to lower margin in the current quarter and a $40 million, onetime, noncash gain related to the acquisition of BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors in last year's first quarter. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 29.6% compared to 23.7% a year ago, reflecting several variable nonrecurring items. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2016, though the effective actual tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring items that could arise during the year. 
BlackRock's first quarter results reflected $36 billion of long-term net inflows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 3% and demonstrated the continued resilience of BlackRock's differentiated business model. Flows were positive across both active and index and across regions as positive momentum in March more than offset a slow start to the year. While organic base fee growth for the quarter was 2%, lagging organic asset growth and strong fixed income flows were offset from outflows from higher fee equity products. Over the last 12 months, BlackRock's organic base fee growth still remains above our long-term organic AUM growth. 
First quarter base fees were down 1% year-over-year as organic AUM growth of $118 billion of last 12 months partially offset the impact of $148 billion of negative market and FX movement. Sequentially, base fees were down 4% despite positive organic growth in the quarter as first quarter average AUM declined from fourth quarter levels due to significant market declines in January and early February. Market improvements that occurred at the end of the quarter had a limited impact on first quarter base fees but should act as tailwinds as we move into the second quarter. 
In a difficult period for the hedge fund industry, with the HFRX index down 2% in the quarter, performance fees of $34 million decreased significantly from a year ago, driven by declines in the [indiscernible] associated with single-strategy hedge funds, funded hedge funds and certain loan-only equity products. Underperformance during the first quarter may have a negative impact on performance fees for the full year as certain quarterly locking funds are below high water marks while others locked base on trailing 12-month performance periods. 
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $171 million was up 16% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Our Aladdin business, which represented 82% of BRS revenue in the quarter, grew 12% year-over-year, driven by several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform in 2015. We continue to see strong market demand from institutional asset managers and owners as they look to consolidate global investment platforms and understand risks across multi-asset class portfolios. Additionally, a rapidly changing regulatory and technology environment is driving accelerated conversations with retail intermediaries about leveraging both Aladdin and FutureAdvisor capabilities in the wealth management space. Non-aladdin BRS revenue was up $9 million year-over-year, though down $3 million sequentially due to completion of a number of assignments in last year's fourth quarter. Our financial markets advisory business continues to reflect a more stable revenue profile, driven by higher level of repeat engagements, and is well positioned to benefit from changes in a regulatory landscape affecting financial institutions and official sector clients worldwide. 
Other revenue was down $12 million year-over-year primarily due to lower earnings from equity method investment. 
Total expense decreased 4% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, driven primarily by lower compensation and G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was down $32 million or 3% year-over-year, reflecting lower incentive compensation, driven primarily by lower performance fees, partially offset by a higher headcount. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was down 4%, reflecting lower incentive compensation, partially offset by higher taxes and an increase in stock-based compensation expense related to grants of prior year awards. 
Looking forward, despite the first quarter restructuring, and assuming stable markets, we currently anticipate ending the year with higher total headcount than we have today, but with a compensation-to-revenue ratio modestly lower than 2015. G&A expense was down 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower discretionary marketing and promotional spend and an increased benefit from the impact of foreign exchange remeasurement. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $92 million, primarily reflecting the seasonal and discretionary impact of lower marketing promotional expense, reduced foreign exchange remeasurement expense and $23 million of deal-related expense associated with strategic transactions executed in last year's fourth quarter. As discussed last quarter, we remain extremely expense-aware in the current market environment and will continue to be prudent with our discretionary G&A spend. At present, and again assuming stable markets, we currently anticipate full year 2016 G&A expense to be approximately in line with 2015 levels. 
Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 41.6% was up 40 basis points year-over-year and flat sequentially. BlackRock's ability to generate positive year-over-year operating leverage in a negative beta environment highlights our commitment to prudently managing expense while continuing to invest for future growth. We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, we anticipate closing the Bank of America Global Capital Management transaction later this month, assuming investment management responsibilities for approximately $87 billion of related cash and liquidity AUM. 
We previously announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.29 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $300 million worth of shares in the first quarter. We saw an opportunity to modestly increase our level of share repurchases during the quarter as sizable market moves and changes in the relative valuation of our stock in January and February created an attractive buying opportunity. We stand by the guidance we previously provided in last year's fourth quarter as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year. 
First quarter long-term net inflows of $36 billion reflected the diversity of our platform. Flows were positive in both active and indexed and across all regions. BlackRock's global retail franchise saw minor long-term net outflows as positive flows in the United States were broadly offset by international outflows. BlackRock's U.S. retail business generated long-term net inflows of $1 billion, demonstrating resilience in what was a challenging quarter for the domestic fund industry with U.S. active mutual funds experiencing negative flows during a first quarter for the first time since the financial crisis. BlackRock's flows were driven by strong long-term investment performance across our fixed income platform, including flows into our total return, high yield and strategic municipal opportunities funds, all of which are performing at the top quartile for the trailing 5-year period. International retail net outflows of $1 billion were primarily related to outflows in international equities and multi-asset funds amid market uncertainty and industry-wide derisking. These flows were partially offset by inflows into our natural resources franchise, which benefited from commodities re-risking during the quarter. Global iShares generated over $24 billion of net new business in the first quarter, representing 9% annualized organic growth, with record fixed income net inflows of $27 billion, partially offset by outflows from developed market equities. Our institutional business generated $12 billion in long-term net inflows in the first quarter driven by higher fee active offerings. Institutional active net inflows of $11 billion represented the eighth consecutive quarter of positive active flows for the business and reflected BlackRock's strong multi-asset capabilities and top-performing fixed income platform. Multi-asset inflows reflected solutions-based fundings, particularly in the insurance outsourcing space and demand for our LifePath target date series. Fixed income net inflows were led by flows into investment-grade strategies. Institutional active equity outflows of $2 billion reflected outflows in our Fundamental Equity business, partially offset by inflows into our scientific active equity business, where 98% of assets are continuing to perform above benchmark on a trailing 5-year period. In addition, we had another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising more than $1.5 billion in new commitments and now have $12 billion in committed capital to deploy for clients. Illiquid alternatives remain a key area of growth for BlackRock as our institutional clients increasingly search for additional sources of income and uncorrelated returns. Institutional Index saw $1 billion of net inflows as strong inflows into LDI strategies were partially offset by outflows from index equities. 
Overall, our first quarter results reflect the benefits from the investments we've made to build a differentiated global business model and our ability to effectively navigate expenses in a challenging beta environment. Diversification across investment styles, distribution channels, products and geographies enables us to serve clients, irrespective of the market environment or investment performance. We will continue to be mindful of the trade-off between growth and margin, looking to strike the right balance between investing in key strategic initiatives and optimizing expenses. Our goal remains to deliver consistent and differentiated organic AUM growth over time. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our first quarter results demonstrates that BlackRock continues to earn our clients' trust in uncertain market environments as we manage risks and deliver investment solutions to",2047,"Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our first quarter results demonstrates that BlackRock continues to earn our clients' trust in uncertain market environments as we manage risks and deliver investment solutions to achieve our clients' long-term investment goals. Economic, social and geopolitical instability drove dramatic market swings in the first quarter. Fears of global recession and the risk of Chinese currency devaluation drove stocks lower to start the year. Investors continue to struggle to digest lower energy prices, negative rate spreads in Europe and Japan. And uncertainty grew from political developments in countries including the United States, Germany, Spain, Brazil and the pending vote in the U.K. on whether to leave the European Union, pushing global markets down more than double-digit percentages in the opening weeks of the year. In February, stabilizing commodity prices and more dovish commentary from the Federal Reserve helped spark a risk on rotation despite continued policy uncertainties and questions surrounding global growth. As Gary mentioned, given the fact that we earn fees on average AUM, we did not realize much of the financial benefit of the market upswing in the first quarter, but we are positioned to benefit from the tailwinds going into the second quarter. 
It is especially in times like this marked by volatility and investor uncertainty that more clients are looking to BlackRock for their investment guidance. Our goal is not to just sell them individual products, but rather to understand our clients' objectives, their needs and to fashion a cohesive solution that helps achieve those goals. While many firms claim to do the same, no other asset manager draws from the same breadth of active, indexed and alternative strategies; investment styles across asset classes and regions; risk management and technology and focus on long-term solutions. These capabilities, combined with the talent and fiduciary culture of the BlackRock team, enables us to have a deeper conversation with our clients as they make important decisions around portfolio construction and asset allocation. This heightened level of client engagement is translating into consistent growth with $36 billion of long-term net new flows in the quarter representing 3% organic growth, driven by our strength in iShares and institutional actives. The fact that we are again seeing such diverse inflows in this very volatile market speaks to the power of our platform we built over time. We consistently invested in capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our clients, and we will continue to invest to helping our clients so we could show future growth in the quarters to come. As clients increasingly look to ETFs as alternatives to individual stocks and bonds, derivatives and mutual funds, we continue to grow our iShares business to meet their needs. Investors turned to iShares in the first quarter as they navigated heightened volatility, and our ETF business saw $24 billion of net inflows. As was the case for the full year in 2015, BlackRock captured the #1 market share of net new business globally, in the United States and in Europe, and the #1 market share in fixed income. 
Two global iShares priorities drove our inflows. First was fixed income. BlackRock has been been fielding our fixed income ETF capabilities for several years. We now manage more than $290 billion in fixed income iShares, which, as a stand-alone franchise, would represent the fourth largest ETF player in the industry. After seeing $50 billion in fixed income inflows for the full year of 2015, this quarter, we generated record quarterly net inflows of $27 billion. Risk off settlement -- sentiment initially drove demand for U.S. treasuries. And as the market conditions improved, client added to their U.S.-European credit exposures. 
We see significant growth ahead for fixed income iShares. A widening range of clients are adopting fixed income iShares as a diversified, efficient investment tools and as substitutes for cash and derivatives as bank balance sheets continue to be strong. Despite rapid growth, fixed income ETFs currently only have 1/10 of the share of global bond market assets that equity ETFs have in the global equity markets, offering a significant opportunity to increase the penetration in the $100 trillion global fixed income market. 
The second priority is smart beta. BlackRock is investing in factors and factor products that we believe will become increasingly important as allocation tools and alternatives to traditional beta or lower alpha capture active strategies, and BlackRock now manages more than $125 billion across a range of factor-based solutions. 
Our iShares minimum volatility products raised nearly $7 billion globally in the quarter, leading the ETF industry smart beta category and increasing our smart beta ETF AUM to $67 billion. Additionally, our newer single-factor products have started to achieve scale at $5 billion, and we are now bringing multifactor iShares to market to complete our offering. 
In our institutional business, first quarter net inflows of $12 billion were driven by strong active fixed income and multi-asset asset flows as the investments we made to diversify our institutional platform are generating results. As we strengthened the diversity of our institutional platform over time, we are deepening our existing client relationships, and more than 50% of BlackRock's largest institutional clients now have 5 or more products managed by BlackRock. For those who have been our investors since 2009 when we did the BGI merger, we've talked about this in great detail as one of the merits of why we thought the merger would work. At that time, we had less than 20% of our clients having more than 1 product. And so one of the great results and why I truly believe our positioning, our penetration, with our clients is through this metrics of how many products we have in terms of positioning ourselves with our clients. And once again, I'll repeat it again, that I am very proud of it, and that's more than 50% of our largest institutional clients have more than 5 or more products managed by BlackRock. 
We saw institutional active fixed income net inflows of nearly $11 billion driven by flows from financial institutional clients as we further expand our relationships with these clients through our solution-oriented approach. BlackRock's financial institution team continues to deliver differentiated investment strategies for these financial institutions, especially in this extended low and negative rate environment. 
In alternatives, we've been investing in the strength and diversity and quality of our platform. We generated more than $1.5 billion of additional illiquid commitments. In the last several years, we have expanded our capabilities in our real estate platform, including infrastructure and real estate. Real estate -- real assets, especially infrastructure, provide clients with the ability achieve long-term financial goals while helping to creating more fertile long-term investment environment, hopefully, by generating jobs and aligning the longer term -- time horizons afforded by greater longevity. BlackRock currently manages more than $30 billion in real assets across our global multiproduct platform. 
BlackRock Solutions revenues grew 16% year-over-year, led by Aladdin, our unifying technology platform. We are seeing growing demand from clients as asset owners and manage -- and managers are focusing on risk management, and they are now learning to utilize more risk management as they adapt to the regulatory changes. As the retail marketplace evolves, we're also seeing increasing opportunities to provide our distribution partners with institutional quality asset allocation, risk management and digital advice capability. 
BlackRock is also intensifying our efforts to leverage the industry's most advanced technologies to enhance client service, to build better investment products and portfolios, and importantly, to identify new and better sources of alpha. 
On the distribution side, FutureAdvisor, which operates within BlackRock Solutions, allows us to strengthen relationships with our distribution partners by offering their clients high-quality, technology-enabled advice, backed by BlackRock's broad investment platform, our Aladdin Risk Analytics, our proprietary retirement technology and our long-standing experience as an enterprise technology partner to other financial institutions. We're seeing growing demand from our intermediary partners for BlackRock FutureAdvisor Solution, including our latest partnership we announced yesterday. 
On the investment side, BlackRock's investment team, including our active equity, our model-based fixed income and our multi-asset strategy teams, continue to expand the use of technology-based tools and research methodologies to produce investment insights that contribute to sustainable, consistent alpha generation. These tools include things such as machine learning, natural language processing and scientific data visualization. In these challenging date environments, our clients look to us more than ever to deliver the investment performance they need to meet their liabilities and their financial goals. We maintain a constant focus on enhancing alpha generation across our platforms, ended with the quarter with 89% of our fixed income, 97% of our scientific active equity and 52% of our fundamental active equity products above market or peer medium for the 5-year period. 
The investments that we're making to leverage technology across our platform are part of BlackRock's focus on continuously solving our clients' long-term challenges. As I discussed in my annual letter to shareholders, earlier this week, in a letter I sent in January to CEOs of companies we invest in on behalf of our clients, it is critical that companies focus their strategy on the long-term and clearly articulate their plans for long-term growth and in the context of the environment and the ecosystem in which they operate. 
Just as we continue to invest for the long run, we are constantly evaluating our ecosystem in which we operate, including the markets, regulatory environment, the competitive landscape to identify the changes that might require us to pivot our strategy. 
Last week, the Department of Labor published a fiduciary rule, which has implications for both our clients and our own business. While we're currently reviewing the final rule to thoroughly assess its implications, we are likely to see changes in our distribution partners accounts and fee structures, their product preferences, and importantly, their use of technology, to both build portfolios for clients and to manage their increased risk, and most importantly, their compliance needs. 
BlackRock believes in the importance of always acting as a fiduciary to our clients, and doing so is one of the core principles that we founded our firm upon. BlackRock has also extensive experience with adapting and helping our clients adapt to change in the regulatory environment, most recently through RDR method in Europe. We're leveraging this experience directly with our distribution partners in the U.S. as we listen to and work with them to address the challenges and the opportunities that the DOL rule presents. This is another example where the combination of the breadth and depth of BlackRock's investment platform, our global footprint and experience, our focus on technology and risk management solutions and our strong fiduciary culture differentiates the value proposition that we can deliver to our clients. We have always embraced change, and we will always be looking for ways to better serve our clients, to operate more efficiently, to focus resources on strategic priorities and to create new opportunities for our strongest employees. 
We began 2016 by enhancing our investment platform by increasing connectivity among our investors by aligning with the evolving needs of our clients and positioning talented investment leaders to drive our success, and these changes are working well. Most recently, we initiated a restructuring to streamline and simplify the organization, driving efficiencies across our platform to better serve our clients, to deliver returns for our shareholders. It will also create opportunities for our strongest employees. 
Over the last 3 years, we have grown our employee base by more than 20%. We added 2,500 employees to support improvements in client service and technology and enhancing alpha generation. We remain commitment -- committed to investing in our business to leverage the opportunities ahead of us to drive continued growth despite current market volatility. Doing so requires making smart, and unfortunately, difficult decisions about allocating resources, which we must always do. While the uncertain environment we face is unsettling at times, it is also an opportunity to look out in the future, to capture new alpha-generating opportunities, to use technology in innovating ways and to build on our platform to serve our clients' evolving needs, create continued opportunities for our employees to deliver consistent returns for our shareholders. 
Now let me open it up for questions."

Well, probably, most importantly, BlackRock has supported the changes to the financial ecosystem. If we can enhance confidence with investors, I believe through that mechanism it's going to increase and promote more investing, less savings in their bank accounts. So more investing and the more money clients are putting to work with greater confidence. And if then -- it's a benefit actually for the entire industry. And I think that's one of the big points that have not been part of the dialogue, and I think that's an important -- a really important point. We need to have more investor confidence. I think one of the great problems we have with longevity, we have -- in human aging process, and importantly with the inability of so many people investing, what I would call, properly, too much cash, probably overemphasis on bonds. If they believe the DOL rules will give them better transparency, better certainty that they're being treated right and they invest more money for the long run, it's better for the country, it's better for their financial future, and it's really very good for the entire industry. And I think that message is totally lost in the conversation. Directly to the issue around how this is going to play out, first of all, it's a very lengthy rule. It's going to take quite some time for everyone to determine how it meets their business model, but I would say the position of BlackRock, given the breadth of our product platform in both active and indexed and the investments we've made in technology -- and I really want to underscore technology, and risk management, we're having really deep conversation with more of our distribution partners and helping them work on solutions for their -- them in their clients. It's still too early to determine the outcome for the DOL rule more broadly, but I think we're as better positioned than any organization. I do believe it's going to require much greater compliance and risk management, so it's very powerful for our Aladdin platform. We believe it can be very powerful for our entire BlackRock Solutions product suite, including FutureAdvisor. And I think, if it means more business in passive, we'll be benefited. If it means more business in active, we're going to be benefiting, too. So I'll just leave it at that. And I actually have a happy General Counsel with that answer. Sorry, Chris."

So Ken, I think as you started out, as we stated last quarter, we are really -- we're maintaining our commitment to investing in a verity of strategic initiatives that will further enhance our client value proposition and generate long-term value for shareholders. And obviously, we're mindful of the challenging markets, as Larry and both I have said, we need to make tough and smarter decisions, especially when it comes reallocating those investment dollars. And one thing I want to make very clear is this restructuring is not about cost cutting. It was about streamlining and simplifying the organization so that we could use those savings to reinvest more efficiently in those strategic growth areas, and as mentioned also, to create new stretch opportunities for our strongest people. It's important to understand that we're really not deemphasizing any particular business. Rather, I'd say we're looking to ensure that the foundation of our businesses are really running as efficiently as possible so we can take those reallocated resources and maximize our investment in the higher growth areas that you mentioned. I'd say there are probably 4 or 5 of those, and I'll let Larry, and Rob, in particular, chime in. And many of those have been mentioned in some of the remarks today. Illiquid alternatives, in particular; the real asset platform, which includes our infrastructure business; factor-based. Larry mentioned over $125 billion there across smart beta and enhanced factor products. Sustainable investing, where we have $200 billion across exclusionary screenings, EST factors and impact [indiscernible]. Obviously, continuing to invest in our iShares business, which we believe continues to have significant runaway in growth from both new uses -- new users and importantly, fixed income, which Larry also mentioned in his comments. And then you mentioned technology as well. And I think -- before I let Larry comment, the issue there on technology is it really impacts everything we do across the organization. It impacts how we invest, in particular, big data and the like, machine learning, language and the like that Larry mentioned, which is importantly, critically important for improvements in our active platform as well as technology to enhance serving our clients, whether it be through Aladdin, Aladdin For Wealth, FutureAdvisor and the others. I think those are a number of the areas that we're really looking to make sure that we are continuing to feed because we think there's incremental and differentiated growth available to us."

And we currently manage about $125 billion in these factor-based strategies. And within that, about $115 billion is smart beta. So we think this is going to grow. BlackRock's iShares, smart beta ETFs are leading the industry now with about $8.5 billion of net inflows in the first quarter, including about $7 billion into the iShares minimum volatility strategies. So these are in asset strategies that take advantage of various sectors and factors in the marketplace to add additional value. So we're adding a lot of people in this category, adding a lot of technology. And we think that it's going to be a very good way, a successful way for our active managers to add additional alpha."

Well, negative -- if you think about 70% of our clients or more are pension funds, high risk, some form of retirement and insurance companies, we hear worldwide have negative interest rates or low interest rates have been impactful and how they are actually harming their objectives of obtaining an asset base to meet their liability needs. In fact, last week, we were with one of the largest New York State funds -- U.S. state funds, not New York State funds. One of the largest U.S. state funds that happen to be in New York City, that's for a meeting we had, and they were in the top deciles of performance last year. And because of low negative interest rates, then they're discounting rate. They actually deteriorated their asset and liability gap. We're hearing is worldwide. We're hearing from savers worldwide they're not going to meet the needs of building their pool of savings to meet the needs of retirement. We're hearing from insurance companies that they're going to have a really hard time meeting their liabilities. And so what is -- so they're looking for more advice. Importantly, what we saw, especially in the first 6 weeks of the year when you had major selling pressure in many components of the world, we saw huge insurance companies interested in buying. We saw widening of spreads. We talked about infrastructure. If we could find large opportunities for infrastructure globally, we have the demand, so clients are looking for more opportunities -- more opportunities. They're looking to invest in different types of products. I believe our platform is giving us more connectivity with our clients. And I do believe, as my shareholder letter stated, I believe a lower negative interest rates have served a great purpose in the short run, but I don't believe lower negative interest rates was supposed to be a permanent feature of the investment landscape. We are now entering the eighth year, and I believe that we are going to have a stronger, more robust economy. And the IMF just lowered their forecast even more for, like, I think the fifth time in a row. We're going to need policy responses by governments. I think the dependency on central bank behavior is one of the problems that we have in the world, and we need policy response by governments related to fiscal policy."

It's actually quite incredible, the amount of cash that's sitting in banks today earning 0. And that money has typically been in the fixed income market. And in order to have access to fixed income, our clients are using more and more ETFs because of all the features that they see, which is the liquidity, the low cost, the tax efficiency. And it's just easier access, and this is where the money is going to flow first. And most people have more of their money in fixed income than they do in equities anyway. So this has been the growth in the first quarter. We are set by having a wide variety of types of fixed income ETFs that they can invest in. And we do see a lot more secondary trading that's going on in these, but we're seeing investment-grade and high-yield corporate bond ETF assets under management grow from about $5 billion to $165 billion, and that's from 2007 to 2015. And this is going to be a very strategic growth area for us. And as Larry cited in his opening, we saw a record $27 billion of net inflows into the fixed income ETFs in the first quarter. So this is really, I think, the big growth area. We have a very long-term history of BlackRock in fixed income, and we are using that historical background and technology that we built to even enhance our reputation more in this business."

And obviously, we're enhancing our technology for our retail clients. FutureAdvisor is just one. We're seeing the digital -- the side of the digital end, but we're also using and leveraging Aladdin to bring portfolio construction, risk analytics tools to financial advisers as well as private bankers. And we're doing that with a number of different areas of growth, whether it be Aladdin portfolio or portfolio construction services or Aladdin For Wealth, importantly. And we are streamlining our sales processes with technology to enhance yielding greater efficiency and effectiveness through doing that. FutureAdvisor, in particular, which, as you know, operates within BlackRock Solutions, allows us to strengthen relationships with our distribution partners by offering their clients high-quality, technology-enabled advice, and most importantly, backed by BlackRock's broad investment platform, our Aladdin risk analytics, our proprietary retirement technology, and obviously, our longstanding experience as enterprise technology partners to other financial situation. I think that is probably the key differentiating factor for us at the moment because what were's noticing, whether it's the commercial arrangement announced this week or some others that, frankly, we have signed but haven't publicly announced, this looks like a very long, long-term and complicated implementation that frankly is exactly what we've been doing with Aladdin over the last couple of decades. And so while there are certain competitors, I think, who are trying to mimic or follow, or in many cases, replicate the type of strategy that we're doing here, the real difference is that we've been involved in client implementations -- very complex client implementations for a significant period of time. I think that is really going to be the differentiating factor. As it relates to the economics, the economics on these things are, frankly, very much customized in some respects. There are platform fees. There are implementation fees. In some cases, there are minimum fees that will be underlying management fees to the extent that the client chooses to either use our own models or populate those models with iShares. But importantly, we're looking to customize as much as we can to meet our intermediary partners' objectives."

In some cases, there's more expenses than revenues in the early years -- early year. And as it's being implemented, then -- and the utilization and then we have all the other service fees, it starts throwing off and generating, depending on the utilization, we hope large fee increases. But more importantly, we also believe having this linkage creates a deeper connection with our clients than our distribution partners. So it's not just the singularity of having more products through these types of channels, but it is also deeper, more consistent connections with these clients. And so this is one of the reasons why we saw earlier than anyone related to the connectivity that digital advice can give or us with distribution partners. And so we're very excited about it. I would also say that it's -- the desire, the demand, the interest, the request for presentations is far greater than we ever imagined."

It's my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2016. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As usual, I will be f",1882,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2016. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As usual, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
In the context of continued market challenges over the last 12 months, including global equity markets down high single digits, emerging markets and natural resources each down over 20%, and a continuation of a low, and in many cases, negative-rate environment, the differentiation and strength of BlackRock's broad, global investment platform enabled us to deliver another quarter of positive organic asset growth. While we are not immune to market headwinds, consistent organic growth and prudent expense discipline allowed us to deliver relatively stable-based fees and increased margins from a year ago and continue to consistently return capital to shareholders.
Our first quarter results highlight the value of the investments we've made to assemble the industry's broadest offering of active and index investment products, and to deliver differentiated customized investment solutions to our clients. The diversity of our platform positions us to serve our clients' needs in a variety of market environments, helping to drive consistent and differentiated organic growth.
As we stated last quarter, we remain committed to investing in a number of strategic initiatives that will further enhance our client value proposition and generate long-term value for shareholders. Doing so requires us to make smarter -- to be smarter about reallocating resources in challenging markets. With that in mind, this quarter, we undertook a restructuring to streamline and simplify the organization with a goal of efficiently optimizing growth. It will also create new opportunities for our strongest people.
This resulted in a restructuring charge of $76 million during the quarter, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards for approximately 400 impacted employees. This charge appears as a single line expense item on our GAAP income statement and has been excluded from our as-adjusted results. 
First quarter revenue of $2.6 billion was 4% lower than a year ago, while operating income of $1 billion was down 3%. Earnings per share of $4.25 declined more significantly versus the prior year quarter, driven by a onetime nonoperating gain and a lower effective tax rate a year ago. 
Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $8 million of net investment gains and a decrease from the first quarter of 2015 due to lower margin in the current quarter and a $40 million, onetime, noncash gain related to the acquisition of BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors in last year's first quarter. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 29.6% compared to 23.7% a year ago, reflecting several favorable nonrecurring items. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2016, though the effective actual tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring items that could arise during the year. 
BlackRock's first quarter results reflected $36 billion of long-term net inflows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 3% and demonstrated the continued resilience of BlackRock's differentiated business model. Flows were positive across both active and index and across regions, as positive momentum in March more than offset a slow start to the year. While organic base fee growth for the quarter was 2%, lagging organic asset growth and strong fixed income flows were offset from outflows from higher fee equity products. Over the last 12 months, BlackRock's organic base fee growth still remains above our long-term organic AUM growth. 
First quarter base fees were down 1% year-over-year as organic AUM growth of $118 billion over the last 12 months partially offset the impact of $148 billion of negative market and FX movement. Sequentially, base fees were down 4% despite positive organic growth over the quarter, as first quarter average AUM declined from fourth quarter levels due to significant market declines in January and early February. Market improvements that occurred at the end of the quarter had a limited impact on first quarter base fees, but should act as tailwind as we move into the second quarter. 
In a difficult period for the hedge fund industry with the HFRX index down 2% in the quarter, performance fees of $34 million decreased significantly from a year ago, driven by declines in associated with single-strategy hedge funds, funded hedge funds and certain long-only equity products. Underperformance during the first quarter may have a negative impact on performance fees for the full year as certain quarterly locked-in funds are below high watermarks, while others lock based on trailing 12-month performance periods. 
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $171 million was up 16% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Our Aladdin business, which represented 82% of BRS revenue in the quarter, grew 12% year-over-year, driven by several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform in 2015. We continue to see strong market demand from institutional asset managers and owners as they look to consolidate global investment platforms and understand risks across multi-asset class portfolios. Additionally, a rapidly changing regulatory and technology environment is driving accelerated conversations with retail intermediaries about leveraging both Aladdin and FutureAdvisor capabilities in the wealth management space.
Non-Aladdin BRS revenue was up $9 million year-over-year, though down $3 million sequentially due to completion of a number of assignments in last year's fourth quarter. Our Financial Markets Advisory business continues to reflect a more stable revenue profile, driven by a higher level of repeat engagements and is well positioned to benefit from changes in a regulatory landscape affecting financial institutions and official sector clients worldwide. Other revenue was down $12 million year-over-year primarily due to lower earnings from equity method investment. 
Total expense decreased 4% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, driven primarily by lower compensation and G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was down $32 million or 3% year-over-year, reflecting lower incentive compensation, driven primarily by lower performance fees, partially offset by a higher headcount. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was down 4%, reflecting lower incentive compensation, partially offset by higher payroll taxes and an increase in stock-based compensation expense related to grants of prior year awards. 
Looking forward, despite the first quarter restructuring and assuming stable markets, we currently anticipate ending the year with higher total headcount than we have today, but with a compensation-to-revenue ratio modestly lower than 2015. G&A expense was down 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower discretionary marketing and promotional spend and an increased benefit from the impact of foreign exchange remeasurement. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $92 million, primarily reflecting the seasonal and discretionary impact of lower marketing promotional expense, reduced foreign exchange remeasurement expense and $23 million of deal-related expense associated with strategic transactions executed in last year's fourth quarter.
As discussed last quarter, we remain extremely expense-aware in the current market environment and will continue to be prudent with our discretionary G&A spend. At present, and again assuming stable markets, we currently anticipate full year 2016 G&A expense to be approximately in line with 2015 levels. 
Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 41.6% was up 40 basis points year-over-year and flat sequentially. BlackRock's ability to generate positive year-over-year operating leverage in a negative beta environment highlights our commitment to prudently managing expense while continuing to invest for future growth. We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, we anticipate closing the Bank of America Global Capital Management transaction later this month, assuming investment management responsibilities for approximately $87 billion of related cash and liquidity AUM. 
We previously announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.29 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $300 million worth of shares in the first quarter. We saw an opportunity to modestly increase our level of share repurchases during the quarter as sizable market moves and changes in the relative valuation of our stock in January and February created an attractive buying opportunity. We stand by the guidance we previously provided in last year's fourth quarter as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year. 
First quarter long-term net inflows of $36 billion reflected the diversity of our platform. Flows were positive in both active and index and across all regions. BlackRock's global retail franchise saw minor long-term net outflows as positive flows in the United States were broadly offset by international outflows. BlackRock's U.S. retail business generated long-term net inflows of $1 billion, demonstrating resilience in what was a challenging quarter for the domestic fund industry, with U.S. active mutual funds experiencing negative flows during a first quarter for the first time since the financial crisis. BlackRock's flows were driven by strong long-term investment performance across our fixed income platform, including flows into our total return, high yield and strategic municipal opportunities funds, all of which are performing in the top quartile for the trailing 5-year period.
International retail net outflows of $1 billion were primarily related to outflows in international equities and multi-asset funds amid market uncertainty and industry-wide derisking. These flows were partially offset by inflows into our natural resources franchise, which benefited from commodities re-risking during the quarter. Global iShares generated over $24 billion of net new business in the first quarter, representing 9% annualized organic growth, with record fixed income net inflows of $27 billion, partially offset by outflows from developed market equities.
Our institutional business generated $12 billion in long-term net inflows in the first quarter driven by higher fee active offerings. Institutional active net inflows of $11 billion represented the eighth consecutive quarter of positive active flows for the business and reflected BlackRock's strong multi-asset capabilities and top-performing fixed income platform. Multi-asset inflows reflected solutions-based fundings, particularly in the insurance outsourcing space and demand for our LifePath target date series. Fixed income net inflows were led by flows into investment-grade strategies. 
Institutional active equity outflows of $2 billion reflected outflows on our Fundamental Equities business, partially offset by inflows into our Scientific Active Equity business, where 98% of assets are continuing to perform above benchmark on a trailing 5-year period. In addition, we had another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising more than $1.5 billion in new commitments and now have $12 billion in committed capital to deploy for clients. Illiquid alternatives remain a key area of growth for BlackRock as our institutional clients increasingly search for additional sources of income and uncorrelated returns. Institutional index saw $1 billion of net inflows as strong inflows into LDI strategies were partially offset by outflows from index equities. 
Overall, our first quarter results reflect the benefits from the investments we've made to build a differentiated global business model and our ability to effectively navigate expenses in a challenging beta environment. Diversification across investment styles, distribution channels, products and geographies enables us to serve clients, irrespective of the market environment or investment performance. We will continue to be mindful of the trade-off between growth and margin, looking to strike the right balance between investing in key strategic initiatives and optimizing expenses. Our goal remains to deliver consistent and differentiated organic AUM growth over time. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our first quarter results demonstrates that BlackRock continues to earn our clients' trust in an uncertain market environments as we manage risk and deliver investment solutions",2041,"Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our first quarter results demonstrates that BlackRock continues to earn our clients' trust in an uncertain market environments as we manage risk and deliver investment solutions to achieve our clients' long-term investment goals.
Economic, social and geopolitical instability drove dramatic market swings in the first quarter. Fears of global recession and the risk of Chinese currency devaluation drove stocks lower to start the year. Investors continue to struggle to digest lower energy prices, negative rate spreads in Europe and Japan. And uncertainty grew from political developments in countries including the United States, Germany, Spain, Brazil and the pending vote in the U.K. on whether to leave the European Union, pushing global markets down more than double-digit percentages in the opening weeks of the year.
In February, stabilizing commodity prices and more dovish commentary from the Federal Reserve helped spark a risk on rotation despite continued policy uncertainties and questions surrounding global growth. As Gary mentioned, given the fact that we earn fees on average AUM, we did not realize much of the financial benefit of the market upswing in the first quarter, but we are positioned to benefit from the tailwinds going into the second quarter. 
It is especially in times like this, marked by volatility and investor uncertainty, that more clients are looking to BlackRock for their investment guidance. Our goal is not to just sell them individual products, but rather to understand the clients' objectives, their needs and to fashion a cohesive solution that helps achieve those goals. While many firms claim to do the same, no other asset manager draws from the same breadth of active, index and alternative strategies; investment styles across asset classes and regions; risk management and technology and focus on long-term solutions. These capabilities, combined with the talent and fiduciary culture of the BlackRock team, enables us to have a deeper conversation with our clients as they make important decisions around portfolio construction and asset allocation.
This heightened level of client engagement is translating into consistent growth with $36 billion of long-term net new flows in the quarter representing 3% organic growth, driven by our strength in iShares and institutional actives. The fact that we are again seeing such diverse inflows in this very volatile market speaks to the power of our platform we've built over time. We consistently invested in capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our clients, and we will continue to invest to helping our clients so we could show future growth in the quarters to come.
As clients increasingly look to ETFs as alternatives to individual stocks and bonds, derivatives and mutual funds, we continue to grow our iShares business to meet their needs. Investors turned to iShares in the first quarter as they navigated heightened volatility, and our ETF business saw $24 billion of net flows. As was the case for the full year in 2015, BlackRock captured the #1 market share of net new business globally in the United States and in Europe, and the #1 market share in fixed income. 
Two global iShare priorities drove our inflows. First was fixed income. BlackRock has been building our fixed income ETF capabilities for several years. We now manage more than $290 billion in fixed income iShares, which, as a stand-alone franchise, would represent the fourth largest ETF player in the industry. After seeing $50 billion in fixed income inflows for the full year of 2015, this quarter we generated record quarterly net inflows of $27 billion. Risk of settlement -- sentiment initially drove demand for U.S. treasuries. And as the market conditions improved, client added to their U.S.-European credit exposures. 
We see significant growth ahead for fixed income iShares. A widening range of clients are adopting fixed income iShares as diversified, efficient investment tools and as substitutes for cash and derivatives as bank balance sheets continue to be shrunk. Despite rapid growth, fixed income ETFs currently only have 1/10 of the share of global bond market assets that equity ETFs have in the global equity markets, offering a significant opportunity to increase the penetration in the $100 trillion global fixed income market. 
The second priority is smart beta. BlackRock is investing in factors and factor products that we believe will become increasingly important as asset allocation tools and alternatives to traditional beta or lower alpha capture active strategies, and BlackRock now manages more than $125 billion across a range of factor-based solutions. Our iShares minimum volatility products raised nearly $7 billion globally in the quarter, leading the ETF industry smart beta category and increasing our smart beta ETF AUM to $67 billion. Additionally, our newer single-factor products have started to achieve scale at $5 billion, and we are now bringing multifactor iShares to market to complete our offering. 
In our institutional business, first quarter net inflows of $12 billion were driven by strong active fixed income and multi-asset asset flows as the investments we made to diversify our institutional platform are generating results. As we strengthened the diversity of our institutional platform over time, we are deepening our existing client relationships, and more than 50% of BlackRock's largest institutional clients now have 5 or more products managed by BlackRock.
For those who have been our investor since 2009 when we did the BGI merger, we've talked about this in great detail as one of the merits of why we thought the merger would work. At that time, we had less than 20% of our clients having more than one product. And so one of the great results and why I truly believe our positioning, our penetration, with our clients is through these metrics of how many products we have in terms of positioning ourselves with our clients. And once again, I'll repeat it again, that I am very proud of it, that more than 50% of our largest institutional clients have more than 5 or more products managed by BlackRock. 
We saw institutional active fixed income net inflows of nearly $11 billion driven by flows from financial institutional clients as we further expand our relationships with these clients through our solution-oriented approach. BlackRock's financial institution team continues to deliver differentiated investment strategies for these financial institutions, especially in this extended low and negative rate environment. 
In alternatives, where we've invested to strengthen and diversity and quality of our platform, we generated more than $1.5 billion of additional illiquid commitments. In the last several years, we have expanded our capabilities in our real estate platform, including infrastructure and real estate. Real estate -- real assets, especially infrastructure, provide clients with the ability achieve long-term financial goals while helping to creating more fertile long-term investment environment, hopefully by generating jobs and aligning the longer term -- time horizons afforded by greater longevity. BlackRock currently manages more than $30 billion in real assets across our global multiproduct platform. 
BlackRock Solutions revenues grew 16% year-over-year, led by Aladdin, our unifying technology platform. We are seeing growing demand from clients as asset owners and managers are focusing on risk management. And they are now learning to utilize more risk management as they adapt to the regulatory changes. As the retail marketplace evolves, we are also seeing increasing opportunities to provide our distribution partners with institutional-quality asset allocation, risk management and digital advice capability. BlackRock is also intensifying our efforts to leverage the industry's most advanced technologies to enhance client service, to build better investment products and portfolios, and importantly, to identify new and better sources of alpha. 
On the distribution side, FutureAdvisor, which operates within BlackRock Solutions, allows us to strengthen relationships with our distribution partners by offering their clients high-quality, technology-enabled advice, backed by BlackRock's broad investment platform, our Aladdin risk analytics, our proprietary retirement technology and our long-standing experience as an enterprise technology partner to other financial institutions. We're seeing growing demand from our intermediary partners for BlackRock FutureAdvisor solution, including our latest partnership we announced yesterday. 
On the investment side, BlackRock's investment team, including our active equity, our model-based fixed income and our multi-asset strategy teams, continue to expand the use of technology-based tools and research methodologies to produce investment insights that contribute to sustainable, consistent alpha generation. These tools include things such as machine learning, natural language processing and scientific data visualization. In these challenging beta environments, our clients look to us more than ever to deliver the investment performance they need to meet their liabilities and their financial goals. We maintain a constant focus on enhancing alpha generation across our platforms, ended with the quarter with 89% of our fixed income, 97% of our scientific active equity and 52% of our fundamental active equity products above market or paramedian for the 5-year period. 
The investments that we're making to leverage technology across our platform are part of BlackRock's focus on continuously solving our clients' long-term challenges. As I discussed in my annual letter to shareholders earlier this week, in a letter I sent in January to CEOs of companies we invest in on behalf of our clients, it is critical that companies focus their strategy on the long-term and clearly articulate their plans for long-term growth and in the context of the environment and the ecosystem in which they operate. Just as we continue to invest for the long run, we are constantly evaluating our ecosystem in which we operate, including the markets, regulatory environment, the competitive landscape to identify the changes that might require us to pivot our strategy. 
Last week, the Department of Labor published their fiduciary rule, which has implications for both our clients and our own business. While we're currently reviewing the final rule to thoroughly assess its implications, we are likely to see changes in our distribution partners' accounts and fee structures, their product preferences, and importantly, their use of technology, to both build portfolios for clients and to manage their increased risk, and most importantly, their compliance needs. 
BlackRock believes in the importance of always acting as a fiduciary to our clients, and doing so is one of the core principles that we founded our firm upon. BlackRock has also extensive experience with adapting and helping our clients adapt to change in the regulatory environment, most recently through RDR method in Europe. We're leveraging this experience directly with our distribution partners in the U.S. as we listen to and work with them to address the challenges and the opportunities that the DoL rule presents.
This is another example where the combination of the breadth and depth of BlackRock's investment platform, our global footprint and experience, our focus on technology and risk management solutions and our strong fiduciary culture differentiates the value proposition that we can deliver to our clients. We have always embraced change, and we will always be looking for ways to better serve our clients, to operate more efficiently, to focus resources on strategic priorities and to create new opportunities for our strongest employees. 
We began 2016 by enhancing our investment platform, by increasing connectivity among our investors, by aligning with the evolving needs of our clients and positioning talented investment leaders to drive our success, and these changes are working well. Most recently, we initiated a restructuring to streamline and simplify the organization, driving efficiencies across our platform to better serve our clients, to deliver returns for our shareholders. It will also create opportunities for our strongest employees. 
Over the last 3 years, we have grown our employee base by more than 20%. We added 2,500 employees to support improvements in client service and technology and enhancing alpha generation. We remain commitment -- committed to investing in our business, to leverage the opportunities ahead of us, to drive continued growth despite current market volatility. Doing so requires making smart, and unfortunately difficult decisions about allocating resources, which we must always do.
While the uncertain environment we face is unsettling at times, it is also an opportunity to look out in the future, to capture new alpha-generating opportunities, to use technology in innovating ways and to build on our platform to serve our clients' evolving needs, create continued opportunities for our employees, to deliver consistent returns for our shareholders. 
Now let me open it up for questions."

Well, probably, most importantly, BlackRock has supported the changes to the financial ecosystem. If we can enhance confidence with investors, I believe through that mechanism it's going to increase and promote more investing, less savings in their bank accounts. So the more investing and the more money clients are putting to work with greater confidence, and if -- then it's a benefit actually for the entire industry. And I think that's one of the big points that have not been part of the dialogue. And I think that's an important -- a really important point. We need to have more investor confidence. I think one of the great problems we have with longevity we have in human aging process, and importantly, with the inability of so many people investing in, what I would call, properly too much cash, probably overemphasis on bonds. If they believe the DoL rules will give them better transparency, better certainty that they're being treated right and they invest more money for the long run, it's better for the country, it's better for their financial future, and it's really very good for the entire industry. And I think that message is totally lost in the conversation. Directly to the issue around how this is going to play out, first of all, it's a very lengthy rule. It's going to take quite some time for everyone to determine how it meets their business model. But I would say the position of BlackRock, given the breadth of our product platform in both active and index and the investments we made in technology -- and I really want to underscore technology, and risk management, we're having really deep conversation with more of our distribution partners and helping them work on solutions for their -- them and their clients. It's still too early to determine the outcome for the DoL rule more broadly, but I think we're as better positioned than any organization. I do believe it's going to require much greater compliance and risk management, so it's very powerful for our Aladdin platform. We believe it can be very powerful for our entire BlackRock Solutions product suite, including FutureAdvisor. And I think, if it means more business in passive, we'll be benefiting. If it means more business in active, we're going to be benefiting, too. So I'll just leave it at that. And I actually have a happy General Counsel with that answer. Sorry, Chris."

Ken, thanks so much. So Ken, I think as you started out, as we stated last quarter, we are really -- we're maintaining our commitment to investing in a verity of strategic initiatives that will further enhance our client value proposition and generate long-term value for shareholders. And obviously, we're mindful of the new challenging markets. As Larry and both -- and I said, that we need to make tough and smarter decisions, especially when it comes reallocating those investment dollars. And one thing I want to make very clear is this restructuring was not about cost cutting. It was about streamlining and simplifying the organization so that we could use those savings to reinvest more efficiently in those strategic growth areas, and as mentioned also, to create new stretch opportunities for our strongest people. It's important to understand that we're really not deemphasizing any particular business. Rather, I'd say we're looking to ensure that the foundation of our businesses are really running as efficiently as possible so we can take those reallocated resources and maximize our investment in the higher growth areas that you mentioned. I'd say there are probably 4 or 5 of those, and I'll let Larry and Rob, in particular, chime in. And many of those have been mentioned at some of the remarks today: illiquid alternatives, in particular; the real asset platform, which includes our infrastructure business. Factor-based, Larry mentioned over $125 billion there across smart beta and enhanced factor products; sustainable investing, where we have $200 billion across exclusionary screenings, EST factors and impact investments. Obviously, continuing to invest in our iShares business, which we believe continue to have significant runway in growth from both new uses -- new users and importantly, fixed income, which Larry also mentioned in his comments. And then you mentioned technology as well. And I think, before I let Larry comment, the issue there on technology is it really impacts everything we do across the organization. It impacts how we invest, in particular, big data and the like, machine learning language and the like, that Larry mentioned, which is, importantly, critically important for improvements in our active platform. As well as technology to enhance serving our clients, whether it be through Aladdin, Aladdin for wealth, FutureAdvisor and the others. I think those are a number of the areas that we're really looking to make sure that we're continuing to feed, because we think there's incremental and differentiated growth available to us."

So this is a way of breaking down the performance within an active category to areas that can provide that additional performance. And we currently manage about $125 billion in these factor-based strategies. And within that, about $115 billion is smart beta. So we think this is going to grow. BlackRock's iShares, smart beta ETFs are leading the industry now with about $8.5 billion of net inflows in the first quarter, including about $7 billion into the iShares minimum volatility strategies. So these are, in essence, strategies that take advantage of various sectors and factors in the marketplace that add additional value.

Well, negative -- if you think about 70% of our clients or more are pension funds, high risk, some form of retirement and insurance companies, we hear worldwide how negative interest rates or low interest rates have been impactful and how they are actually harming their objectives of obtaining an asset base to meet their liability needs. In fact, last week, we were with one of the largest New York State funds -- U.S. state funds, not New York State funds. One of the largest U.S. state funds that happen to be in New York City for a meeting we had, and they were in the top deciles of performance last year. And because of low and negative interest rates and their discounting rate, they actually deteriorated their asset and liability gap. We're hearing this worldwide. We're hearing from savers worldwide they're not going to meet the needs of building their pool of savings to meet the needs of retirement. We're hearing from insurance companies that they're going to have a really hard time meeting their liabilities. And so what is -- so they're looking for more advice. Importantly, what we saw, especially in the first 6 weeks of the year when you had major selling pressure in many components of the world, we saw huge insurance companies interest in buying. We saw a widening of spreads. We talked about infrastructure. If we could find large opportunities for infrastructure globally, we have the demand. So clients are looking for more opportunities. They're looking to invest in different types of products. I believe our platform is giving us more connectivity with our clients. And I do believe, as my shareholder letter stated, I believe low and negative interest rates have served a great purpose in the short run, but I don't believe low and negative interest rates was supposed to be a permanent feature of the investment landscape. We are now entering the eighth year, and I believe that we are going to have a stronger, more robust economy. And the IMF has lowered their forecast even more for, like, I think the fifth time in a row. We're going to need policy responses by governments.

It's actually quite incredible, the amount of cash that's sitting in banks today earning 0, and that money has typically been in the fixed income market. And in order to have access to fixed income, our clients are using more and more ETFs because of all the features that they see, which is the liquidity, the low cost, the tax efficiency. And it's just easier access, and this is where the money is going to flow first. And most people have more of their money in fixed income than they do in equities anyway. So this has been the growth in the first quarter. We are set by having a wide variety of types of fixed income ETFs that they can invest in. And we do see a lot more secondary trading that's going on in these. But we're seeing investment-grade and high-yield corporate bond ETF assets under management grow from about $5 billion to $165 billion, and that's from 2007 to 2015. And this is going to be a very strategic growth area for us. And as Larry cited in his opening, we saw a record $27 billion of net inflows into the fixed income ETFs in the first quarter. So this is really, I think, the big growth area. We have a very long-term history at BlackRock in fixed income, and we are using that historical background and technology that we built to even enhance our reputation more in this business."

And obviously, we're enhancing our technology for our retail clients. FutureAdvisor is just one. We're seeing the digital -- the side of the digital end, but we're also using and leveraging Aladdin to bring portfolio construction, risk analytics tools to financial advisers as well as private bankers. And we're doing that with a number of different areas of growth, whether it be Aladdin Portfolio Builder or portfolio construction services or Aladdin for Wealth, importantly. And we are streamlining our sales processes with technology to enhance yielding greater efficiency and effectiveness through doing that. FutureAdvisor, in particular, which as you know operates within BlackRock Solutions, allows us to strengthen relationships with our distribution partners by offering their clients high-quality, technology-enabled advice, and most importantly, backed by BlackRock's broad investment platform, our Aladdin risk analytics, our proprietary retirement technology, and obviously, our longstanding experience as enterprise technology partners to other financial situation. I think that is probably the key differentiating factor for us at the moment. Because what we're noticing, whether it's the commercial arrangement announced this week or some others that frankly we have signed but haven't publicly announced, this looks like a very long long-term and complicated implementation that, frankly, is exactly what we've been doing with Aladdin over the last couple of decades. And so while there are certain competitors, I think, who are trying to mimic or follow or, in many cases, replicate the type of strategy that we're doing here, the real difference is that we've been involved in client implementations, very complex client implementations, for a significant period of time. I think that is really going to be the differentiating factor. As it relates to the economics, the economics on these things are, frankly, very much customized in some respects. There are platform fees. There are implementation fees. In some cases, there are minimum fees. There will be underlying management fees to the extent that the client chooses to either use our own models or populate those models with iShares. But importantly, we're looking to customize as much as we can to meet our intermediary partners' objectives."

Margins are quite low for the first -- during the implementation stage. In some cases, there are more expenses than revenues in the early years -- early year. And as it's being implemented, then -- and the utilization and then we have all the other service fees, it starts throwing off and generating, depending on the utilization, we hope, large fee increases. But more importantly, we also believe having this linkage creates a deeper connection with our clients than our distribution partners. So it's not just the singularity of having more products through these types of channels, but it is also deeper, more consistent connection with these clients. And so this is one of the reasons why we saw earlier than anyone related to the connectivity that digital advice can give for us with our distribution partners. And so we're very excited about it. I would also say that it's a -- the desire, the demand, the interest, the request for presentations is far greater than we ever imagined."

It's my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2016. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As usual, I will be f",1882,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the first quarter of 2016. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. As usual, I will be focusing primarily on as-adjusted results. 
In the context of continued market challenges over the last 12 months, including global equity markets down high single digits, emerging markets and natural resources each down over 20%, and a continuation of a low, and in many cases, negative-rate environment, the differentiation and strength of BlackRock's broad, global investment platform enabled us to deliver another quarter of positive organic asset growth. While we are not immune to market headwinds, consistent organic growth and prudent expense discipline allowed us to deliver relatively stable-based fees and increased margins from a year ago and continue to consistently return capital to shareholders.
Our first quarter results highlight the value of the investments we've made to assemble the industry's broadest offering of active and index investment products, and to deliver differentiated customized investment solutions to our clients. The diversity of our platform positions us to serve our clients' needs in a variety of market environments, helping to drive consistent and differentiated organic growth.
As we stated last quarter, we remain committed to investing in a number of strategic initiatives that will further enhance our client value proposition and generate long-term value for shareholders. Doing so requires us to make smarter -- to be smarter about reallocating resources in challenging markets. With that in mind, this quarter, we undertook a restructuring to streamline and simplify the organization with a goal of efficiently optimizing growth. It will also create new opportunities for our strongest people.
This resulted in a restructuring charge of $76 million during the quarter, primarily comprised of severance and accelerated amortization expense of previously granted deferred compensation awards for approximately 400 impacted employees. This charge appears as a single line expense item on our GAAP income statement and has been excluded from our as-adjusted results. 
First quarter revenue of $2.6 billion was 4% lower than a year ago, while operating income of $1 billion was down 3%. Earnings per share of $4.25 declined more significantly versus the prior year quarter, driven by a onetime nonoperating gain and a lower effective tax rate a year ago. 
Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $8 million of net investment gains and decreased from the first quarter of 2015 due to lower marks in the current quarter and a $40 million, onetime, noncash gain related to the acquisition of BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors in last year's first quarter. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 29.6% compared to 23.7% a year ago, reflecting several favorable nonrecurring items. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2016, though the effective actual tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring items that could arise during the year. 
BlackRock's first quarter results reflected $36 billion of long-term net inflows, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 3% and demonstrated the continued resilience of BlackRock's differentiated business model. Flows were positive across both active and index and across regions, as positive momentum in March more than offset a slow start to the year. While organic base fee growth for the quarter was 2%, lagging organic asset growth as strong fixed income flows were offset by outflows from higher fee equity products. Over the last 12 months, BlackRock's organic base fee growth still remains above our long-term organic AUM growth. 
First quarter base fees were down 1% year-over-year as organic AUM growth of $118 billion over the last 12 months partially offset the impact of $148 billion of negative market and FX movement. Sequentially, base fees were down 4% despite positive organic growth in the quarter, as first quarter average AUM declined from fourth quarter levels due to significant market declines in January and early February. Market improvements that occurred at the end of the quarter had a limited impact on first quarter base fees, but should act as a tailwind as we move into the second quarter. 
In a difficult period for the hedge fund industry with the HFRX index down 2% in the quarter, performance fees of $34 million decreased significantly from a year ago, driven by declines in fees associated with single-strategy hedge funds, funded hedge funds and certain long-only equity products. Underperformance during the first quarter may have a negative impact on performance fees for the full year as certain quarterly locked-in funds are below high watermarks, while others lock-based on trailing 12-month performance periods. 
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $171 million was up 16% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Our Aladdin business, which represented 82% of BRS revenue in the quarter, grew 12% year-over-year, driven by several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform in 2015. We continue to see strong market demand from institutional asset managers and owners as they look to consolidate global investment platforms and understand risks across multi-asset class portfolios. Additionally, a rapidly changing regulatory and technology environment is driving accelerated conversations with retail intermediaries about leveraging both Aladdin and FutureAdvisor capabilities in the wealth management space.
Non-Aladdin BRS revenue was up $9 million year-over-year, though down $3 million sequentially due to completion of a number of assignments in last year's fourth quarter. Our Financial Markets Advisory business continues to reflect a more stable revenue profile, driven by a higher level of repeat engagements and is well positioned to benefit from changes in a regulatory landscape affecting financial institutions and official sector clients worldwide. Other revenue was down $12 million year-over-year primarily due to lower earnings from equity method investment. 
Total expense decreased 4% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, driven primarily by lower compensation and G&A expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was down $32 million or 3% year-over-year, reflecting lower incentive compensation, driven primarily by lower performance fees, partially offset by a higher headcount. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense was down 4%, reflecting lower incentive compensation, partially offset by higher seasonal payroll taxes and an increase in stock-based compensation expense related to grants of prior year awards. 
Looking forward, despite the first quarter restructuring and assuming stable markets, we currently anticipate ending the year with higher total headcount than we have today, but with a compensation-to-revenue ratio modestly lower than 2015. G&A expense was down 6% year-over-year, primarily reflecting lower discretionary marketing and promotional spend and an increased benefit from the impact of foreign exchange remeasurement. Sequentially, G&A expense decreased $92 million, primarily reflecting the seasonal and discretionary impact of lower marketing promotional expense, reduced foreign exchange remeasurement expense and $23 million of deal-related expense associated with strategic transactions executed in last year's fourth quarter.
As discussed last quarter, we remain extremely expense-aware in the current market environment and will continue to be prudent with our discretionary G&A spend. At present, and again assuming stable markets, we currently anticipate full year 2016 G&A expense to be approximately in line with 2015 levels. 
Our first quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 41.6% was up 40 basis points year-over-year and flat sequentially. BlackRock's ability to generate positive year-over-year operating leverage in a negative beta environment highlights our commitment to prudently managing expense while continuing to invest for future growth. We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting in our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, we anticipate closing the Bank of America Global Capital Management transaction later this month, assuming investment management responsibilities for approximately $87 billion of related cash and liquidity AUM. 
We previously announced a 5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.29 per share of common stock and also repurchased an additional $300 million worth of shares in the first quarter. We saw an opportunity to modestly increase our level of share repurchases during the quarter as sizable market moves and changes in the relative valuation of our stock in January and February created an attractive buying opportunity. We stand by the guidance we previously provided in last year's fourth quarter as it relates to share repurchases for the remainder of the year. 
First quarter long-term net inflows of $36 billion reflected the diversity of our platform. Flows were positive in both active and index and across all regions. BlackRock's global retail franchise saw minor long-term net outflows as positive flows in the United States were broadly offset by international outflows. BlackRock's U.S. retail business generated long-term net inflows of $1 billion, demonstrating resilience in what was a challenging quarter for the domestic fund industry, with U.S. active mutual funds experiencing negative flows during a first quarter for the first time since the financial crisis. BlackRock's flows were driven by strong long-term investment performance across our fixed income platform, including flows into our total return, high yield and strategic municipal opportunities funds, all of which are performing in the top quartile for the trailing 5-year period.
International retail net outflows of $1 billion were primarily related to outflows in international equities and multi-asset funds amid market uncertainty and industry-wide derisking. These flows were partially offset by inflows into our natural resources franchise, which benefited from commodities re-risking during the quarter. Global iShares generated over $24 billion of net new business in the first quarter, representing 9% annualized organic growth, with record fixed income net inflows of $27 billion, partially offset by outflows from developed market equities.
Our institutional business generated $12 billion in long-term net inflows in the first quarter driven by higher fee active offerings. Institutional active net inflows of $11 billion represented the eighth consecutive quarter of positive active flows for the business and reflected BlackRock's strong multi-asset capabilities and top-performing fixed income platforms. Multi-asset inflows reflected solutions-based fundings, particularly in the insurance outsourcing space and demand for our LifePath target date series. Fixed income net inflows were led by flows into investment-grade strategies. 
Institutional active equity outflows of $2 billion reflected outflows on our Fundamental Equities business, partially offset by inflows into our Scientific Active Equity business, where 98% of assets are continuing to perform above benchmark on a trailing 5-year period. In addition, we had another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising more than $1.5 billion in new commitments and now have $12 billion in committed capital to deploy for clients. Illiquid alternatives remain a key area of growth for BlackRock as our institutional clients increasingly search for additional sources of income and uncorrelated returns. Institutional index saw $1 billion of net inflows as strong inflows into LDI strategies were partially offset by outflows from index equities. 
Overall, our first quarter results reflect the benefits in the investments we've made to build a differentiated global business model and our ability to effectively navigate expenses in a challenging beta environment. Diversification across investment styles, distribution channels, products and geographies enables us to serve clients, irrespective of market environment or investment performance. We will continue to be mindful of the trade-off between growth and margin, looking to strike the right balance between investing in key strategic initiatives and optimizing expenses. Our goal remains to deliver consistent and differentiated organic AUM growth over time. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our first quarter results demonstrates that BlackRock continues to earn our clients' trust in an uncertain market environments as we manage risk and deliver investment solutions",2045,"Thank you, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. Our first quarter results demonstrates that BlackRock continues to earn our clients' trust in an uncertain market environments as we manage risk and deliver investment solutions to achieve our clients' long-term investment goals.
Economic, social and geopolitical instability drove dramatic market swings in the first quarter. Fears of global recession and the risk of Chinese currency devaluation drove stocks lower to start the year. Investors continue to struggle to digest lower energy prices, negative rate spreads in Europe and Japan. And uncertainty grew from political developments in countries including the United States, Germany, Spain, Brazil and the pending vote in the U.K. on whether to leave the European Union, pushing global markets down more than double-digit percentages in the opening weeks of the year.
In February, stabilizing commodity prices and more dovish commentary from the Federal Reserve helped spark a risk on rotation despite continued policy uncertainties and questions surrounding global growth. As Gary mentioned, given the fact that we earn fees on average AUM, we did not realize much of the financial benefit of the market upswing in the first quarter, but we are positioned to benefit from the tailwinds going into the second quarter. 
It is especially in times like this, marked by volatility and investor uncertainty, that more clients are looking to BlackRock for their investment guidance. Our goal is not to just sell them individual products, but rather to understand our clients' objectives, their needs and to fashion a cohesive solution that helps achieve those goals. While many firms claim to do the same, no other asset manager draws on the same breadth of active, index and alternative strategies; investment styles across asset classes and regions; risk management and technology and focus on long-term solutions. These capabilities, combined with the talent and fiduciary culture of the BlackRock team, enables us to have a deeper conversation with our clients as they make important decisions around portfolio construction and asset allocation.
This heightened level of client engagement is translating into consistent growth with $36 billion of long-term net new flows in the quarter representing 3% organic growth, driven by our strength in iShares and institutional actives. The fact that we are again seeing such diverse inflows in this very volatile market speaks to the power of our platform we've built over time. We consistently invested in capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our clients, and we will continue to invest to helping our clients so we could show future growth in the quarters to come.
As clients increasingly look to ETFs as alternatives to individual stocks and bonds, derivatives and mutual funds, we continue to grow our iShares business to meet their needs. Investors turned to iShares in the first quarter as they navigated heightened volatility, and our ETF business saw $24 billion of net flows. As was the case for the full year in 2015, BlackRock captured the #1 market share of net new business globally in the United States and in Europe, and the #1 market share in fixed income. 
Two global iShare priorities drove our inflows. First was fixed income. BlackRock has been building our fixed income ETF capabilities for several years. We now manage more than $290 billion in fixed income iShares, which, as a stand-alone franchise, would represent the fourth largest ETF player in the industry. After seeing $50 billion in fixed income inflows for the full year of 2015, this quarter we generated record quarterly net inflows of $27 billion. Risk off settlement -- sentiment initially drove demand for U.S. treasuries. And as the market conditions improved, client added to their U.S.-European credit exposures. 
We see significant growth ahead for fixed income iShares. A widening range of clients are adopting fixed income iShares as diversified, efficient investment tools and as substitutes for cash and derivatives as bank balance sheets continue to be shrunk. Despite rapid growth, fixed income ETFs currently only have 1/10 of the share of global bond market assets that equity ETFs have in the global equity markets, offering a significant opportunity to increase the penetration in the $100 trillion global fixed income market. 
The second priority is smart beta. BlackRock is investing in factors and factor products that we believe will become increasingly important as asset allocation tools and alternatives to traditional beta or lower alpha capture active strategies, and BlackRock now manages more than $125 billion across a range of factor-based solutions. Our iShares minimum volatility products raised nearly $7 billion globally in the quarter, leading the ETF industry smart beta category and increasing our smart beta ETF AUM to $67 billion. Additionally, our newer single-factor products have started to achieve scale at $5 billion, and we are now bringing multifactor iShares to market to complete our offering. 
In our institutional business, first quarter net inflows of $12 billion were driven by strong active fixed income and multi-asset flows as the investments we made to diversify our institutional platform are generating results. As we strengthened the diversity of our institutional platform over time, we are deepening our existing client relationships, and more than 50% of BlackRock's largest institutional clients now have 5 or more products managed by BlackRock.
For those who have been our investor since 2009 when we did the BGI merger, we've talked about this in great detail as one of the merits of why we thought the merger would work. At that time, we had less than 20% of our clients having more than one product. And so one of the great results and why I truly believe our positioning, our penetration, with our clients is through these metrics of how many products we have in terms of positioning ourselves with our clients. And once again, I'll repeat it again, because I am very proud of it, and that's more than 50% of our largest institutional clients have more than 5 or more products managed by BlackRock. 
We saw institutional active fixed income net inflows of nearly $11 billion driven by flows from financial institutional clients as we further expand our relationships with these clients through our solution-oriented approach. BlackRock's financial institution team continues to deliver differentiated investment strategies for these financial institutions, especially in this extended low and negative rate environment. 
In alternatives, where we've invested to strengthen the diversity and quality of our platform, we generated more than $1.5 billion of additional illiquid commitments. In the last several years, we have expanded our capabilities in our real estate platform, including infrastructure and real estate. Real estate -- real assets, especially infrastructure, provide clients with the ability to achieve long-term financial goals while helping to create a more fertile long-term investment environment, hopefully by generating jobs and aligning the longer term -- time horizons afforded by greater longevity. BlackRock currently manages more than $30 billion in real assets across our global multiproduct platform. 
BlackRock Solutions revenues grew 16% year-over-year, led by Aladdin, our unifying technology platform. We are seeing growing demand from clients as asset owners and managers are focusing on risk management. And they are now learning to utilize more risk management as they adapt to the regulatory changes. As the retail marketplace evolves, we are also seeing increasing opportunities to provide our distribution partners with institutional-quality asset allocation, risk management and digital advice capabilities. BlackRock is also intensifying our efforts to leverage the industry's most advanced technologies to enhance client service, to build better investment products and portfolios, and importantly, to identify new and better sources of alpha. 
On the distribution side, FutureAdvisor, which operates within BlackRock Solutions, allows us to strengthen relationships with our distribution partners by offering their clients high-quality, technology-enabled advice, backed by BlackRock's broad investment platform, our Aladdin risk analytics, our proprietary retirement technology and our long-standing experience as an enterprise technology partner to other financial institutions. We're seeing growing demand from our intermediary partners for BlackRock FutureAdvisor solution, including our latest partnership we announced yesterday. 
On the investment side, BlackRock's investment team, including our active equity, our model-based fixed income and our multi-asset strategy teams, continue to expand their use of technology-based tools and research methodologies to produce investment insights that contribute to sustainable, consistent alpha generation. These tools include things such as machine learning, natural language processing and scientific data visualization. In these challenging beta environments, our clients look to us more than ever to deliver the investment performance they need to meet their liabilities and their financial goals. We maintain a constant focus on enhancing alpha generation across our platforms, ended with the quarter with 89% of our fixed income, 97% of our scientific active equity and 52% of our fundamental active equity products above market or paramedian for the 5-year period. 
The investments that we're making to leverage technology across our platform are part of BlackRock's focus on continuously solving our clients' long-term challenges. As I discussed in my annual letter to shareholders earlier this week, in a letter I sent in January to CEOs of companies we invest in on behalf of our clients, it is critical that companies focus their strategy on the long term and clearly articulate their plans for long-term growth and in the context of the environment and the ecosystem in which they operate. Just as we continue to invest for the long run, we are constantly evaluating our ecosystem in which we operate, including the markets, regulatory environment, the competitive landscape to identify the changes that might require us to pivot our strategy. 
Last week, the Department of Labor published their fiduciary rule, which has implications for both our clients and our own business. While we're currently reviewing the final rule to thoroughly assess its implications, we are likely to see changes in our distribution partners' accounts and fee structures, their product preferences, and importantly, their use of technology, to both build portfolios for clients and to manage their increased risk, and most importantly, their compliance needs. 
BlackRock believes in the importance of always acting as a fiduciary to our clients, and doing so is one of the core principles that we founded our firm upon. BlackRock has also extensive experience with adapting and helping our clients adapt to change in the regulatory environment, most recently through RDR method in Europe. We're leveraging this experience directly with our distribution partners in the U.S. as we listen to and work with them to address the challenges and the opportunities that the DoL rule presents.
This is another example where the combination of the breadth and depth of BlackRock's investment platform, our global footprint and experience, our focus on technology and risk management solutions and our strong fiduciary culture differentiates the value proposition that we can deliver to our clients. We have always embraced change, and we will always be looking for ways to better serve our clients, to operate more efficiently, to focus resources on strategic priorities and to create new opportunities for our strongest employees. 
We began 2016 by enhancing our investment platform, by increasing connectivity among our investors, by aligning with the evolving needs of our clients and positioning talented investment leaders to drive our success, and these changes are working well. Most recently, we initiated a restructuring to streamline and simplify the organization, driving efficiencies across our platform to better serve our clients, to deliver returns for our shareholders. It will also create opportunities for our strongest employees. 
Over the last 3 years, we have grown our employee base by more than 20%. We added 2,500 employees to support improvements in client service and technology and enhancing alpha generation. We remain commitment -- committed to investing in our business, to leverage the opportunities ahead of us, to drive continued growth despite current market volatility. Doing so requires making smart, and unfortunately difficult decisions about allocating resources, which we must always do.
While the uncertain environment we face is unsettling at times, it is also an opportunity to look out in the future, to capture new alpha-generating opportunities, to use technology in innovating ways and to build on our platform to serve our clients' evolving needs, create a continued opportunity for our employees, to deliver consistent returns for our shareholders. 
Now let me open it up for questions."

Well, probably, most importantly, BlackRock has supported the changes to the financial ecosystem. If we can enhance confidence with investors, I believe through that mechanism it's going to increase and promote more investing, less savings in their bank accounts. So the more investing and the more money clients are putting to work with greater confidence, and if -- then it's a benefit actually for the entire industry. And I think that's one of the big points that have not been part of the dialogue. And I think that's an important -- a really important point. We need to have more investor confidence. I think one of the great problems we have with longevity we have in human aging process, and importantly, with the inability of so many people investing in, what I would call, properly too much cash, probably overemphasis in bonds. If they believe the DoL rules will give them better transparency, better certainty that they're being treated right and they invest more money for the long run, it's better for the country, it's better for their financial future, and it's really very good for the entire industry. And I think that message is totally lost in the conversation. Directly to the issue around how this is going to play out, first of all, it's a very lengthy rule. It's going to take quite some time for everyone to determine how it meets their business model. But I would say the position of BlackRock, given the breadth of our product platform in both active and index and the investments we made in technology -- and I really want to underscore technology, and risk management, we're having really deep conversation with more of our distribution partners and helping them work on solutions for their -- them and their clients. It's still too early to determine the outcome for the DoL rule more broadly, but I think we're as better positioned than any organization. I do believe it's going to require much greater compliance and risk management, so it's very powerful for our Aladdin platform. We believe it's going to be very powerful for our entire BlackRock Solutions product suite, including FutureAdvisor. And I think, if it means more business in passive, we'll be benefited. If it means more business in active, we're going to be benefiting, too. So I'll just leave it at that. And I actually have a happy General Counsel with that answer. Sorry, Chris."

Ken, thanks so much. So Ken, I think as you started out, as we stated last quarter, we are really -- we're maintaining our commitment to investing in a variety of strategic initiatives that will further enhance our client value proposition and generate long-term value for shareholders. And obviously, we're all mindful of the new challenging markets. As Larry and both -- and I have said, that we need to make tougher and smarter decisions, especially when it comes to reallocating those investment dollars. And one thing I want to make very clear is this restructuring was not about cost cutting. It was about streamlining and simplifying the organization so that we could use those savings to reinvest more efficiently in those strategic growth areas, and as mentioned also, to create new stretch opportunities for our strongest people. It's important to understand that we're really not deemphasizing any particular business. Rather, I'd say we're looking to ensure that the foundation of our businesses are really running as efficiently as possible so we can take those reallocated resources and maximize our investment in the higher growth areas that you mentioned. I'd say there are probably 4 or 5 of those, and I'll let Larry and Rob, in particular, chime in. And many of those have been mentioned at some of the remarks today: illiquid alternatives, in particular; the real asset platform, which includes our infrastructure business. Factor-based, Larry mentioned over $125 billion there across smart beta and enhanced factor products; sustainable investing, where we have $200 billion across exclusionary screenings, EST factors and impact investments. Obviously, continuing to invest in our iShares business, which we believe continues to have significant runway in growth from both new uses -- new users and importantly, fixed income, which Larry also mentioned in his comments. And then you mentioned technology as well. And I think, before I let Larry comment, the issue there on technology is it really impacts everything we do across the organization. It impacts how we invest, in particular, big data and the like, machine learning language and the like, that Larry mentioned, which is, importantly, critically important for improvements in our active platform. As well as technology to enhance serving our clients, whether it be through Aladdin, Aladdin for wealth, FutureAdvisor and the others. I think those are a number of the areas that we're really looking to make sure that we're continuing to feed, because we think there's incremental and differentiated growth available to us."

They're going to -- the need for better risk management technology is only increasing. The need for better interfacing with clients is only going to be more and more important. And I do believe we have great solutions at BlackRock to help and assist these organizations in terms -- for them to raise their bar to be a stronger fiduciary towards their clients. And so we believe our Aladdin system, our FutureAdvisor products, are going to be -- we'll see even more accelerated growth, if we can handle the growth. But importantly also, as we are -- we believe there's a great need to develop better information flows for better investment insights.

So this is a way of breaking down the performance within an active category to areas that can provide that additional performance. And we currently manage about $125 billion in these factor-based strategies. And within that, about $115 billion is smart beta. So we think this is going to grow. BlackRock's iShares, smart beta ETFs are leading the industry now with about $8.5 billion of net inflows in the first quarter, including about $7 billion into the iShares minimum volatility strategies. So these are, in essence, strategies that take advantage of various sectors and factors in the marketplace to add additional value.

Well, negative -- if you think about 70% of our clients or more are pension funds, IRAs, some form of retirement and insurance companies, we hear worldwide how negative interest rates or low interest rates have been impactful and how they are actually harming their objectives of obtaining an asset base to meet their liability needs. In fact, last week, we were with one of the largest New York State funds -- U.S. state funds, not New York State funds. One of the largest U.S. state funds that happen to be in New York City for a meeting we had, and they were in the top deciles of performance last year. And because of low and negative interest rates and their discounting rate, they actually deteriorated their asset and liability gap. We're hearing this worldwide. We're hearing from savers worldwide they're not going to meet the needs of building their pool of savings to meet the needs of retirement. We're hearing from insurance companies that they're going to have a really hard time meeting their liabilities. And so what is -- so they're looking for more advice. Importantly, what we saw, especially in the first 6 weeks of the year when you had major selling pressure in many components of the world, we saw huge insurance company interest in buying. We saw a widening of spreads. We talk about infrastructure. If we could find large opportunities for infrastructure globally, we have the demand. So clients are looking for more opportunities. They're looking to invest in different types of products. I believe our platform is giving us more connectivity with our clients. And I do believe, as my shareholder letter stated, I believe low and negative interest rates have served a great purpose in the short run, but I don't believe low and negative interest rates was supposed to be a permanent feature of the investment landscape. We are now entering the eighth year, and I believe if we are going to have a stronger, more robust economy. And the IMF just lowered their forecast even more for, like, I think the fifth time in a row. We're going to need policy responses by governments.

It's actually quite incredible, the amount of cash that's sitting in banks today earning 0, and that money has typically been in the fixed income market. And in order to have access to fixed income, our clients are using more and more ETFs because of all the features that they see, which is the liquidity, the low cost, the tax efficiency. And it's just easier access, and this is where the money is going to flow first. And most people have more of their money in fixed income than they do in equities anyway. So this has been the growth in the first quarter. We are set by having a wide variety of types of fixed income ETFs that they can invest in. And we do see a lot more secondary trading that's going on in these. But we're seeing investment-grade and high-yield corporate bond ETF assets under management grow from about $5 billion to $165 billion, and that's from 2007 to 2015. And this is going to be a very strategic growth area for us. And as Larry cited in his opening, we saw a record $27 billion of net inflows into the fixed income ETFs in the first quarter.

And obviously, we're enhancing our technology for our retail clients. FutureAdvisor is just one. We're seeing the digital -- the side of the digital end, but we're also using and leveraging Aladdin to bring portfolio construction, risk analytics tools to financial advisers as well as private bankers. And we're doing that with a number of different areas of growth, whether it be Aladdin Portfolio Builder or portfolio construction services or Aladdin for Wealth, importantly. And we are streamlining our sales processes with technology to enhance yielding greater efficiency and effectiveness through doing that. FutureAdvisor, in particular, which as you know operates within BlackRock Solutions, allows us to strengthen relationships with our distribution partners by offering their clients high-quality, technology-enabled advice, and most importantly, backed by BlackRock's broad investment platform, our Aladdin risk analytics, our proprietary retirement technology, and obviously, our longstanding experience as enterprise technology partners to other financial institutions. I think that is probably the key differentiating factor for us at the moment. Because what we're noticing, whether it's the commercial arrangement announced this week or some others that frankly we have signed but haven't publicly announced, this looks like a very long long-term and complicated implementation that, frankly, is exactly what we've been doing with Aladdin over the last couple of decades. And so while there are certain competitors, I think, who are trying to mimic or follow or, in many cases, replicate the type of strategy that we're doing here, the real difference is that we've been involved in client implementations, very complex client implementations, for a significant period of time. And I think that is really going to be the differentiating factor. As it relates to the economics, the economics on these things are, frankly, very much customized in some respects. There are platform fees. There are implementation fees. In some cases, there are minimum fees. There will be underlying management fees to the extent that the client chooses to either use our own models or populate those models with iShares. But importantly, we're looking to customize as much as we can to meet our intermediary partners' objectives."

Margins are quite low for the first -- during the implementation stage. In some cases, there are more expenses than revenues in the early years -- early year. And as it's being implemented, then -- and the utilization and then we have all the other service fees, it starts throwing off and generating, depending on the utilization, we hope, large fee increases. But more importantly, we also believe having this linkage creates a deeper connection with our clients and our distribution partners. So it's not just the singularity of having more products through these types of channels, but it is also deeper, more consistent connection with these clients. And so this is one of the reasons why we saw earlier than anyone related to the connectivity that digital advice can give for us with our distribution partners. And so we're very excited about it. I would also say that it's a -- the desire, the demand, the interest, the request for presentations is far greater than we ever imagined."

While our earnings",1644,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2016. 
Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. 
Clients are struggling to navigate an incredibly difficult investment landscape. Notwithstanding the recent market rally over the last 12 months, many global equity markets were down double digits and interest rates touched historic lows worldwide. The current macro environment, including negative yields in many jurisdictions, Brexit and U.S. election uncertainty, is causing clients to defer investment decisions, resulting in significant increases in global cash balances, lower active flows and a shift from equity to fixed income assets. This environment is also resulting in lower revenue capture across the asset management industry. In times like this, growing and evolving our business are critically important as client needs for our investment advice and risk management capabilities are greater than ever. BlackRock is having richer dialogues with clients than at any time in our history, and we are well positioned for growth when client activity accelerates. 
Last month, at our 2016 Investor Day, we described how BlackRock is built for change. Our strong foundation drives consistent financial results and stable cash flows, enabling us to fund innovation and invest in new growth areas. This is critical to clients, especially during volatile times when other investment managers may be forced to pull back, and to shareholders, as we have an opportunity to win market share. During the second quarter, strength in our global investment platform and Aladdin risk management business, coupled with continued expense discipline, enabled us to continue investing in our business despite market headwinds that impacted both base fees and performance fees on a year-over-year basis. Second quarter revenue of $2.8 billion was 3% lower than a year ago, while operating income of $1.2 billion was down 6%. Earnings per share of $4.78 was down 4% versus the prior year quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $14 million of net investment gains, primarily attributable to net gains on private equity and hedge fund-related investments. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 30.6% compared to 30.1% a year ago. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2016, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring items that could arise during the year. 
Second quarter long-term net inflows of $2 billion reflected $16 billion of net new business from iShares, offset by outflows in active strategies and institutional index mandates. Over the last 12 months, BlackRock delivered long-term net inflows of $126 billion, representing 3% organic growth. 
Second quarter base fees were down 2% year-over-year despite generally flat average AUM, reflecting more than $250 billion in AUM mix change favoring lower-fee fixed income and cash assets, including the impact of divergent equity beta. While the S&P 500 was down only 1% on average year-over-year, many markets went to our higher-fee equity products, including emerging markets, Europe, Asia. Natural resources and commodities experienced double-digit declines. Sequentially, base fees increased 6%, driven by higher average AUM following the market rally in March, more recent market volatility associated with Brexit and a minimal impact on second quarter base fees. While the operational implications of Brexit will evolve over the coming quarters, we are well positioned versus the industry as a function of our globally diversified manufacturing, distribution and operating platform. 
Performance fees of $74 million decreased 46% versus a year ago, reflecting continuing performance challenges in the hedge fund industry generally and the impact of high watermarks on certain funds specifically. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by fees associated with hedge fund-related and certain loan-only equity products. BlackRock Solutions revenue of $172 million was up 7% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Our Aladdin business, which represented 85% of BRS revenue in the quarter, grew 13% year-over-year, driven by several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform during the last year. We continue to see strong market demand from institutional asset managers, evidenced by the recent signing of one of our largest clients today, which will be implemented over the next 18 to 24 months. As discussed at Investor Day, the rapidly changing regulatory and financial landscape is also driving accelerated conversations with retail intermediaries about leveraging Aladdin's value proposition in the wealth management space. Aladdin remains a key differentiator and a competitive advantage for BlackRock, enabling us to communicate more effectively and to serve clients more holistically and efficiently. 
Total expense decreased to 2% year-over-year, driven primarily by lower compensation expense. Sequentially, total expense increased 3%, driven primarily by higher compensation and AUM-related expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was down $31 million [ph] or 3% year-over-year, reflecting lower incentive compensation. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense increased $32 million or 3%, reflecting higher incentive compensation, driven by higher operating income and performance fees relative to the first quarter, partially offset by lower seasonal employer payroll taxes in the current quarter. 
Distribution and servicing costs increased 12% sequentially due to the acquisition of BofA Global Capital Management and reduced money market fund fee waivers, which have historically been shared by our distribution partners. 
G&A expense was essentially flat year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting continued expense discipline despite the impact of recent acquisitions on our run rate. As we mentioned last quarter and assuming stable markets, we still anticipate full year 2016 G&A expense to be roughly in line with 2015 levels. 
Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 43.9% was down 100 basis points year-over-year, but up 230 basis points sequentially, primarily reflecting the marginal impact of changes in base and performance fees in the respective time periods, coupled with G&A expense discipline. As we've stated in the past, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target. We do remain keenly focused on delivering long-term value to our shareholders and will continue working to strike an appropriate balance between organically investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. 
We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting on our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, in the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of BofA Global Capital Management, assuming investment management responsibilities for approximately $81 billion of related cash and liquidity AUM and leveraging the scale of our cash management franchise. During the second quarter, we also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares. 
Second quarter long-term net inflows of $2 billion were driven by the diversity of our platform. Importantly, we saw strength in strategic focus areas, including fixed income ETFs, smart-beta and factor products and infrastructure offerings. Global iShares generated $16 billion of net new business in the second quarter, led by fixed income net inflows of $10 billion. We continue to see investor appetite for risk-aware, smart-beta products with our Minimum Volatility funds raising more than $6 billion during the quarter and maintaining the #1 market share position in the product category. We also continue to see strong results in the course units, which is less sensitive to the macro environment, raising $12 billion in net flows during the quarter. 
Throughout the quarter, investors once again used iShares as their preferred vehicle to navigate market volatility and express rapidly changing investment in. Since the U.K.'s decision to exit the EU, we've seen particular strength in our European iShares range across asset classes, capturing over 70% market share over the past several weeks as clients leveraged our industry-leading product breadth and liquidity. 
BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw $6 billion of long-term net outflows in another challenging quarter for the industry as both domestic and cross-border fund flows suffered in light of political and macroeconomic events. The Global Retail market is changing dramatically. DoL, RDR and are impacting the way wealth managers are serving clients. Digital and technology offerings are proliferating and efficient beta products continue to take share from active products. While year-to-date industry domestic and cross-border active gross sales have slowed significantly due to macro uncertainty and continued out-performance, we are confident that the breadth of our retail platform, including active and passive investment products, solutions and portfolio construction tools and digital and risk management capabilities collectively position BlackRock to be a market leader in this new environment. 
Our institutional business saw $8 billion of long-term net outflows, primarily due to active fixed income net outflows of $7 billion, driven largely by client realization activity. Despite volatility in EMEA, BlackRock continued to expand our presence with institutional clients in Continental Europe, generating $8 billion in net inflows during the quarter and illustrating that while many clients are taking a wait-and-see approach, BlackRock remains the partner of choice when they are prepared to invest. 
In the United States, our Defined Contribution business generated net inflows of approximately $4 billion, driven by LifePath and other target-date inflows, and now accounts for over $650 billion of assets under management. 
Finally, we saw positive flows in institutional illiquid alternatives, driven by continued momentum in infrastructure. Illiquid alternatives remain a key area of growth for BlackRock as institutional clients increasingly search for additional sources of income and uncorrelated returns. We now have more than $10 billion in committed but uninvested capital to deploy for clients. 
As we communicated at Investor Day, we are intensely focused on adapting ahead of change. While the current market environment is putting pressure on asset management companies and challenging historic business models, BlackRock has built the industry's broadest global product and distribution platform to meet the changing needs of our clients and drive long-term value for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. As Gary mentioned, our clients are facing unprecedented challenges as they attempt to navigate the current investment environment, which are described in more detail in a moment. 
While this has caused many of our clients to pause their investment activity for the moment, this also led to a more and deeper conversation with our clients than ever before. They are seeking our advice. They are looking for our investment solutions and are wanting the risk analytics and technology that BlackRock can uniquely offer. We are better positioned -- I mean, we, BlackRock are better positioned than we've ever been to deliver the solutions they need. 
Political and macroeconomic uncertainty, including Brexit, the upcoming elections in France and the United States, historically low yields and elevated market volatility, regulatory pressure, including that DoL Solvency 2. These factors and others are leading clients of all types to pause as they assess both their own needs and their investment options available for them. 
Our pension clients with 7%-plus return expectations are facing an ever-expanding liability gap. Our insurance clients with significant regulatory constraints cannot make their business models works in a 0-yield environment. Sovereign wealth funds have been forced to focus on liquidity and funding needs after years of rapid growth. And individual savers are wrestling with a choice of too much risk versus too little return as they face the prospects of their own underfunded retirement plans. 
Where can clients turn to address these challenges? Today, there's $10 trillion of sovereign bonds that are delivering negative returns and negative yields. Yet, central banks continue to be buying, and global derisking continues to bid up fixed income prices. Active equity managers as a group have underperformed over a multiyear period and are seeking record outflows -- or seeing record outflows. The blanket beta strategy that worked so well postcrisis has come to more volatility and divergence, and as Gary said, as many European and Asian equity indexes have fallen year-to-date, even at the S&P is at record level. Today is the environment asset managers are operating, this is the operating model that we're seeing and the environment we're seeing as an asset manager. Clients do not know what to do with their money. They are afraid, and they are pulling back, as evidenced by more than $55 trillion in bank deposits sitting in the United States, China and Japan alone. And even as markets have rallied recently, many clients have missed that upside and find themselves feeling even further behind. In difficult times, our clients need BlackRock more than ever. We believe that asset managers must evolve in an anticipation of the fundamental shifts taking place in our industry, driven by technology, demographics, regulation, so that they are positioned to meet the clients' needs. And we, BlackRock, are doing that. 
As we highlight at our recent Investor Day, BlackRock is constantly adapting. The differentiating platform we have built at BlackRock over the past 28 years is resonating with our clients and the diversity of product offerings, the risk capabilities of Aladdin, the market insights offered by the BlackRock Investment Institute. Our clients will need to put their money to work. I can't predict when and how much, but when they do, I have confidence that BlackRock has never been better positioned to capture those flows. 
Whether a client is looking for an illiquid alternative investment or an ETF or an unconstrained fixed income strategy or a smart beta or factor strategy or a multi-asset income product, we can deliver that solution and many others, but most important is our ability to fashion solutions from the combination of these strategies to meet the unique needs of our clients, all backed by our unmatched risk analytics and technology. And that is what's truly differentiating with BlackRock, and that is what is now resonating with our clients. As Gary mentioned, we saw $2 billion of long-term net inflows in the quarter. And over the last 12 months, we have seen $126 billion of long-term net inflows across our platform. These flows are well diversified, with $12 billion in active and $114 billion in index, including $96 billion from clients in the U.S., $30 billion from international clients. We saw $39 billion and $85 billion in equity and fixed income net inflows, respectively. And we continue to generate strong client commitments in our rapidly growing illiquid alternative business. 
Since quarter-end, after Brexit, we continue to see accelerated flows in our iShares franchise with approximately $18 billion of net inflows thus far in July, bringing our 2016 net inflows to more than $56 billion. iShares currently has the #1 share of global and European iShares -- ETFs and our fixed income ETF flows year-to-date. 
Let me talk about our fixed income flows. The fixed income iShares continued to be a substantial growth opportunity for BlackRock, and we saw more than $67 billion of net inflows over the past 12 months. If -- for some of you, you may remember, more than 5 years ago, some of our skeptics were still questioning the overall ETF growth story and downplaying the fixed income opportunity. We were outspoken about our ability to innovate and to build this market. And today, with the fixed income ETF industry reaching $600 billion in total AUM, and our own franchises north of $300 billion, we are the proven leader in this space and are focused on the continued penetration of the $100 trillion fixed income asset class. 
And just as we were doing 5 years ago, today, we're investing to develop the solutions that will meet our clients' needs in the future, including infrastructure, sustainable investing, big data, machine learning, factors and smart beta, and also critically in technology, from our Aladdin franchise to our presence in digital wealth management with FutureAdvisor. Monetary policy has driven yields to record low levels while failing to stimulate economic growth, and there's significant need for a global fiscal policy response. Infrastructure investing will be critical component of that solution, creating jobs, driving growth, providing investors with long-term opportunities for yield. We are well positioned to participate in that activity. Following another strong quarter of capital raising, BlackRock now manages more than $8 billion in invested and committed capital across our infrastructure platform. Whether in alternatives or across our active platform, to continue to deliver alpha in the new market paradigm, you have to be connected, you need scale, you have to leverage technology. And of course, you have to be smart and nimble. 
BlackRock's Aladdin technology connects our global investor community on a common platform. The scale of our trading and liquidity platform enables us to access market liquidity that few firms can. And we further enhanced that scale through the Bank of America Global Capital Management acquisition in the quarter. 
Our data expertise allows us to turn large unstructured data sets into meaningful investment insights. And our risks and quantitative analysis teams provide independent oversight to help identify both risks and opportunities. 
The platform that we built is also a powerful means to recruit and retain industry's top talent. Most importantly, we announced that we hired Mark Wiseman to lead our unified active equity franchise. 
In the quarter, performance across our active platform remains stable or improved with 80% fixed income, 67% in Fundamental Equity, 82% in scientific active equity, above their benchmarks for peer medium for the last 3-year period. 
We're making significant investments in big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning. And we saw more than $1 billion in scientific active equity inflows in the quarter. Factor-based investment strategies helps us bridge the gap between traditional active and indexed and further fill out our offerings as clients increasingly look to achieve access to broad persistent drivers of return through low-cost, efficient vehicles. 
During the quarter, our global iShares Minimum Volatility fund raised more than $6 billion, leading the ETF industry smart beta category. And BlackRock now manages more than $140 billion in AUM across a range of factor-based strategies. 
Technology has always been a core component of our value proposition and a significant differentiator for BlackRock. As the investment landscape evolves, technology is transitioning from a competitive advantage to a competitive requirement. Those who do not invest in technology will not be able to meet their clients' long-term needs. Technology remains a key area of focus and investment for BlackRock across all aspects of our business, to enhance our investment process, to enhance our clients service, to create operational efficiencies and our unifying BlackRock Aladdin technology platform. 
Aladdin revenues grew 13% year-over-year. And during the quarter, we saw one of the largest clients -- we signed one of the largest clients today. We expect Aladdin to continue to grow as we enhanced capabilities to meet clients' current and future needs as we expand Aladdin to serve additional clients across the financial ecosystem. We are breaking down legacy systems to connect asset managers to asset servicers through Provider Aladdin and providing wealth management organizations with institutional quality risk oversight and analytics through our Aladdin For Wealth platform. 
We also believe that the evolving technology and regulatory landscape, including the new DoL rule in the U.S., digital advice will play an integral role in increasing access and transparency for investors. And we continue to see strong client interest in our FutureAdvisor platform as clients look to new and innovative wealth management solutions. 
Clients not only turn to BlackRock to manage their assets, but also to help them understand the larger-term impact of global events. The BlackRock Investment Institute leads that discussion. To help clients understand the immediate results of the Brexit vote, BII posted 2 client calls the morning after the vote with more than 10,000 participants worldwide. This level of engagement and participation is a testament to BlackRock's position in the industry, not only as an asset manager, but as a thought leader. And this allows us to be a greater trusted adviser. 
Going forward, we will continue to see changes. We'll see changes in markets, changes in technology, changes in demographics and regulation. This is all driving the changing needs of our clients. And we will continue to adapt our business to serve those needs in that ever-changing world. We are in a difficult environment for our clients and our industry, but challenging environments have always been when BlackRock has been able to make the biggest leaps forward. Today, many of our clients are apprehensive, and they're coming to us and asking us for advice. As I've said, our client dialogues have never been better, and we have never been in a better position to serve our clients' needs. That is why I have never seen, in our 28-year history, more opportunity for BlackRock than I do today. 
Now let's open it up for questions."

I think everyone -- when you look at BlackRock and you look at all the products that you guys offer, and you've proven it over time in terms of the organic growth that you're able to generate, to this quarter, it's a bit surprising, but the backdrop has been anything but normal. But when you think about some of the comments that you made, particularly on the institutional side in terms of flows, you look at all the cash on the sidelines, you look at where equity valuations are, where yields are, when you're talking to clients, is there a risk for the industry that we see a lot of money remaining on the sidelines for a period of time, just given the lack of opportunities? Or do you think that there's still enough, I don't know, conversations or drive to allocate some of this cash into other solutions that can still generate some attractive returns?"

That's certainly true. I think we're seeing an anomaly right now. We're seeing -- if you look at our ETF flows since Brexit, I would say the majority of those inflows are probably -- are institutional. Because at the same time, I'm sure you're looking at the data, there's still outflows in mutual funds, which tells you, obviously, retail are still selling, but that divergence is quite stark and shocking to see that type of differential. The dialogues we're having with clients are, as I said, as robust as possible. Some clients are looking to put money to work, but the issue is some clients who have regulatory issues or capital issue, investing in bond yields at this time, I guess, is more difficult. Some of them are looking to invest in dividend stocks. And so -- I believe we're going to see more unlocking of money over the course of the next 12 months. I can't predict whether it's the third quarter, but I'm particularly surprised at the sheer volume of inflows in iShares in the first 14 days of the month, which is public, so I could talk about it. And the dialogue we're having institutional, we've seen some good flows and awards in alternatives already this quarter. So it is not as -- I wouldn't call it to be as systematic and easy. It is more periodic and idiosyncratic, depending on the clients' needs. But this is a time for us to be in front of our clients more than ever before as they are questioning their asset allocation, where should they put money, how should they think about it. And so, Michael, I can't predict one quarter over another, but what I can see, over a long period of time, there is huge pent-up demand. And we -- I believe we will be more involved than ever before. I can't say that about the industry, though."

I said just that from the last question, we have been awarded some -- 1 or 2 mandates already this quarter in the alts space. I think, across the board, we're well positioned. It really depends on what category you mentioned infrastructure. We have a huge emphasis on this. We are continuing to hire people there. We are in dialogue with many different parts of the world related to infrastructure investing. As we find those investments, it's very easy to find the capital. So as you know, we have a $30 billion real asset platform, $15 billion [indiscernible] and fund to fund to private equity, we continue to see growth in private credit. We're well positioned in some of these products. Other products, we're not as well positioned as others. But importantly, I could say with absolute confidence, the positioning we have in the alts space with our clients has never been more robust. And obviously, we are not as -- in some of the platforms, we're not as strong because it was not one of our core competencies 15 years ago. And we've been building it. We did a -- we have -- institutional client survey. And in that survey, we did determine that 53% of our clients are going to be reallocating more into alts and real asset. So I think that feeds what you just asked. And so we believe we're in a very good position for it. I would argue, though, some of the asset classes, the reason why they've done poorly in the alternative space is because there's so much money chasing us and so few investments."

You have infrastructure [indiscernible] in BBA that Larry mentioned. And we also did institutionally another $700 million of commitments in the quarter.

So clients continue to search for yield in a low-rate environment. And in the quarter, we saw significant equity market volatility. So fixed income has remained a critical component of most clients' portfolios. We continue to have very strong performance across our fixed income franchise with 80% of assets above the benchmark or peer median for the 3-year period. iShares had $10 billion of fixed income net inflows, and that was driven by strong flows into investment-grade corporates, broad U.S. or EM debt and [indiscernible] The fixed income ETF industry recently reached, by the way, $600 billion in total AUM. And that's doubled over the past 4 years. And our own franchise is north of $300 billion. And we see significant opportunity to increase the penetration of the $100 trillion global fixed income market. Now to drill deeper on -- just on July 7, to give you an idea, LQD, which is our corporate bond fund, took in $1.1 billion of net inflows. And that was a record daily inflow for a corporate bond ETF. So on the retail side, the fixed income business continues to be strong, and it's led by a total return. And it's also led by our strategic municipal offering. We saw a $2 billion of net inflows into retail active fixed income. And on the institutional side, the active fixed income net outflows of $7 billion were driven primarily by client reallocation activity in Asia Pac and in the U.S. And clients continue to come in and ask for presentations on strategic income opportunities, the reason being giving the portfolio manager more tools, more ability to find different types of fixed income securities with lower risk but higher returns in a low interest rate environment. So we believe that, that area of the market is going to continue to grow as well as from the iShares fixed income side."

We certainly don't know the end results of how liquidity is going to be addressed. The disclosures related to liquidity, we know, in the proposed document that the SEC is looking at, different buckets how you analyze and risk they're going to set a limit to the illiquid bucket of 15%. Overall, we've been very supportive of these rules. And we believe there's a need for better disclosure related to the composition of all portfolios. As you know, we've been founded on a culture of understanding of managing the risk. And importantly, it is rules like the liquidity rule or even the DoL rule that is, I believe, some of the foundational reasons why we see accelerated interest in having a dialogue with us in a risk platform or risk technology of Aladdin. So I don't know much more than that, Bill, but we are a constructive participant in the dialogue with the SEC. And we hope that we have that transparency in all the funds and understanding so people -- investors can understand what are they investing. Liquidity risks in these funds. And we don't know how they're going to respond to the differentiation between a mutual fund and ETF or how they look at them differently. So we don't know enough.

I think it is, as I said, I think some of the great growth in the fixed income ETF platform is related to the illiquidity in some of the marketplaces. If people are looking for exposures, they could go buy an ETF for that type of exposures. But we believe the marketplace -- like, we do agree with the notion of what PWC has suggested, that ETFs are going to continue to grow and maybe double in size. I think the big thing, Eric, maybe the whole -- a bigger issue is, we're seeing a re-definement of active. And as you heard, we're making our investments, our investments are smart beta, which is a form of active. It's not -- we can call it tethered active, but it is a form of active. We're talking about using factors of analysis. And our Minimum Volatility ETF is a great way of getting active, some form of active returns through an ETF platform. So I think it's technology using different instruments like ETFs. But more importantly, I think preferences are changing. So the old way of investing maybe just as a -- in categories of market capitalization is certainly going to be changing. And so I think it's more than just a preference out of active into passive. I'm a big believer that active will play a role in the future. So let's be clear about it. We believe, whether it is -- alternatives is an active product. We are a big believer that -- and in some categories, like in Asian equities and components of European equities and in some areas of the U.S. equity market where active returns can and show out-performance over index. But I think what you're seeing also is a trend that iShares are taking some share away of people buying individual stocks. That's one thing that I think -- and maybe iShares is taking away from buying individual bonds. These are things that -- the dynamic that are changing. We are seeing more investors talk about asset allocation instead of individual stocks. And I think probably the most important element I alluded to, obviously, in the last 4 months, we've seen some really accelerated outflows, we, the industry, in active equity. I would not write it off over a long cycle. And I would just give you a better perspective on BlackRock. We had 8 quarters in a row of positive flows. And so I'm not -- I don't know if this is the beginning of a trend, but we all should pay attention. But I do believe it is the technology of ETFs, the simplicity of ETFs, the -- a quick, easy way of getting exposures is now driving more demand in those products. And we believe they will continue to drive demand. And as I said, we do believe the ETF business will double in size in the next 5 years."

So first thing is, is there -- do you have any better sense of how -- not so much in terms of more iShares demand, but maybe from a cost or expense perspective, how you think this may flow back into BlackRock and your peers? In particular, how does a distributor continue to demand kind of payment for access in a DoL world?

I -- we are having constant conversation with all our distribution partners. There are some partners who believe that the DoL will be revolutionary for their business, and there are some of our distribution partners who believe it's evolutionary. It does mean change for the business. And I think we're very well positioned for those changes in the business. As I said in our first quarter results that, once again, if better understanding, better outcome for the ultimate investor, which leads to more investable assets out of cash, that's all good for the ecosystem of our distribution partners and really good for the asset management industry. Two, I think it's -- it most certainly -- as you raised the question related to Aladdin For Wealth, most certainly, I think the DoL and the responsibilities under the DoL, it's going to need a much tighter risk management oversight culture with all the clients. And we are having robust dialogue with everybody on the uptick -- uptake of Aladdin for wealth. And we'll see how that plays out. I don't have anything tangible yet to say, and -- but I will say we are in very deep dialogue. And I am very optimistic that there will be uptake for Aladdin for wealth. And I do believe, as I said, the DoL puts much more responsibility on the firm, on the financial adviser, to act in a fiduciary way. There's a big dialogue. As we know, the DoL is only about retirement assets. The big dialogue is, ""Does that force an upgrading of fiduciary standards for all the business?"" That could be debated among different people. And so I don't know what it means in outcome. I think the positive side -- so I am taking this as a long-running positive for most distribution partners. I think they will have -- they have to obviously have much more oversight and understanding of their clients assets as a fiduciary, but I do believe that they're going to have more centralization. I think they're going to have -- almost more like a European model, where you have CIOs who then allocate -- who determine which mutual funds, what platform. And as you know, because we've talked about the European experience now for at least 8 years and one of our strong positioning in Europe with that CIO model. I believe the DoL rule will move the U.S. more to a CIO model. Obviously, we know it's going to move, for those that are appropriate, more to advisory model instead of a commission-based model. And for those clients that have that advisory relationship, it may build a deeper relationship between the client and the distribution partner and their adviser. And I believe, because of our scale, our positioning, we will be a huge beneficiary of that positioning."

So the private credit business is really one that is very customized and very specific to the institutional investor that is looking to find uncorrelated investments in the marketplace that you'd say are a little outside of the box. And we've put together a very, very strong team that has backgrounds in private equity, in venture capital, in credit and using all the resources that we have. And you can imagine across BlackRock, there are so many resources and so many types of transactions that we see. We never really had a pocket of money to take advantage of those opportunities. So putting this group together, we have been able to source transactions from all across the globe for these institutional clients. That while they're a little outside of the box, the risk tolerance fits very perfectly. The return profile in most of these cases is double-digit returns. And they're not correlated at all with various parts of the market to basically diversify their portfolios. So the other part of this, which is quite interesting, is that they come in very large sizes. So these institutions that are looking to invest here are north of $1 billion-type mandates. The struggle for many institutions in this is to get the money invested. We haven't had a problem in finding the opportunities. We just never really went after them. So this is an area that we continue to add resources to. We continue to use and coordinate within the firm to source assets for this. And we're very optimistic. And quite frankly, when we're sitting down with a lot of the large institutions, this is exactly what they're looking for. And I might add, one of the things that we're going to have Mark Wiseman, when he comes in, is also help us to source these assets because in his previous job, he is one of the guys that's in the forefront of the industry that has been able to source and find these type of investments outside of the box. So they are very customized, long term, very large mandates that require a significant team, significant resources. And we have it and we're very optimistic on this in the future."

While our earnings r",1650,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the second quarter of 2016. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. 
Clients are struggling to navigate an incredibly difficult investment landscape. Notwithstanding the recent market reality over the last 12 months, many global equity markets were down double digits, and interest rates touched historic lows worldwide. The current macro environment, including negative yields in many jurisdictions, Brexit and U.S. election uncertainty is causing clients to defer investment decisions, resulting in significant increases in global cash balances, lower active flows and a shift from equity to fixed income assets. This environment is also resulting in lower revenue capture across the asset management industry. In times like this, growing and evolving our business are critically important, as client needs for our investment advice and risk management capabilities are greater than ever. BlackRock is having richer dialogues with clients than at any time in our history, and we are well positioned for growth when client activity accelerates. 
Last month, at our 2016 Investor Day, we described how BlackRock is built for change. Our strong foundation drives consistent financial results and stable cash flows, enabling us to fund innovation and invest in new growth areas. This is critical to clients, especially during volatile times when other investment managers may be forced to pull back and to shareholders, as we have an opportunity to win market share. During the second quarter, strength in our global investment platform and Aladdin risk management business, coupled with continued expense discipline, enabled us to continue investing in our business despite market headwinds that impacted both base fees and performance fees on a year-over-year basis. Second quarter revenue of $2.8 billion was 3% lower than a year ago, while operating income of $1.2 billion was down 6%. Earnings per share of $4.78 was down 4% versus the prior year quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $14 million of net investment gains, primarily attributable to net gains on private equity and hedge fund related investments. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 30.6% compared to 30.1% a year ago. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2016, though the effective -- the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring items that could arise during the year. 
Second quarter long-term net inflows of $2 billion reflected $16 billion of net new business from iShares, offset by outflows in active strategies and institutional index mandates. Over the last 12 months, BlackRock delivered long-term net inflows of $126 billion, representing 3% organic growth. 
Second quarter base fees were down 2% year-over-year despite generally flat average AUM, reflecting more than $250 billion in AUM mix change, favoring lower-fee fixed income and cash assets, including the impact of divergent equity beta. While the S&P 500 was down only 1% on average year-over-year, many markets went to our higher-fee equity products, including emerging markets, Europe, Asia. Natural resources and commodities experienced double-digit declines. Sequentially, base fees increased 6%, driven by higher average AUM following the market rally in March. More recent market volatility associated with Brexit had a minimal impact on second quarter base fees. While the operational implications of Brexit will evolve over the coming quarters, we are well-positioned versus the industry as a function of our globally diversified manufacturing, distribution and operating platform. 
Performance fees of $74 million decreased 46% versus a year ago, reflecting continuing performance challenges in the hedge fund industry generally and the impact of high watermarks on certain funds specifically. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by fees associated with hedge fund-related and certain long-only equity products. BlackRock Solutions revenue of $172 million was up 7% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Our Aladdin business, which represented 85% of BRS revenue in the quarter, grew 13% year-over-year, driven by several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform during the last year. We continue to see strong market demand from institutional asset managers, evidenced by the recent signing of one of our largest clients to date, which will be implemented over the next 18 to 24 months. As discussed at Investor Day, the rapidly changing regulatory and financial landscape is also driving accelerated conversations with retail intermediaries about leveraging Aladdin's value proposition in the wealth management space. Aladdin remains a key differentiator and a competitive advantage for BlackRock, enabling us to communicate more effectively and to serve clients more holistically and efficiently. 
Total expense decreased to 2% year-over-year, driven primarily by lower compensation expense. Sequentially, total expense increased 3%, driven primarily by higher compensation and AUM-related expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was down $31 million or 3% year-over-year, reflecting lower incentive compensation. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense increased $32 million or 3%, reflecting higher incentive compensation, driven by higher operating income and performance fees relative to the first quarter, partially offset by lower seasonal employer payroll taxes in the current quarter. 
Distribution and servicing cost increased 12% sequentially due to the acquisition of BofA Global Capital Management and reduced money market fund fee waivers, which have historically been shared by our distribution partners. 
G&A expense was essentially flat year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting continued expense discipline despite the impact of recent acquisitions on our run rate. As we mentioned last quarter and assuming stable markets, we still anticipate full year 2016 G&A expense to be roughly in line with 2015 levels. 
Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 43.9% was down 100 basis points year-over-year, but up 230 basis points sequentially, primarily reflecting the marginal impact of changes in base and performance fees in the respective time periods, coupled with G&A expense discipline. As we've stated in the past, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target. We do remain keenly focused on delivering long-term value to our shareholders, and will continue working to strike an appropriate balance between organically investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. 
We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting on our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, in the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of BofA Global Capital Management, assuming investment management responsibilities for approximately $81 billion of related cash and liquidity AUM, and leveraging the scale of our cash management franchise. During the second quarter, we also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares. 
Second quarter long-term net inflows of $2 billion were driven by the diversity of our platform. Importantly, we saw strength in strategic focus areas, including fixed income ETFs, smart-beta and factor products and infrastructure offerings. Global iShares generated $16 billion of net new business in the second quarter, led by fixed income net inflows of $10 billion. We continue to see investor appetite for risk-aware, smart-beta products with our Minimum Volatility funds raising more than $6 billion during the quarter, and maintaining the #1 market share position in the product category. We also continue to see strong results in the course units, which is less sensitive to the macro environment, raising $12 billion in net flows during the quarter. 
Throughout the quarter, investors once again used iShares as their preferred vehicle to navigate market volatility and express rapidly changing investment of use. Since the U.K.'s decision to exit the EU, we have seen particular strength in our European iShares range across asset classes, capturing over 70% market share over the past several weeks, as clients leverage our industry-leading product breadth and liquidity. 
BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw $6 billion of long-term net outflows in another challenging quarter for the industry, as both domestic and cross-border fund flows suffered in light of political and macroeconomic events. The Global Retail market is changing dramatically. DoL, RDR and MiFID are impacting the way wealth managers are serving clients. Digital and technology offerings are proliferating and efficient beta products continue to take share from active products. While year-to-date industry domestic and cross-border active gross sales have slowed significantly due to macro uncertainty and continued outperformance, we are confident that the breadth of our retail platform, including active and passive investment products, solutions and portfolio construction tools and digital and risk management capabilities collectively position BlackRock to be a market leader in this new environment. 
Our institutional business saw $8 billion of long-term net outflows, primarily due to active fixed income net outflows of $7 billion, driven largely by client realization activity. Despite volatility in EMEA, BlackRock continued to expand our presence with institutional clients in Continental Europe, generating $8 billion in net inflows during the quarter, and illustrating that while many clients are taking a wait-and-see approach, BlackRock remains the partner of choice when they are prepared to invest. 
In the United States, our Defined Contribution business generated net inflows of approximately $4 billion, driven by LifePath and other target-date inflows, and now accounts for over $650 billion of assets under management. Finally, we saw positive flows in institutional illiquid alternatives, driven by continued momentum in infrastructure. Illiquid alternatives remain a key area of growth for BlackRock, as institutional clients increasingly search for additional sources of income and uncorrelated returns. We now have more than $10 billion in committed but uninvested capital to deploy for clients. 
As we communicated at Investor Day, we are intensely focused on adapting ahead of change. While the current market environment is putting pressure on asset management companies and challenging historic business models, BlackRock has built the industry's broadest global product and distribution platform to meet the changing needs of our clients and drive long-term value for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. As Gary mentioned, our clients are facing unprecedented challenges, as they attempt to navigate the current investment environment, which are described in more detail in a moment.",1815,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. As Gary mentioned, our clients are facing unprecedented challenges, as they attempt to navigate the current investment environment, which are described in more detail in a moment. 
While this has caused many of our clients to pause their investment activity for the moment, this also led to a more and deeper conversation with our clients than ever before. They are seeking our advice. They are looking for our investment solutions, and are wanting the risk analytics and technology that BlackRock can uniquely offer. We are better positioned -- I mean, we, BlackRock, are better positioned than we've ever been to deliver the solutions they need. 
Political and macroeconomic uncertainty, including Brexit, the upcoming elections in France and the United States, historically low yields and elevated market volatility, regulatory pressure, including the DoL Solvency 2, these factors and others are leading clients of all types to pause as they assess both their own needs and their investment options available for them. 
Our pension clients with 7%-plus return expectations are facing an ever-expanding liability gap. Our insurance clients with significant regulatory constraints cannot make their business models works in a 0-yield environment. Sovereign wealth funds have been forced to focus on liquidity and funding needs after years of rapid growth, and individual savers are wrestling with a choice of too much risk versus too little return as they face the prospects of their own underfunded retirement plan.
Where can clients turn to address these challenges? Today, there's $10 trillion of sovereign bonds that are delivering negative returns and negative yields. Yet, central banks continue to be buying, and global derisking continues to bid up fixed income prices. Active equity managers as a group have underperformed over a multiyear period, and are seeking record outflows -- or seeing record outflows. The blanket beta strategy that worked so well postcrisis has come to more volatility and divergence, and as Gary said, as many European and Asian equity indexes have fallen year-to-date, even as the S&P is at a record level. Today, as the environment asset managers are operating, this is the operating model that we're seeing and the environment we're seeing as an asset manager. Clients do not know what to do with their money. They are afraid, and they are pulling back, as evidenced by more than $55 trillion in bank deposits sitting in the United States, China and Japan alone. And even as markets have rallied recently, many clients have missed that upside and find themselves feeling even further behind. In difficult times, our clients need BlackRock more than ever. We believe that asset managers must evolve in an anticipation of the fundamental shifts taking place in our industry, driven by technology, demographics, regulation, so that they are positioned to meet the clients' needs, and we, BlackRock, are doing that. 
As we highlight at our recent Investor Day, BlackRock is constantly adapting. The differentiating platform we have built at BlackRock over the past 28 years is resonating with our clients and the diversity of product offerings, the risk capabilities of Aladdin, the market insights offered by the BlackRock Investment Institute. Our clients will need to put their money to work. I can't predict when and how much, but when they do, I have confidence that BlackRock has never been better positioned to capture those flows. 
Whether a client is looking for an illiquid alternative investment or an ETF or an unconstrained fixed income strategy or a smart beta or factor strategy or a multi-asset income product, we can deliver that solution and many others, but most important is our ability to fashion solutions from the combination of these strategies to meet the unique needs of our clients, all backed by our unmatched risk analytics and technology, and that is what's truly differentiating with BlackRock, and that is what is now resonating with our clients. As Gary mentioned, we saw $2 billion of long-term net inflows in the quarter. And over the last 12 months, we have seen $126 billion of long-term net inflows across our platform. These flows are well diversified, with $12 billion in active and $114 billion in index, including $96 billion from clients in the U.S., $30 billion from international clients. We saw $39 billion and $85 billion in equity and fixed income net inflows, respectively. And we continue to generate strong client commitments in our rapidly growing illiquid alternative business. 
Since quarter-end, after Brexit, we continue to see accelerated flows in our iShares franchise with approximately $18 billion of net inflows, thus far, in July, bringing our 2016 net inflows to more than $56 billion. iShares currently has the #1 share of global and European iShares -- ETFs and our fixed income ETF flows year-to-date. 
Let me talk about our fixed income flows. The fixed income iShares continued to be a substantial growth opportunity for BlackRock, and we saw more than $67 billion of net inflows over the past 12 months. If -- for some of you, you may remember, more than 5 years ago, some of our skeptics were still questioning the overall ETF growth story, and downplaying the fixed income opportunity. We were outspoken about our ability to innovate and to build this market. And today, with the fixed income ETF industry reaching $600 billion in total AUM, and our own franchises north of $300 billion, we are the proven leader in this space, and are focused on the continued penetration of the $100 trillion fixed income asset class. 
And just as we were doing 5 years ago, today, we're investing to develop the solutions that will meet our clients' needs in the future, including infrastructure, sustainable investing, big data, machine learning, factors and smart beta, and also critically in technology from our Aladdin franchise to our presence in digital wealth management with FutureAdvisor. Monetary policy has driven yields to record low levels while failing to stimulate economic growth, and there's significant need for a global fiscal policy response. Infrastructure investing will be critical component of that solution, creating jobs, driving growth, providing investors with long-term opportunities for yield. We are well positioned to participate in that activity. Following another strong quarter of capital raising, BlackRock now manages more than $8 billion in invested and committed capital across our infrastructure platform. Whether in alternatives or across our active platform, to continue to deliver alpha in the new market paradigm, you have to be connected. You need scale. You have to leverage technology, and of course, you have to be smart and nimble. 
BlackRock's Aladdin technology connects our global investor community on a common platform. The scale of our trading and liquidity platform enables us to access market liquidity that few firms can, and we further enhance that scale through the Bank of America Global Capital Management acquisition in the quarter. Our data expertise allows us to turn large unstructured data sets into meaningful investment insights, and our risks and quantitative analysis teams provide independent oversight to help identify both risks and opportunities. The platform that we built is also a powerful means to recruit and retain industry's top talent. Most importantly, we announced that we hired Mark Wiseman to lead our unified active equity franchise. 
In the quarter, performance across our active platform remains stable or improved with 80% fixed income, 67% in Fundamental Equity, 82% in scientific active equity, above their benchmarks or peer medium for the last 3-year period. 
We're making significant investments in big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning. And we saw more than $1 billion in scientific active equity inflows in the quarter. Factor-based investment strategies helps us bridge the gap between traditional active and index, and further fill out our offerings as clients increasingly look to achieve access to broad persistent drivers of return through low-cost, efficient vehicles. 
During the quarter, our global iShares minimum volatility fund raised more than $6 billion, leading the ETF industry smart beta category, and BlackRock now manages more than $140 billion in AUM across a range of factor-based strategies. 
Technology has always been a core component of our value proposition and a significant differentiator for BlackRock. As the investment landscape evolves, technology is transitioning from a competitive advantage to a competitive requirement. Those who do not invest in technology will not be able to meet their clients' long-term needs. Technology remains a key area of focus and investment for BlackRock across all aspects of our business to enhance our investment process, to enhance our client service, to create operational efficiencies and our unifying BlackRock Aladdin technology platform. 
Aladdin revenues grew 13% year-over-year, and during the quarter, we saw one of the largest clients -- we signed one of the largest clients to date. We expect Aladdin to continue to grow as we enhanced capabilities to meet clients' current and future needs as we expand Aladdin to serve additional clients across the financial ecosystem. We are breaking down legacy systems to connect asset managers to asset servicers through Provider Aladdin, and providing wealth management organizations with institutional quality risk oversight and analytics through our Aladdin For Wealth platform. 
We also believe that the evolving technology and regulatory landscape, including the new DoL rule in the U.S., digital advice will play an integral role in increasing access and transparency for investors. And we continue to see strong client interest in our FutureAdvisor platform, as clients look to new and innovative wealth management solutions. 
Clients not only turn to BlackRock to manage their assets, but also to help them understand the larger term impact of global events. The BlackRock Investment Institute leads that discussion. To help clients understand the immediate results of the Brexit vote, BII posted 2 client calls the morning after the vote with more than 10,000 participants worldwide. This level of engagement and participation is a testament to BlackRock's position in the industry, not only as an asset manager, but as a thought leader, and this allows us to be a greater trusted adviser. 
Going forward, we will continue to see changes. We'll see changes in markets, changes in technology, changes in demographics and regulation. This is all driving the changing needs of our clients. And we will continue to adapt our business to serve those needs in that ever-changing world. We are in a difficult environment for our clients and our industry, but challenging environments have always been when BlackRock has been able to make the biggest leaps forward. Today, many of our clients are apprehensive, and they're coming to us and asking us for advice. As I said, our client dialogues have never been better, and we have never been in a better position to serve our clients' needs. That is why I have never seen, in our 28-year history, more opportunity for BlackRock than I do today. 
Now let's open it up for questions."

I think everyone -- when you look at BlackRock and you look at all the products that you guys offer, and you've proven it over time in terms of the organic growth that you're able to generate. So this quarter, it's a bit surprising, but the backdrop has been anything but normal. But when you think about some of the comments that you made, and particularly on the institutional side in terms of flows, you look at all the cash on the sidelines, you look at where equity valuations are, where yields are, when you're talking to clients, is there a risk for the industry that we see a lot of money remaining on the sidelines for a period of time, just given the lack of opportunities? Or do you think that there's still enough, I don't know, conversations or drive to allocate some of this cash into other solutions that can still generate some attractive returns?"

That's certainly true. I think we're seeing an anomaly right now. We're seeing -- if you look at our ETF flows since Brexit, I would say the majority of those inflows are probably -- are institutional because, at the same time, I'm sure you're looking at the data, there's still outflows in mutual funds, which tells you, obviously, retail are still selling, but that divergence is quite stark and shocking to see that type of differential. The dialogues we're having with clients are, as I said, as robust as possible. Some clients are looking to put money to work, but the issue is some clients who have regulatory issues or capital issue, investing in bond yields at this time, I guess, is more difficult. Some of them are looking to invest in dividend stocks. And so  I believe we're going to see more unlocking of money over the course of the next 12 months. I can't predict whether it's the third quarter, but I'm particularly surprised at the sheer volume of inflows in iShares in the first 14 days of the month, which is public, so I could talk about it. And the dialogue we're having in institutional, we've seen some good flows and awards in alternatives already this quarter. So it is not as -- I wouldn't call it to be as systematic and easy. It is more periodic and idiosyncratic, depending on the clients' needs. But this is a time for us to be in front of our clients more than ever before as they are questioning their asset allocation, where should they put money, how should they think about it. And so, Michael, I can't predict one quarter over another, but what I can say, over a long period of time, there is huge pent-up demand and we -- I believe we will be more involved than ever before. I can't say that about the industry, though."

I said just that from the last question, we have been awarded some -- 1 or 2 mandates already this quarter in the alts space. I think, across the board, we're well positioned. It really depends on what category. You mentioned infrastructure. We have a huge emphasis on this. We are continuing to hire people there. We are in dialogue with many different parts of the world related to infrastructure investing. As we find those investments, it's very easy to find the capital. So as you know, we have a $30 billion real asset platform, a $15 billion and fund to fund of private equity. We continue to see growth in private credit. We're well positioned in some of these products. Other products, we're not as well positioned as others. But importantly, I could say with absolute confidence, the positioning we have in the alts space with our clients has never been more robust. And obviously, we are not as -- in some of the platforms, we're not as strong because it was not one of our core competencies 15 years ago, and we've been building it. We did a -- we have institutional client survey, and in that survey, we did determine that 53% of our clients are going to be reallocating more into alts and real asset. So I think that feeds what you just asked. And so we believe we're in a very good position for it. I would argue, though, some of the asset classes, the reason why they've done poorly in the alternative space is because there's so much money chasing us, so few investments."

So on a -- we kind of normalize for that. In terms of the institutional business for the quarter, we did see NNB before return of capital of about 800 -- let's call it $25 million. Again, infrastructure path in BAA that Larry mentioned, and we also did, institutionally, another $700 million of commitments in the quarter. Again, infrastructure opportunities to credit and BAA, I think, was critically important. Our total today is about $10 billion of uninvested but committed capital.

So clients continue to search for yield in a low-rate environment. And in the quarter, we saw significant equity market volatility. So fixed income has remained a critical component of most clients' portfolios. We continue to have very strong performance across our fixed income franchise with 80% of assets above the benchmark or peer median for the 3-year period. iShares had $10 billion of fixed income net inflows, and that was driven by strong flows into investment-grade corporates, broad U.S. or EM debt and TIPS. The fixed income ETF industry recently reached, by the way, $600 billion in total AUM, and that's doubled over the past 4 years and our own franchise is north of $300 billion. And we see significant opportunity to increase the penetration of the $100 trillion global fixed income market. Now to drill deeper on -- just on July 7, to give you an idea, LQD, which is our corporate bond fund, took in $1.1 billion of net inflows, and that was a record daily inflow for a corporate bond ETF. So on the retail side, the fixed income business continues to be strong, and it's led by total return, and it's also led by our strategic municipal offering. We saw $2 billion of net inflows into retail active fixed income, and on the institutional side, the active fixed income net outflows of $7 billion were driven primarily by client reallocation activity in Asia Pac and in the U.S. and clients continue to come in and ask for presentations on strategic income opportunities, the reason being giving the portfolio manager more tools, more ability to find different types of fixed income securities with lower risk, but higher returns in a low interest rate environment. So we believe that, that area of the market is going to continue to grow as well as from the iShares fixed income side."

We are highly enthusiastic with rules that give more confidence to investors that they believe it's a level playing field so they could invest. And if we can see that confidence build and unlock some of this huge cash holdings, we're in a very good position. So I want to put that into context of what is being proposed. We certainly don't know the end results of how liquidity is going to be addressed. The disclosures related to liquidity, we know, in the proposed document that the SEC is looking at different buckets, how you analyze risk. They're going to set a limit to the illiquid bucket of 15%. Overall, we have been very supportive of these rules. And we believe there's a need for better disclosure related to the composition of all portfolios. As you know, we've been founded on a culture of understanding and managing the risk. And importantly, it is rules like the liquidity rule or even the DoL rule that is, I believe, some of the foundational reasons why we see accelerated interest in having a dialogue with us in a risk platform or risk technology of Aladdin. So I don't know much more than that, Bill, but we are a constructive participant in the dialogue with the SEC. And we hope that we have that transparency in all the funds and understanding so people -- investors can understand what are the embedded liquidity risks in these funds. And we don't know how they're going to respond to the differentiation between a mutual fund and ETF or how they look at them differently. So we don't know enough, and we'll wait and see when they come out with a final commentary -- final proposal, and then we'll have another commentary."

I think it is, as I said, I think some of the great growth in the fixed income ETF platform is related to the illiquidity in some of the marketplaces. If people are looking for exposures, they could go buy an ETF for that type of exposures. But we believe the marketplace -- like, we do agree with the notion of what PwC has suggested, that ETFs are going to continue to grow and maybe double in size. I think the big thing, Eric, maybe the -- a bigger issue is we're seeing a re-definement of active. And as you heard, where we're making our investments, our investments are smart beta, which is a form of active. It's not -- we can call it tethered active, but it is a form of active. We're talking about using factors of analysis, and our minimum volatility ETF is a great way of getting active, some form of active returns, through an ETF platform. So I think it's technology using different instruments like ETFs, but more importantly, I think preferences are changing. So the old way of investing maybe just as a -- in categories of market capitalization is certainly going to be changing, and so I think it's more than just a preference out of active into passive. I'm a big believer that active will play a role in the future. So let's be clear about it. We believe, whether it is -- alternatives is an active product. We are a big believer that -- and in some categories, like in Asian equities and components of European equities and in some areas of the U.S. equity market, where active returns can and show out-performance over index. But I think what you're seeing also is a trend that iShares are taking some share away of people buying individual stocks. That's one thing that I think -- and maybe iShares is taking away from buying individual bonds. These are things that -- the dynamic that are changing. We are seeing more investors talk about asset allocation instead of individual stocks. And I think probably the most important element I just alluded to, obviously, in the last 4 months, we've seen some really accelerated outflows, we, the industry, in active equities. I would not write it off over a long cycle, and I would just give you a better perspective on BlackRock. We had 8 quarters in a row of positive flows, and so I'm not -- I don't know if this is the beginning of a trend, but we all should pay attention, but I do believe it is the technology of ETFs, the simplicity of ETFs, the -- a quick, easy way of getting exposures is now driving more demand in those products, and we believe they will continue to drive demand. And as I said, we do believe the ETF business will double in size in the next 5 years."

So first thing is, is there -- do you have any better sense of how -- not so much in terms of more iShares demand, but maybe from a cost or expense perspective, how you think this may flow back into BlackRock and your peers? In particular, how does a distributor continue to demand kind of payment for access in a DoL world?

I -- we are having constant conversation with all our distribution partners. There are some partners who believe the DoL will be revolutionary for their business, and there are some of our distribution partners who believe it's evolutionary. It does mean change for the business, and I think we're very well positioned for those changes in the business. As I said in our first quarter results that, once again, if better understanding, better outcome for the ultimate investor, which leads to more investable assets out of cash, that's all good for the ecosystem of our distribution partners and really good for the asset management industry. Two, I think it's -- it most certainly -- as you raised the question related to Aladdin for wealth, most certainly, I think the DoL and the responsibilities under the DoL, it's going to need a much tighter risk management oversight culture with all the clients. And we are having robust dialogue with everybody on the uptick -- uptake of Aladdin for wealth, and we'll see how that plays out. I don't have anything tangible yet to say, and -- but I will say we are in very deep dialogue, and I am very optimistic that there will be uptake for Aladdin for wealth. And I do believe, as I said, the DoL puts much more responsibility on the firm, on the financial adviser, to act in a fiduciary way. There's a big dialogue. As we know, the DoL is only about retirement assets. The big dialogue is, ""Does that force an upgrading of fiduciary standards for all the business?"" That could be debated among different people, and so I don't know what it means in outcome. I think the positive side -- so I'm taking this as a long-running positive for most distribution partners. I think they will have -- they have to obviously have much more oversight and understanding of their clients assets as a fiduciary, but I do believe that they're going to have more centralization. I think they're going to have -- almost more like a European model, where you have CIOs who then -- who determine which mutual funds, what platform. And as you know, because we've talked about the European experience now for at least 8 years, and one of our strong positioning in Europe with that CIO model. I believe the DoL rule will move the U.S. more to a CIO model. Obviously, we know it's going to move for those that are appropriate more to advisory model instead of a commission-based model. And for those clients that have that advisory relationship, it may build a deeper relationship between the client and the distribution partner and their adviser. And I believe, because of our scale, our positioning, we will be a huge beneficiary of that positioning."

In our last look, 146. The 2-year note is still trading at 66 basis points or approximately around that area. If the U.S. goes down that path, reversing that increase, and indeed, the Federal Reserve needs to ease, that's a whole different issue. I don't see that as an outcome at this moment. It -- I believe the U.S. economy is growing not as well as we want it to be, but I think we will see a 2% economy this year, which would tell -- and we still have, plus or minus, a 5% unemployment rate in this country. So despite all the headwinds and uncertainties, I don't see, at this time, a Federal Reserve that turns itself into a central bank that has to aggressively ease, and so I -- it may delay their path towards normalizing of interest rates, but I don't see any possibility at this moment that they will be forced to going back into an easing mode. I think the actions of the Bank of England today is another good example. Mark placed -- anticipated easing. They suggested in their commentary that they're going to possibly ease in August. They're looking for more data. So if the U.K. growth rates does fall, like we, at BlackRock anticipate, it doesn't mean it falls worldwide. It moves around, and I would tell you very clearly, the U.S. economy is still the area where people want to invest worldwide, and I don't see that -- I don't see the atmosphere where I have to worry about money market funds in the United States anytime soon.

And we've put together a very, very strong team that has backgrounds in private equity, in venture capital, in credit and using all the resources that we have. And you can imagine across BlackRock, there are so many resources and so many types of transactions that we see. We never really had a pocket of money to take advantage of those opportunities. So putting this group together, we have been able to source transactions from all across the globe for these institutional clients. That while they're a little outside of the box, the risk tolerance fits very perfectly. The return profile in most of these cases is double-digit returns, and they're not correlated at all with various parts of the market to basically diversify their portfolios. So the other part of this, which is quite interesting, is that they come in very large sizes. So these institutions that are looking to invest here are north of $1 billion-type mandates. The struggle for many institutions in this is to get the money invested. We haven't had a problem in finding the opportunities. We just never really went after them. So this is an area that we continue to add resources to. We continue to use and coordinate within the firm to source assets for this. And we're very optimistic. And quite frankly, when we're sitting down with a lot of the large institutions, this is exactly what they're looking for. And I might add, one of the things that we're going to have Mark Wiseman, when he comes in, is also help us to source these assets because in his previous job, he is one of the guys that's in the forefront of the industry that has been able to source and find these type of investments outside of the box.

As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which list some of the factors that may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. BlackRock assumes no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. 
So with that, let's begin."

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. 
Clients are struggling to navigate an incredibly difficult investment landscape. Notwithstanding the recent market rally over the last 12 months, many global equity markets were down double digits, and interest rates touched historic lows worldwide. The current macro environment, including negative yields in many jurisdictions, Brexit and U.S. election uncertainty, is causing clients to defer investment decisions, resulting in significant increases in global cash balances, lower active flows and a shift from equity to fixed income assets. This environment is also resulting in lower revenue capture across the asset management industry. In times like this, growing and evolving our business are critically important, as client needs for our investment advice and risk management capabilities are greater than ever. BlackRock is having richer dialogues with clients than at any time in our history, and we are well positioned for growth when client activity accelerates. 
Last month, at our 2016 Investor Day, we described how BlackRock is built for change. Our strong foundation drives consistent financial results and stable cash flows, enabling us to fund innovation and invest in new growth areas. This is critical to clients, especially during volatile times when other investment managers may be forced to pull back, and to shareholders, as we have an opportunity to win market share. During the second quarter, strength in our global investment platform and Aladdin risk management business, coupled with continued expense discipline, enabled us to continue investing in our business despite market headwinds that impacted both base fees and performance fees on a year-over-year basis. Second quarter revenue of $2.8 billion was 3% lower than a year ago, while operating income of $1.2 billion was down 6%. Earnings per share of $4.78 was down 4% versus the prior year quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $14 million of net investment gains, primarily attributable to net gains on private equity and hedge fund-related investments. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 30.6% compared to 30.1% a year ago. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2016, though the effective -- the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring items that could arise during the year. 
Second quarter long-term net inflows of $2 billion reflected $16 billion of net new business from iShares, offset by outflows in active strategies and institutional index mandates. Over the last 12 months, BlackRock delivered long-term net inflows of $126 billion, representing 3% organic growth. 
Second quarter base fees were down 2% year-over-year despite generally flat average AUM, reflecting more than $250 billion in AUM mix change, favoring lower-fee fixed income and cash assets, including the impact of divergent equity beta. While the S&P 500 was down only 1% on average year-over-year, many markets went to our higher-fee equity products, including emerging markets, Europe, Asia. Natural resources and commodities experienced double-digit declines. Sequentially, base fees increased 6%, driven by higher average AUM following the market rally in March. More recent market volatility associated with Brexit had a minimal impact on second quarter base fees. While the operational implications of Brexit will evolve over the coming quarters, we are well positioned versus the industry as a function of our globally diversified manufacturing, distribution and operating platform. 
Performance fees of $74 million decreased 46% versus a year ago, reflecting continuing performance challenges in the hedge fund industry generally, and the impact of high watermarks on certain funds specifically. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by fees associated with hedge fund-related and certain long-only equity products. BlackRock Solutions revenue of $172 million was up 7% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Our Aladdin business, which represented 85% of BRS revenue in the quarter, grew 13% year-over-year, driven by several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform during the last year. We continue to see strong market demand from institutional asset managers, evidenced by the recent signing of one of our largest clients to date, which will be implemented over the next 18 to 24 months. As discussed at Investor Day, the rapidly changing regulatory and financial landscape is also driving accelerated conversations with retail intermediaries about leveraging Aladdin's value proposition in the wealth management space. Aladdin remains a key differentiator and a competitive advantage for BlackRock, enabling us to communicate more effectively and to serve clients more holistically and efficiently. 
Total expense decreased 2% year-over-year, driven primarily by lower compensation expense. Sequentially, total expense increased 3%, driven primarily by higher compensation and AUM-related expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was down $31 million or 3% year-over-year, reflecting lower incentive compensation. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense increased $32 million or 3%, reflecting higher incentive compensation, driven by higher operating income and performance fees relative to the first quarter, partially offset by lower seasonal employer payroll taxes in the current quarter. 
Distribution and servicing cost increased 12% sequentially due to the acquisition of BofA Global Capital Management and reduced money market fund fee waivers, which have historically been shared by our distribution partners. 
G&A expense was essentially flat year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting continued expense discipline despite the impact of recent acquisitions on our run rate. As we mentioned last quarter and assuming stable markets, we still anticipate full year 2016 G&A expense to be roughly in line with 2015 levels. 
Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 43.9% was down 100 basis points year-over-year, but up 230 basis points sequentially, primarily reflecting the marginal impact of changes in base and performance fees in the respective time periods, coupled with G&A expense discipline. As we've stated in the past, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target. We do remain keenly focused on delivering long-term value to our shareholders, and will continue working to strike an appropriate balance between organically investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. 
We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting on our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, in the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of BofA Global Capital Management, assuming investment management responsibilities for approximately $81 billion of related cash and liquidity AUM, and leveraging the scale of our cash management franchise. During the second quarter, we also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares. 
Second quarter long-term net inflows of $2 billion were driven by the diversity of our platform. Importantly, we saw strength in strategic focus areas, including fixed income ETFs, smart-beta and factor products and infrastructure offerings. Global iShares generated $16 billion of net new business in the second quarter, led by fixed income net inflows of $10 billion. We continue to see investor appetite for risk-aware, smart-beta products with our minimum volatility funds raising more than $6 billion during the quarter, and maintaining the #1 market share position in the product category. We also continue to see strong results in the Core Series, which is less sensitive to the macro environment, raising $12 billion in net flows during the quarter. 
Throughout the quarter, investors once again used iShares as their preferred vehicle to navigate market volatility and express rapidly changing investment views. Since the U.K.'s decision to exit the EU, we have seen particular strength in our European iShares range across asset classes, capturing over 70% market share over the past several weeks as clients leverage our industry-leading product breadth and liquidity. 
BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw $6 billion of long-term net outflows in another challenging quarter for the industry, as both domestic and cross-border fund flows suffered in light of political and macroeconomic events. The Global Retail market is changing dramatically. DoL, RDR and MiFID are impacting the way wealth managers are serving clients. Digital and technology offerings are proliferating and efficient beta products continue to take share from active products. While year-to-date industry domestic and cross-border active gross sales have slowed significantly due to macro uncertainty and continued alpha performance, we are confident that the breadth of our retail platform, including active and passive investment products, solutions and portfolio construction tools and digital and risk management capabilities collectively position BlackRock to be a market leader in this new environment. 
Our institutional business saw $8 billion of long-term net outflows, primarily due to active fixed income net outflows of $7 billion, driven largely by client reallocation activity. Despite volatility in EMEA, BlackRock continued to expand our presence with institutional clients in Continental Europe, generating $8 billion in net inflows during the quarter, and illustrating that while many clients are taking a wait-and-see approach, BlackRock remains the partner of choice when they are prepared to invest. 
In the United States, our Defined Contribution business generated net inflows of approximately $4 billion, driven by LifePath and other target-date inflows, and now accounts for over $650 billion of assets under management. Finally, we saw positive flows in institutional illiquid alternatives, driven by continued momentum in infrastructure. Illiquid alternatives remain a key area of growth for BlackRock, as institutional clients increasingly search for additional sources of income and uncorrelated returns. We now have more than $10 billion in committed but uninvested capital to deploy for clients. 
As we communicated at Investor Day, we are intensely focused on adapting ahead of change. While the current market environment is putting pressure on asset management companies and challenging historic business models, BlackRock has built the industry's broadest global product and distribution platform to meet the changing needs of our clients and drive long-term value for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. As Gary mentioned, our clients are facing unprecedented challenges as they attempt to navigate the current investment environment, which I'll describe in more detail in a moment.",1815,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. As Gary mentioned, our clients are facing unprecedented challenges as they attempt to navigate the current investment environment, which I'll describe in more detail in a moment. 
While this has caused many of our clients to pause their investment activity for the moment, this also led to more and deeper conversations with our clients than ever before. They are seeking our advice. They are looking for our investment solutions, and are wanting the risk analytics and technology that BlackRock can uniquely offer. We are better positioned -- I mean, we, BlackRock, are better positioned than we've ever been to deliver the solutions they need. 
Political and macroeconomic uncertainty, including Brexit; the upcoming elections in France and the United States; historically low yields and elevated market volatility; regulatory pressure, including the DoL, Solvency II, these factors and others are leading clients of all types to pause as they assess both their own needs and their investment options available for them. 
Our pension clients with 7%-plus return expectations are facing an ever-expanding liability gap. Our insurance clients with significant regulatory constraints cannot make their business models works in a 0-yield environment. Sovereign wealth funds have been forced to focus on liquidity and funding needs after years of rapid growth, and individual savers are wrestling with a choice of too much risk versus too little return as they face the prospects of their own underfunded retirement plan.
Where can clients turn to address these challenges? Today, there's $10 trillion of sovereign bonds that are delivering negative returns and negative yields. Yet, central banks continue to be buying, and global derisking continues to bid up fixed income prices. Active equity managers as a group have underperformed over a multiyear period, and are seeking record outflows -- or seeing record outflows. The blanket beta strategy that worked so well postcrisis has come to more volatility and divergence, and as Gary said, as many European and Asian equity indexes have fallen year-to-date, even as the S&P is at a record level. Today, as the environment asset managers are operating, this is the operating model that we're seeing and the environment we're seeing as an asset manager. Clients do not know what to do with their money. They are afraid and they are pulling back, as evidenced by more than $55 trillion in bank deposits sitting in the United States, China and Japan alone. And even as markets have rallied recently, many clients have missed that upside and find themselves feeling even further behind. In difficult times, our clients need BlackRock more than ever. We believe that asset managers must evolve in an anticipation of the fundamental shifts taking place in our industry, driven by technology, demographics, regulation, so that they are positioned to meet the clients' needs, and we, BlackRock, are doing that. 
As we highlight at our recent Investor Day, BlackRock is constantly adapting. The differentiating platform we have built at BlackRock over the past 28 years is resonating with our clients, and the diversity of product offerings, the risk capabilities of Aladdin, the market insights offered by the BlackRock Investment Institute. Our clients will need to put their money to work. I can't predict when and how much, but when they do, I have confidence that BlackRock has never been better positioned to capture those flows. 
Whether a client is looking for an illiquid alternative investment or an ETF or an unconstrained fixed income strategy or a smart beta or factor strategy or a multi-asset income product, we can deliver that solution and many others. But most important is our ability to fashion solutions from the combination of these strategies to meet the unique needs of our clients, all backed by our unmatched risk analytics and technology, and that is what's truly differentiating with BlackRock, and that is what is now resonating with our clients. As Gary mentioned, we saw $2 billion of long-term net inflows in the quarter. And over the last 12 months, we have seen $126 billion of long-term net inflows across our platform. These flows are well diversified, with $12 billion in active and $114 billion in index, including $96 billion from clients in the U.S., $30 billion from international clients. We saw $39 billion and $85 billion in equity and fixed income net inflows, respectively. And we continue to generate strong client commitments in our rapidly growing illiquid alternative business. 
Since quarter-end, after Brexit, we continue to see accelerated flows in our iShares franchise with approximately $18 billion of net inflows, thus far, in July, bringing our 2016 net inflows to more than $56 billion. iShares currently has the #1 share of global and European iShares -- ETFs and our fixed income ETF flows year-to-date. 
Let me talk about our fixed income flows. The fixed income iShares continued to be a substantial growth opportunity for BlackRock, and we saw more than $67 billion of net inflows over the past 12 months. If -- for some of you, you may remember, more than 5 years ago, some of our skeptics were still questioning the overall ETF growth story, and downplaying the fixed income opportunity. We were outspoken about our ability to innovate and to build this market. And today, with the fixed income ETF industry reaching $600 billion in total AUM, and our own franchises north of $300 billion, we are the proven leader in this space, and are focused on the continued penetration of the $100 trillion fixed income asset class. 
And just as we were doing 5 years ago, today, we're investing to develop the solutions that will meet our clients' needs in the future, including infrastructure, sustainable investing, big data, machine learning, factors and smart beta, and also critically in technology, from our Aladdin franchise to our presence in digital wealth management with FutureAdvisor. Monetary policy has driven yields to record low levels while failing to stimulate economic growth, and there's significant need for a global fiscal policy response. Infrastructure investing will be a critical component of that solution, creating jobs, driving growth, providing investors with long-term opportunities for yield. We are well positioned to participate in that activity. Following another strong quarter of capital raising, BlackRock now manages more than $8 billion in invested and committed capital across our infrastructure platform. Whether in alternatives or across our active platform, to continue to deliver alpha in the new market paradigm, you have to be connected. You need scale. You have to leverage technology, and of course, you have to be smart and nimble. 
BlackRock's Aladdin technology connects our global investor community on a common platform. The scale of our trading and liquidity platform enables us to access market liquidity that few firms can, and we further enhanced that scale through the Bank of America Global Capital Management acquisition in the quarter. Our data expertise allows us to turn large unstructured data sets into meaningful investment insights, and our risk and quantitative analysis teams provide independent oversight to help identify both risks and opportunities. The platform that we built is also a powerful means to recruit and retain industry's top talent. Most importantly, we announced that we hired Mark Wiseman to lead our unified active equity franchise. 
In the quarter, performance across our active platform remains stable or improved with 80% fixed income, 67% in Fundamental Equity, 82% in scientific active equity, above their benchmarks or peer median for the last 3-year period. 
We're making significant investments in big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning. And we saw more than $1 billion in scientific active equity inflows in the quarter. Factor-based investment strategies helps us bridge the gap between traditional, active and index, and further fill out our offerings as clients increasingly look to achieve access to broad persistent drivers of return through low-cost, efficient vehicles. 
During the quarter, our global iShares minimum volatility fund raised more than $6 billion, leading the ETF industry smart beta category, and BlackRock now manages more than $140 billion in AUM across a range of factor-based strategies. 
Technology has always been a core component of our value proposition and a significant differentiator for BlackRock. As the investment landscape evolves, technology is transitioning from a competitive advantage to a competitive requirement. Those who do not invest in technology will not be able to meet their clients' long-term needs. Technology remains a key area of focus and investment for BlackRock across all aspects of our business to enhance our investment process, to enhance our client service, to create operational efficiencies and our unifying BlackRock Aladdin technology platform. 
Aladdin revenues grew 13% year-over-year, and during the quarter, we saw one of the largest clients -- we signed one of the largest clients to date. We expect Aladdin to continue to grow as we enhance capabilities to meet clients' current and future needs and as we expand Aladdin to serve additional clients across the financial ecosystem. We are breaking down legacy systems to connect asset managers to asset servicers through Provider Aladdin, and providing wealth management organizations with institutional-quality risk oversight and analytics through our Aladdin for wealth platform. 
We also believe that the evolving technology and regulatory landscape, including the new DoL rule in the U.S., digital advice will play an integral role in increasing access and transparency for investors. And we continue to see strong client interest in our FutureAdvisor platform, as clients look to new and innovative wealth management solutions. 
Clients not only turn to BlackRock to manage their assets, but also to help them understand the larger term impact of global events. The BlackRock Investment Institute leads that discussion. To help clients understand the immediate results of the Brexit vote, BII hosted 2 client calls the morning after the vote with more than 10,000 participants worldwide. This level of engagement and participation is a testament to BlackRock's position in the industry, not only as an asset manager, but as a thought leader, and this allows us to be a greater trusted adviser. 
Going forward, we will continue to see changes. We'll see changes in markets, changes in technology, changes in demographics and regulation. This is all driving the changing needs of our clients. And we will continue to adapt our business to serve those needs in that ever-changing world. We are in a difficult environment for our clients and our industry, but challenging environments have always been when BlackRock has been able to make the biggest leaps forward. Today, many of our clients are apprehensive, and they're coming to us and asking us for advice. As I said, our client dialogues have never been better, and we have never been in a better position to serve our clients' needs. That is why I have never seen, in our 28-year history, more opportunity for BlackRock than I do today. 
Now let's open it up for questions."

I think everyone -- when you look at BlackRock and you look at all the products that you guys offer, and you've proven it over time in terms of the organic growth that you're able to generate. So this quarter, it's a bit surprising, but the backdrop has been anything but normal. But when you think about some of the comments that you made, and particularly on the institutional side in terms of flows, you look at all the cash on the sidelines, you look at where equity valuations are, where yields are, when you're talking to clients, is there a risk for the industry that we see a lot of money remaining on the sidelines for a period of time, just given the lack of opportunities? Or do you think that there's still enough, I don't know, conversations or drive to allocate some of this cash into other solutions that can still generate some attractive returns?"

That's certainly true. I think we're seeing an anomaly right now. We're seeing -- if you look at our ETF flows since Brexit, I would say the majority of those inflows are probably -- are institutional because, at the same time, I'm sure you're looking at the data, there's still outflows in mutual funds, which tells you, obviously, retail are still selling, but that divergence is quite stark and shocking to see that type of differential. The dialogues we're having with clients are, as I said, as robust as possible. Some clients are looking to put money to work, but the issue is some clients who have regulatory issues or capital issue, investing in bond yields at this time, I guess, is more difficult. Some of them are looking to invest in dividend stocks. And so I believe we're going to see more unlocking of money over the course of the next 12 months. I can't predict whether it's the third quarter, but I'm particularly surprised at the sheer volume of inflows in iShares in the first 14 days of the month, which is public, so I could talk about it. And the dialogue we're having in institutional, we've seen some good flows and awards in alternatives already this quarter. So it is not as -- I wouldn't call it to be as systematic and easy. It is more periodic and idiosyncratic, depending on the clients' needs. But this is a time for us to be in front of our clients more than ever before as they are questioning their asset allocation, where should they put money, how should they think about it. And so, Michael, I can't predict one quarter over another, but what I can say, over a long period of time, there is huge pent-up demand and we -- I believe we will be more involved than ever before. I can't say that about the industry, though."

I said just that from the last question, we have been awarded some -- 1 or 2 mandates already this quarter in the alts space. I think, across the board, we're well positioned. It really depends on what category. You mentioned infrastructure. We have a huge emphasis on this. We are continuing to hire people there. We are in dialogue with many different parts of the world related to infrastructure investing. As we find those investments, it's very easy to find the capital. So as you know, we have about a $30 billion real asset platform, $15 billion in funded funds of private equity. We continue to see growth in private credit. We're well positioned in some of these products. Other products, we're not as well positioned as others. But importantly, I could say with absolute confidence, the positioning we have in the alts space with our clients has never been more robust. And obviously, we are not as -- in some of the platforms, we're not as strong because it was not one of our core competencies 15 years ago, and we've been building it. We did a -- we have an institutional client survey, and in that survey, we did determine that 53% of our clients are going to be reallocating more into alts and real asset. So I think that feeds what you just asked. And so we believe we're in a very good position for it. I would argue, though, some of the asset classes, the reason why they've done poorly in the alternative space is because there's so much money chasing so few investments."

So on a -- we kind of normalize for that. In terms of the institutional business for the quarter, we did see NNB before return of capital of about, let's call it, $825 million. Again, infrastructure, PEP and BAA that Larry mentioned. And we also did, institutionally, another $700 million of commitments in the quarter. Again, infrastructure opportunities to credit and BAA, I think, was critically important. Our total today is about $10 billion of uninvested but committed capital.

So clients continue to search for yield in a low-rate environment. And in the quarter, we saw significant equity market volatility. So fixed income has remained a critical component of most clients' portfolios. We continue to have very strong performance across our fixed income franchise with 80% of assets above the benchmark or peer median for the 3-year period. iShares had $10 billion of fixed income net inflows, and that was driven by strong flows into investment-grade corporates, broad U.S. or EM debt and TIPS. The fixed income ETF industry recently reached, by the way, $600 billion in total AUM, and that's doubled over the past 4 years, and our own franchise is north of $300 billion. And we see significant opportunity to increase the penetration of the $100 trillion global fixed income market. Now to drill deeper on -- just on July 7, to give you an idea, LQD, which is our corporate bond fund, took in $1.1 billion of net inflows, and that was a record daily inflow for a corporate bond ETF. So on the retail side, the fixed income business continues to be strong, and it's led by total return, and it's also led by our strategic municipal offering. We saw $2 billion of net inflows into retail active fixed income. And on the institutional side, the active fixed income net outflows of $7 billion were driven primarily by client reallocation activity in Asia Pac and in the U.S. And clients continue to come in and ask for presentations on strategic income opportunities, the reason being giving the portfolio manager more tools, more ability to find different types of fixed income securities with lower risk but higher returns in a low interest rate environment. So we believe that, that area of the market is going to continue to grow as well as from the iShares fixed income side."

As we said in the last quarter, we are supportive of rules that enhance investor protection. We are highly enthusiastic with rules that give more confidence to investors that they believe it's a level playing field so they could invest. And if we can see that confidence build and unlock some of this huge cash holdings, we're in a very good position. So I want to put that into context of what is being proposed. We certainly don't know the end results of how liquidity is going to be addressed. The disclosures related to liquidity, we know in the proposed document that the SEC is looking at different buckets, how you analyze risk. They're going to set a limit to the illiquid bucket of 15%. Overall, we have been very supportive of these rules. And we believe there's a need for better disclosure related to the composition of all portfolios. As you know, we've been founded on a culture of understanding and managing the risk. And importantly, it is rules like the liquidity rule or even the DoL rule that is, I believe, some of the foundational reasons why we see accelerated interest in having a dialogue with us in a risk platform or risk technology of Aladdin. So I don't know much more than that, Bill, but we are a constructive participant in the dialogue with the SEC. And we hope that we have that transparency in all the funds and understanding so people -- investors can understand what are the embedded liquidity risks in these funds. And we don't know how they're going to respond to the differentiation between a mutual fund and ETF or how they look at them differently. So we don't know enough, and we'll wait and see when they come out with a final commentary -- final proposal, and then we'll have another commentary."

I think it is -- as I said, I think some of the great growth in the fixed income ETF platform is related to the illiquidity in some of the marketplaces. If people are looking for exposures, they could go buy an ETF for that type of exposures. But we believe the marketplace -- like, we do agree with the notion of what PwC has suggested, that ETFs are going to continue to grow and maybe double in size. I think the big thing, Eric, maybe the -- a bigger issue is we're seeing a re-definement of active. And as you heard, where we're making our investments, our investments are smart beta, which is a form of active. It's not -- we can call it tethered active, but it is a form of active. We're talking about using factors as an analysis, and our minimum volatility ETF is a great way of getting active, some form of active returns through an ETF platform. So I think it's technology using different instruments like ETFs, but more importantly, I think preferences are changing. So the old way of investing maybe just as a -- in categories of market capitalization is certainly going to be changing, and so I think it's more than just a preference out of active into passive. I'm a big believer that active will play a role in the future. So let's be clear about it. We believe, whether it is -- alternatives is an active product. We are a big believer that -- and in some categories, like in Asian equities and components of European equities and in some areas of the U.S. equity market, where active returns can and show out-performance over index. But I think what you're seeing also is a trend that iShares are taking some share away of people buying individual stocks. That's one thing that I think -- and maybe iShares is taking away from buying individual bonds. These are things that -- the dynamic that are changing. We are seeing more investors talk about asset allocation instead of individual stocks. And I think probably the most important element I want to just allude to, obviously, in the last 4 months, we've seen some really accelerated outflows, we, the industry, in active equities. I would not write it off over a long cycle, and I would just give you a better perspective on BlackRock. We had 8 quarters in a row of positive flows, and so I'm not -- I don't know if this is the beginning of a trend, but we all should pay attention. But I do believe it is the technology of ETFs, the simplicity of ETFs, the -- a quick, easy way of getting exposures is now driving more demand in those products, and we believe they will continue to drive demand. And as I said, we do believe the ETF business will double in size in the next 5 years."

So first thing is, is there -- do you have any better sense of how -- not so much in terms of more iShares demand, but maybe from a cost or expense perspective, how you think this may flow back into BlackRock and your peers? In particular, how does a distributor continue to demand kind of payment for access in a DoL world?

I -- we are having constant conversation with all our distribution partners. There are some partners who believe the DoL will be revolutionary for their business, and there are some of our distribution partners who believe it's evolutionary. It does mean change for the business, and I think we're very well positioned for those changes in the business. As I said in our first quarter results that, once again, if better understanding, better outcome for the ultimate investor, which leads to more investable assets out of cash, that's all good for the ecosystem of our distribution partners and really good for the asset management industry. Two, I think it's -- it most certainly -- as you raised the question related to Aladdin for wealth, most certainly, I think the DoL and the responsibilities under the DoL, it's going to mean a much tighter risk management oversight culture with all the clients. And we are having robust dialogue with everybody on the uptick -- uptake of Aladdin for wealth, and we'll see how that plays out. I don't have anything tangible yet to say, and -- but I will say we are in very deep dialogue, and I am very optimistic that there will be uptake for Aladdin for wealth. And I do believe, as I said, the DoL puts much more responsibility on the firm, on the financial adviser, to act in a fiduciary way. There's a big dialogue. As we know, the DoL is only about retirement assets. The big dialogue is, ""Does that force an upgrading of fiduciary standards for all the business?"" That could be debated among different people, and so I don't know what it means in outcome. I think the positive side -- so I'm taking this as a long-running positive for most distribution partners. I think they will have -- they have to obviously have much more oversight and understanding of their clients' assets as a fiduciary, but I do believe that they're going to have more centralization. I think they're going to have almost more like a European model, where you have CIOs who then -- who determine which mutual funds, what platform. And as you know, because we've talked about the European experience now for at least 8 years, and one of our strong positioning in Europe with that CIO model. I believe the DoL rule will move the U.S. more to a CIO model. Obviously, we know it's going to move, for those that are appropriate, more to an advisory model instead of a commission-based model. And for those clients that have that advisory relationship, it may build a deeper relationship between the client and the distribution partner and their adviser. And I believe, because of our scale, our positioning, we will be a huge beneficiary of that positioning."

You're seeing, as you suggested, a flattening of the yield curve. Actually, we don't believe -- I mean we've seen the 10-year go down to as low as, what, 1.35%. And we're 1.47% right now. In our last look, 1.46%. The 2-year note is still trading at 66 basis points or approximately around that area. If the U.S. goes down that path, reversing that increase, and indeed, the Federal Reserve needs to ease, that's a whole different issue. I don't see that as an outcome at this moment. It -- I believe the U.S. economy is growing not as well as we want it to be, but I think we will see a 2% economy this year, which would tell -- and we still have, plus or minus, a 5% unemployment rate in this country. So despite all the headwinds and uncertainties, I don't see, at this time, a Federal Reserve that turns itself into a central bank that has to aggressively ease. And so I -- it may delay their path towards normalizing of interest rates, but I don't see any possibility at this moment that they will be forced to going back into an easing mode. I think the actions of the Bank of England today is another good example. Marketplace anticipated easing. They suggested in their commentary that they're going to possibly ease in August. They're looking for more data. So if the U.K. growth rates does fall, like we at BlackRock anticipate, it doesn't mean it falls worldwide. It moves around. And I would tell you very clearly, the U.S. economy is still the area where people want to invest worldwide, and I don't see that -- I don't see the atmosphere where I have to worry about money market funds in the United States anytime soon. I think we're going to live in this environment of low rates for a long time, though."

And we've put together a very, very strong team that has backgrounds in private equity, in venture capital, in credit, and using all the resources that we have. And you can imagine across BlackRock, there are so many resources and so many types of transactions that we see. We never really had a pocket of money to take advantage of those opportunities. So putting this group together, we have been able to source transactions from all across the globe for these institutional clients, that while they're a little outside of the box, the risk tolerance fits very perfectly. The return profile in most of these cases is double-digit returns, and they're not correlated at all with various parts of the market, to basically diversify their portfolios. So the other part of this, which is quite interesting, is that they come in very large sizes. So these institutions that are looking to invest here are north of $1 billion-type mandates. The struggle for many institutions in this is to get the money invested. We haven't had a problem in finding the opportunities. We just never really went after them. So this is an area that we continue to add resources to. We continue to use and coordinate within the firm to source assets for this. And we're very optimistic. And quite frankly, when we're sitting down with a lot of the large institutions, this is exactly what they're looking for. And I might add, one of the things that we're going to have Mark Wiseman, when he comes in, is also help us to source these assets because in his previous job, he is one of the guys that's in the forefront of the industry that has been able to source and find these type of investments outside of the box. So they are very customized, long term, very large mandates that require a significant team, significant resources, and we have it and we're very optimistic on this in the future."

Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. 
Clients are struggling to navigate an incredibly difficult investment landscape. Notwithstanding the recent market rally over the last 12 months, many global equity markets were down double digits, and interest rates touched historic lows worldwide. The current macro environment, including negative yields in many jurisdictions, Brexit and U.S. election uncertainty, is causing clients to defer investment decisions, resulting in significant increases in global cash balances, lower active flows and a shift from equity to fixed income assets. This environment is also resulting in lower revenue capture across the asset management industry. In times like this, growing and evolving our business are critically important, as client needs for our investment advice and risk management capabilities are greater than ever. BlackRock is having richer dialogues with clients than at any time in our history, and we are well positioned for growth when client activity accelerates. 
Last month, at our 2016 Investor Day, we described how BlackRock is built for change. Our strong foundation drives consistent financial results and stable cash flows, enabling us to fund innovation and invest in new growth areas. This is critical to clients, especially during volatile times when other investment managers may be forced to pull back, and to shareholders, as we have an opportunity to win market share. During the second quarter, strength in our global investment platform and Aladdin risk management business, coupled with continued expense discipline, enabled us to continue investing in our business despite market headwinds that impacted both base fees and performance fees on a year-over-year basis. Second quarter revenue of $2.8 billion was 3% lower than a year ago, while operating income of $1.2 billion was down 6%. Earnings per share of $4.78 was down 4% versus the prior year quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $14 million of net investment gains, primarily attributable to net gains on private equity and hedge fund-related investments. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 30.6% compared to 30.1% a year ago. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for the remainder of 2016, though the effective -- the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring items that could arise during the year. 
Second quarter long-term net inflows of $2 billion reflected $16 billion of net new business from iShares, offset by outflows in active strategies and institutional index mandates. Over the last 12 months, BlackRock delivered long-term net inflows of $126 billion, representing 3% organic growth. 
Second quarter base fees were down 2% year-over-year despite generally flat average AUM, reflecting more than $250 billion in AUM mix change, favoring lower-fee fixed income and cash assets, including the impact of divergent equity beta. While the S&P 500 was down only 1% on average year-over-year, many markets went to our higher-fee equity products, including emerging markets, Europe, Asia. Natural resources and commodities experienced double-digit declines. Sequentially, base fees increased 6%, driven by higher average AUM following the market rally in March. More recent market volatility associated with Brexit had a minimal impact on second quarter base fees. While the operational implications of Brexit will evolve over the coming quarters, we are well positioned versus the industry as a function of our globally diversified manufacturing, distribution and operating platform. 
Performance fees of $74 million decreased 46% versus a year ago, reflecting continuing performance challenges in the hedge fund industry generally, and the impact of high watermarks on certain funds specifically. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by fees associated with hedge fund-related and certain long-only equity products. BlackRock Solutions revenue of $172 million was up 7% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Our Aladdin business, which represented 85% of BRS revenue in the quarter, grew 13% year-over-year, driven by several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform during the last year. We continue to see strong market demand from institutional asset managers, evidenced by the recent signing of one of our largest clients to date, which will be implemented over the next 18 to 24 months. As discussed at Investor Day, the rapidly changing regulatory and financial landscape is also driving accelerated conversations with retail intermediaries about leveraging Aladdin's value proposition in the wealth management space. Aladdin remains a key differentiator and a competitive advantage for BlackRock, enabling us to communicate more effectively and to serve clients more holistically and efficiently. 
Total expense decreased 2% year-over-year, driven primarily by lower compensation expense. Sequentially, total expense increased 3%, driven primarily by higher compensation and AUM-related expense. Employee compensation and benefit expense was down $31 million or 3% year-over-year, reflecting lower incentive compensation. Sequentially, compensation and benefit expense increased $32 million or 3%, reflecting higher incentive compensation, driven by higher operating income and performance fees relative to the first quarter, partially offset by lower seasonal employer payroll taxes in the current quarter. 
Distribution and servicing cost increased 12% sequentially due to the acquisition of BofA Global Capital Management and reduced money market fund fee waivers, which have historically been shared by our distribution partners. 
G&A expense was essentially flat year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting continued expense discipline despite the impact of recent acquisitions on our run rate. As we mentioned last quarter and assuming stable markets, we still anticipate full year 2016 G&A expense to be roughly in line with 2015 levels. 
Our second quarter as-adjusted operating margin of 43.9% was down 100 basis points year-over-year, but up 230 basis points sequentially, primarily reflecting the marginal impact of changes in base and performance fees in the respective time periods, coupled with G&A expense discipline. As we've stated in the past, we do not manage the business to a specific margin target. We do remain keenly focused on delivering long-term value to our shareholders, and will continue working to strike an appropriate balance between organically investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. 
We remain committed to using our cash flow to optimize shareholder value by first reinvesting on our business and then returning excess cash to shareholders. In line with that commitment, in the second quarter, we closed the acquisition of BofA Global Capital Management, assuming investment management responsibilities for approximately $81 billion of related cash and liquidity AUM, and leveraging the scale of our cash management franchise. During the second quarter, we also repurchased an additional $275 million worth of shares. 
Second quarter long-term net inflows of $2 billion were driven by the diversity of our platform. Importantly, we saw strength in strategic focus areas, including fixed income ETFs, smart-beta and factor products and infrastructure offerings. Global iShares generated $16 billion of net new business in the second quarter, led by fixed income net inflows of $10 billion. We continue to see investor appetite for risk-aware, smart-beta products with our minimum volatility funds raising more than $6 billion during the quarter, and maintaining the #1 market share position in the product category. We also continue to see strong results in the Core Series, which is less sensitive to the macro environment, raising $12 billion in net flows during the quarter. 
Throughout the quarter, investors once again used iShares as their preferred vehicle to navigate market volatility and express rapidly changing investment views. Since the U.K.'s decision to exit the EU, we have seen particular strength in our European iShares range across asset classes, capturing over 70% market share over the past several weeks as clients leverage our industry-leading product breadth and liquidity. 
BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw $6 billion of long-term net outflows in another challenging quarter for the industry, as both domestic and cross-border fund flows suffered in light of political and macroeconomic events. The Global Retail market is changing dramatically. DoL, RDR and MiFID are impacting the way wealth managers are serving clients. Digital and technology offerings are proliferating and efficient beta products continue to take share from active products. While year-to-date industry domestic and cross-border active gross sales have slowed significantly due to macro uncertainty and continued alpha performance, we are confident that the breadth of our retail platform, including active and passive investment products, solutions and portfolio construction tools and digital and risk management capabilities collectively position BlackRock to be a market leader in this new environment. 
Our institutional business saw $8 billion of long-term net outflows, primarily due to active fixed income net outflows of $7 billion, driven largely by client reallocation activity. Despite volatility in EMEA, BlackRock continued to expand our presence with institutional clients in Continental Europe, generating $8 billion in net inflows during the quarter, and illustrating that while many clients are taking a wait-and-see approach, BlackRock remains the partner of choice when they are prepared to invest. 
In the United States, our Defined Contribution business generated net inflows of approximately $4 billion, driven by LifePath and other target-date inflows, and now accounts for over $650 billion of assets under management. Finally, we saw positive flows in institutional illiquid alternatives, driven by continued momentum in infrastructure. Illiquid alternatives remain a key area of growth for BlackRock, as institutional clients increasingly search for additional sources of income and uncorrelated returns. We now have more than $10 billion in committed but uninvested capital to deploy for clients. 
As we communicated at Investor Day, we are intensely focused on adapting ahead of change. While the current market environment is putting pressure on asset management companies and challenging historic business models, BlackRock has built the industry's broadest global product and distribution platform to meet the changing needs of our clients and drive long-term value for our shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. As Gary mentioned, our clients are facing unprecedented challenges as they attempt to navigate the current investment environment, which I'll describe in more detail in a moment.",1815,"Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. As Gary mentioned, our clients are facing unprecedented challenges as they attempt to navigate the current investment environment, which I'll describe in more detail in a moment. 
While this has caused many of our clients to pause their investment activity for the moment, this also led to more and deeper conversations with our clients than ever before. They are seeking our advice. They are looking for our investment solutions, and are wanting the risk analytics and technology that BlackRock can uniquely offer. We are better positioned -- I mean, we, BlackRock, are better positioned than we've ever been to deliver the solutions they need. 
Political and macroeconomic uncertainty, including Brexit; the upcoming elections in France and the United States; historically low yields and elevated market volatility; regulatory pressure, including the DoL, Solvency II, these factors and others are leading clients of all types to pause as they assess both their own needs and their investment options available for them. 
Our pension clients with 7%-plus return expectations are facing an ever-expanding liability gap. Our insurance clients with significant regulatory constraints cannot make their business models works in a 0-yield environment. Sovereign wealth funds have been forced to focus on liquidity and funding needs after years of rapid growth, and individual savers are wrestling with a choice of too much risk versus too little return as they face the prospects of their own underfunded retirement plan.
Where can clients turn to address these challenges? Today, there's $10 trillion of sovereign bonds that are delivering negative returns and negative yields. Yet, central banks continue to be buying, and global derisking continues to bid up fixed income prices. Active equity managers as a group have underperformed over a multiyear period, and are seeking record outflows -- or seeing record outflows. The blanket beta strategy that worked so well postcrisis has come to more volatility and divergence, and as Gary said, as many European and Asian equity indexes have fallen year-to-date, even as the S&P is at a record level. Today, as the environment asset managers are operating, this is the operating model that we're seeing and the environment we're seeing as an asset manager. Clients do not know what to do with their money. They are afraid and they are pulling back, as evidenced by more than $55 trillion in bank deposits sitting in the United States, China and Japan alone. And even as markets have rallied recently, many clients have missed that upside and find themselves feeling even further behind. In difficult times, our clients need BlackRock more than ever. We believe that asset managers must evolve in an anticipation of the fundamental shifts taking place in our industry, driven by technology, demographics, regulation, so that they are positioned to meet the clients' needs, and we, BlackRock, are doing that. 
As we highlight at our recent Investor Day, BlackRock is constantly adapting. The differentiating platform we have built at BlackRock over the past 28 years is resonating with our clients, and the diversity of product offerings, the risk capabilities of Aladdin, the market insights offered by the BlackRock Investment Institute. Our clients will need to put their money to work. I can't predict when and how much, but when they do, I have confidence that BlackRock has never been better positioned to capture those flows. 
Whether a client is looking for an illiquid alternative investment or an ETF or an unconstrained fixed income strategy or a smart beta or factor strategy or a multi-asset income product, we can deliver that solution and many others. But most important is our ability to fashion solutions from the combination of these strategies to meet the unique needs of our clients, all backed by our unmatched risk analytics and technology, and that is what's truly differentiating with BlackRock, and that is what is now resonating with our clients. As Gary mentioned, we saw $2 billion of long-term net inflows in the quarter. And over the last 12 months, we have seen $126 billion of long-term net inflows across our platform. These flows are well diversified, with $12 billion in active and $114 billion in index, including $96 billion from clients in the U.S., $30 billion from international clients. We saw $39 billion and $85 billion in equity and fixed income net inflows, respectively. And we continue to generate strong client commitments in our rapidly growing illiquid alternative business. 
Since quarter-end, after Brexit, we continue to see accelerated flows in our iShares franchise with approximately $18 billion of net inflows, thus far, in July, bringing our 2016 net inflows to more than $56 billion. iShares currently has the #1 share of global and European iShares -- ETFs and our fixed income ETF flows year-to-date. 
Let me talk about our fixed income flows. The fixed income iShares continued to be a substantial growth opportunity for BlackRock, and we saw more than $67 billion of net inflows over the past 12 months. If -- for some of you, you may remember, more than 5 years ago, some of our skeptics were still questioning the overall ETF growth story, and downplaying the fixed income opportunity. We were outspoken about our ability to innovate and to build this market. And today, with the fixed income ETF industry reaching $600 billion in total AUM, and our own franchises north of $300 billion, we are the proven leader in this space, and are focused on the continued penetration of the $100 trillion fixed income asset class. 
And just as we were doing 5 years ago, today, we're investing to develop the solutions that will meet our clients' needs in the future, including infrastructure, sustainable investing, big data, machine learning, factors and smart beta, and also critically in technology, from our Aladdin franchise to our presence in digital wealth management with FutureAdvisor. Monetary policy has driven yields to record low levels while failing to stimulate economic growth, and there's significant need for a global fiscal policy response. Infrastructure investing will be a critical component of that solution, creating jobs, driving growth, providing investors with long-term opportunities for yield. We are well positioned to participate in that activity. Following another strong quarter of capital raising, BlackRock now manages more than $8 billion in invested and committed capital across our infrastructure platform. Whether in alternatives or across our active platform, to continue to deliver alpha in the new market paradigm, you have to be connected. You need scale. You have to leverage technology, and of course, you have to be smart and nimble. 
BlackRock's Aladdin technology connects our global investor community on a common platform. The scale of our trading and liquidity platform enables us to access market liquidity that few firms can, and we further enhanced that scale through the Bank of America Global Capital Management acquisition in the quarter. Our data expertise allows us to turn large unstructured data sets into meaningful investment insights, and our risk and quantitative analysis teams provide independent oversight to help identify both risks and opportunities. The platform that we built is also a powerful means to recruit and retain industry's top talent. Most importantly, we announced that we hired Mark Wiseman to lead our unified active equity franchise. 
In the quarter, performance across our active platform remains stable or improved with 80% fixed income, 67% in Fundamental Equity, 82% in scientific active equity, above their benchmarks or peer median for the last 3-year period. 
We're making significant investments in big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning. And we saw more than $1 billion in scientific active equity inflows in the quarter. Factor-based investment strategies helps us bridge the gap between traditional, active and index, and further fill out our offerings as clients increasingly look to achieve access to broad persistent drivers of return through low-cost, efficient vehicles. 
During the quarter, our global iShares minimum volatility fund raised more than $6 billion, leading the ETF industry smart beta category, and BlackRock now manages more than $140 billion in AUM across a range of factor-based strategies. 
Technology has always been a core component of our value proposition and a significant differentiator for BlackRock. As the investment landscape evolves, technology is transitioning from a competitive advantage to a competitive requirement. Those who do not invest in technology will not be able to meet their clients' long-term needs. Technology remains a key area of focus and investment for BlackRock across all aspects of our business to enhance our investment process, to enhance our client service, to create operational efficiencies and our unifying BlackRock Aladdin technology platform. 
Aladdin revenues grew 13% year-over-year, and during the quarter, we saw one of the largest clients -- we signed one of the largest clients to date. We expect Aladdin to continue to grow as we enhance capabilities to meet clients' current and future needs and as we expand Aladdin to serve additional clients across the financial ecosystem. We are breaking down legacy systems to connect asset managers to asset servicers through Provider Aladdin, and providing wealth management organizations with institutional-quality risk oversight and analytics through our Aladdin for wealth platform. 
We also believe that the evolving technology and regulatory landscape, including the new DoL rule in the U.S., digital advice will play an integral role in increasing access and transparency for investors. And we continue to see strong client interest in our FutureAdvisor platform, as clients look to new and innovative wealth management solutions. 
Clients not only turn to BlackRock to manage their assets, but also to help them understand the larger term impact of global events. The BlackRock Investment Institute leads that discussion. To help clients understand the immediate results of the Brexit vote, BII hosted 2 client calls the morning after the vote with more than 10,000 participants worldwide. This level of engagement and participation is a testament to BlackRock's position in the industry, not only as an asset manager, but as a thought leader, and this allows us to be a greater trusted adviser. 
Going forward, we will continue to see changes. We'll see changes in markets, changes in technology, changes in demographics and regulation. This is all driving the changing needs of our clients. And we will continue to adapt our business to serve those needs in that ever-changing world. We are in a difficult environment for our clients and our industry, but challenging environments have always been when BlackRock has been able to make the biggest leaps forward. Today, many of our clients are apprehensive, and they're coming to us and asking us for advice. As I said, our client dialogues have never been better, and we have never been in a better position to serve our clients' needs. That is why I have never seen, in our 28-year history, more opportunity for BlackRock than I do today. 
Now let's open it up for questions."

I think everyone -- when you look at BlackRock and you look at all the products that you guys offer, and you've proven it over time in terms of the organic growth that you're able to generate. So this quarter, it's a bit surprising, but the backdrop has been anything but normal. But when you think about some of the comments that you made, and particularly on the institutional side in terms of flows, you look at all the cash on the sidelines, you look at where equity valuations are, where yields are, when you're talking to clients, is there a risk for the industry that we see a lot of money remaining on the sidelines for a period of time, just given the lack of opportunities? Or do you think that there's still enough, I don't know, conversations or drive to allocate some of this cash into other solutions that can still generate some attractive returns?"

That's certainly true. I think we're seeing an anomaly right now. We're seeing -- if you look at our ETF flows since Brexit, I would say the majority of those inflows are probably -- are institutional because, at the same time, I'm sure you're looking at the data, there's still outflows in mutual funds, which tells you, obviously, retail are still selling, but that divergence is quite stark and shocking to see that type of differential. The dialogues we're having with clients are, as I said, as robust as possible. Some clients are looking to put money to work, but the issue is some clients who have regulatory issues or capital issue, investing in bond yields at this time, I guess, is more difficult. Some of them are looking to invest in dividend stocks. And so I believe we're going to see more unlocking of money over the course of the next 12 months. I can't predict whether it's the third quarter, but I'm particularly surprised at the sheer volume of inflows in iShares in the first 14 days of the month, which is public, so I could talk about it. And the dialogue we're having in institutional, we've seen some good flows and awards in alternatives already this quarter. So it is not as -- I wouldn't call it to be as systematic and easy. It is more periodic and idiosyncratic, depending on the clients' needs. But this is a time for us to be in front of our clients more than ever before as they are questioning their asset allocation, where should they put money, how should they think about it. And so Michael, I can't predict one quarter over another, but what I can say, over a long period of time, there is huge pent-up demand and we -- I believe we will be more involved than ever before. I can't say that about the industry, though."

I said just that from the last question, we have been awarded some -- 1 or 2 mandates already this quarter in the alts space. I think, across the board, we're well positioned. It really depends on what category. You mentioned infrastructure. We have a huge emphasis on this. We are continuing to hire people there. We are in dialogue with many different parts of the world related to infrastructure investing. As we find those investments, it's very easy to find the capital. So as you know, we have about a $30 billion real asset platform, $15 billion in funded funds of private equity. We continue to see growth in private credit. We're well positioned in some of these products. Other products, we're not as well positioned as others. But importantly, I could say with absolute confidence, the positioning we have in the alts space with our clients has never been more robust. And obviously, we are not as -- in some of the platforms, we're not as strong because it was not one of our core competencies 15 years ago, and we've been building it. We did a -- we have an institutional client survey, and in that survey, we did determine that 53% of our clients are going to be reallocating more into alts and real asset. So I think that feeds what you just asked. And so we believe we're in a very good position for it. I would argue, though, some of the asset classes, the reason why they've done poorly in the alternative space is because there's so much money chasing so few investments."

So on a -- we kind of normalize for that. In terms of the institutional business for the quarter, we did see NNB before return of capital of about, let's call it, $825 million. Again, infrastructure, PEP and BAA that Larry mentioned. And we also did, institutionally, another $700 million of commitments in the quarter. Again, infrastructure opportunities to credit and BAA, I think, was critically important. Our total today is about $10 billion of uninvested but committed capital. As you know, we'll hit NNB as the assets go on the ground."

So clients continue to search for yield in a low-rate environment. And in the quarter, we saw significant equity market volatility. So fixed income has remained a critical component of most clients' portfolios. We continue to have very strong performance across our fixed income franchise with 80% of assets above the benchmark or peer median for the 3-year period. iShares had $10 billion of fixed income net inflows, and that was driven by strong flows into investment-grade corporates, broad U.S. or EM debt and TIPS. The fixed income ETF industry recently reached, by the way, $600 billion in total AUM, and that's doubled over the past 4 years, and our own franchise is north of $300 billion. And we see significant opportunity to increase the penetration of the $100 trillion global fixed income market. Now to drill deeper on -- just on July 7, to give you an idea, LQD, which is our corporate bond fund, took in $1.1 billion of net inflows, and that was a record daily inflow for a corporate bond ETF. So on the retail side, the fixed income business continues to be strong, and it's led by total return, and it's also led by our strategic municipal offering. We saw $2 billion of net inflows into retail active fixed income. And on the institutional side, the active fixed income net outflows of $7 billion were driven primarily by client reallocation activity in Asia Pac and in the U.S. And clients continue to come in and ask for presentations on strategic income opportunities, the reason being giving the portfolio manager more tools, more ability to find different types of fixed income securities with lower risk but higher returns in a low interest rate environment. So we believe that, that area of the market is going to continue to grow as well as from the iShares fixed income side."

We certainly don't know the end results of how liquidity is going to be addressed. The disclosures related to liquidity, we know in the proposed document that the SEC is looking at different buckets, how you analyze risk. They're going to set a limit to the illiquid bucket of 15%. Overall, we have been very supportive of these rules. And we believe there's a need for better disclosure related to the composition of all portfolios. As you know, we've been founded on a culture of understanding and managing the risk. And importantly, it is rules like the liquidity rule or even the DoL rule that is, I believe, some of the foundational reasons why we see accelerated interest in having a dialogue with us in a risk platform or risk technology of Aladdin. So I don't know much more than that, Bill, but we are a constructive participant in the dialogue with the SEC.

And as you heard, where we're making our investments, our investments are smart beta, which is a form of active. It's not -- we can call it tethered active, but it is a form of active. We're talking about using factors as an analysis, and our minimum volatility ETF is a great way of getting active, some form of active returns through an ETF platform. So I think it's technology using different instruments like ETFs, but more importantly, I think preferences are changing. So the old way of investing maybe just as a -- in categories of market capitalization is certainly going to be changing, and so I think it's more than just a preference out of active into passive. I'm a big believer that active will play a role in the future. So let's be clear about it. We believe, whether it is -- alternatives is an active product. We are a big believer that -- and in some categories, like in Asian equities and components of European equities and in some areas of the U.S. equity market, where active returns can and show out-performance over index. But I think what you're seeing also is a trend that iShares are taking some share away of people buying individual stocks. That's one thing that I think -- and maybe iShares is taking away from buying individual bonds. These are things that -- the dynamic that are changing. We are seeing more investors talk about asset allocation instead of individual stocks. And I think probably the most important element I want to just allude to, obviously, in the last 4 months, we've seen some really accelerated outflows, we, the industry, in active equities. I would not write it off over a long cycle, and I would just give you a better perspective on BlackRock. We had 8 quarters in a row of positive flows, and so I'm not -- I don't know if this is the beginning of a trend, but we all should pay attention. But I do believe it is the technology of ETFs, the simplicity of ETFs, the -- a quick, easy way of getting exposures is now driving more demand in those products, and we believe they will continue to drive demand. And as I said, we do believe the ETF business will double in size in the next 5 years."

So first thing is, is there -- do you have any better sense of how -- not so much in terms of more iShares demand, but maybe from a cost or expense perspective, how you think this may flow back into BlackRock and your peers? In particular, how does a distributor continue to demand kind of payment for access in a DoL world? And then maybe related to that, you did develop the Aladdin for wealth platform or adopt the Aladdin platform for the wealth market. Kind of curious for any update on how you're seeing the uptake on that or potential uptake on that platform in the wealth management market."

I -- we are having constant conversation with all our distribution partners. There are some partners who believe the DoL will be revolutionary for their business, and there are some of our distribution partners who believe it's evolutionary. It does mean change for the business, and I think we're very well positioned for those changes in the business. As I said in our first quarter results that, once again, if better understanding, better outcome for the ultimate investor, which leads to more investable assets out of cash, that's all good for the ecosystem of our distribution partners and really good for the asset management industry. Two, I think it's -- it most certainly -- as you raised the question related to Aladdin for wealth, most certainly, I think the DoL and the responsibilities under the DoL, it's going to mean a much tighter risk management oversight culture with all the clients. And we are having robust dialogue with everybody on the uptick -- uptake of Aladdin for wealth, and we'll see how that plays out. I don't have anything tangible yet to say, and -- but I will say we are in very deep dialogue, and I am very optimistic that there will be uptake for Aladdin for wealth. And I do believe, as I said, the DoL puts much more responsibility on the firm, on the financial adviser, to act in a fiduciary way. There's a big dialogue. As we know, the DoL is only about retirement assets. The big dialogue is, ""Does that force an upgrading of fiduciary standards for all the business?"" That could be debated among different people, and so I don't know what it means in outcome. I think the positive side -- so I'm taking this as a long-running positive for most distribution partners. I think they will have -- they have to obviously have much more oversight and understanding of their clients' assets as a fiduciary, but I do believe that they're going to have more centralization. I think they're going to have almost more like a European model, where you have CIOs who then -- who determine which mutual funds, what platform. And as you know, because we've talked about the European experience now for at least 8 years, and one of our strong positioning in Europe with that CIO model. I believe the DoL rule will move the U.S. more to a CIO model. Obviously, we know it's going to move, for those that are appropriate, more to an advisory model instead of a commission-based model. And for those clients that have that advisory relationship, it may build a deeper relationship between the client and the distribution partner and their adviser. And I believe, because of our scale, our positioning, we will be a huge beneficiary of that positioning."

You're seeing, as you suggested, a flattening of the yield curve. Actually, we don't believe -- I mean we've seen the 10-year go down to as low as, what, 1.35%. And we're 1.47% right now. In our last look, 1.46%. The 2-year note is still trading at 66 basis points or approximately around that area. If the U.S. goes down that path, reversing that increase, and indeed, the Federal Reserve needs to ease, that's a whole different issue. I don't see that as an outcome at this moment. It -- I believe the U.S. economy is growing not as well as we want it to be, but I think we will see a 2% economy this year, which would tell -- and we still have, plus or minus, a 5% unemployment rate in this country. So despite all the headwinds and uncertainties, I don't see, at this time, a Federal Reserve that turns itself into a central bank that has to aggressively ease. And so I -- it may delay their path towards normalizing of interest rates, but I don't see any possibility at this moment that they will be forced to going back into an easing mode. I think the actions of the Bank of England today is another good example. Marketplace anticipated easing. They suggested in their commentary that they're going to possibly ease in August. They're looking for more data. So if the U.K. growth rates does fall, like we at BlackRock anticipate, it doesn't mean it falls worldwide. It moves around. And I would tell you very clearly, the U.S. economy is still the area where people want to invest worldwide, and I don't see that -- I don't see the atmosphere where I have to worry about money market funds in the United States anytime soon. I think we're going to live in this environment of low rates for a long time, though."

So the private credit business is really one that is very customized and very specific to the institutional investor that is looking to find uncorrelated investments in the marketplace that you'd say are a little outside of the box. And we've put together a very, very strong team that has backgrounds in private equity, in venture capital, in credit, and using all the resources that we have. And you can imagine across BlackRock, there are so many resources and so many types of transactions that we see. We never really had a pocket of money to take advantage of those opportunities. So putting this group together, we have been able to source transactions from all across the globe for these institutional clients, that while they're a little outside of the box, the risk tolerance fits very perfectly. The return profile in most of these cases is double-digit returns, and they're not correlated at all with various parts of the market, to basically diversify their portfolios. So the other part of this, which is quite interesting, is that they come in very large sizes. So these institutions that are looking to invest here are north of $1 billion-type mandates. The struggle for many institutions in this is to get the money invested. We haven't had a problem in finding the opportunities. We just never really went after them. So this is an area that we continue to add resources to. We continue to use and coordinate within the firm to source assets for this. And we're very optimistic. And quite frankly, when we're sitting down with a lot of the large institutions, this is exactly what they're looking for. And I might add, one of the things that we're going to have Mark Wiseman, when he comes in, is also help us to source these assets because in his previous job, he is one of the guys that's in the forefront of the industry that has been able to source and find these type of investments outside of the box. So they are very customized, long term, very large mandates that require a significant team, significant resources, and we have it and we're very optimistic on this in the future."

It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2016. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. While our earnings re",1561,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2016. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. 
Our clients are facing significant challenges, driven by increased regulation, market volatility, record low interest rates and disruptive technology. And as a result, the asset management industry is changing rapidly. During these times, as we've done in the past, we reexamined our strategic priorities and evolved our business model with the goal of better serving the needs of our clients and optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible for our shareholders. 
Financial results for the third quarter of 2016 demonstrate the diversification and stability of our global investment and technology platform and our commitment to investing for the future. We executed on each of the 3 components of our framework for shareholder value creation this quarter: delivering organic growth, demonstrating operating leverage and systematically returning capital to our shareholders. Third quarter revenue of $2.8 billion was 3% lower than a year ago. However, on a constant-currency basis, we estimate that quarterly revenue was down approximately 1% year-over-year. Operating income of $1.2 billion declined 1% while earnings per share of $5.14 increased 3% versus the prior year quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $29 million of net investment gains, primarily attributable to net gains on unhedged or partially hedged multi-asset and fixed income seed investments. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 29.7%, reflecting the impact of several nonrecurring items. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable protected -- projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2016, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring items that could arise in the future. 
BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 5%. Flows were positive in our active and index franchises and across asset classes and regions, increasing the value of our broad-based, diversified business model. 
Third quarter base fees of $2.5 billion were up 4% year-over-year, driven primarily by organic growth, positive beta and higher securities lending revenue, which was positively impacted by widening asset spreads resulting from a rise in short-term interest rates. Sequentially, base fees were up 2%. 
While we continue to deliver strong organic growth, base fee growth has recently lagged growth in average assets under management as client risk appetite and portfolio construction decisions impact our business mix. In the current environment, client mix shift has favored index over active, fixed income and cash over equities and government funds over prime funds in the money market space. While mix change amongst and within asset classes will impact our blended fee rate over time, we remain confident that our diverse business model is capable of generating differentiated organic growth in a variety of market environments, and our scale enables us to prudently manage expense and defend our operating margin. 
Performance fees of $58 million declined 72% versus a year ago, driven by our single-strategy hedge fund platform. Recall that performance fees in last year's third quarter benefited from a single European hedge fund that has delivered exceptional full year performance. 
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $174 million increased 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Our Aladdin business, which represented 87% of BRS revenue in the quarter, up from 81% a year ago, grew 13% year-over-year, driven by new clients and several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform over the last year. Strong market demand for Aladdin continues from institutional asset managers as well as retail intermediaries, who are seeking sophisticated risk analytics and portfolio construction tools to better serve their wealth management clients in the current regulatory environment. 
Other revenue was down $16 million year-over-year, primarily related to lower transition management activity in the current quarter.  Total expense decreased 4% year-over-year and was flat sequentially, driven primarily by lower compensation expense. Employee compensation expense was down $56 million or 6% year-over-year, reflecting lower incentive compensation, primarily driven by lower performance fees versus a year ago. G&A expense decreased $7 million or 2% from a year ago and $4 million or 1% sequentially as we continue to exercise discipline over our discretionary spend in the current environment. At present, we anticipate fourth quarter G&A spend to be moderately lower than last year's normalized levels after adjusting for $23 million of quarterly deal-related costs incurred a year ago. 
Finally, distribution and servicing costs decreased 12% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, primarily related to the acquisition of BofA Global Capital Management in April of this year. 
Despite an overall decline in year-over-year revenues driven by a reduction in performance fees, we have delivered 3.5% organic growth over the last 12 months and expanded our as-adjusted operating margin versus a year ago, evidencing our continued commitment to strike an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. 
In line with that commitment, earlier this month, we reduced prices on 15 U.S. iShares core ETFs and several actively managed U.S. bond funds. We chose to use our scale and leadership position to invest on behalf of clients and financial advisers as they adapt to the DoL's new fiduciary rule. In isolation, these price reductions will result in an estimated $85 million annualized revenue reduction for BlackRock, representing less than 1% of our total base fees. However, over the mid to long term, we expect this investment to be accretive to organic growth and additive to overall shareholder value. 
During the third quarter, we continue to return excess cash to shareholders and repurchased an additional $275 million [ph] worth of BlackRock shares. 
BlackRock generated $70 billion of total net inflows in the third quarter, including $55 billion of long-term net inflows and $15 billion of cash management inflows. Cash management inflows demonstrate the breadth of our platform and strength of our client relationships in the lead-up to U.S. money market reform. Since the beginning of the year, our platform has experienced a remarkable shift from prime to government funds. BlackRock is now the second-largest 2a-7 money fund provider in the United States, and our diverse capabilities across SEP accounts, elective [ph] trusts and short-duration products position us well for continued future growth. 
Global iShares generated $51 billion of net inflows during the quarter, representing 18% annualized organic growth. Over the last 12 months, iShares has now generated over $140 billion in net inflows, representing 15% organic growth. iShares equity inflows of $26 billion for the quarter were driven by flows into U.S. and emerging markets as investors, once again, turn to iShares precision exposures as their preferred vehicle to re-risk following the Brexit vote. 
Importantly, our ETF product segmentation strategy, which tailors products to different client segments, continues to perform well. As an example, large institutional clients who value liquidity and often use derivative strategies drove $6 billion of quarterly flows into EEM, our flagship iShares emerging markets financial instrument. Longer-term investors, who may be retail or institutional, but are more price-sensitive added nearly $3 billion into IEMG, our iShares core emerging markets ETF. 
Quarterly iShares fixed income inflows of $23 billion reflect an ongoing adoption of ETFs as a means of rapidly accessing and investing in fixed income markets worldwide. Demand was particularly acute in investment-grade corporates and emerging markets as investors continue to search for sources of higher yield. 
Our institutional client platform saw $6 billion of long-term net inflows during the quarter, driven by active net inflows of $8 billion, as clients increasingly look to partner with BlackRock to build customized solutions or generate yield to meet their investment objectives. Inflows into multi-asset and solutions-oriented strategies, including our LifePath target-date series and active fixed income, were partially offset by outflows from Active Equity. 
In addition, we had another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising $1 billion in new commitments. Illiquid alternatives remain a key area of growth for BlackRock as our institutional clients increasingly search for additional sources of income and fund-correlated returns. 
BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw $2 billion of long-term net outflows, primarily due to outflows from equity and multi-asset funds in another challenging quarter for the active mutual fund industry. Outflows were concentrated in European and U.S. equities and world allocation strategies. 
Retail fixed income remained a pocket of strength with diversified flows across our top-performing platform, including strong flows into emerging markets, high yield, municipals and European and Asian fixed income. At September 30, 88% of BlackRock's taxable fixed income assets were at or above the benchmark or peer median for the trailing 5-year period. In particular, our flagship Total Return Fund continues to generate best-in-class performance and is performing in the top 5% of its peers for the trailing 3- and 5-year periods. 
Overall, our third quarter results reflect the benefits of the investments we've made to build a diversified global business model. Diversification across investment style, distribution channel, product and region enables us to deliver differentiated organic growth in a variety of market environments, while our scale allows us to make strategic investments which deliver value for our clients and shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. BlackRock's business model was built to thrive in all market environments, and clients continue to trust BlackRock in an environment characterized by macroeconomic and political uncertainties, slow global growth and persistent low rates. 
In the third quarter, even as industry-wide investor preferences continue to migrate from equities to fixed income and cash and away from active strategies, the diversity of our platform drove nearly $70 billion of total net inflows. Our $55 billion of long-term net inflows was positive across both active and index strategies and across every asset class and every region. We are seeing ongoing divergence in global monetary policy. While the U.S. signals a slow path to tightening, the U.K., Japan and other central banks continue with accommodative monetary policy, keeping yields at historical low levels and fueling widening asset liability gaps for both large institutions and also individual savers. As monetary policy reaches its limits in many regions, expansionary fiscal policy, particularly in the form of infrastructure investments, will be necessary to ignite economic growth. 
The lack of clarity around the outcomes of several upcoming political events, including the path forward on Brexit, elections in the U.S. and the constitutional referendum in Italy, is contributing to growing tail risk and investor caution. 
Despite underlying uncertainty, market volatility reached lows not seen since 1995. And equity markets rose in the quarter, posting record highs in the United States and the United Kingdom. 
Many clients are turning to BlackRock to help them understand the risk at the intersection of policy, markets and economics as governments' actions continue to drive our markets. Both institutional and retail clients are increasingly utilizing Aladdin risk management technology and portfolio construction tools as well as turning to BlackRock for our insights as a thought leader. 
In the third quarter, the BlackRock Investment Institute posted -- hosted a call on the potential impact in financial markets on [ph] the upcoming U.S. election, which had more than 1,000 participants. These differentiators, and combined with our global active and indexed investment platform that BlackRock has built over time, enables us to have a deeper and more meaningful conversation with our clients. And more than ever before, clients value BlackRock's diverse global business model. 
As Gary mentioned, BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, representing a 5% organic asset growth and 5% organic base fee growth. The composition of our flows this quarter is representative of global market conditions and investor sentiment. Across client segments, inflows were led by U.S. and emerging markets equities and debt as investors view the U.S. as a relatively safe haven, and emerging markets have gained momentum as commodity prices stabilized. Meanwhile, we saw outflows from European equities amid political and policy uncertainties, both from the continent and the United Kingdom. Institutional investors are slowly regaining confidence, and the third quarter was characterized by consistent, diverse client flows rather than any one concentrated activity. 
Our institutional business saw $8 billion of active net inflows in the quarter, driven by strong fixed income and multi-asset flows, primarily from defined contributions and insurance clients. Insurance clients face complex challenges as traditional asset allocation strategies are failing to support their business models. With expertise in understanding the specific needs of insurance clients, BlackRock's Financial Institution Group is putting the differentiated technology advantages on our Aladdin platform to work, constructing and delivering highly customized investment solutions, which incorporate both traditional and alternative asset classes across active and index strategies. 
Insurance companies are also increasingly employing fixed income ETFs in a broad range of applications. A recent study from British associates found that ETF demand from insurers is likely to increase. Of insurance in the study -- insurers [ph] in the study, 52% of these companies expect to increase their use of fixed income ETFs in the next year, and BlackRock is well positioned to work with large insurers as their investment strategies and techniques evolve. 
Active fixed income flows from retail investors remain strong in the quarter at $5 billion, driven by flows into high yield, emerging market debt and Asia fixed income, again reflecting investors moving out of the risk curve in search of income as they struggle with historical low rates. At the same time, retail investors continue to pull back from active equity investments, driven by a combination of challenging long-term performance track records and also accelerating regulatory changes. 
2016 U.S. active equity mutual funds has experienced more than $240 billion of year-to-date outflows, its worst year on record, with more than $110 billion of outflows in the third quarter alone. At the same time, we have seen strong flows from this client segment across our iShares equity ETFs, which I'll speak about in a moment. 
Regulatory change is having a material impact on the retail ecosystem. The Department of Labor fiduciary rule, RDR and MiFID are all impacting the way wealth managers serve their clients. We are likely to see a historical shift on how assets are being managed and invested as our distribution partners are changing both their product preferences and their use of technology to adapt to these rule changes. We have been working closely with our distribution partners in the U.S. in advance of the Department of Labor rule implementation. 
Aladdin for wealth, [ph] our technology and risk management system designed specifically for wealth managers, will be a key differentiator for BlackRock in helping our clients adapt as financial advisers sharpen their focus on the quality and cost efficiencies of funds. We also expect that they will use ETFs more and more at the center of their portfolios. Advisers are using ETFs alongside high-conviction active funds. And also, they're using ETFs as an active tool to manage their clients' assets. 
Throughout BlackRock's history, we have anticipated a series of changes in the ecosystem and have taken strategic actions to adapt. This included combining our active and index strategies on one platform through the BGI acquisition in 2009; continuously enhancing our Aladdin risk and investment management technology; launching the iShares Core Series in 2012, which exceeded our expectations by growing at an average organic asset growth rate at [ph] 24% since inception; and most recently, acquiring FutureAdvisor. Each of these strategic actions represented an investment to better serve our clients and to drive growth in our business. As our ecosystem evolves further, asset managers can no longer rely on beta to subsidize investment spending. 
BlackRock's diversified business and history of successful execution allows us to continue to invest when other firms may not be able to. Whether using our balance sheet to seed new products, streamlining the organization to reallocate investments to strategic initiatives, making tactical technology or product acquisitions or leveraging our scale to reprice products for our clients, we are committed to seeking out the most efficient ways to growing our business. 
Earlier this month, we made a strategic investment in our U.S. iShares Core ETFs, reducing prices to meet our clients' needs for high-quality, long-term holdings. In doing so, we are taking steps to be the leader in the Core segment by providing clients with the best quality and value of any ETF sponsor and making iShares a clear ETF choice for financial advisers building portfolios under the new fiduciary standard. 
We are maximizing the benefit of our scale to drive the maximum value of -- for our clients and our shareholders, and we expect to see increased organic asset and revenue growth in the iShares Core Series over time. We also expect this investment to drive growth across our broader range of iShares precision exposures, where clients place significant value on characteristics like liquidity and tax efficiency. And finally, we expect this investment to drive growth across our active business as we deepen our relationships with all our distribution partners. 
Our early results have been strong. Since the repricing action just last week, our U.S. core market share of net flows have grown by 25 points to 59%, and our iShares outside the core have also been logging strong flows. iShares saw $51 billion of net inflows in the third quarter and year-to-date, I'm speaking as of yesterday, close to $100 billion of inflows in 2016. Fixed income iShares, continues to be a substantial growth opportunity for BlackRock, and we achieved a significant milestone in the quarter by reaching $100 billion in our European fixed income ETF AUM. 
iShares is a world-leading ETF provider, holding the #1 share of U.S., European and global equity and fixed income ETF flows year-to-date. Going forward, in a lower bid environment, alpha generation has the opportunity to drive greater percentage of overall investor returns. 
BlackRock saw positive active net inflows of $4 billion in the third quarter. Active flows were driven by our leading global fixed income platform, where we have scale, product diversity and strong long-term performance, with 88% of our assets above benchmark or peer medium for the 5-year period. The combination of active and index strategies will continue to play an important role in our clients' portfolio. And BlackRock has all the components, unlike our peers, as well as portfolio construction capabilities, risk technology and better portfolios. 
I've emphasized the importance of technology many times today. Technology is an essential component of adapting to our regulatory changes and more broadly, a changing investor landscape. As advisers take on greater portfolio construction responsibilities in a fee-based account, they are increasingly using BlackRock Solutions' sophisticated tools and risk analytics to build better portfolios. And as a result, we are seeing strong interest for our Aladdin for wealth, [ph] our iRetire platform and our FutureAdvisor offerings. Institutional clients facing persistent low rates and searching for yield require a deeper look into their entire portfolio, and BlackRock's technology can help them see clear and allocate more effectively. Aladdin continues to build momentum with institutional clients, and revenues grew over 13% year-over-year. We are committed to constantly innovating on our existing platform as well as thinking of new ways that we can serve our clients' needs with technology. This remains a key differentiator for BlackRock relative to any other firm in the asset management industry. 
In a time of significant change for the asset management industry, I believe BlackRock is better positioned than in any time in our history, and we've never had more opportunity working with the clients than we do today. We are at a pivotal point with uncertainty in politics, regulation in [ph] market likely to play out over the coming months. Our clients are apprehensive, but they are coming to BlackRock for advice, and our priorities remain helping them to meet their investment goals in all environments. We have a unique ability to use our scale, our breadth of active and index products, our global reach and our portfolio construction, our risk management expertise and technology advantages to meet our clients' needs, their evolving needs to drive their future growth and our future growth as a firm and future growth for our shareholders.

So maybe a little bit more color from the perspective of what kind of changes are you anticipating. Obviously, we saw the announcement from Merrill and Edward Jones a couple of months ago.

We witnessed the changes from Merrill Lynch and Edward Jones. It is very clear, though, that the fiduciary rule is changing how our distribution partners manage their clients' accounts, as you suggested. And [ph] stated by these public announcements, it's moving more to a fee-based relationship, less commission-based relationship. We also believe it's going to move more to model-based relationships, too, where you're going to see the CIO offices at the various distribution platforms coming up with asset allocation strategies. We certainly believe that in the DoL rules, it's going to mean fees are going to be very important, and that's obviously one thing we can say with certainty. We don't know how that's going to play out. But we do believe, as it moves more towards managed portfolios, utilizing more the centralization of models and corporate -- and asset allocation, it's going to move quite a bit of money more towards passive strategies, utilization of ETFs. We do believe it'll systematically move assets away from active, and so we're trying to get prepared. The one thing we can say with certainty in our conversations, though, it leads to greater need of risk management tools. This is one of the reasons why we have adapted Aladdin, which, historically, was an enterprise system for large institutional investment organizations. Where we [ph] now -- have now adopted for Aladdin for wealth that we could go down to individual accounts and allowing the adviser and the organization to look at every relationship they have through the lens of risk management. And we believe, under the DoL rules, having that oversight is going to be imperative. And this is one of the reasons why we developed this technology. We're in dialogues with many, many distribution partners already related to Aladdin for Wealth. [ph] We have signed up one institution already for Aladdin for Wealth. [ph] And we're in dialogue with many more utilizing the Aladdin system for the navigation of their clients' investment strategies. So we look at this as a huge opportunity for us. We're in great position to navigate. I should add I don't think any other organization has those capabilities, and so it puts us in a great position. By having that position, it allows us to have more dialogue, not just more dialogue for passive strategies, but more dialogue in portfolio construction and models and active strategies. So having this opportunity to be working with these institutions, on the navigation of risk management on behalf of all their individual clients, gives us -- will give us a unique opportunity to be working with these institutions in a way that we never had been able to before."

I'm of the view that the changes are going to be more rapid. I think most of my team believe this change is going to be more evolutionary. And so I think there is -- there's even a debate here at BlackRock related to how these changes are going to be, but I do believe the legal responsibilities of each firm has under the DoL is going to probably move towards these changes. But let me be clear. These are not our decisions. These are our distribution partners' decisions. Each firm has to do whatever is the right strategy for them under the new rules, the new laws on behalf of their clients. And I'm sure they're all going to be working on behalf of their clients. I'm not trying to suggest they're focusing on their own specific needs. What we're trying to do with our scale and our platform and the ability to have a dialogue using our active and passive strategy, but more importantly, introducing Aladdin for Wealth, we're helping our distribution platforms to focus on what should they be doing towards their implementation in the new DoL rule. I do believe one thing will be -- is going to be constant, though. The need for more this tools is going to be imperative to making sure that there's better oversight to protecting the firm, making sure they're living under the new DoL world. I do believe you're going to see us, as you saw from Merrill Lynch, Edward med managed accounts. But the key questions you asked, Brian, in the composition of the managed account, how will those portfolio allocations be? Quite frankly, we've heard a whole array of that. I do believe, over a cycle, it's going to be a much greater utilization of passive strategies in ETFs than active strategies. And I think that is where it's going. So we believe, because of our positioning of Aladdin for Wealth and because of our ability to work with our distribution platforms and utilization of beta and active strategies, we're in a very good position. That's how we're trying to position. Let me be clear. That's not our decision. We're responding to the ecosystem changes of our distribution partners. And we're trying to be additive. We have to be a partner with them. And what I can say is, at this time, we're in extensive dialogues with these institutions in terms of how they navigate it, and we believe we'll be able to play a role in their ultimate outcomes."

I think this has been underreported, but $1 trillion of money has moved from prime funds to government funds. This is an incredible amount of money by one government change. This is one of the great examples where government actions can truly change an ecosystem. And so we saw this huge movement out of prime funds to government funds. We were very well positioned to accommodate our clients on that. We saw about $60 billion in our own prime funds going into government funds, but the key thing for us was we actually picked up a little more than 1% market share in these events, and we had $15 billion in net inflows. We look at the money market fund industry as a great business. Obviously, we are earning lower fees in government funds than we did in the prime funds. And I think that's obviously a circumstance that everybody will be facing. But I do believe, as clients feel more comfortable, and as they navigate with their risk committees the whole idea of ""What is a prime fund?"" I think you will see money eventually move back into prime, not the same -- not the whole $1 trillion, but I think as clients understand what prime funds are and that they can pick up more return with quite a bit less risk than they ever would have had in a prime fund, because prime funds rules have changed quite considerably, too, how we report our NAV, how we report our positioning -- our position. So they're far less risky than they were in the 2000 to 2007 and '08 environment. So I do believe it's going to take some time as clients become a little bit more circumspect about the difference of the 2 funds. In many cases, they're going to have to go to their risk committees to get a change because the fact that there is no certainty about a dollar NAV, some clients just can't do it unless they changed their rules. We are working with many clients right now on that, helping clients understand the trade-offs, but the knee-jerk reaction was very clear. People did not have time to focus on how to work with risk committee in terms of getting these changes. But I do believe, over time, clients will do that. We are working -- once again, this is one of the great characteristics of BlackRock. We have worked with our clients in helping them assess those types risks and the opportunities. But clearly, from our opinion, when you start seeing changes in central bank behavior, when you start seeing widening credit spreads, the advantage of a prime fund versus a government fund may be quite large enough, which will accelerate more people seeking the differences and getting the changes from their boards, risk committee boards, and being able to invest their liquidity in a prime fund even without the constant dollar NAV."

And so is there a growth ratio in the AUM in between that iShares business and the Active Equity business that we could think about that represents a DMZ or breakeven line? Because I'm sure it's not just about revenue growth. It seems more complicated than that."

I mean, we've literally spent the last 5 of the first 6 questions around change that's basically drive -- being driven by regulatory change and a whole host of other things in terms of the current environment. And I think that we look at the business in its totality more broadly. We're not really looking at a product-by-product analysis and a breakeven on a product-by-product analysis. It's really about the diversification and the breadth of the entire platform and how all of the products fit together at the end of the day into a set of solutions for the clients. We're constantly making decisions in the best interest of the clients, and we're trying to basically bring forth the benefits of the platform, whether its breadth, its globality or its scale, to basically drive better outcomes for clients. And at the end of the day, better outcomes for our shareholders. So while we're mindful when we talk about theoretical breakevens, which, look, you can calculate those as well, you know what the change in the fees are and can basically do the math to see how quickly we can capture the incremental revenue. It's really more -- much more importantly about balancing everything that the firm has to offer, a top 10 manager in active, a top 10 manager in passive, a top 10 manager in [indiscernible] all wrapped up with the differentiation of Aladdin and the technology platform, really driving much more comprehensive set of solutions ultimately for the clients and to leverage the scale, not only in behalf of those clients, but also on behalf of our shareholders at the end of the day."

Obviously, factors, smart beta, in terms of our style advantage products and the like are also getting a lot of seed capital. We really want to try and leverage again back to scale and stability.

The regulatory changes have enhanced clients' willingness to invest where we are a big beneficiary of it. So we've been in a very big supporter of the rule, enhances investor protection. We had circumstances earlier in the past few years related to liquidity and the impact of some the mutual funds where they had to be frozen. Obviously, it hurts the whole industry. It raises questions of uncertainty. So the SEC tried to find a solution. I think they found a pretty good solution under the circumstances. I also do believe we welcome the SEC's role in this. We think the SEC needs to play a larger role in helping ensure the sanctity of the capital markets as more and more money moves to capital markets, the need for safety in the capital markets only has increased. So we work very close with all the regulators in Europe related to MiFID and MiFID II, and we work very closely -- mainly we stated, we provided, and letters -- I can't -- we work closely -- probably that's the wrong way of putting it, but we provided our input in helping the regulatory agencies to come up with this solution. We believe MiFID II liquidity rules of the SEC, as I said earlier, is going to lead for greater needs for risk management tools. And clearly, if we have rules like liquidity rule, as I said, increases the need for risk management, which is pointing up to BlackRock's strength. We built this organization technology with all these things in mind, making sure that we focus on the protection of our clients. I don't think it changes that much in terms of investment management behaviors in terms of how we invest. We have never been on the edge of investing in illiquid products in our 40 products or use products. And so it doesn't change our behaviors at BlackRock at all. It may change some investors' behaviors. Obviously, some of who were emphasizing very illiquid buckets in their platform. But both -- we're MiFID II is going, where the liquidity risk rules are going with the SEC, these are just a work in progress. I believe we are going to see more and more regulatory oversight of our capital markets, ensuring that we have the proper safeguards for investors to invest. And then that's critical. I can't say enough about the need to making sure we have the proper safeguards. If we have the proper safeguards, all of the money that Rob Kapito was talking about sitting in the sidelines would be implemented. I don't believe that people are sitting there because they're just worried about the next event. A lot of people just don't feel like investing has been that fair to them. And by putting these rules in place, it allows more retail investors to feel that they are protected. They have more safety. And through that safety, they probably have a little bit more security, which probably will lead to greater investing into the capital markets. And we'll all be benefited by it. The -- but the details related to the SEC liquidity rules, obviously, it's a 1,000-page rule. It's going to take our lawyers and every lawyers a long time to make sure we understand of all the intricacies of how we're going to implement it and how we're going to manage it. It is very clear, and I predict it means a lot of risk management needs, making sure you're can live under these new liquidity rules day to day and abide by them. So it requires greater risk tools, which we have. Even about a year ago, we added a lot of liquidity components to the Aladdin risk models to helping our portfolio managers navigate this. And then in terms of MiFID II, this is going to take time working with her European regulators. This is scheduled for 2018. So we do have some time before it's implemented. And hopefully, we'll have better clarity on making sure that we're living under these new rules. So as I think I've said earlier, all of this will be for the asset management history greater need for reliance on the risk tools, which will lead some of the asset managers a greater expenses to build those tools. I think I'm losing my voice now. So I'll end it there."

And I think BlackRock has that platform of scale, diversity products and global nature. I would say probably the biggest theme that I can think about in terms of the third quarter was, we're seeing an impact on the strategic investments we made in our platform over the last few years. I think it is because of those investments we made, the investments we made from BGI acquisition, the investments we made in the Core Series in 2012, the investments we made in our infrastructure products, our ESG products, our investments now in big data and factors, our investment now in technology related to Aladdin, Aladdin for Wealth, our investment in FutureAdvisor, I believe it all speaks loudly that we are staying ahead of the needs of our clients, trying to anticipate the needs. And I do believe we -- the third quarter, when you think about how we handle this adversity of the markets, that we've been able to position ourselves quite well in this environment. I could certainly say again these investments we made and the investments we're going to continue to make, it is allowing us to have a deeper, broader relationship with our clients in retail and a deeper and broader relationships with the client institutionally. We need to continue to stay ahead of our clients' needs, or we're not going to provide the service to our clients. So that's the paranoia that BlackRock possesses, staying in front of our clients' needs and trying to respond to our clients needs. And I think that is the key characteristic and the key differentiator that has positioned BlackRock so well in the past and why think it's going to be a key characteristic why we're so well positioned for the future.

It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2016. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. While our earnings re",1559,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2016. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. 
Our clients are facing significant challenges, driven by increased regulation, market volatility, record low interest rates and disruptive technology. And as a result, the asset management industry is changing rapidly. During these times, as we've done in the past, we reexamined our strategic priorities and evolved our business model with the goal of better serving the needs of our clients and optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible for our shareholders. 
Financial results for the third quarter of 2016 demonstrate the diversification and stability of our global investment and technology platform and our commitment to investing for the future. We executed on each of the 3 components of our framework for shareholder value creation this quarter: delivering organic growth, demonstrating operating leverage and systematically returning capital to our shareholders. Third quarter revenue of $2.8 billion was 3% lower than a year ago. However, on a constant-currency basis, we estimate that quarterly revenue was down approximately 1% year-over-year. Operating income of $1.2 billion declined 1% while earnings per share of $5.14 increased 3% versus the prior year quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $29 million of net investment gains, primarily attributable to net gains on unhedged or partially hedged multi-asset and fixed income seed investments. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 29.7%, reflecting the impact of several nonrecurring items. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable protected -- projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2016, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring items that could arise in the future. 
BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 5%. Flows were positive in our active and index franchises and across asset classes and regions, increasing the value of our broad-based, diversified business model. 
Third quarter base fees of $2.5 billion were up 4% year-over-year, driven primarily by organic growth, positive beta and higher securities lending revenue, which was positively impacted by widening asset spreads resulting from a rise in short-term interest rates. Sequentially, base fees were up 2%. 
While we continue to deliver strong organic growth, base fee growth has recently lagged growth in average assets under management as client risk appetite and portfolio construction decisions impact our business mix. In the current environment, client mix shift has favored index over active, fixed income and cash over equities and government funds over prime funds in the money market space. While mix change amongst and within asset classes will impact our blended fee rate over time, we remain confident that our diverse business model is capable of generating differentiated organic growth in a variety of market environments, and our scale enables us to prudently manage expense and defend our operating margin. 
Performance fees of $58 million declined 72% versus a year ago, driven by our single-strategy hedge fund platform. Recall that performance fees in last year's third quarter benefited from a single European hedge fund that has delivered exceptional full year performance. 
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $174 million increased 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Our Aladdin business, which represented 87% of BRS revenue in the quarter, up from 81% a year ago, grew 13% year-over-year, driven by new clients and several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform over the last year. Strong market demand for Aladdin continues from institutional asset managers as well as retail intermediaries, who are seeking sophisticated risk analytics and portfolio construction tools to better serve their wealth management clients in the current regulatory environment. 
Other revenue was down $16 million year-over-year, primarily related to lower transition management activity in the current quarter. Total expense decreased 4% year-over-year and was flat sequentially, driven primarily by lower compensation expense. Employee compensation expense was down $56 million or 6% year-over-year, reflecting lower incentive compensation, primarily driven by lower performance fees versus a year ago. G&A expense decreased $7 million or 2% from a year ago and $4 million or 1% sequentially as we continue to exercise discipline over our discretionary spend in the current environment. At present, we anticipate fourth quarter G&A spend to be moderately lower than last year's normalized levels after adjusting for $23 million of quarterly deal-related costs incurred a year ago. 
Finally, distribution and servicing costs decreased 12% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, primarily related to the acquisition of BofA Global Capital Management in April of this year. 
Despite an overall decline in year-over-year revenues driven by a reduction in performance fees, we have delivered 3.5% organic growth over the last 12 months and expanded our as-adjusted operating margin versus a year ago, evidencing our continued commitment to strike an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. 
In line with that commitment, earlier this month, we reduced prices on 15 U.S. iShares core ETFs and several actively managed U.S. bond funds. We chose to use our scale and leadership position to invest on behalf of clients and financial advisers as they adapt to the DoL's new fiduciary rule. In isolation, these price reductions will result in an estimated $85 million annualized revenue reduction for BlackRock, representing less than 1% of our total base fees. However, over the mid to long term, we expect this investment to be accretive to organic growth and additive to overall shareholder value. 
During the third quarter, we continue to return excess cash to shareholders and repurchased an additional $275 million worth of BlackRock shares. 
BlackRock generated $70 billion of total net inflows in the third quarter, including $55 billion of long-term net inflows and $15 billion of cash management inflows. Cash management inflows demonstrate the breadth of our platform and strength of our client relationships in the lead-up to U.S. money market reform. Since the beginning of the year, our platform has experienced a remarkable shift from prime to government funds. BlackRock is now the second-largest 2a-7 money fund provider in the United States, and our diverse capabilities across SEP accounts, elective trusts and short-duration products position us well for continued future growth. 
Global iShares generated $51 billion of net inflows during the quarter, representing 18% annualized organic growth. Over the last 12 months, iShares has now generated over $140 billion in net inflows, representing 15% organic growth. iShares equity inflows of $26 billion for the quarter were driven by flows into U.S. and emerging markets as investors, once again, turn to iShares precision exposures as their preferred vehicle to re-risk following the Brexit vote. 
Importantly, our ETF product segmentation strategy, which tailors products to different client segments, continues to perform well. As an example, large institutional clients who value liquidity and often use derivative strategies drove $6 billion of quarterly flows into EEM, our flagship iShares emerging markets financial instrument. Longer-term investors, who may be retail or institutional, but are more price-sensitive added nearly $3 billion into IEMG, our iShares core emerging markets ETF. 
Quarterly iShares fixed income inflows of $23 billion reflect an ongoing adoption of ETFs as a means of rapidly accessing and investing in fixed income markets worldwide. Demand was particularly acute in investment-grade corporates and emerging markets as investors continue to search for sources of higher yield. 
Our institutional client platform saw $6 billion of long-term net inflows during the quarter, driven by active net inflows of $8 billion, as clients increasingly look to partner with BlackRock to build customized solutions or generate yield to meet their investment objectives. Inflows into multi-asset and solutions-oriented strategies, including our LifePath target-date series and active fixed income, were partially offset by outflows from Active Equity. 
In addition, we had another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising $1 billion in new commitments. Illiquid alternatives remain a key area of growth for BlackRock as our institutional clients increasingly search for additional sources of income and fund-correlated returns. 
BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw $2 billion of long-term net outflows, primarily due to outflows from equity and multi-asset funds in another challenging quarter for the active mutual fund industry. Outflows were concentrated in European and U.S. equities and world allocation strategies. 
Retail fixed income remained a pocket of strength with diversified flows across our top-performing platform, including strong flows into emerging markets, high yield, municipals and European and Asian fixed income. At September 30, 88% of BlackRock's taxable fixed income assets were at or above the benchmark or peer median for the trailing 5-year period. In particular, our flagship Total Return Fund continues to generate best-in-class performance and is performing in the top 5% of its peers for the trailing 3- and 5-year periods. 
Overall, our third quarter results reflect the benefits of the investments we've made to build a diversified global business model. Diversification across investment style, distribution channel, product and region enables us to deliver differentiated organic growth in a variety of market environments, while our scale allows us to make strategic investments which deliver value for our clients and shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. BlackRock's business model was built to thrive in all market environments, and clients continue to trust BlackRock in an environment characterized by macroeconomic and political uncertainties, slow global growth and persistent low rates. 
In the third quarter, even as industry-wide investor preferences continue to migrate from equities to fixed income and cash and away from active strategies, the diversity of our platform drove nearly $70 billion of total net inflows. Our $55 billion of long-term net inflows was positive across both active and index strategies and across every asset class and every region. We are seeing ongoing divergence in global monetary policy. While the U.S. signals a slow path to tightening, the U.K., Japan and other central banks continue with accommodative monetary policy, keeping yields at historical low levels and fueling widening asset liability gaps for both large institutions and also individual savers. As monetary policy reaches its limits in many regions, expansionary fiscal policy, particularly in the form of infrastructure investments, will be necessary to ignite economic growth. 
The lack of clarity around the outcomes of several upcoming political events, including the path forward on Brexit, elections in the U.S. and the constitutional referendum in Italy, is contributing to growing tail risk and investor caution. 
Despite underlying uncertainty, market volatility reached lows not seen since 1995. And equity markets rose in the quarter, posting record highs in the United States and the United Kingdom. 
Many clients are turning to BlackRock to help them understand the risk at the intersection of policy, markets and economics as governments' actions continue to drive our markets. Both institutional and retail clients are increasingly utilizing Aladdin risk management technology and portfolio construction tools as well as turning to BlackRock for our insights as a thought leader. 
In the third quarter, the BlackRock Investment Institute posted -- hosted a call on the potential impact in financial markets of the upcoming U.S. election, which had more than 1,000 participants. These differentiators, and combined with our global active and indexed investment platform that BlackRock has built over time, enables us to have a deeper and more meaningful conversation with our clients. And more than ever before, clients value BlackRock's diverse global business model. 
As Gary mentioned, BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, representing a 5% organic asset growth and 5% organic base fee growth. The composition of our flows this quarter is representative of global market conditions and investor sentiment. Across client segments, inflows were led by U.S. and emerging markets equities and debt as investors view the U.S. as a relatively safe haven, and emerging markets have gained momentum as commodity prices stabilized. Meanwhile, we saw outflows from European equities amid political and policy uncertainties, both from the continent and the United Kingdom. Institutional investors are slowly regaining confidence, and the third quarter was characterized by consistent, diverse client flows rather than any one concentrated activity. 
Our institutional business saw $8 billion of active net inflows in the quarter, driven by strong fixed income and multi-asset flows, primarily from defined contributions and insurance clients. Insurance clients face complex challenges as traditional asset allocation strategies are failing to support their business models. With expertise in understanding the specific needs of insurance clients, BlackRock's Financial Institution Group is putting the differentiated technology advantages on our Aladdin platform to work, constructing and delivering highly customized investment solutions, which incorporate both traditional and alternative asset classes across active and index strategies. 
Insurance companies are also increasingly employing fixed income ETFs in a broad range of applications. A recent study from British associates found that ETF demand from insurers is likely to increase. Of Insurance -- in the study, insurers in the study, 52% of these companies expect to increase their use of fixed income ETFs in the next year, and BlackRock is well positioned to work with large insurers as their investment strategies and techniques evolve. 
Active fixed income flows from retail investors remain strong in the quarter at $5 billion, driven by flows into high yield, emerging market debt and Asia fixed income, again reflecting investors moving out of the risk curve in search of income as they struggle with historical low rates. At the same time, retail investors continue to pull back from active equity investments, driven by a combination of challenging long-term performance track records and also accelerating regulatory changes. 
2016 U.S. active equity mutual funds has experienced more than $240 billion of year-to-date outflows, its worst year on record, with more than $110 billion of outflows in the third quarter alone. At the same time, we have seen strong flows from this client segment across our iShares equity ETFs, which I'll speak about in a moment. 
Regulatory change is having a material impact on the retail ecosystem. The Department of Labor fiduciary rule, RDR and MiFID are all impacting the way wealth managers serve their clients. We are likely to see a historical shift on how assets are being managed and invested as our distribution partners are changing both their product preferences and their use of technology to adapt to these rule changes. We have been working closely with our distribution partners in the U.S. in advance of the Department of Labor rule implementation. 
Aladdin for wealth, our technology and risk management system designed specifically for wealth managers, will be a key differentiator for BlackRock in helping our clients adapt as financial advisers sharpen their focus on the quality and cost efficiencies of funds. We also expect that they will use ETFs more and more at the center of their portfolios. Advisers are using ETFs alongside high-conviction active funds. And also, they're using ETFs as an active tool to manage their clients' assets. 
Throughout BlackRock's history, we have anticipated a series of changes in the ecosystem and have taken strategic actions to adapt. This included combining our active and index strategies on one platform through the BGI acquisition in 2009; continuously enhancing our Aladdin risk and investment management technology; launching the iShares Core Series in 2012, which exceeded our expectations by growing at an average organic asset growth rate at 24% since inception; and most recently, acquiring FutureAdvisor. Each of these strategic actions represented an investment to better serve our clients and to drive growth in our business. As our ecosystem evolves further, asset managers can no longer rely on beta to subsidize investment spending. 
BlackRock's diversified business and history of successful execution allows us to continue to invest when other firms may not be able to. Whether using our balance sheet to seed new products, streamlining the organization to reallocate investments to strategic initiatives, making tactical technology or product acquisitions or leveraging our scale to reprice products for our clients, we are committed to seeking out the most efficient ways to growing our business. 
Earlier this month, we made a strategic investment in our U.S. iShares core ETFs, reducing prices to meet our clients' needs for high-quality, long-term holdings. In doing so, we are taking steps to be the leader in the core segment by providing clients with the best quality and value of any ETF sponsor and making iShares a clear ETF choice for financial advisers building portfolios under the new fiduciary standard. 
We are maximizing the benefit of our scale to drive the maximum value of -- for our clients and our shareholders, and we expect to see increased organic asset and revenue growth in the iShares Core Series over time. We also expect this investment to drive growth across our broader range of iShares precision exposures, where clients place significant value on characteristics like liquidity and tax efficiency. And finally, we expect this investment to drive growth across our active business as we deepen our relationships with all our distribution partners. 
Our early results have been strong. Since the repricing action just last week, our U.S. core market share of net flows have grown by 25 points to 59%, and our iShares outside the core have also been logging strong flows. iShares saw $51 billion of net inflows in the third quarter and year-to-date, I'm speaking as of yesterday, close to $100 billion of inflows in 2016. Fixed income iShares, continues to be a substantial growth opportunity for BlackRock, and we achieved a significant milestone in the quarter by reaching $100 billion in our European fixed income ETF AUM. 
iShares is a world-leading ETF provider, holding the #1 share of U.S., European and global equity and fixed income ETF flows year-to-date. Going forward, in a lower bid environment, alpha generation has the opportunity to drive greater percentage of overall investor returns. 
BlackRock saw positive active net inflows of $4 billion in the third quarter. Active flows were driven by our leading global fixed income platform, where we have scale, product diversity and strong long-term performance, with 88% of our assets above benchmark or peer medium for the 5-year period. The combination of active and index strategies will continue to play an important role in our clients' portfolio. And BlackRock has all the components, unlike our peers, as well as portfolio construction capabilities, risk technology and better portfolios. 
I've emphasized the importance of technology many times today. Technology is an essential component of adapting to our regulatory changes and more broadly, a changing investor landscape. As advisers take on greater portfolio construction responsibilities in a fee-based account, they are increasingly using BlackRock Solutions' sophisticated tools and risk analytics to build better portfolios. And as a result, we are seeing strong interest for our Aladdin for wealth, our iRetire platform and our FutureAdvisor offerings. Institutional clients facing persistent low rates and searching for yield require a deeper look into their entire portfolio, and BlackRock's technology can help them see clear and allocate more effectively. Aladdin continues to build momentum with institutional clients, and revenues grew over 13% year-over-year. We are committed to constantly innovating on our existing platform as well as thinking of new ways that we can serve our clients' needs with technology. This remains a key differentiator for BlackRock relative to any other firm in the asset management industry. 
In a time of significant change for the asset management industry, I believe BlackRock is better positioned than in any time in our history, and we've never had more opportunity working with the clients than we do today. We are at a pivotal point with uncertainty in politics, regulation in market likely to play out over the coming months. Our clients are apprehensive, but they are coming to BlackRock for advice, and our priorities remain helping them to meet their investment goals in all environments. We have a unique ability to use our scale, our breadth of active and index products, our global reach and our portfolio construction, our risk management expertise and technology advantages to meet our clients' needs, their evolving needs to drive their future growth and our future growth as a firm and future growth for our shareholders.

It's been a couple of quarters, and I guess, the distribution networks and the platforms had a chance to kind of digest the rules. And Larry, you alluded to you guys are working closely with your distribution partners on helping them adapt to the changes. So maybe a little bit more color from the perspective of what kind of changes are you anticipating. Obviously, we saw the announcement from Merrill and Edward Jones a couple of months ago. But more specifically, I guess, with respect to number of products, fee structures and any more granularity, I think, will be very helpful."

We witnessed the changes from Merrill Lynch and Edward Jones. It is very clear, though, that the fiduciary rule is changing how our distribution partners manage their clients' accounts, as you suggested. And as stated by these public announcements, it's moving more to a fee-based relationship, less commission-based relationship. We also believe it's going to move more to model-based relationships, too, where you're going to see the CIO offices at the various distribution platforms coming up with asset allocation strategies. We certainly believe that in the DoL rules, it's going to mean fees are going to be very important, and that's obviously one thing we can say with certainty. We don't know how that's going to play out. But we do believe, as it moves more towards managed portfolios, utilizing more the centralization of models and corporate -- and asset allocation, it's going to move quite a bit of money more towards passive strategies, utilization of ETFs. We do believe it'll systematically move assets away from active, and so we're trying to get prepared. The one thing we can say with certainty in our conversations, though, it leads to greater need of risk management tools. This is one of the reasons why we have adapted Aladdin, which, historically, was an enterprise system for large institutional investment organizations. Where we now -- have now adapted for Aladdin for wealth that we could go down to individual accounts and allowing the adviser and the organization to look at every relationship they have through the lens of risk management. And we believe, under the DoL rules, having that oversight is going to be imperative. And this is one of the reasons why we developed this technology. We're in dialogues with many, many distribution partners already related to Aladdin for wealth. We have signed up one institution already for Aladdin for wealth. And we're in dialogue with many more, utilizing the Aladdin system for the navigation of their clients' investment strategies. So we look at this as a huge opportunity for us. We're in great position to navigate. I should add, I don't think any other organization has those capabilities, and so it puts us in a great position. By having that position, it allows us to have more dialogue, not just more dialogue for passive strategies, but more dialogue in portfolio construction and models and active strategies. So having this opportunity to be working with these institutions on the navigation of risk management on behalf of all their individual clients gives us -- will give us a unique opportunity to be working with these institutions in a way that we never have been able to before."

We've done studies to show that globally, there's $50-plus trillion that's sitting in cash. And I don't think anybody knows how big that can be relative to the size of the markets. So depending upon changes in interest rates and changes in equity volatility, a lot of that money can come into motion. So it's not only coming into areas of retirement. It's overall. And the studies that we show range anywhere from 38% to 60% of clients' portfolios are now sitting in cash.

And now price is becoming in that segment something that's very important to be included in the models and focused on, so we responded directly to our clients in that specific segment. When it comes to the mutual funds, we have a pretty large array of mutual funds. We have lowered the pricing in some of our bond fund platform. We have 23 funds there. We took a look and we wanted to make sure that, especially in this low interest rate environment, we are being responsive to our clients. And our adjustments were in 14 of those funds, 8 taxable and 6 municipals, which is about $23 billion in assets.

And yes, behind the scenes, they're doing an incredible amount of preparation for this. I don't think any one firm wants to get ahead of this because they don't want to have -- they have to make serious changes to the relationships with their FAs and their clients. They don't want to be at a competitive disadvantage with their FAs one from another. So I think you're going to see a lot of kabuki, in which a lot of people are going to be shadow dancing until they have to come up with a strategy. But I do -- behind the scenes, all of them are looking at many of the different possible outcomes. Could be a slow transition to more, what I would say, managed portfolios or is going to be sudden. I'm under the view that the changes are going to be more rapid. I think most of my team believes this change is going to be more evolutionary. And so I think there is -- there's even a debate here at BlackRock related to how these changes are going to be, but I do believe the legal responsibilities of each firm has under the DoL is going to probably move towards these changes. But let me be clear. These are not our decisions. These are our distribution partners' decisions. Each firm has to do whatever is the right strategy for them under the new rules, the new laws on behalf of their clients. And I'm sure they're all going to be working on behalf of their clients. I'm not trying to suggest they're focusing on their own specific needs. What we're trying to do with our scale and our platform and the ability to have a dialogue using our active and passive strategy, but more importantly, introducing Aladdin for wealth, we're helping our distribution platforms to focus on what should they be doing towards their implementation in the new DoL rule. I do believe one thing will be -- is going to be constant, though. The need for more risk tools is going to be imperative to making sure that there's better oversight to protecting the firm, making sure they're living under the new DoL rules. I do believe you're going to see, as you saw from Merrill and Edward Jones, more managed accounts. But in -- the key question that you asked, Brian, in the composition of the managed account, how will those portfolio allocations be? Quite frankly, we've heard a whole array of that. I do believe, over a cycle, it's going to be a much greater utilization of passive strategies in ETFs than active strategies. And I think that's where it's going. So we believe, because of our positioning of Aladdin for wealth and because of our ability to work with our distribution platforms in the utilization of beta and active strategies, we're in a very good position. And that's how we are trying to position it. I want to be clear. These are not our decisions. We're responding to the ecosystem changes of our distribution partners, and we're trying to be additive. We have to be a partner with them. And what I can say is, at this time, we're in extensive dialogues with these institutions in terms of how they navigate it, and I believe we'll be able to play a role in their ultimate outcomes."

I think this has been underreported, but $1 trillion of money has moved from prime funds to government funds. This is an incredible amount of money by one government change. I mean, this is one of the great examples where government actions can truly change an ecosystem. And so we saw this huge movement out of prime funds to government funds. We were very well positioned to accommodate our clients on that. We saw about $60 billion in our own prime funds going into government funds, but the key thing for us was we actually picked up a little more than 1% market share in these events, and we had $15 billion in net inflows. We look at the money market fund industry as a great business. Obviously, we are earning lower fees in government funds than we did in the prime funds, and I think that's obviously a circumstance that everybody is going to be facing. But I do believe, as clients feel more comfortable and as we navigate with their risk committees the whole idea of what is a prime fund, I think you will see money eventually move back into prime, not the same -- not the whole $1 trillion. But I think as clients understand what prime funds are and that they can pick up more return with quite a bit less risk than they ever would have had in a prime fund -- because prime funds rules have changed quite considerably, too, how we report our NAV, how we report our positioning -- our position. So they're far less risky than they were in the 2000 to 2007 and '08 environment. So I do believe it's going to take some time as clients become a little bit more circumspect about the difference of the 2 funds. In many cases, they're going to have to go to their risk committees to get a change because the fact that there is no certainty about a dollar NAV, some clients just can't do it unless they change their rules. We're working with many clients right now on that, helping clients understand the trade-offs, but the knee-jerk reaction was very clear. People did not have time to focus on how to work with their risk committee in terms of getting these changes. But I do believe, over time, clients will do that. We are working -- once again, this is one of the great characteristics of BlackRock. We are working with our clients and helping them assess those types risks and the opportunities. But clearly, from our opinion, when you start seeing changes in central bank behavior, when you start seeing widening credit spreads, the advantage of a prime fund versus a government fund may be quite large enough, which will accelerate more people seeking the differences and getting the changes from their boards, risk committee boards, and being able to invest their liquidity in a prime fund even without the constant dollar NAV."

So while we're mindful when we talk about theoretical breakevens, which, look, you can calculate those as well, you know what the change in the fees are and can basically do the math to see how quickly we can capture the incremental revenue, it's really more -- much more importantly about balancing everything that the firm has to offer, a top 10 manager in active, a top 10 manager in passive, a top 10 manager in alts all wrapped up with the differentiation of Aladdin and the technology platform, really to drive a much more comprehensive set of solutions ultimately for the clients and to leverage the scale not only on behalf of those clients, but also on behalf of our shareholders at the end of the day."

Obviously, factors, smart beta in terms of our style advantage products and the like are also getting a lot of seed capital. We really want to try and leverage again back to scale and stability. We think that we can seed in significantly larger amounts than potentially our competitors as a function of our very stable cash flow, which is in excess of $3.5 billion a year.

The regulatory changes have enhanced clients' willingness to invest. We're a big beneficiary of it. So we've been very supportive of the rules that enhances investor protection. We had circumstances earlier in the past few years related to liquidity and the impact of some of the mutual funds where they had to be frozen. Obviously, it hurts the whole industry. It raises questions of uncertainty. So the SEC tried to find a solution. I think they found a pretty good solution under the circumstances. I also do believe we welcome the SEC's role in this. We think the SEC needs to play a larger role in helping ensure the sanctity of the capital markets. As more and more money moves to these capital markets, the need for safety in the capital markets only has increased. So we work very close with all the regulators in Europe related to MiFID and MiFID II, and we worked very closely -- let me restate it. We provided comment letters. I can't say we worked closely. That would be -- that's probably the wrong way of putting it. But we provided our input in helping the regulatory agencies to come up with a solution. We believe MiFID II, liquidity rules of SEC, as I said earlier, is going to lead for greater needs for risk management tools. And clearly, if we have rules like liquidity rule, as I said, it increases the need for risk management, which is pointing up to BlackRock's strength. We built this organization technology with all these things in mind, making sure that we focus on the protection of our clients. I don't think it changes that much in terms of investment management behaviors in terms of making -- in terms of how we invest. We have never been on the edge of investing in illiquid products in our '40 Act products or our UCIT products. And so it doesn't change our behaviors at BlackRock at all. It may change some investors' behaviors. Obviously, some of who were emphasizing very illiquid buckets in their platform. But both -- where MiFID II is going, where the liquidity risk rules are going with the SEC, these are just a work in progress. I believe we are going to see more and more regulatory oversight of our capital markets, ensuring that we have the proper safeguard for investors to invest. And that's critical. I can't say enough about the need to making sure we have the proper safeguards. If we have the proper safeguards, all of the money that Rob Kapito was talking about sitting in the sidelines would be implemented. I don't believe people are sitting there because they're just worried about the next event. A lot of people just don't feel like investing. It's been that fair to them. And by putting these rules in place, it allows more retail investors to feel that they are protected, they have more safety. And through that safety, they probably will have a little more security, which probably will lead to greater investing into the capital markets, and we'll all be benefited by it. The -- but the details related to the SEC liquidity rules, obviously, it's a 1,000-page rule. It's going to take our lawyers and every lawyers a long time to making sure that we understand all the intricacies of how we are going to implement it and how we're going to manage it. It is very clear, in our brief reading, it means a lot more risk management needs, making sure that you can live under these new liquidity rules day to day and abide by them. So it requires greater risk tools, which we have. Even about a year ago, we added a lot of liquidity components to the Aladdin risk models to helping our portfolio managers navigate this. And then in terms of MiFID, this is going to take time working with the European regulators. This is scheduled for 2018. So we do have some time before it's implemented. And hopefully, we'll have better clarity on making sure that we're living up -- under these new rules. So as I think I said earlier, all of this will lead for the asset management industry probably a greater need for reliance on the risk tools, which will lead for some of the asset managers greater expenses to build those tools. I think I'm losing my voice now, so I'll end that -- end it there."

It certainly benefits why you need diverse -- diversity of product. And also, I think it also speaks quite loudly why you need a global platform. And I think BlackRock has that platform of scale, diversity of products and global nature. I would say probably the biggest theme that I could think about in terms of the third quarter was we're seeing an impact on the strategic investments we made in our platform over the last few years. I think it is because of those investments we made, the investments we made from BGI acquisition, the investments we made in the Core Series in 2012, the investments we made in our infrastructure products, our ESG products, our investments now in big data and factors, our investment now in technology related to Aladdin, Aladdin for wealth, our investment in FutureAdvisor, I believe it all speaks loudly that we are staying ahead of the needs of our clients, trying to anticipate the needs. And I do believe we -- the third quarter, when you think about how we handled this adversity of the markets, that we've been able to position ourselves quite well in this environment. I could certainly say again, these investments we made and the investments we're going to continue to make is allowing us to have a deeper, broader relationship with our clients in retail and a deeper and broader relationship with the clients institutionally. We need to continue to stay ahead of our clients' needs or we're not going to provide the service to our clients. So that's the paranoia that BlackRock possesses, staying in front of our clients' needs and trying to respond to our clients' needs. And I think that is the key characteristic and a key differentiator that has positioned BlackRock so well in the past and why I think it's going to be a key characteristic why it's -- why we're so well positioned for our future. 
With that, I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and your continued interest in BlackRock."

It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2016. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. While our earnings re",1555,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2016. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. 
Our clients are facing significant challenges, driven by increased regulation, market volatility, record low interest rates and disruptive technology. And as a result, the asset management industry is changing rapidly. During these times, as we've done in the past, we reexamine our strategic priorities and evolve our business model with the goal of better serving the needs of our clients and optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible for our shareholders. 
Financial results for the third quarter of 2016 demonstrate the diversification and stability of our global investment and technology platform and our commitment to investing for the future. We executed on each of the 3 components of our framework for shareholder value creation this quarter: delivering organic growth, demonstrating operating leverage and systematically returning capital to our shareholders. Third quarter revenue of $2.8 billion was 3% lower than a year ago. However, on a constant-currency basis, we estimate that quarterly revenue was down approximately 1% year-over-year. Operating income of $1.2 billion declined 1% while earnings per share of $5.14 increased 3% versus the prior year quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $29 million of net investment gains, primarily attributable to net gains on unhedged or partially hedged multi-asset and fixed-income seed investments. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 29.7%, reflecting the impact of several nonrecurring items. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable protected -- projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2016, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring items that could arise in the future. 
BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 5%. Flows were positive in our active and index franchises and across asset classes and regions, increasing the value of our broad-based, diversified business model. 
Third quarter base fees of $2.5 billion were up 4% year-over-year, driven primarily by organic growth, positive beta and higher securities lending revenue, which was positively impacted by widening asset spreads resulting from a rise in short-term interest rates. Sequentially, base fees were up 2%. 
While we continue to deliver strong organic growth, base fee growth has recently lagged growth in average assets under management as client risk appetite and portfolio construction decisions impact our business mix. In the current environment, client mix shift has favored index over active, fixed income and cash over equities and government funds over prime funds in the money market space. While mix change amongst and within asset classes will impact our blended fee rate over time, we remain confident that our diverse business model is capable of generating differentiated organic growth in a variety of market environments, and our scale enables us to prudently manage expense and defend our operating margin. 
Performance fees of $58 million declined 72% versus a year ago, driven by our single-strategy hedge fund platform. Recall that performance fees in last year's third quarter benefited from a single European hedge fund that has delivered exceptional full-year performance. 
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $174 million increased 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Our Aladdin business, which represented 87% of BRS revenue in the quarter, up from 81% a year ago, grew 13% year-over-year, driven by new clients and several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform over the last year. Strong market demand for Aladdin continues from institutional asset managers as well as retail intermediaries, who are seeking sophisticated risk analytics and portfolio construction tools to better serve their wealth management clients in the current regulatory environment. 
Other revenue was down $16 million year-over-year, primarily related to lower transition management activity in the current quarter. Total expense decreased 4% year-over-year and was flat sequentially, driven primarily by lower compensation expense. Employee compensation expense was down $56 million or 6% year-over-year, reflecting lower incentive compensation, primarily driven by lower performance fees versus a year ago. G&A expense decreased $7 million or 2% from a year ago and $4 million or 1% sequentially as we continue to exercise discipline over our discretionary spend in the current environment. At present, we anticipate fourth quarter G&A spend to be moderately lower than last year's normalized levels after adjusting for $23 million of quarterly deal-related costs incurred a year ago. 
Finally, distribution and servicing costs decreased 12% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, primarily related to the acquisition of BofA Global Capital Management in April of this year. 
Despite an overall decline in year-over-year revenues driven by a reduction in performance fees, we have delivered 3.5% organic growth over the last 12 months and expanded our as-adjusted operating margin versus a year ago, evidencing our continued commitment to strike an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. 
In line with that commitment, earlier this month, we reduced prices on 15 U.S. iShares core ETFs and several actively managed U.S. bond funds. We chose to use our scale and leadership position to invest on behalf of clients and financial advisers as they adapt to the DoL's new fiduciary rule. In isolation, these price reductions will result in an estimated $85 million annualized revenue reduction for BlackRock, representing less than 1% of our total base fees. However, over the mid to long term, we expect this investment to be accretive to organic growth and additive to overall shareholder value. 
During the third quarter, we continued to return excess cash to shareholders and repurchased an additional $275 million worth of BlackRock shares. 
BlackRock generated $70 billion of total net inflows in the third quarter, including $55 billion of long-term net inflows and $15 billion of cash management inflows. Cash management inflows demonstrate the breadth of our platform and strength of our client relationships in the lead up to U.S. money market reform. Since the beginning of the year, our platform has experienced a remarkable shift from prime to government funds. BlackRock is now the second-largest 2a-7 money fund provider in the United States, and our diverse capabilities across SEP accounts, elective trusts and short-duration products position us well for continued future growth. 
Global iShares generated $51 billion of net inflows during the quarter, representing 18% annualized organic growth. Over the last 12 months, iShares has now generated over $140 billion in net inflows, representing 15% organic growth. iShares equity inflows of $26 billion for the quarter were driven by flows into U.S. and emerging markets as investors once again turned to iShares precision exposures as their preferred vehicle to re-risk following the Brexit vote. 
Importantly, our ETF product segmentation strategy, which tailors products to different client segments, continues to perform well. As an example, large institutional clients who value liquidity and often use derivative strategies, drove $6 billion of quarterly flows into EEM, our flagship iShares emerging markets financial instrument. Longer-term investors, who may be retail or institutional but are more price-sensitive, added nearly $3 billion into IEMG, our iShares core emerging markets ETF. 
Quarterly iShares fixed income inflows of $23 billion reflect an ongoing adoption of ETFs as a means of rapidly accessing and investing in fixed-income markets worldwide. Demand was particularly acute in investment-grade corporates and emerging markets as investors continued to search for sources of higher yield. 
Our institutional client platform saw $6 billion of long-term net inflows during the quarter, driven by active net inflows of $8 billion, as clients increasingly look to partner with BlackRock to build customized solutions or generate yield to meet their investment objectives. Inflows into multi-asset and solutions-oriented strategies, including our LifePath target-date series and active fixed income, were partially offset by outflows from Active Equity. 
In addition, we had another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising $1 billion in new commitments. Illiquid alternatives remain a key area of growth for BlackRock as our institutional clients increasingly search for additional sources of income and fund-correlated returns. 
BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw $2 billion of long-term net outflows, primarily due to outflows from equity and multi-asset funds in another challenging quarter for the active mutual fund industry. Outflows were concentrated in European and U.S. equities and world allocation strategies. 
Retail fixed income remained a pocket of strength with diversified flows across our top-performing platform, including strong flows into emerging markets, high yield, municipals and European and Asian fixed income. At September 30, 88% of BlackRock's taxable fixed-income assets were at or above benchmark or peer median for the trailing 5-year period. In particular, our flagship Total Return Fund continues to generate best-in-class performance and is performing in the top 5% of its peers for the trailing 3- and 5-year periods. 
Overall, our third quarter results reflect the benefits of the investments we've made to build a diversified global business model. Diversification across investment style, distribution channel, product and region enables us to deliver differentiated organic growth in a variety of market environments, while our scale allows us to make strategic investments which deliver value for our clients and shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. BlackRock's business model was built to thrive in all market environments, and clients continue to trust BlackRock in an environment characterized by macroeconomic and political uncertainties, slow global growth and persistent low rates. 
In the third quarter, even as industry-wide investor preferences continue to migrate from equities to fixed income and cash and away from active strategies, the diversity of our platform drove nearly $70 billion of total net inflows. Our $55 billion of long-term net inflows was positive across both active and index strategies and across every asset class and every region. We are seeing ongoing divergence in global monetary policy. While the U.S. signals a slow path to tightening, the U.K., Japan and other central banks continue with accommodative monetary policy, keeping yields at historical low levels and fueling widening asset liability gaps for both large institutions and also individual savers. As monetary policy reaches its limits in many regions, expansionary fiscal policy, particularly in the form of infrastructure investments, will be necessary to ignite economic growth. 
The lack of clarity around the outcomes of several upcoming political events, including the path forward on Brexit, elections in the U.S. and the constitutional referendum in Italy, is contributing to growing tail risk and investor caution. 
Despite underlying uncertainty, market volatility reached lows not seen since 1995. And equity markets rose in the quarter posting record highs in the United States and the United Kingdom. 
Many clients are turning to BlackRock to help them understand the risk at the intersection of policy, markets and economics as governments' actions continue to drive our markets. Both institutional and retail clients are increasingly utilizing Aladdin risk management technology and portfolio construction tools as well as turning to BlackRock for our insights as a thought leader. 
In the third quarter, the BlackRock Investment Institute posted -- hosted a call on the potential impact in financial markets of the upcoming U.S. election, which had more than 1,000 participants. These differentiators, and combined with our global active and index investment platform that BlackRock has built over time, enables us to have a deeper and more meaningful conversation with our clients. And more than ever before, clients value BlackRock's diverse global business model. 
As Gary mentioned, BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, representing a 5% organic asset growth and 5% organic base fee growth. The composition of our flows this quarter is representative of global market conditions and investor sentiment. Across client segments, inflows were led by U.S. and emerging markets' equities and debt as investors view the U.S. as a relatively safe haven, and emerging markets have gained momentum as commodity prices stabilized. Meanwhile, we saw outflows from European equities amid political and policy uncertainties, both from the continent and the United Kingdom. Institutional investors are slowly regaining confidence, and the third quarter was characterized by consistent, diverse client flows rather than any one concentrated activity. 
Our institutional business saw $8 billion of active net inflows in the quarter, driven by strong fixed-income and multi-asset flows, primarily from defined contributions and insurance clients. Insurance clients face complex challenges as traditional asset allocation strategies are failing to support their business models. With expertise in understanding the specific needs of insurance clients, BlackRock's Financial Institution Group is putting the differentiated technology advantages on our Aladdin platform to work, constructing and delivering highly customized investment solutions, which incorporate both traditional and alternative asset classes across active and index strategies. 
Insurance companies are also increasingly employing fixed-income ETFs in a broad range of applications. A recent study from Greenwich Associates found that ETF demand from insurers is likely to increase. Of Insurance -- in the study, insurers in the study, 52% of these companies expect to increase their use of fixed-income ETFs in the next year, and BlackRock is well positioned to work with large insurers as their investment strategies and techniques evolve. 
Active fixed-income flows from retail investors remain strong in the quarter at $5 billion, driven by flows into high yield, emerging market debt and Asia fixed income, again reflecting investors moving out of the risk curve in search of income as they struggle with historical low rates. At the same time, retail investors continue to pull back from active equity investments, driven by a combination of challenging long-term performance track records and also accelerating regulatory changes. 
2016 U.S. active equity mutual funds has experienced more than $240 billion of year-to-date outflows, its worst year on record, with more than $110 billion of outflows in the third quarter alone. At the same time, we have seen strong flows from this client segment across our iShares equity ETFs, which I'll speak about in a moment. 
Regulatory change is having a material impact on the retail ecosystem. The Department of Labor fiduciary rule, RDR and MiFID are all impacting the way wealth managers serve their clients. We are likely to see a historical shift on how assets are being managed and invested as our distribution partners are changing both their product preferences and their use of technology to adapt to these rule changes. We have been working closely with our distribution partners in the U.S. in advance of the Department of Labor rule implementation. 
Aladdin for wealth, our technology and risk management system designed specifically for wealth managers, will be a key differentiator for BlackRock in helping our clients adapt as financial advisers sharpen their focus on the quality and cost efficiencies of funds. We also expect that they will use ETFs more and more at the center of their portfolios. Advisers are using ETFs alongside high-conviction active funds and also they're using ETFs as an active tool to manage their clients' assets. 
Throughout BlackRock's history, we have anticipated a series of changes in the ecosystem and have taken strategic actions to adapt. This has included combining our active and index strategies on one platform through the BGI acquisition in 2009, continuously enhancing our Aladdin risk and investment management technology, launching the iShares Core Series in 2012, which exceeded our expectations by growing at an average organic asset growth rate of 24% since inception, and most recently acquiring FutureAdvisor. Each of these strategic actions represent an investment to better serve our clients and to drive growth in our business. As our ecosystem evolves further, asset managers can no longer rely on beta to subsidize investment spending. 
BlackRock's diversified business and history of successful execution allows us to continue to invest when other firms may not be able to. Whether using our balance sheet to seed new products, streamlining the organization to reallocate investments to strategic initiatives, making tactical technology or product acquisitions or leveraging our scale to reprice products for our clients, we are committed to seeking out the most efficient ways to growing our business. 
Earlier this month, we made a strategic investment in our U.S. iShares core ETFs, reducing prices to meet our clients' needs for high-quality, long-term holdings. In doing so, we are taking steps to be the leader in the core segment by providing clients with the best quality and value of any ETF sponsor and making iShares a clear ETF choice for financial advisers building portfolios under the new fiduciary standard. 
We are maximizing the benefit of our scale to drive the maximum value of -- for our clients and our shareholders, and we expect to see increased organic asset and revenue growth in the iShares Core Series over time. We also expect this investment to drive growth across our broader range of iShares precision exposures, where clients place significant value on characteristics like liquidity and tax efficiency. And finally, we expect this investment to drive growth across our active business as we deepen our relationships with all our distribution partners. 
Our early results have been strong. Since the repricing action just last week, our U.S. core market share of net flows have grown by 25 points to 59%, and our iShares outside the core have also been logging strong flows. iShares saw $51 billion of net inflows in the third quarter and year-to-date, I'm speaking as of yesterday, close to $100 billion of inflows in 2016. Fixed-income iShares continues to be a substantial growth opportunity for BlackRock, and we achieved a significant milestone in the quarter by reaching $100 billion in our European fixed-income ETF, AUM. 
iShares is a world-leading ETF provider, holding the #1 share of U.S., European and global equity and fixed-income ETF flows year-to-date. Going forward, in a lower-bid environment, alpha generation has the opportunity to drive greater percentage of overall investor returns. 
BlackRock saw positive active net inflows of $4 billion in the third quarter. Active flows were driven by our leading global fixed-income platform, where we have scale, product diversity and strong long-term performance, with 88% of our assets above benchmark or peer median for the 5-year period. The combination of active and index strategies will continue to play an important role in our clients' portfolio. And BlackRock has all the components, unlike our peers, as well as portfolio construction capabilities, risk technology and better portfolios. 
I've emphasized the importance of technology many times today. Technology is an essential component of adapting to our regulatory changes, and more broadly, a changing investor landscape. As advisers take on greater portfolio construction responsibilities in a fee-based account, they are increasingly using BlackRock Solutions' sophisticated tools and risk analytics to build better portfolios. As a result, we are seeing strong interest for our Aladdin for wealth, our iRetire platform and our FutureAdvisor offerings. Institutional clients facing persistent low rates and searching for yield require a deeper look into their entire portfolio, and BlackRock's technology can help them see clearer and allocate more effectively. Aladdin continues to build momentum with institutional clients, and revenues grew over 13% year-over-year. We are committed to constantly innovating on our existing platform as well as thinking of new ways that we can serve our clients' needs with technology. This remains a key differentiator for BlackRock relative to any other firm in the asset management industry. 
In a time of significant change for the asset management industry, I believe BlackRock is better positioned than in any time in our history, and we've never had more opportunity working with clients than we do today. We are at a pivotal point with uncertainty in politics, regulation in market likely to play out over the coming months. Our clients are apprehensive, but they are coming to BlackRock for advice, and our priorities remain helping them to meet their investment goals in all environments. We have a unique ability to use our scale, our breadth of active and index products, our global reach and our portfolio construction, our risk management expertise and technology advantages to meet our clients' needs -- their evolving needs, to drive their future growth and our future growth as a firm and future growth for our shareholders.

It's been a couple of quarters and I guess the distribution networks and the platforms had a chance to kind of digest the rules. And Larry, you alluded to you guys are working closely with your distribution partners on helping them adapt to these changes. So maybe a little bit more color from the perspective of what kind of changes are you anticipating? Obviously, we saw the announcement from Merrill and Edward Jones a couple of months ago. But more specifically, I guess with respect to number products, fee structures and any more granularity I think will be very helpful."

We witnessed the changes from Merrill Lynch and Edward Jones. It is very clear, though, that the fiduciary rule is changing how our distribution partners manage their clients' accounts, as you suggested and what was stated by these public announcements, it's moving more to a fee-based relationship, less commission-based relationship. We also believe it's going to move more to model-based relationships, too, where you're going to see the CIO offices of the various distribution platforms coming up with asset allocation strategies. We certainly believe that in the DoL rules, it's going to mean fees are going to be very important and that's obviously one thing we can say with certainty. We don't know how that's going to play out. But we do believe, as it moves more towards managed portfolios, utilizing more of the centralization of models and corporate and asset allocation, it's going to move quite a bit of money more towards passive strategies, utilization of ETFs. We do believe it'll systematically move assets away from active, and so we're trying to get prepared. But one thing we can say was certain in our conversations, though, it leads to greater need of risk management tools. This is one of the reasons why we have adapted Aladdin, which historically was an enterprise system for large institutional investment organizations. Where we now -- have now adapted Aladdin for wealth that we could go down to individual accounts and allowing the adviser and the organization to look at every relationship they have through the lens of risk management. And we believe, under the DoL rules, having that oversight is going to be imperative. And this is one of the reasons why we developed this technology. We're in dialogues with many, many distribution partners already related to Aladdin for wealth. We have signed up one institution already for Aladdin for wealth. And we're in dialogue with many more, utilizing the Aladdin system for the navigation of their clients' investment strategies. So we look at this as a huge opportunity for us. We're in great position to navigate. I should add, I don't think any other organization has those capabilities and so it puts us in a great position. By having that position, it allows us to have more dialogue.  Not just more dialogue for passive strategies, but more dialogue in portfolio construction and models and active strategies. So having this opportunity to be working with these institutions on the navigation of risk management on behalf of all their individual clients gives us -- will give us a unique opportunity to be working with these institutions in a way that we never have been able to before."

We've done studies to show that globally there's $50-plus trillion that's sitting in cash. And I don't think anybody knows how big that can be relative to the size of the markets. So depending upon changes in interest rates and changes in equity volatility, a lot of that money can come into motion. So it's not only coming into areas of retirement, it's overall. And the studies that we show range anywhere from 38% to 60% of clients' portfolios are now sitting in cash.

And as Larry mentioned in his opening remarks, we know that people like the brand. And now price is becoming in that segment something that's very important to be included in the models and focused on, so we responded directly to our clients in that specific segment. When it comes to the mutual funds, we have a pretty large array of mutual funds. We have lowered the pricing in some of our bond fund platform. We have 23 funds there. We took a look and we wanted to make sure that, especially in this low interest rate environment, we are being responsive to our clients. And our adjustments were in 14 of those funds, 8 taxable and 6 municipals, which is about $23 billion in assets.

And yes, behind the scenes, they're doing an incredible amount of preparation for this. I don't think any one firm wants to get ahead of this because they don't want to have -- they have to make serious changes to the relationships with their FAs and their clients. They don't want to be at a competitive disadvantage with their FAs one from another. So I think you're going to see a lot of kabuki, in which a lot of people are going to be shadow dancing until they have to come up with a strategy. But I do -- behind the scenes, all of them are looking at many of the different possible outcomes. Could it -- could be a slow transition to more, what I would say, managed portfolios or is going to be sudden. I'm under the view that the changes are going to be more rapid. I think most of my team believes this changes are going to be more evolutionary. And so I think there is -- there's even a debate here at BlackRock related to how these changes are going to be, but I do believe the legal responsibilities of each firm has under the DoL is going to probably move towards these changes. But let me be clear. These are not our decisions. These are our distribution partners' decisions. Each firm has to do whatever is the right strategy for them under the new rules, the new laws on behalf of their clients. And I'm sure they're all going to be working on behalf of their clients. I'm not trying to suggest they're focusing on their own specific needs. What we're trying to do with our scale and our platform and the ability to have a dialogue using our active and passive strategy, but more importantly, introducing Aladdin for wealth, we're helping our distribution platforms to focus on what should they be doing towards their implementation in the new DoL rule. I do believe one thing will be -- is going to be constant, though. The need for more risk tools is going to be imperative to making sure that there's better oversight to protecting the firm, making sure they're living under the new DoL rules. I do believe you're going to see, as you saw from Merrill and Edward Jones, more managed accounts. But in -- the key question that you asked, Brian, in the composition of the managed account, how will those portfolio allocations be? Quite frankly, we've heard a whole array of that. I do believe, over a cycle, is going to be a much greater utilization of passive strategies in ETFs than active strategies. And I think that's where it's going. So we believe, because of our positioning of Aladdin for wealth and because of our ability to work with our distribution platforms in the utilization of beta and active strategies, we're in a very good position. And that's how we are trying to position it. I want to be clear. These are not our decisions. We're responding to the ecosystem changes of our distribution partners, and we're trying to be additive. We have to be a partner with them. And what I can say is, at this time we are in extensive dialogues with these institutions in terms of how they navigate it, and I believe we'll be able to play a role in their ultimate outcomes."

I think this has been underreported, but $1 trillion of money has moved from prime funds to government funds. This is an incredible amount of money by one government change. I mean, this is one of the great examples where government actions can truly change an ecosystem. And so we saw this huge movement out of prime funds to government funds. We were very well positioned to accommodate our clients on that. We saw about $60 billion in our own prime funds going into government funds, but the key thing for us was we actually picked up a little more than 1% market share in these events, and we had $15 billion in net inflows. We look at the money market fund industry as a great business. Obviously, we are earning lower fees in government funds than we did in the prime funds, and I think that's obviously a circumstance that everybody is going to be facing. But I do believe, as clients feel more comfortable and as they navigate with their risk committees the whole idea of what is a prime fund, I think you will see money eventually move back into prime, not the same -- not the whole $1 trillion. But I think as clients understand what prime funds are and that they can pick up more return with quite a bit less risk than they ever would have had in a prime fund -- because prime funds' rules have changed quite considerably, too, how we report our NAV, how we report our positioning -- our positions. So they're far less risky than they were in the 2000 to 2007 and '08 environment. So I do believe it's going to take some time as clients become a little bit more circumspect about the difference of the 2 funds. In many cases, they're going to have to go to their risk committees to get a change because the fact that there is no certainty about a dollar NAV, some clients just can't do it unless they change their rules. We're working with many clients right now on that, helping clients understand the trade-offs, but the knee-jerk reaction was very clear. People did not have time to focus on how to work with their risk committee in terms of getting these changes. But I do believe, over time, clients will do that. We are working -- once again, this is one of the great characteristics of BlackRock. We are working with our clients and helping them assess those types risks and the opportunities. But clearly, from our opinion, when you start seeing changes in central bank behavior, when you start seeing widening credit spreads, the advantage of a prime fund versus a government fund may be quite large enough, which will accelerate more people seeking the differences and getting the changes from their boards, risk committee boards, and being able to invest their liquidity in a prime fund even without the constant dollar NAV."

That's a significant part of our story, leveraging our scale, the stability of our cash flow to invest in products that we think are going to drive, again, better outcomes for our clients and growth in the future. I would say that we do believe that if you look at where we're seeding money, it's basically again today significantly more in multi-assets, significantly more in fixed income, trying to be smarter around cash solutions that may basically change in the future.  Obviously, our illiquid business, which takes the form of co-invest as opposed to what we call seed. But we're really trying to basically think 2, 3 years down the road to try and figure out where the new blockbuster opportunities are in a way that can really differentiate the strengths that we have. Obviously, factors, smart beta in terms of our style advantage products and the like are also getting a lot of seed capital. We really want to try and leverage again back to scale and stability. We think that we can seed in significantly larger amounts than potentially our competitors as a function of our very stable cash flow, which is in excess of $3.5 billion a year. And we think our ability to seed more frequently and in larger scale allows us to show greater commitment to the product and reduce time to market in a way that allows us to leverage market opportunities significantly quicker."

If the regulatory changes have enhanced clients' willingness to invest, we're a big beneficiary of it. So we've been very supportive of the rules that enhances investor protection. We had circumstances earlier in the past few years related to liquidity and the impact of some of the mutual funds where they had to be frozen. Obviously, it hurts the whole industry. It raises questions of uncertainty. So the SEC tried to find a solution. I think they found a pretty good solution under the circumstances. I also do believe we welcome the SEC's role in this. We think the SEC needs to play a larger role in helping ensure the sanctity of the capital markets. As more and more money moves to these capital markets, the need for safety in the capital markets only has increased. So we work very close with all the regulators in Europe related to MiFID and MiFID II, and we worked very closely -- let me restate it. We provided comment letters. I can't say we worked closely. That would be -- that's probably the wrong way of putting it. But we provided our input in helping the regulatory agencies to come up with a solution. We believe MiFID II, liquidity rules of the SEC, as I said earlier, is going to lead for greater needs for risk management tools. And clearly, if we have rules like liquidity rule, as I said, it increases the need for risk management, which is playing up to BlackRock's strength. We built this organization technology with all these things in mind, making sure that we focus on the protection of our clients. I don't think it changes that much in terms of investment management behaviors in terms of making -- in terms of how we invest. We have never been on the edge of investing in illiquid products in our '40 Act products or our UCIT products. And so it doesn't change our behaviors at BlackRock at all. It may change some investors' behaviors. Obviously, some who are emphasizing very illiquid buckets in their platform. But both -- where MiFID II is going, where the liquidity risk rules are going with the SEC, these are just a work in progress. I believe we are going to see more and more regulatory oversight of our capital markets, ensuring that we have the proper safeguard for investors to invest. And that's critical. I can't say enough about the need to making sure we have the proper safeguards. If we have the proper safeguards, all of the money that Rob Kapito was talking about sitting in the sidelines would be implemented. I don't believe people are sitting there because they're just worried about the next event. A lot of people just don't feel like investing has been that fair to them, and by putting these rules in place, it allows more retail investors to feel that they are protected, they have more safety. And through that safety, they probably will have a little more security, which probably will lead to greater investing into the capital markets, and we'll all be benefited by it. The -- but the details related to the SEC liquidity rules, obviously, it's a 1,000-page rule. It's going to take our lawyers and every lawyers a long time to making sure that we understand all the intricacies of how we are going to implement it and how we're going to manage it. It is very clear, in our brief reading, it means a lot more risk management needs, making sure that you can live under these new liquidity rules day to day and abide by them. So it requires greater risk tools, which we have. Even about a year ago, we added a lot of liquidity components to the Aladdin risk models to helping our portfolio managers navigate this. And then in terms of MiFID, this is going to take time working with the European regulators. This is scheduled for 2018. So we do have some time before it's implemented. And hopefully, we'll have better clarity on making sure that we're living up -- under these new rules. So as I think I said earlier, all of this will lead, for the asset management industry, probably a greater need for reliance on the risk tools, which will lead for some of the asset managers greater expenses to build those tools. I think I'm losing my voice now, so I'll end that -- end it there."

And I think BlackRock has that platform of scale, diversity of products and global nature. I would say probably the biggest theme that I could think about in terms of the third quarter was we're seeing an impact on the strategic investments we made in our platform over the last few years. I think it is because of those investments we made, the investments we made from BGI acquisition, the investments we made in the Core Series in 2012, the investments we made in our infrastructure products, our ESG products, our investments now in big data and factors, our investment now in technology related to Aladdin, Aladdin for wealth, our investment in FutureAdvisor, I believe it all speaks loudly that we are staying ahead of the needs of our clients, trying to anticipate the needs. And I do believe we -- the third quarter, when you think about how we handled this adversity of the markets, that we've been able to position ourselves quite well in this environment. I could certainly say again, these investments we made and the investments we're going to continue to make is allowing us to have a deeper, broader relationship with our clients in retail and a deeper and broader relationship with the clients institutionally. We need to continue to stay ahead of our clients' needs or we're not going to provide the service to our clients. So that's the paranoia that BlackRock possesses, staying in front of our clients' needs and trying to respond to our clients' needs. And I think that is the key characteristic and a key differentiator that has positioned BlackRock so well in the past and why I think it's going to be a key characteristic, why it's -- why we're so well positioned for our future.

It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2016. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. While our earnings re",1558,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. It's my pleasure to present results for the third quarter of 2016. Before I turn it over to Larry to offer his comments, I'll review our quarterly financial performance and business results. While our earnings release discloses both GAAP and as-adjusted financial results, I will be focusing primarily on our as-adjusted results. 
Our clients are facing significant challenges, driven by increased regulation, market volatility, record low interest rates and disruptive technology. And as a result, the asset management industry is changing rapidly. During these times, as we've done in the past, we reexamine our strategic priorities and evolve our business model with the goal of better serving the needs of our clients and optimizing organic growth in the most efficient way possible for our shareholders. 
Financial results for the third quarter of 2016 demonstrate the diversification and stability of our global investment and technology platform and our commitment to investing for the future. We executed on each of the 3 components of our framework for shareholder value creation this quarter: delivering organic growth, demonstrating operating leverage and systematically returning capital to our shareholders. Third quarter revenue of $2.8 billion was 3% lower than a year ago. However, on a constant-currency basis, we estimate that quarterly revenue was down approximately 1% year-over-year. Operating income of $1.2 billion declined 1% while earnings per share of $5.14 increased 3% versus the prior year quarter. Nonoperating results for the quarter reflected $29 million of net investment gains, primarily attributable to net gains on unhedged or partially hedged multi-asset and fixed income seed investments. Our as-adjusted tax rate for the third quarter was 29.7%, reflecting the impact of several nonrecurring items. We continue to estimate that 31% remains a reasonable protected -- projected tax run rate for the fourth quarter of 2016, though the actual effective tax rate may differ as a consequence of nonrecurring items that could arise in the future. 
BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, representing an annualized organic growth rate of 5%. Flows were positive in our active and index franchises and across asset classes and regions, increasing the value of our broad-based, diversified business model. 
Third quarter base fees of $2.5 billion were up 4% year-over-year, driven primarily by organic growth, positive beta and higher securities lending revenue, which was positively impacted by widening asset spreads resulting from a rise in short-term interest rates. Sequentially, base fees were up 2%. 
While we continue to deliver strong organic growth, base fee growth has recently lagged growth in average assets under management as client risk appetite and portfolio construction decisions impact our business mix. In the current environment, client mix shift has favored index over active, fixed income and cash over equities and government funds over prime funds in the money market space. While mix change amongst and within asset classes will impact our blended fee rate over time, we remain confident that our diverse business model is capable of generating differentiated organic growth in a variety of market environments, and our scale enables us to prudently manage expense and defend our operating margin. 
Performance fees of $58 million declined 72% versus a year ago, driven by our single-strategy hedge fund platform. Recall that performance fees in last year's third quarter benefited from a single European hedge fund that has delivered exceptional full-year performance. 
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $174 million increased 4% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Our Aladdin business, which represented 87% of BRS revenue in the quarter, up from 81% a year ago, grew 13% year-over-year, driven by new clients and several sizable clients going live on the Aladdin platform over the last year. Strong market demand for Aladdin continues from institutional asset managers as well as retail intermediaries, who are seeking sophisticated risk analytics and portfolio construction tools to better serve their wealth management clients in the current regulatory environment. 
Other revenue was down $16 million year-over-year, primarily related to lower transition management activity in the current quarter. Total expense decreased 4% year-over-year and was flat sequentially, driven primarily by lower compensation expense. Employee compensation expense was down $56 million or 6% year-over-year, reflecting lower incentive compensation, primarily driven by lower performance fees versus a year ago. G&A expense decreased $7 million or 2% from a year ago and $4 million or 1% sequentially as we continue to exercise discipline over our discretionary spend in the current environment. At present, we anticipate fourth quarter G&A spend to be moderately lower than last year's normalized levels after adjusting for $23 million of quarterly deal-related costs incurred a year ago. 
Finally, distribution and servicing costs decreased 12% year-over-year and 5% sequentially, primarily related to the acquisition of BofA Global Capital Management in April of this year. 
Despite an overall decline in year-over-year revenues driven by a reduction in performance fees, we have delivered 3.5% organic growth over the last 12 months and expanded our as-adjusted operating margin versus a year ago, evidencing our continued commitment to strike an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and practical discretionary expense management. 
In line with that commitment, earlier this month, we reduced prices on 15 U.S. iShares core ETFs and several actively managed U.S. bond funds. We chose to use our scale and leadership position to invest on behalf of clients and financial advisers as they adapt to the DoL's new fiduciary rule. In isolation, these price reductions will result in an estimated $85 million annualized revenue reduction for BlackRock, representing less than 1% of our total base fees. However, over the mid to long term, we expect this investment to be accretive to organic growth and additive to overall shareholder value. 
During the third quarter, we continued to return excess cash to shareholders and repurchased an additional $275 million worth of BlackRock shares. 
BlackRock generated $70 billion of total net inflows in the third quarter, including $55 billion of long-term net inflows and $15 billion of cash management inflows. Cash management inflows demonstrate the breadth of our platform and strength of our client relationships in the lead up to U.S. money market reform. Since the beginning of the year, our platform has experienced a remarkable shift from prime to government funds. BlackRock is now the second-largest 2a-7 money fund provider in the United States, and our diverse capabilities across SEP accounts, elective trusts and short-duration products position us well for continued future growth. 
Global iShares generated $51 billion of net inflows during the quarter, representing 18% annualized organic growth. Over the last 12 months, iShares has now generated over $140 billion in net inflows, representing 15% organic growth. iShares equity inflows of $26 billion for the quarter were driven by flows into U.S. and emerging markets as investors once again turned to iShares precision exposures as their preferred vehicle to re-risk following the Brexit vote. 
Importantly, our ETF product segmentation strategy, which tailors products to different client segments, continues to perform well. As an example, large institutional clients who value liquidity and often use derivative strategies, drove $6 billion of quarterly flows into EEM, our flagship iShares emerging markets financial instrument. Longer-term investors, who may be retail or institutional but are more price-sensitive, added nearly $3 billion into IEMG, our iShares core emerging markets ETF. 
Quarterly iShares fixed income inflows of $23 billion reflect an ongoing adoption of ETFs as a means of rapidly accessing and investing in fixed income markets worldwide. Demand was particularly acute in investment-grade corporates and emerging markets as investors continued to search for sources of higher yield. 
Our institutional client platform saw $6 billion of long-term net inflows during the quarter, driven by active net inflows of $8 billion, as clients increasingly look to partner with BlackRock to build customized solutions or generate yield to meet their investment objectives. Inflows into multi-asset and solutions-oriented strategies, including our LifePath target-date series and active fixed income, were partially offset by outflows from Active Equity. 
In addition, we had another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid alternatives, raising $1 billion in new commitments. Illiquid alternatives remain a key area of growth for BlackRock as our institutional clients increasingly search for additional sources of income and fund-correlated returns. 
BlackRock's Global Retail franchise saw $2 billion of long-term net outflows, primarily due to outflows from equity and multi-asset funds in another challenging quarter for the active mutual fund industry. Outflows were concentrated in European and U.S. equities and world allocation strategies. 
Retail fixed income remained a pocket of strength with diversified flows across our top-performing platform, including strong flows into emerging markets, high yield, municipals and European and Asian fixed income. At September 30, 88% of BlackRock's taxable fixed income assets were at or above benchmark or peer median for the trailing 5-year period. In particular, our flagship Total Return Fund continues to generate best-in-class performance and is performing in the top 5% of its peers for the trailing 3- and 5-year periods. 
Overall, our third quarter results reflect the benefits of the investments we've made to build a diversified global business model. Diversification across investment style, distribution channel, product and region enables us to deliver differentiated organic growth in a variety of market environments, while our scale allows us to make strategic investments which deliver value for our clients and shareholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call. BlackRock's business model was built to thrive in all market environments, and clients continue to trust BlackRock in an environment characterized by macroeconomic and political uncertainties, slow global growth and persistent low rates. 
In the third quarter, even as industry-wide investor preferences continue to migrate from equities to fixed income and cash and away from active strategies, the diversity of our platform drove nearly $70 billion of total net inflows. Our $55 billion of long-term net inflows was positive across both active and index strategies and across every asset class and every region. We are seeing ongoing divergence in global monetary policy. While the U.S. signals a slow path to tightening, the U.K., Japan and other central banks continue with accommodative monetary policy, keeping yields at historical low levels and fueling widening asset liability gaps for both large institutions and also individual savers. As monetary policy reaches its limits in many regions, expansionary fiscal policy, particularly in the form of infrastructure investments, will be necessary to ignite economic growth. 
The lack of clarity around the outcomes of several upcoming political events, including the path forward on Brexit, elections in the U.S. and the constitutional referendum in Italy, is contributing to growing tail risk and investor caution. 
Despite underlying uncertainty, market volatility reached lows not seen since 1995. And equity markets rose in the quarter posting record highs in the United States and the United Kingdom. 
Many clients are turning to BlackRock to help them understand the risk at the intersection of policy, markets and economics as governments' actions continue to drive our markets. Both institutional and retail clients are increasingly utilizing Aladdin risk management technology and portfolio construction tools as well as turning to BlackRock for our insights as a thought leader. 
In the third quarter, the BlackRock Investment Institute posted -- hosted a call on the potential impact in financial markets of the upcoming U.S. election, which had more than 1,000 participants. These differentiators, and combined with our global active and index investment platform that BlackRock has built over time, enables us to have a deeper and more meaningful conversation with our clients. And more than ever before, clients value BlackRock's diverse global business model. 
As Gary mentioned, BlackRock generated $55 billion of long-term net inflows in the third quarter, representing a 5% organic asset growth and 5% organic base fee growth. The composition of our flows this quarter is representative of global market conditions and investor sentiment. Across client segments, inflows were led by U.S. and emerging markets' equities and debt as investors view the U.S. as a relatively safe haven, and emerging markets have gained momentum as commodity prices stabilized. Meanwhile, we saw outflows from European equities amid political and policy uncertainties, both from the continent and the United Kingdom. Institutional investors are slowly regaining confidence, and the third quarter was characterized by consistent, diverse client flows rather than any one concentrated activity. 
Our institutional business saw $8 billion of active net inflows in the quarter, driven by strong fixed income and multi-asset flows, primarily from defined contributions and insurance clients. Insurance clients face complex challenges as traditional asset allocation strategies are failing to support their business models. With expertise in understanding the specific needs of insurance clients, BlackRock's Financial Institution Group is putting the differentiated technology advantages on our Aladdin platform to work, constructing and delivering highly customized investment solutions, which incorporate both traditional and alternative asset classes across active and index strategies. 
Insurance companies are also increasingly employing fixed income ETFs in a broad range of applications. A recent study from Greenwich Associates found that ETF demand from insurers is likely to increase. Of Insurance -- in the study, insurers in the study, 52% of these companies expect to increase their use of fixed income ETFs in the next year, and BlackRock is well positioned to work with large insurers as their investment strategies and techniques evolve. 
Active fixed income flows from retail investors remain strong in the quarter at $5 billion, driven by flows into high yield, emerging market debt and Asia fixed income, again reflecting investors moving out of the risk curve in search of income as they struggle with historical low rates. At the same time, retail investors continue to pull back from active equity investments, driven by a combination of challenging long-term performance track records and also accelerating regulatory changes. 
2016 U.S. active equity mutual funds has experienced more than $240 billion of year-to-date outflows, its worst year on record, with more than $110 billion of outflows in the third quarter alone. At the same time, we have seen strong flows from this client segment across our iShares equity ETFs, which I'll speak about in a moment. 
Regulatory change is having a material impact on the retail ecosystem. The Department of Labor fiduciary rule, RDR and MiFID are all impacting the way wealth managers serve their clients. We are likely to see a historical shift on how assets are being managed and invested as our distribution partners are changing both their product preferences and their use of technology to adapt to these rule changes. We have been working closely with our distribution partners in the U.S. in advance of the Department of Labor rule implementation. 
Aladdin for wealth, our technology and risk management system designed specifically for wealth managers, will be a key differentiator for BlackRock in helping our clients adapt as financial advisers sharpen their focus on the quality and cost efficiencies of funds. We also expect that they will use ETFs more and more at the center of their portfolios. Advisers are using ETFs alongside high-conviction active funds and also they're using ETFs as an active tool to manage their clients' assets. 
Throughout BlackRock's history, we have anticipated a series of changes in the ecosystem and have taken strategic actions to adapt. This has included combining our active and index strategies on one platform through the BGI acquisition in 2009, continuously enhancing our Aladdin risk and investment management technology, launching the iShares Core Series in 2012, which exceeded our expectations by growing at an average organic asset growth rate of 24% since inception, and most recently acquiring FutureAdvisor. Each of these strategic actions represent an investment to better serve our clients and to drive growth in our business. As our ecosystem evolves further, asset managers can no longer rely on beta to subsidize investment spending. 
BlackRock's diversified business and history of successful execution allows us to continue to invest when other firms may not be able to. Whether using our balance sheet to seed new products, streamlining the organization to reallocate investments to strategic initiatives, making tactical technology or product acquisitions or leveraging our scale to reprice products for our clients, we are committed to seeking out the most efficient ways to growing our business. 
Earlier this month, we made a strategic investment in our U.S. iShares core ETFs, reducing prices to meet our clients' needs for high-quality, long-term holdings. In doing so, we are taking steps to be the leader in the core segment by providing clients with the best quality and value of any ETF sponsor and making iShares a clear ETF choice for financial advisers building portfolios under the new fiduciary standard. 
We are maximizing the benefit of our scale to drive the maximum value of -- for our clients and our shareholders, and we expect to see increased organic asset and revenue growth in the iShares Core Series over time. We also expect this investment to drive growth across our broader range of iShares precision exposures, where clients place significant value on characteristics like liquidity and tax efficiency. And finally, we expect this investment to drive growth across our active business as we deepen our relationships with all our distribution partners. 
Our early results have been strong. Since the repricing action just last week, our U.S. core market share of net flows have grown by 25 points to 59%, and our iShares outside the core have also been logging strong flows. iShares saw $51 billion of net inflows in the third quarter and year-to-date, I'm speaking as of yesterday, close to $100 billion of inflows in 2016. Fixed income iShares continues to be a substantial growth opportunity for BlackRock, and we achieved a significant milestone in the quarter by reaching $100 billion in our European fixed income ETF, AUM. 
iShares is a world-leading ETF provider, holding the #1 share of U.S., European and global equity and fixed income ETF flows year-to-date. Going forward, in a lower-bid environment, alpha generation has the opportunity to drive greater percentage of overall investor returns. 
BlackRock saw positive active net inflows of $4 billion in the third quarter. Active flows were driven by our leading global fixed income platform, where we have scale, product diversity and strong long-term performance, with 88% of our assets above benchmark or peer median for the 5-year period. The combination of active and index strategies will continue to play an important role in our clients' portfolio. And BlackRock has all the components, unlike our peers, as well as portfolio construction capabilities, risk technology and better portfolios. 
I've emphasized the importance of technology many times today. Technology is an essential component of adapting to our regulatory changes, and more broadly, a changing investor landscape. As advisers take on greater portfolio construction responsibilities in a fee-based account, they are increasingly using BlackRock Solutions' sophisticated tools and risk analytics to build better portfolios. As a result, we are seeing strong interest for our Aladdin for wealth, our iRetire platform and our FutureAdvisor offerings. Institutional clients facing persistent low rates and searching for yield require a deeper look into their entire portfolio, and BlackRock's technology can help them see clearer and allocate more effectively. Aladdin continues to build momentum with institutional clients, and revenues grew over 13% year-over-year. We are committed to constantly innovating on our existing platform as well as thinking of new ways that we can serve our clients' needs with technology. This remains a key differentiator for BlackRock relative to any other firm in the asset management industry. 
In a time of significant change for the asset management industry, I believe BlackRock is better positioned than in any time in our history, and we've never had more opportunity working with clients than we do today. We are at a pivotal point with uncertainty in politics, regulation in market likely to play out over the coming months. Our clients are apprehensive, but they are coming to BlackRock for advice, and our priorities remain helping them to meet their investment goals in all environments. We have a unique ability to use our scale, our breadth of active and index products, our global reach and our portfolio construction, our risk management expertise and technology advantages to meet our clients' needs -- their evolving needs, to drive their future growth and our future growth as a firm and future growth for our shareholders. 
Now let's open it up for questions."

It's been a couple of quarters and I guess the distribution networks and the platforms had a chance to kind of digest the rules. And Larry, you alluded to you guys are working closely with your distribution partners on helping them adapt to these changes. So maybe a little bit more color from the perspective of what kind of changes are you anticipating? Obviously, we saw the announcement from Merrill and Edward Jones a couple of months ago. But more specifically, I guess with respect to number products, fee structures and any more granularity I think will be very helpful."

We witnessed the changes from Merrill Lynch and Edward Jones. It is very clear, though, that the fiduciary rule is changing how our distribution partners manage their clients' accounts, as you suggested and what was stated by these public announcements, it's moving more to a fee-based relationship, less commission-based relationship. We also believe it's going to move more to model-based relationships, too, where you're going to see the CIO offices of the various distribution platforms coming up with asset allocation strategies. We certainly believe that in the DoL rules, it's going to mean fees are going to be very important and that's obviously one thing we can say with certainty. We don't know how that's going to play out. But we do believe, as it moves more towards managed portfolios, utilizing more of the centralization of models and corporate and asset allocation, it's going to move quite a bit of money more towards passive strategies, utilization of ETFs. We do believe it'll systematically move assets away from active, and so we're trying to get prepared. But one thing we can say was certain in our conversations, though, it leads to greater need of risk management tools. This is one of the reasons why we have adapted Aladdin, which historically was an enterprise system for large institutional investment organizations. Where we now -- have now adapted Aladdin for wealth that we could go down to individual accounts and allowing the adviser and the organization to look at every relationship they have through the lens of risk management. And we believe, under the DoL rules, having that oversight is going to be imperative. And this is one of the reasons why we developed this technology. We're in dialogues with many, many distribution partners already related to Aladdin for wealth. We have signed up one institution already for Aladdin for wealth. And we're in dialogue with many more, utilizing the Aladdin system for the navigation of their clients' investment strategies. So we look at this as a huge opportunity for us. We're in great position to navigate. I should add, I don't think any other organization has those capabilities and so it puts us in a great position. By having that position, it allows us to have more dialogue.  Not just more dialogue for passive strategies, but more dialogue in portfolio construction and models and active strategies. So having this opportunity to be working with these institutions on the navigation of risk management on behalf of all their individual clients gives us -- will give us a unique opportunity to be working with these institutions in a way that we never have been able to before."

We've done studies to show that globally there's $50-plus trillion that's sitting in cash. And I don't think anybody knows how big that can be relative to the size of the markets. So depending upon changes in interest rates and changes in equity volatility, a lot of that money can come into motion. So it's not only coming into areas of retirement, it's overall. And the studies that we show range anywhere from 38% to 60% of clients' portfolios are now sitting in cash.

They're long-term holders, and a lot of them will be purchasing these either directly or through models because of what you had just mentioned with Larry in the DoL opportunity. We want to be a leader in this segment, in the core segment. We want to provide the clients with the best quality and value of any ETF sponsor and making sure that iShares is the clear ETF choice for financial advisers that are looking to build their portfolios under the new fiduciary standard. Now when we talk about that in particular, 90% of our iShares, we have not changed the price on. This is really targeted at this specific segment that is very fee-sensitive. And as Larry mentioned in his opening remarks, we know that people like the brand. And now price is becoming in that segment something that's very important to be included in the models and focused on, so we responded directly to our clients in that specific segment. When it comes to the mutual funds, we have a pretty large array of mutual funds. We have lowered the pricing in some of our bond fund platform. We have 23 funds there. We took a look and we wanted to make sure that, especially in this low interest rate environment, we are being responsive to our clients. And our adjustments were in 14 of those funds, 8 taxable and 6 municipals, which is about $23 billion in assets.

And yes, behind the scenes, they're doing an incredible amount of preparation for this. I don't think any one firm wants to get ahead of this because they don't want to have -- they have to make serious changes to the relationships with their FAs and their clients. They don't want to be at a competitive disadvantage with their FAs one from another. So I think you're going to see a lot of kabuki, in which a lot of people are going to be shadow dancing until they have to come up with a strategy. But I do -- behind the scenes, all of them are looking at many of the different possible outcomes. Could it -- could be a slow transition to more, what I would say, managed portfolios or is going to be sudden. I'm under the view that the changes are going to be more rapid. I think most of my team believes this changes are going to be more evolutionary. And so I think there is -- there's even a debate here at BlackRock related to how these changes are going to be, but I do believe the legal responsibilities of each firm has under the DoL is going to probably move towards these changes. But let me be clear. These are not our decisions. These are our distribution partners' decisions. Each firm has to do whatever is the right strategy for them under the new rules, the new laws on behalf of their clients. And I'm sure they're all going to be working on behalf of their clients. I'm not trying to suggest they're focusing on their own specific needs. What we're trying to do with our scale and our platform and the ability to have a dialogue using our active and passive strategy, but more importantly, introducing Aladdin for wealth, we're helping our distribution platforms to focus on what should they be doing towards their implementation in the new DoL rule. I do believe one thing will be -- is going to be constant, though. The need for more risk tools is going to be imperative to making sure that there's better oversight to protecting the firm, making sure they're living under the new DoL rules. I do believe you're going to see, as you saw from Merrill and Edward Jones, more managed accounts. But in -- the key question that you asked, Brian, in the composition of the managed account, how will those portfolio allocations be? Quite frankly, we've heard a whole array of that. I do believe, over a cycle, is going to be a much greater utilization of passive strategies in ETFs than active strategies. And I think that's where it's going. So we believe, because of our positioning of Aladdin for wealth and because of our ability to work with our distribution platforms in the utilization of beta and active strategies, we're in a very good position. And that's how we are trying to position it. I want to be clear. These are not our decisions. We're responding to the ecosystem changes of our distribution partners, and we're trying to be additive. We have to be a partner with them. And what I can say is, at this time we are in extensive dialogues with these institutions in terms of how they navigate it, and I believe we'll be able to play a role in their ultimate outcomes."

I think this has been underreported, but $1 trillion of money has moved from prime funds to government funds. This is an incredible amount of money by one government change. I mean, this is one of the great examples where government actions can truly change an ecosystem. And so we saw this huge movement out of prime funds to government funds. We were very well positioned to accommodate our clients on that. We saw about $60 billion in our own prime funds going into government funds, but the key thing for us was we actually picked up a little more than 1% market share in these events, and we had $15 billion in net inflows. We look at the money market fund industry as a great business. Obviously, we are earning lower fees in government funds than we did in the prime funds, and I think that's obviously a circumstance that everybody is going to be facing. But I do believe, as clients feel more comfortable and as they navigate with their risk committees the whole idea of what is a prime fund, I think you will see money eventually move back into prime, not the same -- not the whole $1 trillion. But I think as clients understand what prime funds are and that they can pick up more return with quite a bit less risk than they ever would have had in a prime fund -- because prime funds' rules have changed quite considerably, too, how we report our NAV, how we report our positioning -- our positions. So they're far less risky than they were in the 2000 to 2007 and '08 environment. So I do believe it's going to take some time as clients become a little bit more circumspect about the difference of the 2 funds. In many cases, they're going to have to go to their risk committees to get a change because the fact that there is no certainty about a dollar NAV, some clients just can't do it unless they change their rules. We're working with many clients right now on that, helping clients understand the trade-offs, but the knee-jerk reaction was very clear. People did not have time to focus on how to work with their risk committee in terms of getting these changes. But I do believe, over time, clients will do that. We are working -- once again, this is one of the great characteristics of BlackRock. We are working with our clients and helping them assess those types risks and the opportunities. But clearly, from our opinion, when you start seeing changes in central bank behavior, when you start seeing widening credit spreads, the advantage of a prime fund versus a government fund may be quite large enough, which will accelerate more people seeking the differences and getting the changes from their boards, risk committee boards, and being able to invest their liquidity in a prime fund even without the constant dollar NAV."

If the regulatory changes have enhanced clients' willingness to invest, we're a big beneficiary of it. So we've been very supportive of the rules that enhances investor protection. We had circumstances earlier in the past few years related to liquidity and the impact of some of the mutual funds where they had to be frozen. Obviously, it hurts the whole industry. It raises questions of uncertainty. So the SEC tried to find a solution. I think they found a pretty good solution under the circumstances. I also do believe we welcome the SEC's role in this. We think the SEC needs to play a larger role in helping ensure the sanctity of the capital markets. As more and more money moves to these capital markets, the need for safety in the capital markets only has increased. So we work very close with all the regulators in Europe related to MiFID and MiFID II, and we worked very closely -- let me restate it. We provided comment letters. I can't say we worked closely. That would be -- that's probably the wrong way of putting it. But we provided our input in helping the regulatory agencies to come up with a solution. We believe MiFID II, liquidity rules of the SEC, as I said earlier, is going to lead for greater needs for risk management tools. And clearly, if we have rules like liquidity rule, as I said, it increases the need for risk management, which is playing up to BlackRock's strength. We built this organization technology with all these things in mind, making sure that we focus on the protection of our clients. I don't think it changes that much in terms of investment management behaviors in terms of making -- in terms of how we invest. We have never been on the edge of investing in illiquid products in our '40 Act products or our UCIT products. And so it doesn't change our behaviors at BlackRock at all. It may change some investors' behaviors. Obviously, some who are emphasizing very illiquid buckets in their platform. But both -- where MiFID II is going, where the liquidity risk rules are going with the SEC, these are just a work in progress. I believe we are going to see more and more regulatory oversight of our capital markets, ensuring that we have the proper safeguard for investors to invest. And that's critical. I can't say enough about the need to making sure we have the proper safeguards. If we have the proper safeguards, all of the money that Rob Kapito was talking about sitting in the sidelines would be implemented. I don't believe people are sitting there because they're just worried about the next event. A lot of people just don't feel like investing has been that fair to them, and by putting these rules in place, it allows more retail investors to feel that they are protected, they have more safety. And through that safety, they probably will have a little more security, which probably will lead to greater investing into the capital markets, and we'll all be benefited by it. The -- but the details related to the SEC liquidity rules, obviously, it's a 1,000-page rule. It's going to take our lawyers and every lawyers a long time to making sure that we understand all the intricacies of how we are going to implement it and how we're going to manage it. It is very clear, in our brief reading, it means a lot more risk management needs, making sure that you can live under these new liquidity rules day to day and abide by them. So it requires greater risk tools, which we have. Even about a year ago, we added a lot of liquidity components to the Aladdin risk models to helping our portfolio managers navigate this. And then in terms of MiFID, this is going to take time working with the European regulators. This is scheduled for 2018. So we do have some time before it's implemented. And hopefully, we'll have better clarity on making sure that we're living up -- under these new rules. So as I think I said earlier, all of this will lead, for the asset management industry, probably a greater need for reliance on the risk tools, which will lead for some of the asset managers greater expenses to build those tools. I think I'm losing my voice now, so I'll end that -- end it there."

It certainly benefits why you need diverse -- diversity of product. And also, I think it also speaks quite loudly why you need a global platform. And I think BlackRock has that platform of scale, diversity of products and global nature. I would say probably the biggest theme that I could think about in terms of the third quarter was we're seeing an impact on the strategic investments we made in our platform over the last few years. I think it is because of those investments we made, the investments we made from BGI acquisition, the investments we made in the Core Series in 2012, the investments we made in our infrastructure products, our ESG products, our investments now in big data and factors, our investment now in technology related to Aladdin, Aladdin for wealth, our investment in FutureAdvisor, I believe it all speaks loudly that we are staying ahead of the needs of our clients, trying to anticipate the needs. And I do believe we -- the third quarter, when you think about how we handled this adversity of the markets, that we've been able to position ourselves quite well in this environment. I could certainly say again, these investments we made and the investments we're going to continue to make is allowing us to have a deeper, broader relationship with our clients in retail and a deeper and broader relationship with the clients institutionally. We need to continue to stay ahead of our clients' needs or we're not going to provide the service to our clients. So that's the paranoia that BlackRock possesses, staying in front of our clients' needs and trying to respond to our clients' needs. And I think that is the key characteristic and a key differentiator that has positioned BlackRock so well in the past and why I think it's going to be a key characteristic, why it's -- why we're so well positioned for our future. 
With that, I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning and your continued interest in BlackRock."
