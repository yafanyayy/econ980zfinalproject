273983758,325513497,947216,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Mar 03, 2016",2016-03-03,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thanks, Andy. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We've now completed our first full quarter as an independent company and we're off to a very strong start. We are already seeing the benefits of being a smaller, more focused and agil",2026,"Thanks, Andy. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We've now completed our first full quarter as an independent company and we're off to a very strong start. We are already seeing the benefits of being a smaller, more focused and agile company across a number of fronts. Our customers and partners understand our strategy and appreciate working with the simplified faster moving organization. Our employees are engaged and aligned. 
For example, we've created a single pan HPA sales training and account planning program, which has already uncovered over 100 accounts where there are significant untapped cross-selling opportunities. Our innovation engine is firing on all cylinders and you're going to see some amazing new introductions in the coming quarters in key areas of the portfolio, including servers, cloud, high performance computing, IoT, all flash storage, Aruba and converge systems. 
For our shareholders, this focus is driving strong financial and operational performance. In Q1, we delivered our third consecutive quarter of growth in constant currency with revenue of $12.7 billion up 4% year-over-year. And when you exclude the impact from recent M&A activities, we grew revenue on a constant currency basis in every 1 of our business segments for the first time since Q4 fiscal year '10. 
At the same time, we continue to make progress on our cost structure particularly in ES and delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.41 at the top end of our previously provided range. Delivering strong cash flow is also a key priority for us. While Q1 was impacted by seasonality, separation payments and timing, we expect cash flow to improve as we move through the year and remained confident in our full year free cash flow outlook of $2 billion to $2.2 billion. 
Tim will walk through the specific Q1 cash flow drivers in a minute. Finally, in line with our commitment to return cash to our shareholders, in Q1, we paid $1.3 billion, including $1.2 billion for share repurchases and nearly $100 million in dividends. As a result, we've already exceeded our FY '16 commitment of returning at least 50% of expected free cash flow to shareholders. And share repurchases will remain our preferred method to return cash to shareholders given the current market conditions. Overall, while there is more work to do to accelerate top line growth, align our cost structure and drive even closer collaboration and integration across our organization, I'm very pleased with where we stand today. 
Now let me turn to business performance. We had another strong quarter in Enterprise Group with revenue up 7% year-over-year in constant currency. Our portfolio is truly the best we've had in years and is driving strong customer traction. For example, today, HPE is the leading infrastructure provider for SAP Hana with nearly twice the number of shipments over the next competitor. And this quarter, we won a number of important deals, including 1 with Canadian communications company, Rogers, to help them transform their existing traditional IT to a hybrid infrastructure. We will provide a comprehensive solution, including converge systems, cloud systems, StoreOnce pre-part all flash and technology services.
We also signed a multiyear agreement with one of the world's largest food producers, JBS to help them build an IT environment that supports faster business expansion, including consolidating their data centers and moving to the cloud. And just last week, at Mobile Word Congress, we announced that Swiss Com, Switzerland's leading telecommunications provider will deploy new virtual network functions using HPE open NFE solutions. 
This customer momentum is driving financial results and each of our hardware business units performed well in Q1. In servers, we delivered 5% year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, maintain strong margins and also continued to make R&D investments. While we won't chase share for shares' sake, we continue to see significant growth opportunities ahead as the clear market leader with the most comprehensive portfolio of offerings, our mission-critical and High Performance Computing to our new IoT and cloud line solutions. 
Storage had another strong quarter with revenue up 3% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by continued strength in 3PAR. Converge storage grew 70% year-over-year and constant currency and is now a solid 56% of storage revenue. We had record revenue for 3PAR, driven by triple digit constant currency growth in all flash, which grew at a 3x the market rate. With the industry-leading all flash product and the broadest reach through our channel, we expect to gain share for the ninth quarter in a row in calendar Q4. 
Turning to networking. The significant actions we took last year are paying off and we are very pleased with the performance overall. Networking revenue grew 62% year-over-year in constant currency. Normalized for the Aruba acquisition, revenue grew double-digits, driven by record China revenue as well as good performance in other regions. As we've discussed before, we are seeing strength in China as customers anticipate the completion of the deal with Tsinghua, that we announced last year. 
We are currently working through the final regulatory approval in China and we expect the deal to close by the end of May. Aruba also grew double-digits at an operational level and we saw strong pull through of HPE's switching portfolio to compliment Aruba's wireless offerings. Technology Services revenue was down 3% in constant currency although TS support performed better. Total orders grew year-over-year, excluding China where we are seeing some customers delaying renewals until the Tsinghua transaction closed. 
Unlike networking or servers, these are long-term contracts and we believe some customers are waiting to work directly with the new entity. We also saw constant currency double-digit order growth in new solutions like Data Center Care and Proactive Care. We expect TS performance to improve throughout the year, driven by a better mix of new, faster growing support solutions. 
In cloud, following a major wave of product releases across our HPE Helion portfolio in the second half of 2015, we are seeing strong customer traction. In fact, since separation, Helion has gained over 200 customer wins, including some of the world's largest banks, service providers and industrials. This momentum reinforces our belief that our strategy of helping customers transform to a hybrid infrastructure is a winning approach for us. 
Enterprise Services continues to execute well against its turnaround strategy. ES is essence building a more diversified customer base, stabilizing revenue and significantly reducing its cost structure. For example, during the quarter, we grew new business TCV by 4% year-over-year in constant currency. This includes an agreement with Saber to provide virtualization, automation and security services, hardware and software to support faster product development and extend Saber's position in the global travel industry. And it includes an agreement with Avon to transform key elements of the leading beauty companies global IT infrastructure by offering a dedicated data center services, cross functional support, network management and security services. 
This builds on the progress we've made over the past 3 years. Remember that in FY '13, just 3 customers made up approximately 65% of ES operating profit. Today, no account makes up more than 10%. We also continued to make progress on our cost structure by exiting high cost data centers, improving low-cost location mix and rebalancing our workforce. As a result, Q1 revenue grew slightly in constant currency, marking the first quarter with constant currency growth since Q3 of '12. 
We also had our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. Q1 operating margin of 5.1% improved 2.1 points year-over-year driven largely by delivery cost actions. Overall, I believe we are taking the right steps to achieve our long-term goal of a sustainable market competitive cost structure with a 7% to 9% operating profit margin. In software, we continue to make progress, aligning the portfolio and go to market to our 4 transformation areas, increasing efficiency and accelerating fast. 
This has included the divestiture of several software businesses that were not core to our strategy, including iManage, Live Vault and Tipping Point, which we expect to close later this month. In Q1, software returned to growth with revenue up 1% in constant currency when adjusted for recent M&A activity. The ADM iTom business was down slightly in current currency as continued headwinds in license and support were nearly offset by professional services and record revenue growth in SaaS, which grew over 20% year-on-year. Big Data was strong with revenue up double-digits when normalized for currency and divestitures, driven by triple digit growth in vertical license. 
Security performance was also strong across both license and SaaS. Financial services continues to provide our customers with the financing the flexibility they need to take on their biggest IT challenges. At the same time, the team does a great job managing this business to minimize our risk and maximize our return. Financial services revenue grew 3% in constant currency in Q1 and financing volume also increased 3% year-over-year. 
Before I hand it over to Tim to provide further insight into the financials, I want to highlight some of the exciting product announcements for the quarter. One of the most important benefits from being a smaller more focused companies we're able to be very targeted in our investments and to even more effectively put our resources towards the most important, high-potential opportunities that support our strategy. As we discussed before, we prioritize organic investments to maintain a strong technology pipeline. At Discover in December, we unveiled HPE Synergy, a new category of infrastructure designed to learn both traditional and cloud native applications for organizations running a hybrid infrastructure. 
Synergy, powered by our 1D [ph] software, represents a critical step in delivering our vision for hybrid infrastructure. We also introduced our new IoT lite systems and we have a networking centers specifically designed to help customers more specifically collect, process and analyze IoT data. The new solutions are key elements of our strategy of delivering more strategy and computing power at the network edge and you can expect more IoT announcements coming up this year. 
And in January, HP expanded its network function virtualization portfolio. We announced HPE Service Director, a new end-to-end service operation solution designed to help communication service providers manage services in NFC by bridging traditional and new virtualized environments. In addition to organic investments, we are also investing in key partnerships. In January, HP and Skala announced an enhanced partnership designed to accelerate the adoption of software-defined storage. And we announced a new partnership with Microsoft appointing Asher as a preferred public cloud partner for HPE customers. While HPE now serves as a preferred partner in providing infrastructure and services for Microsoft's hybrid cloud offerings.
As a result of this commitment to innovation, our products and services are being recognized as leaders in the industry. For example, we are now named a leader in 26 different Gartner Magic Quadrants, including Integrated Systems, Modular Servers, Storage Disk Arrays and Wired and Wireless infrastructure. Forrester has ranked Enterprise Services as a leader in workplace services and positioned HPE as a leader in its recent private cloud report and IDC ranked us a the leader in application modernization services. Looking forward, you can expect this momentum and investment and innovation to continue. Later this month we will announce a new market changing hyper converged offering basin our industry-leading ProLiant virtualization server. 
Our new solution will offer customers installation in minutes, a consumer-inspired, simple, mobile-ready user experience and IT operations, all at 20% lower cost at [indiscernible]. We believe this new system will allow us to quickly become a top player in the $5 billion high growth hyper converged market. Also later this month, we will refresh our server portfolio to include a game changing new technology called Persistent Memory, which was invented by our server group. 
This new technology will enable an ecosystem of new applications supporting non-volatile memory and is a key milestone on our journey to the machine. So overall, I'm very pleased with our first quarter as an independent company. We are already seeing the benefits of being a smaller, more focused organization and I'm excited about what's ahead. 
On that note, I will hand the call over to Tim"

Good afternoon, everyone. We have now completed our first quarter as a stand-alone company and overall, I'm pleased with our performance. As part of the separation process, we delivered a clear financial architecture for HPE where each busine",1971,"Thanks, Meg. Good afternoon, everyone. We have now completed our first quarter as a stand-alone company and overall, I'm pleased with our performance. As part of the separation process, we delivered a clear financial architecture for HPE where each business segment has a specific role in driving overall company performance. 
Enterprise Group is our growth engine. Enterprise Services is committed to stabilizing revenue and expanding margins. Software provides high margins and strong cash flow. And financial services provides a consistent annuity-based revenue stream. 
After only 1 quarter, it's already clear that each business is executing against this framework and as a result, it driving solid financial performance at the HPE level. First quarter revenue was $12.7 billion, down 2.5% year-over-year, but up 3.8% in constant currency. And as Meg said, this marks our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth. Clearly, currency was a significant headwind this quarter. You might recall that we saw the most significant movement in currencies during our first fiscal quarter last year, which drove a large rate translation impact this year and a total currency impact of 6 points year-over-year. 
Going forward, currency will still be a significant impact in Q2 and then moderate in the second half and we still anticipate a currency headwind of approximately 3 points to revenue for the full year. Looking at performance by geography. We had some challenges in the Americas, which grew 1% year-over-year in constant currency with increased weakness in January, particularly in U.S. hardware as macro uncertainty cause a slowdown in global account spending. 
EMEA delivered growth of 4% year-over-year and constant currency, driven by balanced growth across EG hardware. APJ saw the best growth at 9% year-over-year in constant currency due to strengthened servers and record China networking revenue. The gross margin was 28.4%, down 1.2 points sequentially due to normal seasonality and up 70 basis points year-over-year primarily driven continued productivity improvements and Enterprise Services. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $2.6 billion were up 3%year-over-year, driven by R&D as we continue to make targeted investments. 
Non-GAAP operating profit was 8.1%, down 1.5 points sequentially and down 40 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.41, at the top of our guided range. Non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pretax charges of $311 million for restructuring charges, $218 million for amortization of intangible assets, and $79 million for separation costs. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.15, $0.02 above our previously provided outlook range of $0.09 to $0.13 due primarily to tax indemnification adjustments related to the separation. 
Free cash flow was negative $831 million, down 70% year-on-year on an adjusted basis, that reflects the estimated HPE contribution to the combined HPE company free cash flow last year. As we discussed during the Q4 earnings call, Q1 is usually our lowest cash flow quarter due primarily to earnings seasonality in ES and software as well as normal annual bonus compensation payments. You can see the seasonal in our adjusted fiscal '15 results when our free cash flow for Q1 was a use of approximately $500 million. In addition, the normal seasonality in Q1 '16 we had higher separation payments year-over-year, which are now largely compete and higher usage of working capital. 
Let me explain what's happening with working capital. The cash conversion cycle was 31 days, up 8 days sequentially. This was above our targeted level of mid-20 days, primarily due to payables that were impacted by intra quarter purchasing linearity and strategic buys that provide an economic benefit to the company. These items are largely timing-related and we continue to more aggressively manage our working capital and expect the cash conversion cycle to improve throughout the year and returned to our targeted levels. With all that in mind, we remain committed to our free cash flow outlook of $2 billion to $2.2 billion for the full year. 
Turning to capital allocation. In the first quarter, we paid approximately $1.2 billion for share repurchases, including $1.1 billion through an accelerated share repurchase program and an additional $132 million on the open market as part of our ongoing share repurchase program. 
We also distributed $96 million as part of our normal dividend. To date, we have already returned over 60% of our free cash flow outlook to shareholders and now we are raising our commitment and expect to return at least 100% of our free cash flow outlook to shareholders in fiscal year '16. 
Separately as Meg noted, we expect the Tsinghua transactions to close near the end of May. When the deal closes, we expect to receive cash of just over $2 billion that is net of some initial on the sale. We are planning to use the vast majority of this cash to opportunistically repurchase shares. The timing of the repurchases may not be linear and will be dependent on several factors, including market conditions and availability of U.S. cash. 
Now turning to the business results. The Enterprise Group delivered healthy growth and stable profitability in line with our financial architecture. As Meg discussed, we are investing in innovation across EG to deliver best-in-class solutions in growing markets while maintaining cost discipline and solid profitability. Revenue grew 1% year-over-year as reported or 7% in constant currency with strength across all hardware groups. Profitability was down 1.8 points to 13.4%, primarily due to FX and to a lesser extent, product mix. 
Service revenue was down 1% year-over-year as reported but grew 5% in constant currency. Growth was driven by strong Tier 1 and by core sales in both EMEA and APJ. This was somewhat offset by pressure in the Americas towards the end of the quarter. Our R&D investments continue to pay off with our industry-leading offerings and high performance compute that now exceed the $1 billion run rate and strong double-digit growth in mission-critical x86 servers. 
Looking forward, we continue to see opportunities for profitable revenue growth and shared expansion in a server market. We have the most comprehensive and compelling server portfolio with solutions for every workload. And we are aggressively taking advantage of the uncertainty in the markets surrounding our competitors. Storage revenue declined 3% year-on-year as reported but grew 3% in constant currency. The unified 3PAR architecture combined with our excellent channel partnerships continues to drive revenue growth and share gains while our competitors are distracted and contracting. 3PAR all flash grew single-digits [ph] again driving 3PAR revenue growth of 21% year-over-year in constant currency. Significantly outperforming the market. 3PAR plus XP plus EVA was up 15% year-over-year in constant currency. 
We estimate that we've gained solid market share in the fourth [ph] calendar quarter and expect storage to continue to be a growth driver in constant currency throughout the remainder of the year. Networking revenue grew 54% year-over-year as reported or 62% in constant currency and expanded operating margins, driven by the acquisition of Aruba and strong execution across all regions. When adjusted for Aruba, networking revenue was still up double-digits in constant currency. 
The Aruba acquisition continues to prove to be a key strategic move for HPE and has transformed our networking business. Consistent with our acquisition strategy, Aruba continues to drive growing in wireless and has also been integral in return switching to double-digit growth year-over-year. ES revenue declined 9% year-over-year as reported or 3% in constant currency. However, approximately 1 point of the decline was due to the discontinuation of HPI related service contract that was supported by TS last year. Encouragingly, TS support which has significantly higher margins and consulting, continue to stabilize and revenue is only down 2% year-over-year in constant currency, including the HPI impact. 
Orders were down slightly in constant currency but up, excluding China where signings have been delayed ahead of the Tsinghua deal close date. Enterprise Services executed well against its plan to stabilize the top line and expand margins. Revenue declined 6% year-over-year but grew slightly in constant currency. Applications in business services, which you'll recall is the higher-margin business within ES, continue to improve with the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, driven by strong apps performance and stabilization and business process services. Strategic Enterprise Services revenue was up double-digits year-on-year with strong growth in Helion-managed cloud. 
Overall, TCV was up nearly 30% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by strong renewals as well as growth in new logos and add-ons. ES operating profit improved 2.1 points year-over-year to 5.1% as the team continued to execute productivity improvements and delivering on sales and improved new deal productivity. We also had a benefit from a onetime divestiture of a noncore business. We continue to make progress against the cost take out plan we laid out at our Analyst Meeting. 
We now have approximately 45% of our workforce and low-cost locations and are well on our way to our longer term goal of 60%. Given the progress we have made on bookings and cost improvements along with our normal quarterly seasonality, we remain confident in our full-year operating profit outlook of 6% to 7% and revenue down 2% to flat year-over-year in constant currency. Software executed well in the quarter, improving revenue and delivering strong profitability while continuing to become more tightly integrated with the rest of the HPE portfolio and go-to-market approach. 
Revenue declined 10% year-over-year as reported or 6% in constant currency, but was up 1% when adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures in constant currency. We strong performance in Big Data and also some growth in security, offset by declines in IT management. SaaS had a very good quarter growing double-digits in constant currency when adjusted for divestitures, driven by ADMI and security. 
Operating profit was 17.4% down 60 basis points year-over-year due primarily to currency and higher mix of professional services. The team continue to focus on disciplined cost controls but is still making strategic R&D investments in growth areas that aligned well with the broader HPE portfolio. In financial services, revenue declined 3% year-over-year but grew 3% in constant currency as we began to see more impact from the volume growth we delivered last year. Financing volume in the quarter declined 4% year-over-year but was up 3% in constant currency. Operating profit improve that 1.7 points year-over-year to 12.9% as we were able to adjust that debt reserves to reflect the high-quality portfolio. 
Return on equity was up 1 point year-over-year to 18.1%. Now turning to our outlook. We will not formally update our fiscal year '16 outlook for the impact of Tsinghua transaction until after it closes, but I wanted to give you some information about how to think about the potential impact. We now anticipate the deal will close near the end of May and expect the transaction will impact fiscal year '16 EPS operationally by approximately $0.05. 
This includes some stranded costs from corporate administrative functions that we will mitigate in the near term. After the transactions closes, we will update our fiscal year '16 free cash flow and EPS outlook, including any expected benefit from share repurchases made with the sale proceeds. Also, we do have an EPS benefit from our share repurchases completed Q1 and still feel confident in the underlying operating performance of the business. But it's too early in the year to change our full-year outlook given the softness in January and near-term market uncertainty. 
With that in mind, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.39 to $0.43 in Q2 2016, and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.13 to $0.17 in Q2 2016, and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.85. 
Now let's open it up for questions."

So keep in mind in the first quarter last year, the euro was an example was kind of 1.24 and the average accounting rates in the first quarter of this year is 1.08 [ph]. So we still saw significant pressure from a FX perspective when you look at the first quarter. Going out for the rest of the year, we would expect the margin to stabilize and maybe get a little bit of a lift, particularly as we continue to grow the storage business as well as the networking business. So as you know, those businesses have a healthier margin profile. So as we continue to grow those, we should see some lift there. And then the other -- the only other major comment I'd make is on the ES business, again we saw great performance in the first quarter margins at 5.1%, up 210 basis points year-over-year. So the efforts of the team continues to execute upon as their transforming that business that we and the seasonality in that business we would expect those margins to improve over the course of the year and settle on average in the range of 6% to 7% as we talked about at the Analyst Meeting in September."

And I think your question is can we see accelerated growth. I think we just are a little concerned about the macroeconomic environment. We saw a slowdown in the U.S. in the last 3 weeks of January. Linearity to be back on track, but it's early in the game. And so I think we're just being a bit cautious year. We've like our product portfolio, we like our go-to-market changes we like our innovation engine. There's a lot of things that we're feeling very good about that the macro environment still has pockets of weakness. Russia continues to be a big challenge to the Ukraine, parts of Latin America, China right now for us is doing really well but that can change in any minute.

And we're working through some final Chinese regulatory approval, so all the U.S. approvals have been received et cetera only the China regulatory remains the call that the CSRC, which is a bit like our SEC. And there's been a couple of things going on there. One is they have a new head of the CSR C. Two, there is a big backlog of appeals and they're working through those that backlog. But we feel confident -- we expect that deal to close by the end of May. As you can imagine, we've been in contact with all the appropriate regulatory people. And, obviously, our partners at Tsinghua. So that's the way we think about it right now. There's also, as you know, a fair amount of volatility in the markets in China and I think that frankly, is slowing things down a little bit in China. And btw, the H3C revenue over there is doing great. We had a record revenue for our China networking business. And I take that as a positive sign. It means that the Chinese government is still leaning into HVC and that product and that business it has been well received in the China market."

Actually not that dissimilar from what I believe Cisco or referred to on their call. And I don't have a good explanation of that, except for 1 or 2 things. One is, remember the opening week in the market in 2016 was really tough, right? And I think companies are quite now extra sensitive to volatility in the market. There quite quick to be cautious and pulled back purchases. From a vertical perspective, obviously, the weakest perspective was oil and natural gas. We saw that across the board in a lot of our oil and gas natural customers are in the United States, so that was a challenge and will probably continue. What I will say is while I'm conscious about it, it looks like February has returned to the linearity that we would have expected. Oil and natural gas continues to be a bit weak but there's some visit some other parts so I'm not quite sure what happened to those last 3 weeks but that would be my guess. Turning to Aruba and why it has helped our networking switch business. It's because customers now believe we're complete the committed to the networking business I mean, we are all in all, networking and while we had HP networking before, I think people thought well, maybe they're not 100% committed maybe a bit below scale below the acquisition of Aruba. They did a great deal of confidence in our product road map and our commitment to the business. And so Aruba, I think has cast a really nice glow over the rest of our HP networking business."

On the quarterly free cash flow, we're not going to guide on a quarterly basis. But if you think about it obviously, first quarter for us is seasonally low, and that's primarily driven by earning seasonality, right, which is, driven by the profiles and DS and the software as well as the timing of that bonus payment which happens in the first quarter of every year it's a onetime payment. So we saw that same seasonality last year. Now going forward, what I would say is in -- we're going to get improvements every quarter in primarily 4 areas: one, earnings improvement so obviously, we are back and loaded from an earnings perspective particularly in the second half. So as those earnings improve obviously, our free cash flow will improve; the bonus payment is behind us now so that is no longer a drag as you go forward. The cash conversion cycle, I mean we were disappointed that the 31 days but when you look at the fundamentals of our terms and mix we're confident that, that will get back to the mid-20 day range sold that will drive a significant amount of improvement. And then lastly, the separation. So it to Tony's question, we had $600 million of separation charges planned for the year. We paid out $300 million of that in the first quarter. So that becomes less of a drag. So as we progressed through every quarter similar to last year, you will see improvement.

So I think there's a couple of things going on here. One, is the first quarter of constant currency revenue growth. Not a huge amount, 0.1% but relative to from where we come from the businesses given us a lot of confidence if the first quarter of constant currency revenue growth since Q3 of FY '12. And ABS, which is happens to have a higher level of profitability than ITO, posted second consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth FES as I've mentioned that's our cloud, Big Data, security practices rule over 30% year-over-year in Q1. And we saw some benefits from strong strategic enterprise signings in FY '15. I think we have also worked through the vast majority of the key account revenue runoff that we've talked about for the last couple of years. This were 3 or 4 very big ES customers that have now really run off and have become quite predictable. And then I got to give the finance team and operations team in ES credit. We are much better now at forecasting revenue than we have been. It's a very granular account by account forecast profit -- forecast of revenue by type of practice. And that gives us a lot of confidence. So as we sit here today and we look at the landscape and we see a book-to-bill ratio of roughly 1, we feel good about that negative 2% to flat."

And so it is interesting to note how different HP and Dell we have taken very different strategies in this environment. There's no question and my view of this is predicated upon the speed that this market is changing. And so we decided to get smaller while they got bigger we decided to lean into new technology while there doubling down on old technology and a cost take out play. They levered up while we delevered. And we're super focused on being fast and nimble for our customers. So both strategies we work I happen to like our hand better than the Dell EMC hand. So how are we taking advantage of the disruption in the marketplace? So we learned a lot about how to do this in the context of IBM sale of their server business to Lenovo. We have a very focused channel play where we actually, it's called Smart Choice, and we have a big opportunity to go take the Dell and EMC business much as we have taken a lot of the Lenovo business that would have gone to Lenovo. And so we're seeing good results in the marketplace. We're rolling out our full sail efforts you're going to start to see even more advertising and digital as you capitalize on another one to two years of uncertainty as this deal closes and we work through the integration. The other thing is as you think about it, we continue to invest in innovation. And you have to think about Dell EMC as many ways owned by private equity and you can do your own calculation on when you think that debt is going through that, that interest payments is going to be for perspective, the entire EMC R&D budget is $2.7 billion. So we feel good about our hand to different strategies but I like where we are. In regards to M&A. As I said, we -- our first priority is organic innovation and are starting to see that innovation engine really kick into gear. And we started this if you'll remember 4 years ago, as we cut costs over the last 4 years, almost every single quarter year-over-year we spent more money on innovation and it's paying off. That doesn't say we won't do acquisitions. But I would rate the rate, it's returns based in the focused on companies like 3PAR, like 3Com, like Aruba, but our complement very technology, that fit into our overall 4 transformation areas as we go forward. So I think we're -- we got the right strategy here. We're thoughtful about it. But if the right acquisition comes along and we feel like the price is appropriate, we'll go ahead and do it."

So what we've heard from customers is there's almost universal acceptance of their environments will be hybrid. And there's almost universal acceptance that it has to start with an analysis of the apps. How many apps that the customer want to have? Is there opportunities to reduce the number of apps and consolidate? And then what do you want that apt to be on? Some apps are going to say locked down on the customers data center, untouched by anyone's hands other than their own employees. But some apps will go to a private cloud on-prem, a virtual private cloud, a managed private cloud and then obviously, to the private cloud. And we're seeing workloads move. Because even going from a traditional data center to the private cloud can be a 20% to 30% savings to a customer for that workload, which is meaningful. So as you know, we are the leader in private cloud. It is the first step that many customers take. And then they think okay, what would I like? What of my apps I like to have in a virtual Private cloud in the managed cloud. I think there is on from the sender only apps to Private cloud, BBC, NBC and ultimately to the public cloud. So one of the other things we're doing here is developing our multi-cloud management layer or one payment flash or orchestration automation of your multi-cloud environment. How do you deploy workloads to these different clouds quickly and efficiently? So I think we've got the right strategy here. I think it was smart to get out of our spending on public cloud. I think that game has moved to as you are and AWS, and maybe someday Google. And we're really pleased with our Azure partnership, so that's working well. The other thing that I would say is recall, is that we had built our cloud operation on Helion OpenStack. And our version 2.0 of what we call HOS, Helion OpenStack 2.0 is a significant improvement from 1.1 where we had some install or challenges, so we're getting a lot of good feedback around HOS 2.0 as well as our carrier-grade OpenStack, which is of course, of interest to the telcos. We had a very good Mobile World Congress show. I was there for 3 days and our open NFC solutions, we had 60 PLCs across the globe and a couple of very big customer wins. So I feel like we're on the right strategy. The world is changing at a breakneck speed, but we feel good about our strategy and I feel good actually about having chosen OpenStack. Two or 3 years ago, I was getting a little concerned because I wasn't sure how fast OpenStack was going to mature, but it seems like it's finally hitting many of the curve in the adult supervision and the number of big companies have provided that's actually helping."

Hence, HPE synergy, which allows the developer to basically compose the infrastructure they need for their app. So HPE synergy isn't exactly cloud by any stretch of the imagination here, but it is in fact, the next generation of infrastructure for the software-defined data center. I would also say that we are gaining share in that market. There's no question about it. We did a great job I think in grabbing share from Lenovo as I said earlier when their servers moved from IBM, and we're all over this Dell EMC opportunity. So in a flat to declining market which probably core servers are at least over the next 5 years, we have to gain share. But there are real pockets of growth in the market as well. And HPC by the way, outperforms compute, we're like the last man standing there and we're investing in HPC, and it's a core competency for the company."

Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We've now completed our first full quarter as an independent company, and we're off to a very strong start.

We've now completed our first full quarter as an independent company, and we're off to a very strong start. We are already seeing the benefits of being a smaller, more focused and agile company across a number of fronts. Our customers and partners understand our strategy and appreciate working with the simplified faster moving organization. Our employees are engaged and aligned. 
For example, we've created a single pan HPE sales training and account-planning program, which has already uncovered over 100 accounts, where there are significant untapped cross-selling opportunities. Our innovation engine is firing on all cylinders, and you're going to see some amazing new introductions in the coming quarters in key areas of the portfolio, including servers, cloud, high-performance computing, IoT, all-flash storage, Aruba and converged systems. 
For our shareholders, this focus is driving strong financial and operational performance. In Q1, we delivered our third consecutive quarter of growth in constant currency, with revenue of $12.7 billion, up 4% year-over-year. And when you exclude the impact from recent M&A activities, we grew revenue on a constant-currency basis in every one of our business segments for the first time since Q4 fiscal year '10. 
At the same time, we continue to make progress on our cost structure, particularly in ES and delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.41, at the top end of our previously provided range. Delivering strong cash flow is also a key priority for us. While Q1 was impacted by seasonality, separation payments and timing, we expect cash flow to improve as we move through the year and remained confident in our full year free cash flow outlook of $2 billion to $2.2 billion. 
Tim will walk through the specific Q1 cash flow drivers in a minute. Finally, in line with our commitment to return cash to our shareholders, in Q1, we paid $1.3 billion, including $1.2 billion for share repurchases and nearly $100 million in dividends. As a result, we've already exceeded our FY '16 commitment of returning at least 50% of expected free cash flow to shareholders. And share repurchases will remain our preferred method to return cash to shareholders given the current market conditions. Overall, while there is more work to do to accelerate top line growth, align our cost structure and drive even closer collaboration and integration across our organization, I'm very pleased with where we stand today. 
Now let me turn to business performance. We had another strong quarter in Enterprise Group, with revenue up 7% year-over-year in constant currency. Our portfolio is truly the best we've had in years and is driving strong customer traction. For example, today, HPE is the leading infrastructure provider for SAP HANA with nearly twice the number of shipments over the next competitor. And this quarter, we won a number of important deals, including 1 with Canadian communications company, Rogers, to help them transform their existing traditional IT to a hybrid infrastructure. We will provide a comprehensive solution, including converged systems, cloud systems, StoreOnce 3PAR all-flash and technology services.
We also signed a multiyear agreement with one of the world's largest food producers, JBS, to help them build an IT environment that supports faster business expansion, including consolidating their data centers and moving to the cloud. And just last week, at Mobile World Congress, we announced that Swisscom, Switzerland's leading telecommunications provider, will deploy new virtual network functions using HPE open NFC solutions. 
This customer momentum is driving financial results and each of our hardware business units performed well in Q1. In servers, we delivered 5% year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, maintained strong margins and also continued to make R&D investments. While we won't chase share for shares' sake, we continue to see significant growth opportunities ahead as the clear market leader with the most comprehensive portfolio of offerings, our mission-critical and High Performance Computing to our new IoT and Cloudline solutions. 
Storage had another strong quarter, with revenue up 3% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by continued strength in 3PAR. Converge storage grew 17% year-over-year in constant currency and is now a solid 56% of storage revenue. We had record revenue for 3PAR, driven by triple digit constant-currency growth in all-flash, which grew at 3x the market rate. With the industry-leading all-flash product and the broadest reach to our channel, we expect to gain share for the ninth quarter in a row in calendar Q4. 
Turning to networking. The significant actions we took last year are paying off, and we are very pleased with the performance overall. Networking revenue grew 62% year-over-year in constant currency. Normalized for the Aruba acquisition, revenue grew double digits, driven by record China revenue as well as good performance in other regions. As we've discussed before, we are seeing strength in China as customers anticipate the completion of the deal with Tsinghua, that we announced last year. 
We are currently working through the final regulatory approval in China, and we expect the deal to close by the end of May. Aruba also grew double digits at an operational level, and we saw strong pull through of HPE's switching portfolio to compliment Aruba's wireless offerings. Technology Services revenue was down 3% in constant currency although TS support performed better. Total orders grew year-over-year, excluding China where we are seeing some customers delaying renewals until the Tsinghua transaction closes. 
Unlike networking or servers, these are long-term contracts and we believe some customers are waiting to work directly with the new entity. We also saw constant currency double-digit order growth in new solutions like Datacenter Care and Proactive Care. We expect TS performance to improve throughout the year, driven by a better mix of new, faster growing support solutions. 
In cloud, following a major wave of product releases across our HPE Helion portfolio in the second half of 2015, we are seeing strong customer traction. In fact, since separation, Helion has gained over 200 customer wins, including some of the world's largest banks, service providers and industrials. This momentum reinforces our belief that our strategy of helping customers transform to a hybrid infrastructure is a winning approach for us. 
Enterprise Services continues to execute well against its turnaround strategy. ES is building building a more diversified customer base, stabilizing revenue and significantly reducing its cost structure. For example, during the quarter, we grew new business TCV by 4% year-over-year in constant currency. This includes an agreement with Sabre to provide virtualization, automation and security services, hardware and software to support faster product development and extend Sabre's position in the global travel industry. And it includes an agreement with Avon to transform key elements of the leading beauty companies global IT infrastructure by offering a dedicated data center services, cross functional support, network management and security services. 
This builds on the progress we've made over the past 3 years. Remember that in FY '13, just 3 customers made up approximately 65% of ES operating profit. Today, no account makes up more than 10%. We also continued to make progress on our cost structure by exiting high cost data centers, improving low-cost location mix and rebalancing our workforce. As a result, Q1 revenue grew slightly in constant currency, marking the first quarter with constant currency growth since Q3 of '12. 
We also had our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. Q1 operating margin of 5.1%, improved 2.1 points year-over-year, driven largely by delivery cost actions. Overall, I believe we are taking the right steps to achieve our long-term goal of a sustainable market competitive cost structure with a 7% to 9% operating profit margin. In Software, we continue to make progress, aligning the portfolio and go to market to our 4 transformation areas, increasing efficiency and accelerating fast. 
This has included the divestiture of several software businesses that were not core to our strategy, including iManage, LiveVault and TippingPoint, which we expect to close later this month. In Q1, software returned to growth with revenue up 1% in constant currency when adjusted for recent M&A activity. The ADM ITOM business was down slightly in current currency as continued headwinds in license and support were nearly offset by professional services and record revenue growth in SaaS, which grew over 20% year-on-year. Big Data was strong with revenue up double digits when normalized for currency and divestitures, driven by triple digit growth in vertical license. 
Security performance was also strong across both license and SaaS. Financial Services continues to provide our customers with the financing flexibility they need to take on their biggest IT challenges. At the same time, the team does a great job managing this business to minimize our risk and maximize our return. Financial services revenue grew 3% in constant currency in Q1 and financing volume also increased to 3% year-over-year. 
Before I hand it over to Tim to provide further insight into the financials, I want to highlight some of the exciting product announcements from the quarter. One of the most important benefits of being a smaller more focused company is that we're able to be very targeted in our investments and to even more effectively put our resources towards the most important, high-potential opportunities that support our strategy. As we discussed before, we prioritize organic investments to maintain a strong technology pipeline. At Discover in December, we unveiled HPE Synergy, a new category of infrastructure designed to run both traditional and cloud-native applications for organizations running a hybrid infrastructure. 
Synergy, powered by our 1D [ph] software, represents a critical step in delivering our vision for hybrid infrastructure. We also introduced our new IoT Edgeline systems and Aruba networking centers, specifically designed to help customers more specifically collect, process and analyze IoT data. The new solutions are key elements of our strategy of delivering more connectivity and computing power at the network edge, and you can expect more IoT announcements coming up this year. 
And in January, HP expanded its network function virtualization portfolio. We announced HPE Service Director, a new end-to-end service operation solution, designed to help communication service providers manage services in NFC deployments by bridging traditional and new virtualized environments. In addition to organic investments, we are also investing in key partnerships. In January, HPE and Scality announced an enhanced partnership designed to accelerate the adoption of software-defined storage. And we announced a new partnership with Microsoft, appointing Azure as a preferred public cloud partner for HPE customers. While HPE now serves as a preferred partner in providing infrastructure and services for Microsoft's hybrid cloud offerings.
As a result of this commitment to innovation, our products and services are being recognized as leaders in the industry. For example, we are now named a leader in 26 different Gartner Magic Quadrants including Integrated Systems, Modular Servers, Storage Disk Arrays and Wired and Wireless infrastructure. Forrester has ranked Enterprise Services as a leader in workplace services and positioned HPE as a leader in its recent private cloud report and IDC ranked us a the leader in application modernization services. Looking forward, you can expect this momentum and investment and innovation to continue. Later this month, we will announce a new market changing hyper-converged offering based on our industry-leading ProLiant virtualization server. 
Our new solution will offer customers installation in minutes, a consumer-inspired, simple, mobile-ready user experience and automated IT operations, all at 20% lower cost than Nutanix. We believe this new system will allow us to quickly become a top player in the $5 billion high growth hyper-converged market. Also later this month, we will refresh our server portfolio to include a game changing new technology called Persistent Memory, which was invented by our server group. 
This new technology will enable an ecosystem of new applications supporting non-volatile memory and is a key milestone on our journey to the machine. So overall, I'm very pleased with our first quarter as an independent company. We are already seeing the benefits of being a smaller, more focused organization, and I'm excited about what's ahead. 
On that note, I will hand the call over to Tim"

Good afternoon, everyone. We have now completed our first quarter as a stand-alone company and overall, I'm pleased with our performance. As part of the separation process, we developed a clear financial architecture for HPE, where each busin",1980,"Thanks, Meg. Good afternoon, everyone. We have now completed our first quarter as a stand-alone company and overall, I'm pleased with our performance. As part of the separation process, we developed a clear financial architecture for HPE, where each business segment has a specific role in driving overall company performance. 
Enterprise Group is our growth engine. Enterprise Services is committed to stabilizing revenue and expanding margins. Software provides high margins and strong cash flow. And financial services provides a consistent annuity-based revenue stream. 
After only 1 quarter, it's already clear that each business is executing against this framework and as a result, it is driving solid financial performance at the HPE level. First quarter revenue was $12.7 billion, down 2.5% year-over-year, but up 3.8% in constant currency. And as Meg said, this marks our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth. Clearly, currency was a significant headwind this quarter. You might recall that we saw the most significant movement in currencies during our first fiscal quarter last year, which drove a large rate translation impact this year and a total currency impact of 6 points year-over-year. 
Going forward, currency will still be a significant impact in Q2 and then moderate in the second half, and we still anticipate a currency headwind of approximately 3 points to revenue for the full year. Looking at performance by geography. We had some challenges in the Americas, which grew 1% year-over-year in constant currency, with increased weakness in January, particularly in U.S. hardware, as macro uncertainty caused a slowdown in global account spending. 
EMEA delivered growth of 4% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by balanced growth across EG hardware. APJ saw the best growth at 9% year-over-year in constant currency due to strengthened servers and record China networking revenue. The gross margin was 28.4%, down 1.2 points sequentially due to normal seasonality and up 70 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven continued productivity improvements in Enterprise Services. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $2.6 billion were up 3%year-over-year, driven by R&D as we continue to make targeted investments. 
Non-GAAP operating profit was 8.1%, down 1.5 points sequentially and down 40 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.41, at the top of our guided range. Non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pretax charges of $311 million for restructuring charges, $218 million for amortization of intangible assets and $79 million for separation costs. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.15, $0.02 above our previously provided outlook range of $0.09 to $0.13 due primarily to tax indemnification adjustments related to the separation. 
Free cash flow was negative $831 million, down 70% year-on-year on an adjusted basis that reflects the estimated HPE contribution to the combined HP company free cash flow last year. As we discussed during the Q4 earnings call, Q1 is usually our lowest cash flow quarter, due primarily to earnings seasonality in ES and Software as well as normal annual bonus compensation payments. You can see the seasonal pattern in our adjusted fiscal '15 results, when our free cash flow for Q1 was a use of approximately $500 million. In addition to normal seasonality, in Q1 '16, we had higher separation payments year-over-year, which are now largely compete and higher usage of working capital. 
Let me explain what's happening with working capital. The cash conversion cycle was 31 days, up 8 days sequentially. This was above our targeted levels of mid-20 days, primarily due to payables that were impacted by intra-quarter purchasing linearity and strategic buys that provide an economic benefit to the company. These items are largely timing related, and we continue to more aggressively manage our working capital and expect the cash conversion cycle to improve throughout the year and return to our targeted levels. With all that in mind, we remain committed to our free cash flow outlook of $2 billion to $2.2 billion for the full year. 
Turning to capital allocation. In the first quarter, we paid approximately $1.2 billion for share repurchases, including $1.1 billion through an accelerated share repurchase program and an additional $132 million on the open market as part of our ongoing share repurchase program. 
We also distributed $96 million as part of our normal dividend. To date, we have already returned over 60% of our free cash flow outlook to shareholders, and now we are raising our commitment and expect to return at least 100% of our free cash flow outlook to shareholders in fiscal year '16. 
Separately, as Meg noted, we expect the Tsinghua transaction to close near the end of May. When the deal closes, we expect to receive cash of just over $2 billion that is net of some initial tax on the sale. We are planning to use the vast majority of this cash to opportunistically repurchase shares. The timing of the repurchases may not be linear and will be dependent on several factors, including market conditions and availability of U.S. cash. 
Now turning to the business results. The Enterprise Group delivered healthy growth and stable profitability, in line with our financial architecture. As Meg discussed, we are investing in innovation across EG to deliver best-in-class solutions in growing markets, while maintaining cost discipline and solid profitability. Revenue grew 1% year-over-year as reported or 7% in constant currency with strength across all hardware groups. Profitability was down 1.8 points to 13.4%, primarily due to FX and to a lesser extent product mix. 
Servers revenue was down 1% year-over-year as reported, but grew 5% in constant currency. Growth was driven by strong Tier 1 and by core sales in both EMEA and APJ. This was somewhat offset by pressure in the Americas towards the end of the quarter. Our R&D investments continue to pay off with our industry-leading offerings in high-performance compute that now exceeds the $1 billion run rate and strong double-digit growth in mission-critical x86 servers. 
Looking forward, we continue to see opportunities for profitable revenue growth and share expansion in the server market. We have the most comprehensive and compelling server portfolio with solutions for every workload. And we are aggressively taking advantage of the uncertainty in the markets surrounding our competitors. Storage revenue declined 3% year-on-year as reported, but grew 3% in constant currency. The unified 3PAR architecture combined with our excellent channel partnerships continues to drive revenue growth and share gains while our competitors are distracted and contracting. 3PAR all-flash grew triple digits again, driving 3PAR revenue growth of 21% year-over-year in constant currency, significantly outperforming the market. 3PAR plus XP plus EVA was up 15% year-over-year in constant currency. 
We estimate that we've gained solid market share in the fourth calendar quarter and expect storage to continue to be a growth driver in constant currency throughout the remainder of the year. Networking revenue grew 54% year-over-year as reported or 62% in constant currency and expanded operating margins, driven by the acquisition of Aruba and strong execution across all regions. When adjusted for Aruba, networking revenue was still up double digits in constant currency. 
The Aruba acquisition continues to prove to be a key strategic move for HPE and has transformed our networking business. Consistent with our acquisition strategy, Aruba continues to drive growth in wireless and has also been integral and returning switching to double-digit growth year-over-year. ES revenue declined 9% year-over-year as reported or 3% in constant currency. However, approximately 1 point of the decline was due to the discontinuation of HPI-related service contracts that were supported by TS last year. Encouragingly, TS support which has significantly higher margins and consulting, continue to stabilize and revenue was only down 2% year-over-year in constant currency, including the HPI impact. 
Orders were down slightly in constant currency, but up, excluding China, where signings have been delayed ahead of the Tsinghua deal close date. Enterprise Services executed well against its plan to stabilize the top line and expand margins. Revenue declined 6% year-over-year, but grew slightly in constant currency. Applications in business services, which you'll recall is the higher-margin business within ES, continue to improve with the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, driven by strong apps performance and stabilization and business process services. Strategic Enterprise Services revenue was up double-digits year-on-year with strong growth in Helion-managed cloud. 
Overall, TCB was up nearly 30% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by strong renewals as well as growth in new logos and add-ons. ES operating profit improved 2.1 points year-over-year to 5.1% as the team continued to execute productivity improvements and delivering on sales and improved new deal profitability. We also had a benefit from a onetime divestiture of a noncore business. We continue to make progress against the cost take out plan we laid out at our Analyst Meeting. 
We now have approximately 45% of our workforce in low-cost locations and are well on our way to our longer-term goal of 60%. Given the progress we have made on bookings and cost improvements, along with our normal quarterly seasonality, we remain confident in our full-year operating profit outlook of 6% to 7% and revenue of down 2% to flat year-over-year in constant currency. Software executed well in the quarter, improving revenue and delivering strong profitability while continuing to become more tightly integrated with the rest of the HPE portfolio and go-to-market approach. 
Revenue declined 10% year-over-year as reported or 6% in constant currency, but was up 1% when adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures in constant currency. We saw strong performance in Big Data and also some growth in security, offset by declines in IT management. SaaS had a very good quarter growing double digits in constant currency when adjusted for divestitures, driven by ADM, ICOM [ph] and security. 
Operating profit was 17.4%, down 60 basis points year-over-year due primarily to currency and higher mix of professional services. The team continues to focus on disciplined cost controls, but is still making strategic R&D investments in growth areas that align well with the broader HPE portfolio. In financial services, revenue declined 3% year-over-year, but grew 3% in constant currency as we began to see more impact from the volume growth we delivered last year. Financing volume in the quarter declined 4% year-over-year, but was up 3% in constant currency. Operating profit improved 1.7 points year-over-year to 12.9% as we were able to adjust bad debt reserves to reflect the improved loss rates and our high-quality portfolio. 
Return on equity was up 1 point year-over-year to 18.1%. Now turning to our outlook. We will not formally update our fiscal year '16 outlook for the impact of Tsinghua transaction until after it closes, but I wanted to give you some information about how to think about the potential impact. We now anticipate the deal will close near the end of May and expect the transaction will impact fiscal year '16 EPS operationally by approximately $0.05. 
This includes some stranded costs from corporate administrative functions that we will mitigate in the near term. After the transaction closes, we will update our fiscal year '16 free cash flow and EPS outlook, including any expected benefit from share repurchases made with the sale proceeds. Also, we do have an EPS benefit from our share repurchases completed in Q1 and still feel confident in the underlying operating performance of the business. But it's too early in the year to change our full-year outlook given the softness in January and near-term market uncertainty. 
With that in mind, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.39 to $0.43 in Q2 2016, and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.13 to $0.17 in Q2 2016, and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.85. 
Now let's open it up for questions."

So we still saw significant pressure from a FX perspective when you look at the first quarter. Going out for the rest of the year, we would expect the margins to stabilize and maybe get a little bit of a lift, particularly as we continue to grow the storage business as well as the networking business. So as you know, those businesses have a healthier margin profile. So as we continue to grow those, we should see some lift there. And then, the other -- the only other major comment I'd make is on the ES business again we saw some great performance there in the first quarter. Margins at 5.1%, up 210 basis points year-over-year. So the efforts of the team continues to execute upon as they are transforming that business and the seasonality in that business. We would expect those margins to improve over the course of the year and settle on average in the range of 6% to 7% as we talked about at the Analyst Meeting in September."

And given where the stock price has been trading, this is one of the best return on investments that we can actually make. And as I said, when we were on our roadshow for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, our first choice is, from an integration perspective is, organic innovation. Look at the success of the 3, 4 all-flash storage array, internally homegrown, growing 3x the rate of the market and gives a benefit of the common architecture from top to bottom. The benefit of doing organic innovation is you don't end up with the Frankenstein of architectures. The second choice would be acquisitions that look like 3PAR, 3COM and Aruba. These have been very successful acquisitions for us. They are additional complementary technology that goes to our excellent distribution system. But again, where the stock is trading right now, we think that this makes a lot of sense to buy back shares, which is why we've decided to go to 100% of the free cash flow."

But do you think you have that visibility? Because the reason why I ask is Tim also mentioned visibility in January. And obviously, we can see what the markets have been doing in the macro. So I'm kind of curious as to how we see sustainable growth in the business. And then also, just for Tim, on the Enterprise Services margin guidance, kind of the growth guidance for this year, given the contract value growth, given the mix shift you're seeing in the business, the cost changes you're putting through very well, why isn't -- the guidance, it seems, for Enterprise Services is now very conservative. So is there some caution you're reflecting in that guidance in the balance of the year on the Enterprise Services side specifically?"

And I think your question is, can we see accelerated growth? I think we just are a little concerned about the macroeconomic environment. We saw a slowdown in the U.S. in the last 3 weeks of January. Linearity appears to be back on track, but it's early in the game. And so I think we're just being a bit cautious here. We like our product portfolio, we like our go-to-market changes, we like our innovation engine. There's a lot of things that we're feeling very good about, but the macroeconomic environment still has pockets of weakness. Russia continues to be a big challenge, the Ukraine, parts of Latin America. China right now, for us, is doing well, but that can change at any minute. So we feel great about the stated goal of growth in constant currencies, and let's see how the macroeconomic and sort of the political environment changes over time."

So you recall, we originally thought this would close roughly at the end of February, and now we are confident that the deal is going to close near the end of May. And we're working through some final Chinese regulatory approval. So all the U.S. approvals have been received, CFIUS, et cetera. Only the China's Securities Regulatory Committee remains, and they call that the CSRC in China, which is a bit like our SEC. And there's been a couple of things going on there. One is they have a new head of the CSRC. Two, there is a big backlog of deals, and they're working through those -- that backlog. But we feel confident. We expect that deal to close at the end of May. As you can imagine, we've been in contact with all the appropriate regulatory people, and obviously, our partners at Tsinghua. So that's the way we think about it right now. You -- there's also, as you know, a fair amount of volatility in the markets in China, and I think that, frankly, is slowing things down a little bit in China. And by the way, the H3C revenue over there is doing great. We had a record revenue for our China networking business, and I'd take that as a positive sign. It means that the Chinese government is still leaning into H3C, and that product and that business is being well received in the China market."

Actually, not that dissimilar from what, I believe, Cisco referred to on their call. And I don't have a good explanation of that, except for 1 or 2 things. One is, remember, the opening week in the market in 2016 was really tough, right? And I think companies are quite now extra sensitive to volatility in the market. They're quite quick to be cautious and pull back purchases. From a vertical perspective, obviously, the weakest vertical was oil and natural gas. We saw that across the board, and a lot of our oil and natural gas customers are in the United States, so that was a challenge and will probably continue. What I will say is while I'm cautious about it, it looks like February has returned to the linearity that we would have expected. Oil and natural gas continues to be a bit weak, but there's been some strength in other parts. So I'm not quite sure what happened in those last 3 weeks, but that would be my guess. Turning to Aruba and why it has helped our networking switch business. It's because the customers now believe we're completely committed to the networking business. I mean, we are all in on networking. And while we had HP networking before, I think people thought, well, maybe they're not 100% committed, maybe a bit below scale. With the acquisition of Aruba, they've gained a great deal of confidence in our product road map and in our commitment to the business. And so Aruba, I think, has cast a really nice glow over the rest of our HP networking business."

On the quarterly free cash flow, we're not going to guide on a quarterly basis.

On the quarterly free cash flow, we're not going to guide on a quarterly basis. But if you think about it, obviously, first quarter for us is seasonally low, and that's primarily driven by earnings seasonality, right, which is driven by the profiles in ES and software, as well as the timing of that bonus payment, which happens in the first quarter of every year. It's a onetime payment. So we saw that same seasonality last year. Now going forward, what I would say is in -- we're going to get improvements every quarter in primarily 4 areas. One, earnings improvement. So obviously, we are back-end loaded from an earnings perspective, particularly in the second half. So as those earnings improve, obviously, our free cash flow will improve. The bonus payment's behind us now, so that is no longer a drag as you go forward. The cash conversion cycle, I mean, we were disappointed with the 31 days, but when you look at the fundamentals of our terms and mix, we're confident that, that will get back to the mid-20-day range, so that will drive a significant amount of improvement. And then lastly, the separation. So to Toni's question, we had $600 million of separation charges planned for the year. We paid out $300 million of that in the first quarter, so that becomes less of a drag. So as we progress through every quarter, similar to the last year, you will see improvement. So I think if you look at the seasonality of last year, that would probably give you a pretty good reflection of how it may play out this year."

So I think there's a couple of things going on here. One is this is the first quarter of constant currency revenue growth. Not a huge amount, 0.1%, but relative to from whence we've come in that businesses, that's given us a lot of confidence. It's first quarter of constant currency revenue growth since Q3 of FY '12. And ABS, which happens to have a higher level of profitability than ITO, posted its second consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth. SES, as I mentioned, that's our cloud, Big Data, security practices, grew over 30% year-over-year in Q1. And we saw some benefits from strong strategic Enterprise Services signings in FY '15. I think we have also worked through the vast majority of the key account revenue runoff that we've talked about for the last couple of years. These were 3 or 4 very big ES customers that have now really run off and have become quite predictable. And then I got to give the finance team and the operations team in ES credit. We are much better now at forecasting revenue than we have been. It's a very granular account-by-account forecast profit -- forecast of revenue by type of practice. And that gives us a lot of confidence. So as we sit here today and we look out at the landscape and we see a book-to-bill ratio of roughly 1, we feel good about that negative 2% to flat."

So it is interesting to note how different -- HP and Dell, we have taken very different strategies in this environment. There's no question. And my view of this is predicated upon the speed that this market is changing. And so we decided to get smaller while they got bigger. We decided to lean into new technology while they're doubling down on old technology and a cost takeout play. They levered up while we delevered. And we're super focused on being fast and nimble for our customers. So both strategies may work. I happen to like our hand better than the Dell-EMC hand. So how are we taking advantage of the disruption in the marketplace? So we learned a lot about how to do this in the context of the IBM sale of their server business to Lenovo. We have a very focused channel play where we -- actually, it's called Smart Choice, and we have a big opportunity to go take Dell and EMC business much as we took a lot of the Lenovo business that would have gone to Lenovo. And so we're seeing good results in the marketplace. We're rolling out our full sales efforts. You're going to start to see even more advertising and digital as we capitalize on another 1 to 2 years of uncertainty as this deal closes and they work through the integration. The other thing is, as you think about it, we continue to invest in innovation. And you have to think about, Dell-EMC, in many ways, is owned by private equity, and you can do your own calculation on what you think that debt is going to -- the debt interest payments are going to be. For perspective, the entire EMC R&D budget is $2.7 billion. So we feel good about our hand. Two completely different strategies but I like where we are. In regards to M&A. As I said, we -- our first priority is organic innovation, and you're starting to see that innovation engine really kick into gear. And we started this, Steve, you'll remember, 4 years ago. As we cut costs over the last 4 years, almost every single quarter year-over-year, we spent more money on innovation, and it's paying off. That doesn't say we won't do acquisitions. But I would reiterate, it's returns-based and it is focused on companies like 3PAR, like 3Com, like Aruba that are complementary technology that fit into our overall 4 transformation areas as we go forward. So I think we're -- we've got the right strategy here. We're thoughtful about it. But if the right acquisition comes along and we feel like the price is appropriate, we'll go ahead and do it."

So what we're hearing from customers is there's almost universal acceptance that their environments will be hybrid.

So what we're hearing from customers is there's almost universal acceptance that their environments will be hybrid. And there's almost universal acceptance that it has to start with an analysis of the apps. How many apps does a customer want to have? Is there opportunities to reduce the number of apps and consolidate? And then what instantiation do you want that app to be on? Some apps are going to stay locked down in the customer's data center, untouched by anyone's hands other than their own employees, but some apps will go to a private cloud on-prem, a virtual private cloud, a managed private cloud, and then, obviously, to the public cloud. And we're seeing workloads move. Because even going from a traditional data center to the private cloud can be a 20% to 30% savings to a customer for that workload, which is meaningful. So as you know, we are the leader in private cloud. It is the first step that many customers take. And then, they think, okay, what would I like? What of my apps would I like to have in a virtual private cloud and a managed cloud? I think there is an inexorable march on data center-only apps to private cloud, VPC, MPC, and ultimately, to the public cloud. So one of the other things we're doing here is developing our multi-cloud management layer, our one pane of glass, our orchestration and automation of your multi-cloud environment. How do you deploy workloads to these different clouds quickly and efficiently? So I think we've got the right strategy here. I think it was smart to get out of our spending on public cloud. I think that game has moved to Azure and AWS and maybe, someday, Google. And we're really pleased with our Azure partnership. So that's working well. The other thing I would say is, recall that we have built our cloud operation on Helion OpenStack. And our version 2.0 of what we call HOS, Helion OpenStack 2.0, is a significant improvement from 1.1, where we had some installer challenges. So we're getting a lot of good feedback around HOS 2.0 as well as our carrier-grade OpenStack, which is of course, of interest to the telcos. We had a very good Mobile World Congress show. I was there for 3 days, and our open NFE solution, we have 60 POCs across the globe and a couple of very big customer wins. So I feel like we're on the right strategy. The world's changing at a breakneck speed, but we feel good about our strategy, and I feel good, actually, about having chosen OpenStack. 2 or 3 years ago, I was getting a little concerned because I wasn't sure how fast OpenStack was going to mature, but it seems like it's finally hitting the knee of the curve, and the adult supervision that a number of big companies have provided is actually helping."

Hence, HPE Synergy, which allows a developer to basically compose the infrastructure they need for their app. So HPE Synergy isn't exactly cloud by any stretch of the imagination, but it is, in fact, the next generation of infrastructure for the software-defined data center. I would also say that we are gaining share in that market. There's no question about it. We did a great job, I think, in grabbing share from Lenovo, as I said earlier, when the servers moved from IBM, and we are all over this Dell-EMC opportunity. So in a flat to declining market, which probably core servers are, at least over the next 5 years, we have to gain share. But there are real pockets of growth in the market as well. And HPC by the way, high-performance compute, we're like the last man standing there. And we're investing in HPC, and it's a core competency for the company."

We've now completed our first full quarter as an independent company, and we're off to a very strong start. We are already seeing the benefits of being a smaller, more focused and agile company across a number of fronts. Our customers and partners understand our strategy and appreciate working with a simplified faster moving organization. Our employees are engaged and aligned. 
For example, we've created a single pan HPE sales training and account-planning program, which has already uncovered over 100 accounts, where there are significant untapped cross-selling opportunities. Our innovation engine is firing on all cylinders, and you're going to see some amazing new introductions in the coming quarters in key areas of the portfolio, including servers, cloud, high-performance computing, IoT, all-flash storage, Aruba and converged systems. 
For our shareholders, this focus is driving strong financial and operational performance. In Q1, we delivered our third consecutive quarter of growth in constant currency, with revenue of $12.7 billion, up 4% year-over-year. And when you exclude the impact from recent M&A activities, we grew revenue on a constant-currency basis in every one of our business segments for the first time since Q4 fiscal year '10. 
At the same time, we continued to make progress on our cost structure, particularly in ES and delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.41, at the top end of our previously provided range. Delivering strong cash flow is also a key priority for us. While Q1 was impacted by seasonality, separation payments and timing, we expect cash flow to improve as we move through the year and remained confident in our full year free cash flow outlook of $2 billion to $2.2 billion. 
Tim will walk through the specific Q1 cash flow drivers in a minute. Finally, in line with our commitment to return cash to our shareholders, in Q1, we paid $1.3 billion, including $1.2 billion for share repurchases and nearly $100 million in dividends. As a result, we've already exceeded our FY '16 commitment of returning at least 50% of expected free cash flow to shareholders. And share repurchases will remain our preferred method to return cash to shareholders given current market conditions. Overall, while there is more work to do to accelerate top line growth, align our cost structure and drive even closer collaboration and integration across our organization, I'm very pleased with where we stand today. 
Now let me turn to business performance. We had another strong quarter in Enterprise Group, with revenue up 7% year-over-year in constant currency. Our portfolio is truly the best we've had in years and is driving strong customer traction. For example, today, HPE is the leading infrastructure provider for SAP HANA with nearly twice the number of shipments over the next competitor. And this quarter, we won a number of important deals, including 1 with Canadian communications company, Rogers, to help them transform their existing traditional IT to a hybrid infrastructure. We will provide a comprehensive solution, including converged systems, cloud systems, StoreOnce, 3PAR all-flash and technology services.
We also signed a multiyear agreement with one of the world's largest food producers, JBS, to help them build an IT environment that supports faster business expansion, including consolidating their data centers and moving to the cloud. And just last week, at Mobile World Congress, we announced that Swisscom, Switzerland's leading telecommunications provider, will deploy new virtual network functions using HPE open NFE solutions. 
This customer momentum is driving financial results and each of our hardware business units performed well in Q1. In servers, we delivered 5% year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, maintained strong margins and also continued to make R&D investments. While we won't chase share for shares' sake, we continue to see significant growth opportunity ahead as the clear market leader with the most comprehensive portfolio of offerings, from mission-critical and High Performance Computing to our new IoT and Cloudline solutions. 
Storage had another strong quarter, with revenue up 3% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by continued strength in 3PAR. Converge storage grew 17% year-over-year in constant currency and is now a solid 56% of storage revenue. We had record revenue for 3PAR, driven by triple digit constant-currency growth in all-flash, which grew at 3x the market rate. With the industry-leading all-flash product and the broadest reach through our channel, we expect to gain share for the ninth quarter in a row in calendar Q4. 
Turning to networking. The significant actions we took last year are paying off, and we are very pleased with the performance overall. Networking revenue grew 62% year-over-year in constant currency. Normalized for the Aruba acquisition, revenue grew double digits, driven by record China revenue as well as good performance in other regions. As we've discussed before, we are seeing strength in China as customers anticipate the completion of the deal with Tsinghua, that we announced last year. 
We are currently working through the final regulatory approval in China, and we expect the deal to close by the end of May. Aruba also grew double digits at an operational level, and we saw strong pull through of HPE's switching portfolio to compliment Aruba's wireless offerings. Technology Services revenue was down 3% in constant currency although TS support performed better. Total orders grew year-over-year, excluding China where we are seeing some customers delaying renewals until the Tsinghua transaction closes. 
Unlike networking or servers, these are long-term contracts and we believe some customers are waiting to work directly with the new entity. We also saw constant currency double-digit order growth in new solutions like Datacenter Care and Proactive Care. We expect TS performance to improve throughout the year, driven by a better mix of new, faster growing support solutions. 
In cloud, following a major wave of product releases across our HPE Helion portfolio in the second half of 2015, we are seeing strong customer traction. In fact, since separation, Helion has gained over 200 customer wins, including some of the world's largest banks, service providers and industrials. This momentum reinforces our belief that our strategy of helping customers transform to a hybrid infrastructure is a winning approach for us. 
Enterprise Services continues to execute well against its turnaround strategy. ES is building a more diversified customer base, stabilizing revenue and significantly reducing its cost structure. For example, during the quarter, we grew new business TCV by 4% year-over-year in constant currency. This includes an agreement with Sabre to provide virtualization, automation and security services, hardware and software to support faster product development and extend Sabre's position in the global travel industry. And it includes an agreement with Avon to transform key elements of the leading beauty company's global IT infrastructure by offering a dedicated data center services, cross functional support, network management and security services. 
This builds on the progress we've made over the past 3 years. Remember that in FY '13, just 3 customers made up approximately 65% of ES operating profit. Today, no account makes up more than 10%. We also continued to make progress on our cost structure by exiting high cost data centers, improving low-cost location mix and rebalancing our workforce. As a result, Q1 revenue grew slightly in constant currency, marking the first quarter with constant currency growth since Q3 of '12. 
We also had our seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. Q1 operating margin of 5.1%, improved 2.1 points year-over-year, driven largely by delivery cost actions. Overall, I believe we are taking the right steps to achieve our long-term goal of a sustainable market competitive cost structure with a 7% to 9% operating profit margin. In Software, we continued to make progress, aligning the portfolio and go to market to our 4 transformation areas, increasing efficiency and accelerating SaaS. 
This has included the divestiture of several software businesses that were not core to our strategy, including iManage, LiveVault and TippingPoint, which we expect to close later this month. In Q1, software returned to growth with revenue up 1% in constant currency when adjusted for recent M&A activity. The ADM ITOM business was down slightly in constant currency as continued headwinds in license and support were nearly offset by professional services and record revenue growth in SaaS, which grew over 20% year-on-year. Big Data was strong with revenue up double digits when normalized for currency and divestitures, driven by triple digit growth in vertical license. 
Security performance was also strong across both license and SaaS. Financial Services continues to provide our customers with the financing flexibility they need to take on their biggest IT challenges. At the same time, the team does a great job managing this business to minimize our risk and maximize our return. Financial services revenue grew 3% in constant currency in Q1 and financing volume also increased 3% year-over-year. 
Before I hand it over to Tim to provide further insight into the financials, I want to highlight some of the exciting product announcements from the quarter. One of the most important benefits of being a smaller more focused company is that we are able to be very targeted in our investments and to even more effectively put our resources towards the most important, high-potential opportunities that support our strategy. As we've discussed before, we prioritize organic investments to maintain a strong technology pipeline. At Discover in December, we unveiled HPE Synergy, a new category of infrastructure designed to run both traditional and cloud-native applications for organizations running a hybrid infrastructure. 
Synergy, powered by our OneView [ph] software, represents a critical step in delivering our vision for hybrid infrastructure. We also introduced our new IoT Edgeline systems and Aruba networking sensors, specifically designed to help customers more specifically collect, process and analyze IoT data. The new solutions are key elements of our strategy of delivering more connectivity and computing power at the network edge, and you can expect more IoT announcements coming up this year. 
And in January, HP expanded its network function virtualization portfolio. We announced HPE Service Director, a new end-to-end service operation solution, designed to help communication service providers manage services in NFC deployments by bridging traditional and new virtualized environments. In addition to organic investments, we are also investing in key partnerships. In January, HPE and Scality announced an enhanced partnership designed to accelerate the adoption of software-defined storage. And we announced a new partnership with Microsoft, appointing Azure as a preferred public cloud partner for HPE customers. While HPE now serves as a preferred partner in providing infrastructure and services for Microsoft's hybrid cloud offerings.
As a result of this commitment to innovation, our products and services are being recognized as leaders in the industry. For example, we are now named a leader in 26 different Gartner Magic Quadrants including Integrated Systems, Modular Servers, Storage Disk Arrays and Wired and Wireless infrastructure. Forrester has ranked Enterprise Services as a leader in workplace services and positioned HPE as a leader in its recent private cloud report and IDC ranked us as a leader in application modernization services. Looking forward, you can expect this momentum and investment in innovation to continue. Later this month, we will announce a new market changing hyper-converged offering based on our industry-leading ProLiant virtualization server. 
Our new solution will offer customers installation in minutes, a consumer-inspired, simple, mobile-ready user experience and automated IT operations, all at 20% lower cost than Nutanix. We believe this new system will allow us to quickly become a top player in the $5 billion high growth hyper-converged market. Also later this month, we will refresh our server portfolio to include a game changing new technology called Persistent Memory, which was invented by our server group. 
This new technology will enable an ecosystem of new applications supporting non-volatile memory and is a key milestone on our journey to the machine. So overall, I'm very pleased with our first quarter as an independent company. We are already seeing the benefits of being a smaller, more focused organization, and I'm excited about what's ahead. 
On that note, I will hand the call over to Tim"

We have now completed our first quarter as a stand-alone company and overall, I'm pleased with our performance. As part of the separation process, we developed a clear financial architecture for HPE, where each business segment has a specific role in driving overall company performance. 
Enterprise Group is our growth engine. Enterprise Services is committed to stabilizing revenue and expanding margins. Software provides high margins and strong cash flow. And financial services provides a consistent annuity-based revenue stream. 
After only 1 quarter, it's already clear that each business is executing against this framework and as a result, is driving solid financial performance at the HPE level. First quarter revenue was $12.7 billion, down 2.5% year-over-year, but up 3.8% in constant currency. And as Meg said, this marks our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth. Clearly, currency was a significant headwind this quarter. You might recall that we saw the most significant movement in currencies during our first fiscal quarter last year, which drove a large rate translation impact this year and a total currency impact of 6 points year-over-year. 
Going forward, currency will still be a significant impact in Q2 and then moderate in the second half, and we still anticipate a currency headwind of approximately 3 points to revenue for the full year. Looking at performance by geography. We had some challenges in the Americas, which grew 1% year-over-year in constant currency, with increased weakness in January, particularly in U.S. hardware, as macro uncertainty caused a slowdown in global account spending. 
EMEA delivered growth of 4% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by balanced growth across EG hardware. APJ saw the best growth at 9% year-over-year in constant currency due to strengthened servers and record China networking revenue. The gross margin was 28.4%, down 1.2 points sequentially due to normal seasonality and up 70 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by continued productivity improvements in Enterprise Services. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $2.6 billion were up 3%year-over-year, driven by R&D as we continue to make targeted investments. 
Non-GAAP operating profit was 8.1%, down 1.5 points sequentially and down 40 basis points year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $0.41, at the top of our guided range. Non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pretax charges of $311 million for restructuring charges, $218 million for amortization of intangible assets and $79 million for separation costs. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.15, $0.02 above our previously provided outlook range of $0.09 to $0.13 due primarily to tax indemnification adjustments related to the separation. 
Free cash flow was negative $831 million, down 70% year-on-year on an adjusted basis that reflects the estimated HPE contribution to the combined HP company free cash flow last year. As we discussed during the Q4 earnings call, Q1 is usually our lowest cash flow quarter, due primarily to earnings seasonality in ES and Software as well as normal annual bonus compensation payments. You can see this seasonal pattern in our adjusted fiscal year '15 results, when our free cash flow for Q1 was a use of approximately $500 million. In addition to normal seasonality, in Q1 '16, we had higher separation payments year-over-year, which are now largely compete and higher usage of working capital. 
Let me explain what's happening with working capital. The cash conversion cycle was 31 days, up 8 days sequentially. This was above our targeted levels of mid-20 days, primarily due to payables that were impacted by intra-quarter purchasing linearity and strategic buys that provide an economic benefit to the company. These items are largely timing related, and we continue to more aggressively manage our working capital and expect the cash conversion cycle to improve throughout the year and return to our targeted levels. With all that in mind, we remain committed to our free cash flow outlook of $2 billion to $2.2 billion for the full year. 
Turning to capital allocation. In the first quarter, we paid approximately $1.2 billion for share repurchases, including $1.1 billion through an accelerated share repurchase program and an additional $132 million on the open market as part of our ongoing share repurchase program. 
We also distributed $96 million as part of our normal dividend. To date, we have already returned over 60% of our free cash flow outlook to shareholders, and now we are raising our commitment and expect to return at least 100% of our free cash flow outlook to shareholders in fiscal year '16. 
Separately, as Meg noted, we expect the Tsinghua transaction to close near the end of May. When the deal closes, we expect to receive cash of just over $2 billion that is net of some initial tax on the sale. We are planning to use the vast majority of this cash to opportunistically repurchase shares. The timing of the repurchases may not be linear and will be dependent on several factors, including market conditions and availability of U.S. cash. 
Now turning to the business results. The Enterprise Group delivered healthy growth and stable profitability, in line with our financial architecture. As Meg discussed, we are investing in innovation across EG to deliver best-in-class solutions in growing markets, while maintaining cost discipline and solid profitability. Revenue grew 1% year-over-year as reported or 7% in constant currency with strength across all hardware groups. Profitability was down 1.8 points to 13.4%, primarily due to FX and to a lesser extent product mix. 
Servers revenue was down 1% year-over-year as reported, but grew 5% in constant currency. Growth was driven by strong Tier 1 and by core sales in both EMEA and APJ. This was somewhat offset by pressure in the Americas towards the end of the quarter. Our R&D investments continue to pay off with our industry-leading offerings in high-performance compute that now exceeds a $1 billion run rate and strong double-digit growth in mission-critical x86 servers. 
Looking forward, we continue to see opportunities for profitable revenue growth and share expansion in the server market. We have the most comprehensive and compelling server portfolio with solutions for every workload. And we are aggressively taking advantage of the uncertainty in the markets surrounding our competitors. Storage revenue declined 3% year-on-year as reported, but grew 3% in constant currency. The unified 3PAR architecture combined with our excellent channel partnerships continues to drive revenue growth and share gains while our competitors are distracted and contracting. 3PAR all-flash grew triple digits again, driving 3PAR revenue growth of 21% year-over-year in constant currency, significantly outperforming the market. 3PAR plus XP plus EVA was up 15% year-over-year in constant currency. 
We estimate that we've gained solid market share in the fourth calendar quarter and expect storage to continue to be a growth driver in constant currency throughout the remainder of the year. Networking revenue grew 54% year-over-year as reported or 62% in constant currency and expanded operating margins, driven by the acquisition of Aruba and strong execution across all regions. When adjusted for Aruba, networking revenue was still up double digits in constant currency. 
The Aruba acquisition continues to prove to be a key strategic move for HPE and has transformed our networking business. Consistent with our acquisition strategy, Aruba continues to drive growth in wireless and has also been integral in returning switching to double-digit growth year-over-year. ES revenue declined 9% year-over-year as reported or 3% in constant currency. However, approximately 1 point of the decline was due to the discontinuation of HPI-related service contracts that were supported by TS last year. Encouragingly, TS support which has significantly higher margins than consulting, continued to stabilize and revenue was only down 2% year-over-year in constant currency, including the HPI impact. 
Orders were down slightly in constant currency, but up, excluding China, where signings have been delayed ahead of the Tsinghua deal close date. Enterprise Services executed well against its plan to stabilize the top line and expand margins. Revenue declined 6% year-over-year, but grew slightly in constant currency. Applications and business services, which you'll recall is the higher-margin business within ES, continued to improve with the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth in constant currency, driven by strong apps performance and stabilization in business process services. Strategic Enterprise Services revenue was up double-digits year-on-year with strong growth in Helion-managed cloud. 
Overall, TCB was up nearly 30% year-over-year in constant currency, driven by strong renewals as well as growth in new logos and add-ons. ES operating profit improved 2.1 points year-over-year to 5.1% as the team continued to execute productivity improvements and delivering on sales and improved new deal profitability. We also had a benefit from a onetime divestiture of a noncore business. We continue to make progress against the cost take out plan we laid out at our Analyst Meeting. 
We now have approximately 45% of our workforce in low-cost locations and are well on our way to our longer-term goal of 60%. Given the progress we have made on bookings and cost improvements, along with our normal quarterly seasonality, we remain confident in our full-year operating profit outlook of 6% to 7% and revenue of down 2% to flat year-over-year in constant currency. Software executed well in the quarter, improving revenue and delivering strong profitability while continuing to become more tightly integrated with the rest of the HPE portfolio and go-to-market approach. 
Revenue declined 10% year-over-year as reported or 6% in constant currency, but was up 1% when adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures in constant currency. We saw strong performance in Big Data and also some growth in security, offset by declines in IT management. SaaS had a very good quarter growing double digits in constant currency when adjusted for divestitures, driven by ADM, ITOM [ph] and security. 
Operating profit was 17.4%, down 60 basis points year-over-year due primarily to currency and higher mix of professional services. The team continues to focus on disciplined cost controls, but is still making strategic R&D investments in growth areas that align well with the broader HPE portfolio. In financial services, revenue declined 3% year-over-year, but grew 3% in constant currency as we began to see more impact from the volume growth we delivered last year. Financing volume in the quarter declined 4% year-over-year, but was up 3% in constant currency. Operating profit improved 1.7 points year-over-year to 12.9% as we were able to adjust bad debt reserves to reflect the improved loss rates and our high-quality portfolio. 
Return on equity was up 1 point year-over-year to 18.1%. Now turning to our outlook. We will not formally update our fiscal year '16 outlook for the impact of Tsinghua transaction until after it closes, but I wanted to give you some information about how to think about the potential impact. We now anticipate the deal to close near the end of May and expect the transaction will impact fiscal year '16 EPS operationally by approximately $0.05. 
This includes some stranded costs from corporate administrative functions that we will mitigate in the near term. After the transaction closes, we will update our fiscal year '16 free cash flow and EPS outlook, including any expected benefit from share repurchases made with the sale proceeds. Also, we do have an EPS benefit from our share repurchases completed in Q1 and still feel confident in the underlying operating performance of the business. But it's too early in the year to change our full-year outlook given the softness in January and near-term market uncertainty. 
With that in mind, we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.39 to $0.43 in Q2 2016, and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.13 to $0.17 in Q2 2016, and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.75 to $0.85. 
Now let's open it up for questions."

So keep in mind, in the first quarter last year, the euro, as an example, was kind of at 1.24 and the average accounting rates in the first quarter of this year it was 1.08. So we still saw significant pressure from an FX perspective when you look at the first quarter. Going out for the rest of the year, we would expect the margins to stabilize and maybe get a little bit of a lift, particularly as we continue to grow the storage business as well as the networking business. So as you know, those businesses have a healthier margin profile. So as we continue to grow those, we should see some lift there. And then, the other -- the only other major comment I'd make is on the ES business again we saw some great performance there in the first quarter. Margins at [ph] 5.1%, up 210 basis points year-over-year. So the efforts that the team continues to execute upon as they are transforming that business, and the seasonality in that business, We would expect those margins to improve over the course of the year and settle on average in the range of 6% to 7% as we talked about at the Analyst Meeting in September."

And given where the stock price has been trading, this is one of the best return on investments that we can actually make.

Look at the success of the 3, 4 all-flash storage array, internally homegrown, growing 3x the rate of the market and gives that benefit of a common architecture from top to bottom. The benefit of doing organic innovation is you don't end up with a Frankenstein of architectures. The second choice would be acquisitions that look like 3PAR, 3COM and Aruba. These have been very successful acquisitions for us. They are additional complementary technology that goes through our excellent distribution system. But again, where the stock is trading right now, we think that this makes a lot of sense to buy back shares, which is why we've decided to go to 100% of the free cash flow."

But do you think you have that visibility? Because the reason why I ask is Tim also mentioned visibility in January. And obviously, we can see what the markets have been doing in the macro. So I'm kind of curious as to how we see sustainable growth of the business. And then also, just for Tim, on the Enterprise Services margin guidance, kind of the growth guidance for this year, given the contract value growth, given the mix shift you're seeing in the business, the cost changes you're putting through very well, why isn't -- that guidance, it seems, for Enterprise Services is now very conservative. So is there some caution you're reflecting in that guidance in the balance of the year on the Enterprise Services side specifically?"

And I think your question is, can we see accelerated growth? I think we just are a little concerned about the macroeconomic environment. We saw a slowdown in the U.S. in the last 3 weeks of January. Linearity appears to be back on track, but it's early in the game. And so I think we're just being a bit cautious here. We like our product portfolio, we like our go-to-market changes, we like our innovation engine. There's a lot of things that we're feeling very good about, but the macroeconomic environment still has pockets of weakness. Russia continues to be a big challenge, the Ukraine, parts of Latin America. China right now, for us, is doing well, but that can change at any minute. So we feel great about the stated goal of growth in constant currencies, and let's see how the macroeconomic and sort of the political environment changes over time."

Only the China Securities Regulatory Committee remains, and they call that the CSRC in China, which is a bit like our SEC. And there's been a couple of things going on there. One is they have a new head of the CSRC. Two, there is a big backlog of deals, and they're working through those -- that backlog. But we feel confident. We expect that deal to close at the end of May. As you can imagine, we've been in contact with all the appropriate regulatory people, and obviously, our partners at Tsinghua. So that's the way we think about it right now. You -- there's also, as you know, a fair amount of volatility in the markets in China, and I think that, frankly, is slowing things down a little bit in China. And by the way, the H3C revenue over there is doing great. We had a record revenue for our China networking business, and I'd take that as a positive sign.

Actually, not that dissimilar from what, I believe, Cisco referred to on their call. And I don't have a good explanation of that, except for 1 or 2 things. One is, remember, the opening week in the market in 2016 was really tough, right? And I think companies are quite now extra sensitive to volatility in the market. They're quite quick to be cautious and pull back purchases. From a vertical perspective, obviously, the weakest vertical was oil and natural gas. We saw that across the board, and a lot of our oil and natural gas customers are in the United States, so that was a challenge and will probably continue. What I will say is while I'm cautious about it, it looks like February has returned to the linearity that we would have expected. Oil and natural gas continues to be a bit weak, but there's been some strength in other parts. So I'm not quite sure what happened in those last 3 weeks, but that would be my guess. Turning to Aruba and why it has helped our networking switch business. It's because the customers now believe we're completely committed to the networking business. I mean, we are all in on networking. And while we had HP networking before, I think people thought, well, maybe they're not 100% committed, maybe a bit below scale. With the acquisition of Aruba, they've gained a great deal of confidence in our product road map and in our commitment to the business. And so Aruba, I think, has cast a really nice glow over the rest of our HP networking business."

On the quarterly free cash flow, we're not going to guide on a quarterly basis. But if you think about it, obviously, first quarter for us is seasonally low, and that's primarily driven by earnings seasonality, right, which is driven by the profiles in ES and software, as well as the timing of that bonus payment, which happens in the first quarter of every year. It's a onetime payment. So we saw that same seasonality last year. Now going forward, what I would say is in -- we're going to get improvements every quarter in primarily 4 areas. One, earnings improvement. So obviously, we are back-end loaded from an earnings perspective, particularly in the second half. So as those earnings improve, obviously, our free cash flow will improve. The bonus payment's behind us now, so that is no longer a drag as you go forward. The cash conversion cycle, I mean, we were disappointed with the 31 days, but when you look at the fundamentals of our terms and mix, we're confident that, that will get back to the mid-20-day range, so that will drive a significant amount of improvement. And then lastly, the separation. So to Toni's question, we had $600 million of separation charges planned for the year. We paid out $300 million of that in the first quarter, so that becomes less of a drag. So as we progress through every quarter, similar to the last year, you will see improvement. So I think if you look at the seasonality of last year, that would probably give you a pretty good reflection of how it may play out this year."

So I think there's a couple of things going on here. One is this is the first quarter of constant currency revenue growth. Not a huge amount, 0.1%, but relative to from whence we've come in that businesses, it's given us a lot of confidence. It's first quarter of constant currency revenue growth since Q3 of FY '12. And ABS, which happens to have a higher level of profitability than ITO, posted its second consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant currency growth. SES, as I mentioned, that's our cloud, Big Data, security practices, grew over 30% year-over-year in Q1. And we saw some benefits from strong strategic Enterprise Services signings in FY '15. I think we have also worked through the vast majority of the key account revenue runoff that we've talked about for the last couple of years. These were 3 or 4 very big ES customers that have now really run off and have become quite predictable. And then I got to give the finance team and the operations team in ES credit. We are much better now at forecasting revenue than we have been. It's a very granular account-by-account forecast profit -- forecast of revenue by type of practice. And that gives us a lot of confidence. So as we sit here today and we look out at the landscape and we see a book-to-bill ratio of roughly 1, we feel good about that negative 2% to flat."

So it is interesting to note how different -- HP and Dell, we have taken very different strategies in this environment. There's no question. And my view of this is predicated upon the speed that this market is changing. And so we decided to get smaller while they got bigger. We decided to lean into new technology while they're doubling down on old technology and a cost takeout play. They levered up while we delevered. And we're super focused on being fast and nimble for our customers. So both strategies may work. I happen to like our hand better than the Dell-EMC hand. So how are we taking advantage of the disruption in the marketplace? So we learned a lot about how to do this in the context of the IBM sale of their server business to Lenovo. We have a very focused channel play where we -- actually, it's called Smart Choice, and we have a big opportunity to go take Dell and EMC business much as we took a lot of the Lenovo business that would have gone to Lenovo. And so we're seeing good results in the marketplace. We're rolling out our full sales efforts. You're going to start to see even more advertising and digital as we capitalize on another 1 to 2 years of uncertainty as this deal closes and they work through the integration. The other thing is, as you think about it, we continue to invest in innovation. And you have to think about, Dell-EMC, in many ways, is owned by private equity, and you can do your own calculation on what you think that debt is going to -- the debt interest payments are going to be. For perspective, the entire EMC R&D budget is $2.7 billion. So we feel good about our hand. Two completely different strategies but I like where we are. In regards to M&A. As I said, we -- our first priority is organic innovation, and you're starting to see that innovation engine really kick into gear. And we started this, Steve, you'll remember, 4 years ago. As we cut costs over the last 4 years, almost every single quarter year-over-year, we spent more money on innovation, and it's paying off. That doesn't say we won't do acquisitions. But I would reiterate, it's returns-based and it is focused on companies like 3PAR, like 3Com, like Aruba that are complementary technology that fit into our overall 4 transformation areas as we go forward. So I think we're -- we've got the right strategy here. We're thoughtful about it. But if the right acquisition comes along and we feel like the price is appropriate, we'll go ahead and do it."

So what we're hearing from customers is there's almost universal acceptance that their environments will be hybrid. And there's almost universal acceptance that it has to start with an analysis of the apps. How many apps does a customer want to have? Is there opportunities to reduce the number of apps and consolidate? And then what instantiation do you want that app to be on? Some apps are going to stay locked down in a customer's data center, untouched by anyone's hands other than their own employees, but some apps will go to a private cloud on-prem, a virtual private cloud, a managed private cloud, and then, obviously, to the public cloud. And we're seeing workloads move. Because even going from a traditional data center to the private cloud can be a 20% to 30% savings to a customer for that workload, which is meaningful. So as you know, we are the leader in private cloud. It is the first step that many customers take. And then, they think, okay, what would I like? What of my apps would I like to have in a virtual private cloud and a managed private cloud? I think there is an inexorable march from data center-only apps to private cloud, VPC, MPC, and ultimately, to the public cloud. So one of the other things we're doing here is developing our multi-cloud management layer, our one pane of glass, our orchestration and automation of your multi-cloud environment. How do you deploy workloads to these different clouds quickly and efficiently? So I think we've got the right strategy here. I think it was smart to get out of our spending on public cloud. I think that game has moved to Azure and AWS and maybe, someday, Google. And we're really pleased with our Azure partnership. So that's working well. The other thing I would say is, recall that we have built our cloud operation on Helion OpenStack. And our version 2.0 of what we call HOS, Helion OpenStack 2.0, is a significant improvement from 1.1, where we had some installer challenges. So we're getting a lot of good feedback around HOS 2.0 as well as our carrier-grade OpenStack, which is of course, of interest to the telcos. We had a very good Mobile World Congress show. I was there for 3 days, and our open NFE solution, we have 60 POCs across the globe and a couple of very big customer wins. So I feel like we're on the right strategy. The world's changing at breakneck speed, but we feel good about our strategy, and I feel good, actually, about having chosen OpenStack. 2 or 3 years ago, I was getting a little concerned because I wasn't sure how fast OpenStack was going to mature, but it seems like it's finally hitting the knee of the curve, and the adult supervision that a number of big companies have provided is actually helping."

Hence, HPE Synergy, which allows a developer to basically compose the infrastructure they need for their app. So HPE Synergy isn't exactly cloud by any stretch of the imagination, but it is, in fact, the next generation of infrastructure for the software-defined data center. I would also say that we are gaining share in that market. There's no question about it. We did a great job, I think, in grabbing share from Lenovo, as I said earlier, when those servers moved from IBM, and we are all over this Dell-EMC opportunity. So in a flat to declining market, which probably core servers are, at least over the next 5 years, we have to gain share. But there are real pockets of growth in the market as well. And HPC by the way, high-performance compute, we're like the last man standing there. And we're investing in HPC, and it's a core competency for the company."

Hewlett-Packard Enterprise completed our second full quarter as an independent company, and I have to say that we've delivered the best performance since I joined.In Q2, we saw ou",1126,"Thanks, Andy, and thank you to everyone on the call for joining us today. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise completed our second full quarter as an independent company, and I have to say that we've delivered the best performance since I joined.
In Q2, we saw our first quarter of as-reported year-over-year revenue growth since 2011 for the Hewlett-Packard Enterprise businesses. We also saw our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant currency revenue growth. We delivered revenue of $12.7 billion, up more than 1% as reported and 5% in constant currency, driven by excellent performance in servers, storage, networking and converged infrastructure as well as outstanding performance in Enterprise Services. 
Enterprise Group had a fabulous quarter, delivering 7% revenue growth on an as-reported basis and 10% in constant currency. In fact, we grew on an as-reported basis in every one of EG's hardware business units and in every region. ES grew revenue year-over-year in constant currency for the second consecutive quarter and expanded operating margins more than 3 points over the prior year. That's the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. Our software business also delivered a strong quarter. When adjusted for divestitures and acquisitions, software delivered its third consecutive quarter of constant currency growth. And in financial services, we saw double-digit volume growth over the prior year.
So with strong performance across every one of our business segments, HPE delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.42 at the high end of our previously provided outlook. Free cash flow improved in the second quarter to $511 million due to careful management of our working capital. Tim will walk through the drivers of our cash flow and outlook shortly.
And we are seeing the benefits of our increased R&D and more focused product road maps as we take share from our competitors. In storage, HPE is the only major vendor to gain share in external disk over the last 2 years, while EMC, net app, IBM and Dell lost share year-over-year. 
Revenue in our 3PAR all-flash business grew nearly triple digits about 2x faster than the market and is once again expected to be larger and faster growing then. networking, we are seeing an acceleration of our business, particularly since our acquisition of Aruba and our game-changing partnership with Unisplendor [ph] a subsidiary of Tsinghua in China. 
And our results are in stark contrast with the result Cisco reported last week. In switching, HPE grew 18% year-over-year versus Cisco that was down 3%. And we are getting credit from the industry for our innovation, capturing the leading position in Gartner's most recent Magic Quadrant for wired, wireless, upsetting Cisco's long-standing run in the top spot. That is in addition to our leading positions in servers, storage and integrated systems.  And we're not taking our foot off the pedal. Next month at Discover Las Vegas, you'll be hearing more about significant new innovations across our cloud, IoT and compostable infrastructure product lines as well as an update on the machine. 
Last but certainly not least, earlier today we made a major announcement we are planning a tax-free spin-off and measure of our Enterprise Services business with CSC, which is expected to create a pure play global IT service powerhouse with annual revenue of more than $26 billion. The new company will have more than 5,000 customers in 70 countries and employees in every region around the world. The transaction is expected to deliver approximately $8.5 billion to HP's shareholders in an after-tax basis. This includes an equity stake in the newly combined company valued at more than $4.5 billion, which represents approximately 50% ownership, a cash dividend of $1.5 billion and the assumption of $2.5 billion of debt and other liabilities. We also expect the merger of the 2 businesses to produce first-tier synergies of approximately $1 billion postclose, with a run rate of $1.5 billion by the end of year 1. And there's also an opportunity for additional synergies in subsequent years. As owners of approximately 50% of the merged company, HPE shareholders will share in the value of the synergies as well as future growth in earnings. 
The cost to separate ES from HPE will be offset by lower costs associated with previously announced fiscal year 2015 restructuring program. So there will be no incremental onetime cash payments beyond what we've already communicated. 
I will serve on the board of the new company, and HPE's Board of Directors will nominate half of the new company's board. Mike Lawrie, the current head of CSC, will become Chairman and CEO of the new company. And Mike  , the current EVP and General Manager of our Enterprise Services business, will become a key part of the new company's executive team and partner closely with Mike Lawrie on building the new organization. Other executives and directors as well as the name of the company will be announced at a later date. The transaction is currently targeted to be completed by March 31, 2017. 
For the combined CSC and Enterprise Services, this will create a new company that will be a pure play global IT services leader. For customers, this means global access to world-class offerings in cloud, mobility, application development and modernization, business process services, IT services, big data and analytics and security. This is combined with deep industry experience in sectors that include financial services, transportation, consumer products, health care and insurance. HPE and this new company will be closely connected moving forward with agreements that will keep the 2 companies aligned for current customers and grow new business opportunities over time. 
For the remaining Hewlett Packard Enterprise, this transaction creates a significant incremental value by unlocking a faster growing higher-margin and stronger free cash flow business. HPE will now have $33 billion in annual revenue and will focus on secure, next-generation, software-defined infrastructure that leverages a world-class portfolio servers, storage, networking conversion infrastructure as well as our Helion cloud platform and software assets. By bringing together leadership positions in these key data center technologies, we will help customers rather traditional IT better while building a bridge to multicloud environments. 
Beyond the data center, it HPE is redefining IT at the edge with our next generation of Aruba and computing products for campus, branch and IoT applications. In addition, through our Technology Services division, we can deliver consulting and support to customers, while HPE Financial Services offers financial flexibilities the customers to maximize their investment. Finally we will continue to leverage our portfolio of operations, security and big software assets that deliver machine learning and analytics capabilities to customers. 
Mike Lawrie has joined our call today and will have much more to say about the deal in a moment. But first, Tim is going to walk us through HPE's financial performance in detail."
273983758,336644881,991296,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 24, 2016",2016-05-24,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thanks, Meg. Overall, we had great quarter. We grew revenue as reported in, in constant currency, generated healthy cash flow and delivered non-GAAP diluted net EPS at the high end of our guidance range. Revenue of $12.7 billion was up 1.3% year-over-year",2000,"Thanks, Meg. Overall, we had great quarter. We grew revenue as reported in, in constant currency, generated healthy cash flow and delivered non-GAAP diluted net EPS at the high end of our guidance range. Revenue of $12.7 billion was up 1.3% year-over-year and grew 4.9% in constant currency, our fourth consecutive quarter of constant currency growth. And as Meg mentioned, HPE businesses reported absolutely revenue growth for the first time in 5 years. 
We saw revenue growth in constant currency in every region and outright growth in the Americas and APG. Our Americas performance continues to support cautious optimism for the remainder of the year amongst an uneven macroeconomic environment. In EMEA, we were still significantly impacted by currency. we are seeing encouraging momentum in enterprise hardware. And in APJ, China networking drove strong performance. The top line currency impacts to revenue was 4 points year-over-year, primarily due to hedging gains from the prior year. Going forward, we expect the currency impact to significantly moderate throughout the second half of the year. And we continue to anticipate an impact to revenue of approximately 3 points for the full year as rates are now roughly in line with where they were when we originally guided the year.
Margins were largely stable in the quarter, with gross margin of 28.7%, up 10 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially. And non-GAAP operating profit margin was 7.9%, down 50 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially. 
Total non-GAAP operating expenses of $2.6 billion were up 4.7% year-over-year primarily due to increased FSC and R&D 
investments. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.42, at the high end of our guided range. This primarily excludes $201 million for amortization of intangible assets, $161 million for restructuring and $91 million of separation charges. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.18, $0.01 above our previously guided range. 
Now turning to the business results. Enterprise Group had a strong quarter with excellent top line performance. Our sales motion is hitting its stride, aided by the seamless launch of the HPE brand and our marketing efforts. Revenue was up 7% year-over-year or 10% in constant currency and grew in all product groups. For the remainder of the year, revenue growth will likely moderate as we will not have the benefit of H3C and begin to face tougher compares. 
Profitability in the quarter was 11.7%, down 240 basis points year-on-year. This was primarily due to foreign exchange, heavier Tier 1 mix and a lesser degree, incremental R&D investment. 
A deal that exemplifies the strength of the Enterprise Group is the recently won project with Woolworth's Limited, Australia's largest retail company. Our solution, based on the converged system 900 for SAP provides access to real-time data, enabling critical business decisions to be made immediately. this win against Lenovo, Fujitsu and Dimension Data with Cisco UCS also displaces the current outsourced provider, Wipro, and further secures HPE's relationship with Woolworth's. 
Service revenue grew 7% year-on-year or 10% in constant currency, primarily driven by strong Tier 1 sales in the Americas and core servers in APJ. Based in our performance, we believe we took share in servers overall, density optimized servers and . From a regional perspective, we took share in the Americas and EMEA. In this quarter, we started shipping our hyperconverged HC 380, which enabled midsized and remote office enterprises to easily deploy management support virtual machines in a few clicks. we continue to see servers as a growth driver given the strength of our portfolio and anticipate healthy demand for compute for the remainder of the year. 
In storage, we grew revenue 2% year-over-year and 5% in constant currency. Converged Storage continued its strong growth trend, growing 19% year-over-year in constant currency and comprising 54% of the total portfolio. 3PAR all-flash revenue grew near triple digits and continues to drive mid-range share gains. We estimate that we gained market share in the external disk for the 10th consecutive quarter and expect storage to gain share for the remainder of the year on the strength of the 3PAR portfolio and new logo wins as we take advantage of the uncertainties surrounding the Dell-EMC merger. 
Networking revenue grew 57% year-over-year as reported, or 62% in constant currency. when adjusted for Aruba, networking was still up 17% in constant currency. We have strong execution with growth across all regions. While Aruba continues to drive growth in wireless share, we also expected to take share in switching and routing on the strength of H3C and Aruba campus switching pull-through. Leading up to the transaction closed with Tsinghua, H3C grew more than 50% year-over-year, validating the strategic moves we made to collaborate with a strong local partner. 
In Technology Services, revenue decline 6% year-on-year or 2% in constant currency. However, it was only down 1% in constant currency when adjusted for the discontinuation of HP Inc. attach, which remains in the fiscal year '15 results. TS support, the most profitable and largest segment of Technology Services, grew orders in constant currency. Based on this and order growth we saw last year, we continue to expect TS revenue to return to growth in constant currency towards the end of the year. 
Enterprise Services had another great quarter as we continue to see the benefits of our restructuring cost actions and improving sales motion. A great example of the deals we are winning is our recent selection from 5 other competitors for a 10-year $0.5 billion contract to provide IT services, including infrastructure, mission-critical systems and applications to the U.S. Strategic Command. Revenue declined 2% year-over-year, but grew 1% in constant currency. When adjusted for the Deutsche Bank win last year, both new business TCV and total TCV grew year-over-year. Strategic Enterprise Services is gaining strength in both overall revenue and mix, delivering mid-double digit growth year-over-year.  ABS continues to improve with a third consecutive quarter of year-on-year constant currency revenue growth. And ITO also grew in constant currency for the first time since the first quarter of 2012. 
Operating profit improved 310 basis points year-over-year to 6.7% as the team continues to execute productivity improvements in delivery and sales. we are also seeing the benefits from improving location mix as well as increasing sold margins and healthy add-on sales. we continue to track well against our longer-term goal of 60-40 low cost, high cost headcount mix and completed the quarter with 47% of our headcount in low-cost centers. progress made on cost improvements, sales strength and normal quarterly seasonality provides us with confidence that operating profit margins for the full year will now be towards the high end of our original 6% to 7% outlook.
Software declined 13% year-over-year as reported or 10% in constant currency. However, it was up 2% in constant currency when adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. Sales strength in security and big data was partly offset by declines in IT management. On a product level, we had encouraging results in Voltage, and [indiscernible]. The team continues to focus on disciplined cost controls, decreasing OpEx dollars year-over-year and growing operating profit dollars.  Operating profit margin expanded 7 points year-over-year. However, the largest contributor to OpEx and margin improvement was a onetime benefit from the tipping point divestiture. 
HPE Financial Services revenue declined 2% year-over-year but grew 1% in constant currency. Operating profit declined 130 basis points year-over-year to 9.3% as lower residual sales pressured margin rates. Financing volume grew 15% year-over-year or 19% in constant currency, primarily due to favorable movement in our cost of funds, which has enabled us to price more competitively. Return on equity was down 230 basis points year-on-year to 12.7%. 
Cash flow was strong in the quarter due to judicious working capital management. Cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion, up 101% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Free cash flow was $511 million, up from negative $106 million last year, again on an adjusted basis. 
When adjusted for the sale of H3C, the cash conversion cycle was 27 days, down 4 days quarter-over-quarter. The largest contributor to cash conversion cycle improvement was DPO, which increased 5 days sequentially adjusted for H3C as we continued to improve payment churns with our vendors. This is partly offset by DSO, which increased 2 days sequentially, while DOI was flat through the quarter. Given the momentum in our working capital initiatives, we now expect our cash conversion cycle will reach the low 20-day range by the year-end. 
let's turn to capital allocation. In the quarter, we returned $109 million of cash to shareholders. Due to the ES-CSE transaction, we were largely prohibited from repurchasing shares and only bought back $15 million of shares. We also paid $94 million as part of our normal dividend. We continue to see our shares as very attractively priced and would be back in the market this month. Along those lines, our Board of Directors recently increased our share repurchase authorization by $3 billion, which now stands at $4.8 billion remaining.
During our Q1 earnings call, we committed approximately $2 billion of the proceeds from the H3C transaction to share repurchases. We now expect to complete roughly half of those this fiscal year, with the remainder to be completed in fiscal year '17. As you recall, share repurchases resulting from the HVC transaction are in addition to commitment to return 100% of our original fiscal year '16 free cash flow outlook to shareholders. 
Now I'd like to an update on recent M&A activity.  First, we announced the sale of our majority stake in mPhasis to Blackstone as we continue to refine our capital strategy and make improvements to our go-to-market model. We expect this transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In addition during the quarter, we closed the sale of 51% of H3C to Tsinghua at the beginning of May. Remember that our prior guidance did not include the impact of this transaction. We now think that we can offset the EPS impact with the share repurchases we completed in the first quarter and the incremental share repurchases to be completed later this year. 
Going forward, we will recognize only 49% of H3C earnings and receive a corresponding cash payment. This will reduce cash flow by approximately $200 million in the second half of fiscal year '16. However, roughly half of that will be received as a cash payment in fiscal year '17. 
Finally I'd like to discuss the cash impact of the EF-CSE transaction to HPE. There will be no incremental onetime uses of cash beyond that we've already communicated. We expect total onetime separation payments of around $900 million, with $300 million in fiscal year '16 and the remainder in fiscal year '17. As an offset, we will reduce the $2.6 billion of restructuring payments associated with our 2015 restructuring plan by roughly $1 billion as we are achieving our targeted savings more efficiently and will no longer need to find EF actions after the transaction closes. We have gained valuable experience in the HPE-HPI separation that gives us confidence in executing this spin quickly and efficiently.  In total, the fiscal year '16 free cash flow will be reduced by $300 million due to the H3C divestiture and current year ES separation payments that will be partly offset by working capital improvements.
Let's go to guidance. We expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.42 to $0.46 in Q3 of 2016 and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $1.10 to $1.14 in Q3 of 2016 and now expect full year fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.68 to $1.78, reflecting the new ES separation charges and gain on sale of H3C. And we now expect full year fiscal 2016 free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Meg."

Now I'd like to go into detail on the deal we announced today with CSC, which I think will be very beneficial to customers, employees and shareholders of both companies. As today's results confirm, Enterprise Services is a stronger and more robust business than it has been in many years. As a result of customer diversification efforts and other improvements, ES delivered stable constant currency revenue for the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2016, which were the first quarters of year-over-year constant currency revenue growth since fiscal 2012. Overall, ES is on track to achieve its long-term goal of a market-competitive cost structure and operating margins. 
So by bringing together the best of these 2 organizations, we will create a pure play services leader, ready to compete and win against all the current players. The new company will have greater agility, focus and the ability to drive faster outcomes for our customers. also have a top-notch management team, quite literally the best in the business, and that management team will be 100% focused on ensuring a smooth transition with no disruption for ES and CSC customers. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mike Lawrie. Mike and I have gotten to know each other quite well, and I can tell you he is a world-class CEO with incredible talent and unbridled passion for his business. Once the deal closes, I look forward to working with him to build our new company. Mike?"

I'm excited about the great potential this merger brings to our people, to our clients, to our partners and investors, both at CSC and HPE's Enterprise Services division.

I'm excited about the great potential this merger brings to our people, to our clients, to our partners and investors, both at CSC and HPE's Enterprise Services division. And let me tell you why.
Over the past 2 years, our 2 organizations have been embarked on uncritical turnarounds and broad-based transformations. Not everyone is aware of this, but Meg and I joined our respective companies within about 6 months of each other. And I'm pleased to be able to say that in recent years, both our organizations have been on the up trajectories with significant improvements in financial performance and client satisfaction scores. And the progress has been real and it has been measurable. Both of our companies separated last year, within a month of one another, into more client-focused pure play entities aimed at specific markets and core industries. 
In today's announcement, the coming together of these 2 organizations is the next logical step, building on their progress to date and significantly accelerating the transformation. The new company will be a global top 3 leader in IT services, one that's uniquely positioned to lead clients in their digital transformations. Our organizations are highly complementary. HPE Enterprise Services has a proud legacy and brings focus and agility and the ability to drive faster outcomes for clients, along with a first-rate sales organization. CSC brings deep industry expertise, innovation and next-generation technologies and an exceptional partner network, among other strengths. And together as an agile technology independent services pure play, we will be better positioned to innovate and compete and win against both emerging and established players. We will have some scale to serve customers more efficiently and effectively worldwide. We will have a highly competitive cost structure to take advantage of our distinct growth opportunities, resulting in the capital capacity to invest and grow both organically and inorganically. We will strengthen and grow client relationships that cover more than 3/4 of the Fortune 500, with less than 15% overlap across our top accounts. We will leverage the combined portfolio that will include leading solutions in areas like managed security, cloud IT, enterprise applications and big data and analytics, along with combined BPO leadership and health care and insurance and banking and capital markets. 
But most importantly, this great leap forward in our transformation will enable our people to better innovate, to compete and adapt to an ever-changing marketplace. Employees will become part of a very strong and focused global enterprise that is positioned for success, one that enables them to take advantage of the diverse career development and growth opportunities of a larger global enterprise. And as a pure play services leader, our new company would be able to operate independent of any single hardware provider, establishing the right partnerships for success. And at the same time, CSC and HPE you will have long-term agreements in place to ensure that current customer commitments continue to be met and our relationship will be stronger and our collaboration deeper. 
Now before I hand it back to Meg, I'd just like to take a moment to thank the teams at both companies for their hard work and resilience and driving our respective transformations. Through your efforts, we are at a place where we can bring our 2 great organizations together. And that includes our team at CSC and also the HPE Enterprise Services team under Mike . I'm pleased that Mike has agreed to stay with the company in a senior position, reporting to me, and that he will be playing a crucial role in helping build and grow our new company. And I'm looking forward to working with Meg as a member of the new company's board.
Let me just reiterate my excitement about our 2 organizations coming together to better serve clients around the world and deliver value for our shareholders. We recognize that we are just at the beginning of this process with a lot of work to do. By staying laser focused and working in the same collaborative spirit that has gotten us to this point, we can get to the finish line faster and in a great position to launch of the new company. My colleagues at CSC and I look forward to working with everyone in HP Enterprise Services. So let me hand it back to you, Meg"

Our focus is going to be on next-gen, software-defined infrastructure with a world-class portfolio servers, storage networking converge in a procession hyperconverged market, helion or helion cloud platform and our Software assets. you probably be have guessed by now I am now a devote of focus. and this is going to be a laserlike focused company that, as I think you know, is higher growth, higher margin with more robust free cash flows. And it's going to be well-capitalized. So we don't necessarily think there is a need for acquisitions, but if we find the right companies, we certainly will move. let me just recap the kind of acquisitions that have worked well for this company in the past: complementary technologies that we can put through our excellent distribution and support system. So think 3PAR, 3com, Aruba, all 3 of those acquisitions have been fantastic for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. And so we'll keep our eyes out for those kinds of acquisitions. Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of those around, but to the extent we see them, we won't hesitate. And as Tim said, remember, our capital allocation strategy is returns based. Right now, we really think there's incredible value in our stock price. Tim announced we're going to to be buying back using 100% of our free cash flow, in addition to half of the H3C proceeds. And we just got an increase in authorization of share buyback from our board."

A lot of activities team is done through the transformation are starting to see through to the P&L. 7% to 9% is what we would have. it may be conservative, but again, we need to get some -- continue to execute and there's more work to do there. So we're prudent at the 7% to 9%. On the EG front, margins were down about 240 basis points. And that's primarily driven by foreign exchange, some Tier 1 mix and to a lesser degree, the R&D investment we made. And we are a little bit heavy in Tier 1 right now. If you recall, we launched cloud line product line, where we're seeing a lot of momentum. we launched that in the second half of last year, so we are little bit heavier weighted in Tier 1. We expect it to normalize in the second half. I think margins there will be stable in near term. if you look at longer term, we may even see some expansion or we expect to see some expansion as you think about further growth in Aruba, converged storage and those types of areas."

The business has a lot of momentum in terms of profit improvement. I understand the $8.5 billion consideration, but this business is going to earn over $1 billion in net income this year, could be closer to $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion going forward. So you're ascribing a value of 6.5x to 8x to that business when operating profit under your previous plan would have been growing pretty healthily.

And I would say the time is right now because we believe this industry actually will consolidate. And it's better to be on the front and of the consolidation play than the back end of the consolidation play. And while there is more margin expansion here, we actually think the ability to accelerate the turnaround of ES will happen in the combined entity of CSC and ES. And recall that our shareholders will own 50% of this new entity, so they'll be party to that 50% of the synergies, 50% of the operational improvements, 50% of the synergy improvement. So in some ways, the shareholders get the best of both worlds. the get to maintain a position in Hewlett Packard Enterprise and a more focused software-defined data center and Edge strategy. And they get to ride the upside, half the upside that they would have gotten had it stayed with us. And my view is the upside would be bigger with CSC and ES together. And I guess the other reason is why now is the business is in a good position. 2 years ago, we were struggling in this business. We diversified revenue. We've taken costs out. Revenue has stabilized. We've developed some new product lines. And I think combined with CSC, it's going to be a powerhouse IT services company."

And then I'll ask, who is our Chief Operating Officer who helped negotiate this deal, to give a bit more detail. So we started out with what is the value of the Enterprise Services asset. And as you saw from the release, the headline value there is $8.5 billion. Now we wanted to make sure that we did a 50-50 merger of equals, tax-free spin merge of Enterprise Services into this new entity. And so obviously, we made some  -- we negotiated some adjustments to that. So first of all, the new company, and I'm sort of calling if for shorthand CSC ES, will pay Hewlett Packard Enterprise, the future stand-alone Hewlett Packard Enterprise, $1.5 billion of cash after the deal closes and will [ph] assume $2.5 billion of liability, pension liability as well as an old EDS $300 million bond. And then ES or Hewlett Packard Enterprise will actually subsidize some of that pension liability with offshore cash. So Chris, do you want any more detail to that?"

So that was roughly $3.9 billion. So the 2 components, the $3.9 billion of upfront considerations plus the $4.6 billion of equity consideration in CSC stock essentially makes up the $8.5 billion in total valuation. Now the equity consideration that CSC will essentially issue stock at the time of the transaction, and that stock will essentially result in the company being 50-50. And the price or the total value at the time of the close will depend on where CSC is trading at that point in time."

And I guess part of the point of being a pure services company is that they're fairly agnostic. And so do you lose that over time? So it's not obvious to me that you absolutely maintain what you have and is just a question of if it get better. I'm a little worried obviously about whether it could get worse.

Because the last thing I wanted to do was combine CSC with ES, and then lose the infrastructure pull-through. That would not have been a value to Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. So we've negotiated a deal that I think is very fair. It allows CSC to continue to work with people they worked with in the past. But we've also gotten a commitment from them for the next 3 years. Beyond that, I'm very confident that the work we will do in Hewlett Packard Enterprise will earn our way to that commitment. I mean, think about our server lineup, our storage lineup, our networking lineup, our wired, wireless land lineup, converged infrastructure and Helion cloud platform. we do have, if you will, a safety net for the next 3 years. But I also -- one of the benefits of a pure play services company is to be able to work with best of breed, and I know Mike wants to continue to do that. So I think we struck a good thing that protects us in the near term, but gives Mike the flexibility he needs to do solutions that are right for his customers. On the other side of it is we do business today with some of ES competitors. Think about Deloitte or Accenture, Capgemini or the Indian players. And we want to continue to grow that. And they're, just like for Mike, there's a benefit to being a pure play that will be benefit for us in terms of being primarily a software defined infrastructure company and software company. So we imagine growing the business with those players as well. And by the way, this happened with the HPE, HP Inc. split. When HP Inc. became a separate company, all of a sudden a lot of competitors who used to think they were competitors to some degree with our company, all of a sudden are very interested in the HP Inc. offering. So I think that could happen to us as well."

I think they are the best indication that we've got a winning company here. We outgrew the market. We outgrew every single competitor, gained share in every single one of -- against our infrastructure competitors. And I think what you have now is the Enterprise Group and Software on a roll. And the investments that we have made in R&D, the investments we've made in a fire in the belly sales force. I mean, we have done a complete transformation of our sales force around not only our channel, but also direct selling.

The primary delta versus consensus right now is really driven by the H3C transaction. To your point, that's probably about, I'd say, $0.03 or $0.04. that implies a ramp in the fourth quarter. And that's really, think about it in 3 ways. One, it's seasonality. So when you look at our ES business and our Software business, those businesses tend to be back-end loaded. So that will drive a lot of the improvement. The second component is around the H3C transaction from a stranded cost perspective. So now that the deal is closed, there is some overhead costs that we need to take out of the system. That generally takes a little bit of time, not to dissimilar to that dis-synergies story we had around the separation. and third component is driven by the share repurchases. So there's more of an impact in Q4 versus Q3 on the share repurchase front. So those are really the key drivers to the ramp in the fourth quarter, but we've got clear plans. For sure, we need to go out and execute, but we feel good about the total year. And that's why we held our total year guide of 1 85 to 1 95."

Again, that will tend to normalize. So I would expect the margins in EG to be stable. And I'm not going to give margin guidance here. But again, as we continue to grow Aruba, as we continue to grow storage, that's going to help the margin front. On the TS front, that business will also stabilize. So we had -- we were down in revenue 1% in constant currency when you adjust for the HPI transaction. But we do expect revenue growth in the latter part of the year. And the way to think about that is obviously, that's an annuity type business, given the contracts. So what we're going to start seeing in the second half is that those negative growth orders that we had in '14, that's replaced by positive growth that we saw in '15. That feeds our 2016 revenue. So we do expect TS revenue to be flat on the year-over-year basis for the total year, and that will also help from a margin perspective as well."

It's fantastic. Second is when you retool a sales force, that take some time as well. And I would say we're much farther along than we have been. There is more work to do. And then as I said marketing, we've retooled our entire demand generation. We've retooled -- and by the way, the launch of Hewlett Packard Enterprise gave us a chance to tell still people the story of the enterprise side of this business. Because prior to that, if you asked men on the street what is HPE, they's say printing and PC company. So I think that's actually been beneficial. And then turnarounds take 5 years. I said it when I started. And we're rounding the bend into the end of the fifth year. And so it's gratifying that we saw as reported growth for the first time in 5 years."

Hewlett-Packard Enterprise completed our second full quarter as an independent company, and I have to say that we've delivered the best performance since I joined.In Q2, we saw ou",1124,"Thanks, Andy, and thank you to everyone on the call for joining us today. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise completed our second full quarter as an independent company, and I have to say that we've delivered the best performance since I joined.
In Q2, we saw our first quarter of as-reported year-over-year revenue growth since 2011 for the Hewlett-Packard Enterprise businesses. We also saw our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant currency revenue growth. We delivered revenue of $12.7 billion, up more than 1% as reported and 5% in constant currency, driven by excellent performance in servers, storage, networking and converged infrastructure as well as outstanding performance in Enterprise Services. 
Enterprise Group had a fabulous quarter, delivering 7% revenue growth on an as-reported basis and 10% in constant currency. In fact, we grew on an as-reported basis in every one of EG's hardware business units and in every region. ES grew revenue year-over-year in constant currency for the second consecutive quarter and expanded operating margins more than 3 points over the prior year. That's the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. 
Our Software business also delivered a strong quarter. When adjusted for divestitures and acquisitions, Software delivered its third consecutive quarter of constant currency growth. And in financial services, we saw double-digit volume growth over the prior year.
So with strong performance across every one of our business segments, HPE delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.42, at the high end of our previously provided outlook. 
Free cash flow improved in the second quarter to $511 million due to careful management of our working capital. Tim will walk through the drivers of our cash flow and outlook shortly. And we are seeing the benefits of our increased R&D and more focused product road maps as we take share from our competitors. 
In storage, HPE is the only major vendor to gain share in external disk over the last 2 years, while EMC, NetApp, IBM and Dell lost share year-over-year. Revenue in our 3PAR all-flash business grew nearly triple digits, about 2x faster than the market, and is once again expected to be larger and faster growing than pure. In networking, we are seeing an acceleration of our business, particularly since our acquisition of Aruba and our game-changing partnership with Unisplendour, a subsidiary of Tsinghua in China. And our results are in stark contrast with the result Cisco reported last week. In switching, HPE grew 18% year-over-year versus Cisco that was down 3%. And we are getting credit from the industry for our innovation, capturing the leading position in Gartner's most recent Magic Quadrant for wired-wireless, upsetting Cisco's long-standing run in the top spot. That is in addition to our leading positions in servers, storage and integrated systems. And we're not taking our foot off the pedal. Next month, at Discover Las Vegas, you'll be hearing more about some significant new innovations across our cloud, IoT and Composable Infrastructure product lines as well as an update on the machine. 
Last, but certainly not least, earlier today we made a major announcement that we are planning a tax-free spinoff and merger of our Enterprise Services business with CSC, which is expected to create a pure-play global IT service powerhouse with annual revenue of more than $26 billion. The new company will have more than 5,000 customers in 70 countries and employees in every region around the world. The transaction is expected to deliver approximately $8.5 billion to HPE's shareholders on an after-tax basis. This includes an equity stake in the newly combined company valued at more than $4.5 billion, which represents approximately 50% ownership, a cash dividend of $1.5 billion and the assumption of $2.5 billion of debt and other liabilities. We also expect the merger of the 2 businesses to produce first-tier synergies of approximately $1 billion post-close with a run rate of $1.5 billion by the end of year 1. There's also an opportunity for additional synergies in subsequent years. As owners of approximately 50% of the merged company, HPE shareholders will share in the value of the synergies as well as future growth in earnings. 
The cost to separate ES from HPE will be offset by lower costs associated with the previously announced fiscal year 2015 restructuring program, so there will be no incremental onetime cash payments beyond what we've already communicated. 
I will serve on the board of the new company, and HPE's Board of Directors will nominate half of the new company's board. Mike Lawrie, the current head of CSC, will become Chairman and CEO of the new company. And Mike Nefkens, the current EVP and General Manager of our Enterprise Services business, will become a key part of the new company's executive team and partner closely with Mike Lawrie on building the new organization. Other executives and directors as well as the name of the company will be announced at a later date. The transaction is currently targeted to be completed by March 31, 2017. 
For the combined CSC and Enterprise Services, this will create a new company that will be a pure-play global IT services leader. For customers, this means global access to world-class offerings in cloud, mobility, application development and modernization, business process services, IT services, big data and analytics and security. This is combined with deep industry experience in sectors that include financial services, transportation, consumer products, health care and insurance. HPE and this new company will be closely connected moving forward with agreements that will keep the 2 companies aligned for current customers and grow new business opportunities over time. 
For the remaining Hewlett Packard Enterprise, this transaction creates significant incremental value by unlocking a faster-growing, higher-margin and stronger free cash flow business. HPE will now have $33 billion in annual revenue and will focus on secure next-generation, software-defined infrastructure that leverages a world-class portfolio of servers, storage, networking, converged infrastructure as well as our Helion cloud platform and software assets. By bringing together leadership positions in these key data center technologies, we will help customers run their traditional IT better while building a bridge to multi-cloud environments. 
Beyond the data center, HPE is redefining IT at the edge with our next-generation Aruba and computing products for campus, branch and IoT applications. In addition, through our Technology Services division, we can deliver consulting and support to customers, while HPE Financial Services offers financial flexibilities to customers to maximize their investments. Finally, we will continue to leverage our portfolio of operations, security and big data software assets that deliver machine learning and deep analytics capabilities to customers. 
Mike Lawrie has joined our call today and will have much more to say about the deal in a moment. But first, Tim is going to walk us through HPE's financial performance in detail."
273983758,336644881,991393,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 24, 2016",2016-05-24,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thanks, Meg. Overall, we had a great quarter. We grew revenue as reported and in constant currency, generated healthy cash flow and delivered non-GAAP diluted net EPS at the high end of our guided range. Revenue of $12.7 billion was up 1.3% year-over-year",2007,"Thanks, Meg. Overall, we had a great quarter. We grew revenue as reported and in constant currency, generated healthy cash flow and delivered non-GAAP diluted net EPS at the high end of our guided range. Revenue of $12.7 billion was up 1.3% year-over-year and grew 4.9% in constant currency, our fourth consecutive quarter of constant currency growth. And as Meg mentioned, HPE businesses reported absolute revenue growth for the first time in 5 years. 
We saw revenue growth in constant currency in every region and outright growth in the Americas and APJ. Our Americas performance continues to support cautious optimism for the remainder of the year amongst an uneven macroeconomic environment. In EMEA, we were still significantly impacted by currency. Hoever, we are seeing encouraging momentum in enterprise hardware. And in APJ, China networking drove strong performance. The top line currency impact to revenue was 4 points year-over-year, primarily due to hedging gains from the prior year. Going forward, we expect the currency impact to significantly moderate throughout the second half of the year. And, we continue to anticipate an impact to revenue of approximately 3 points for the full year as rates are now roughly in line with where they were when we originally guided the year.
Margins were largely stable in the quarter, with gross margin of 28.7%, up 10 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially. And non-GAAP operating profit margin was 7.9%, down 50 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially. 
Total non-GAAP operating expenses of $2.6 billion were up 4.7% year-over-year primarily due to increased FSC and R&D investments. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.42, at the high end of our guided range. This primarily excludes $201 million for amortization of intangible assets, $161 million for restructuring and $91 million of separation charges. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.18, $0.01 above our previously guided range. 
Now turning to the business results. The Enterprise Group had a strong quarter with excellent top line performance. Our sales motion is hitting its stride aided by the seamless launch of the HPE brand and our marketing efforts. Revenue was up 7% year-over-year or 10% in constant currency and grew in all product groups. For the remainder of the year, revenue growth will likely moderate as we will not have the benefit of H3C and begin to face tougher compares. 
Profitability in the quarter was 11.7%, down 240 basis points year-on-year. This was primarily due to foreign exchange, heavier Tier 1 mix and, to a lesser degree, incremental R&D investments. 
A deal that exemplifies the strength of the Enterprise Group is the recently won project with Woolworths Limited, Australia's largest retail company. Our solution, based on the ConvergedSystem 900 for SAP HANA, provides access to real-time data, enabling critical business decisions to be made immediately. This competitive win against Lenovo, Fujitsu and Dimension Data with Cisco UCS also displaces the current outsourced provider, Wipro, and further secures HPE's relationship with Woolworths.
Service revenue grew 7% year-on-year or 10% in constant currency, primarily driven by strong Tier 1 sales in the Americas and core servers in APJ. Based on our performance, we believe we took share in servers overall, density-optimized servers and rack. From a regional perspective, we took share in the Americas and EMEA. And this quarter, we started shipping our Hyper Converged HC 380, which enabled midsize and remote office enterprises to easily deploy, manage and support virtual machines in a few clicks. We continue to see servers as a growth driver given the strength of our portfolio and anticipate healthy demand for compute through the remainder of the year. 
In storage, we grew revenue 2% year-over-year and 5% in constant currency. Converged Storage continued its strong growth trend, growing 19% year-over-year in constant currency and comprising 54% of the total portfolio. 3PAR all-flash revenue grew near-triple digits and continues to drive mid-range share gains. We estimate that we gained market share in the external disk for the 10th consecutive quarter and expect Storage to gain share throughout the remainder of the year on the strength of the 3PAR portfolio and new logo wins as we take advantage of the uncertainty surrounding the Dell-EMC merger. 
Networking revenue grew 57% year-over-year as reported or 62% in constant currency. And when adjusted for Aruba, networking was still up 17% in constant currency. We had strong execution with growth across all regions. While Aruba continues to drive growth in wireless share, we also expect to take share in switching and routing on the strength of H3C and Aruba campus switching pull-through. Leading up to the transaction close with Tsinghua, H3C grew more than 50% year-over-year, validating the strategic moves we made to collaborate with a strong local partner. 
In Technology Services, revenue did decline 6% year-on-year or 2% in constant currency. However, it was only down 1% in constant currency when adjusted for the discontinuation of HP Inc. attach, which remains in the fiscal year '15 results. TS Support, the most profitable and largest segment of Technology Services, grew orders in constant currency. Based on this and the order growth we saw last year, we continue to expect TS revenue to return to growth in constant currency towards the end of the year. 
Enterprise Services had another great quarter as we continue to see the benefits of our restructuring cost actions and improving sales motion. A great example of the deals we are winning is our recent selection from 5 other competitors for a 10-year $0.5 billion contract to provide IT services, including infrastructure, mission-critical systems and applications to the U.S. Strategic Command. Revenue declined 2% year-over-year but grew 1% in constant currency. When adjusted for the Deutsche Bank win last year, both new business TCV and total TCV grew year-over-year. Strategic Enterprise Services is gaining strength in both overall revenue and mix, delivering mid-double-digit growth year-over-year. ABS continues to improve with a third consecutive quarter of year-on-year constant currency revenue growth. And ITO also grew in constant currency for the first time since the first quarter of 2012. 
Operating profit improved 310 basis points year-over-year to 6.7% as the team continues to execute productivity improvements in delivery and sales. We are also seeing the benefits from improving location mix as well as increasing sold margins and healthy add-on sales. We continue to track well against our longer-term goal of 60-40 low-cost, high-cost headcount mix and completed the quarter with 47% of our headcount in low-cost centers. The progress made on cost improvements, sales strength and normal quarterly seasonality provides us with confidence that operating profit margins for the full year will now be towards the high end of our original 6% to 7% outlook.
Software declined 13% year-over-year as reported or 10% in constant currency. However, it was up 2% in constant currency when adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. Sales strength in security and big data was partly offset by declines in IT management. On a product level, we had encouraging results in Voltage, Fortify and IDOL. The team continues to focus on disciplined cost controls, decreasing OpEx dollars year-over-year and growing operating profit dollars. Operating profit margin expanded 7 points year-over-year. However, the largest contributor to OpEx and margin improvement was a onetime benefit from the TippingPoint divestiture. 
HPE Financial Services revenue declined 2% year-over-year but grew 1% in constant currency. Operating profit declined 130 basis points year-over-year to 9.3% as lower residual sales pressured margin rates. Financing volume grew 15% year-over-year or 19% in constant currency, primarily due to favorable movement in our cost of funds, which has enabled us to price more competitively. Return on equity was down 230 basis points year-on-year to 12.7%. 
Cash flow was strong in the quarter due to judicious working capital management. Cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion, up 101% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Free cash flow was $511 million, up from negative $106 million last year, again, on an adjusted basis. 
When adjusted for the sale of H3C, the cash conversion cycle was 27 days, down 4 days quarter-over-quarter. The largest contributor to cash conversion cycle improvement was DPO, which increased 5 days sequentially adjusted for H3C as we continue to improve payment terms with our vendors. This was partly offset by DSO, which increased 2 days sequentially, while DOI was flat through the quarter. Given the momentum in our working capital initiatives, we now expect our cash conversion cycle will reach the low 20-day range by the year-end. 
Now let's turn to capital allocation. In the quarter, we returned $109 million of cash to shareholders. Due to the ES-CSC transaction, we were largely prohibited from repurchasing shares and only bought back $15 million of shares. We also paid $94 million as part of our normal dividend. We continue to see our shares as very attractively priced and will be back in the market this month. Along those lines, our Board of Directors recently increased our share repurchase authorization by $3 billion, which now stands at $4.8 billion remaining.
During our Q1 earnings call, we committed approximately $2 billion of the proceeds from the H3C transaction to share repurchases. We now expect to complete roughly half of those this fiscal year, with the remainder to be completed in fiscal year '17. As you recall, share repurchases resulting from the H3C transaction are in addition to commitment to return 100% of our original fiscal year '16 free cash flow outlook to shareholders. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on recent M&A activity. First, we announced the sale of our majority stake in Mphasis to Blackstone as we continue to refine our capital strategy and make improvements to our go-to-market model. We expect this transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In addition, during the quarter, we closed the sale of 51% of H3C to Tsinghua at the beginning of May. Remember that our prior guidance did not include the impact of this transaction. We now think that we can offset the EPS impact with the share repurchases we completed in the first quarter and the incremental share repurchases to be completed later this year. 
Going forward, we will recognize only 49% of H3C earnings and receive a corresponding cash payment. This will reduce cash flow by approximately $200 million in the second half of fiscal year '16. However, roughly half of that will be received as a cash payment in fiscal year '17. 
Finally, I'd like to discuss the cash impact of the ES-CSC transaction to HPE. There will be no incremental onetime uses of cash beyond that we've already communicated. We expect total onetime separation payments of around $900 million, with $300 million in fiscal year '16 and the remainder in fiscal year '17. As an offset, we will reduce the $2.6 billion of restructuring payments associated with our 2015 restructuring plan by roughly $1 billion as we are achieving our targeted savings more efficiently and will no longer need to fund ES actions after the transaction closes. We've gained valuable experience in the HPE-HPI separation that gives us confidence in executing this spin quickly and efficiently. In total, the fiscal year '16 free cash flow will be reduced by $300 million due to the H3C divestiture and current year ES separation payments that will be partly offset by working capital improvements.
Let's go to guidance. We expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.42 to $0.46 in Q3 of 2016 and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $1.10 to $1.14 in Q3 of 2016 and now expect full year fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.68 to $1.78, reflecting the new ES separation charges and gain on sale of H3C. And we now expect full year fiscal 2016 free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Meg."

Now I'd like to go into more detail on the deal we announced today with CSC, which I think will be very beneficial to customers, employees and shareholders of both companies. As today's results confirm, Enterprise Services is a stronger and more robust business than it has been in many years. As a result of customer diversification efforts and other improvements, ES delivered stable constant currency revenue for the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2016, which were the first quarters of year-over-year constant currency revenue growth since fiscal 2012. Overall, ES is on track to achieve its long-term goal of a market-competitive cost structure and operating margins. 
So by bringing together the best of these 2 organizations, we will create a pure-play services leader ready to compete and win against all the current players. The new company will have greater agility, focus and the ability to drive faster outcomes for our customers. It will also have a top-notch management team, quite literally the best in the business, and that management team will be 100% focused on ensuring a smooth transition with no disruption for ES and CSC customers. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mike Lawrie. Mike and I have gotten to know each other quite well, and I can tell you he is a world-class CEO with incredible talent and unbridled passion for his business. Once the deal closes, I look forward to working with him to build our new company. Mike?"

I'm excited about the great potential this merger brings to our people, to our clients, to our partners and investors, both at CSC and HPE's Enterprise Services division. And let me tell you why.Over the past few years, our 2 organ",723,"Well, thank you, Meg. I'm excited about the great potential this merger brings to our people, to our clients, to our partners and investors, both at CSC and HPE's Enterprise Services division. And let me tell you why.
Over the past few years, our 2 organizations have been embarked on critical turnarounds and broad-based transformations. Not everyone is aware of this, but Meg and I joined our respective companies within about 6 months of each other. And I'm pleased to be able to say that, in recent years, both our organizations have been on upward trajectories with significant improvements in financial performance and in client satisfaction scores. And the progress has been real and it has been measurable. Both of our companies separated last year, within a month of one another, into more client-focused pure-play entities aimed at specific markets and core industries. 
In today's announcement, the coming together of these 2 organizations is the next logical step, building on their progress to date and significantly accelerating their transformation. The new company will be a global top 3 leader in IT services, one that's uniquely positioned to lead clients in their digital transformations. Our organizations are highly complementary. HPE Enterprise Services has a proud legacy and brings focus and agility and the ability to drive faster outcomes for clients, along with a first-rate sales organization. CSC brings deep industry expertise, innovation and next-generation technologies and an exceptional partner network, among other strengths. And together as an agile technology independent services pure play, we will be better positioned to innovate and compete and win against both emerging and established players. We will have substantial scale to serve customers more efficiently and effectively worldwide. We will have a highly competitive cost structure to take advantage of our distinct growth opportunities, resulting in the capital capacity to invest and grow both organically and inorganically. We will strengthen and grow client relationships that cover more than 3/4 of the Fortune 500, with less than 15% overlap across our top accounts. We will leverage a combined portfolio that will include leading solutions in areas like managed security, cloud IP, enterprise applications and big data and analytics, along with combined BPO leadership in health care and insurance and banking and capital markets. 
But most importantly, this great leap forward in our transformation will enable our people to better innovate, to compete and adapt to an ever-changing marketplace. Employees will become part of a very strong and focused global enterprise that is positioned for success, one that enables them to take advantage of the diverse career development and growth opportunities of a larger global enterprise. And as a pure-play services leader, our new company would be able to operate independent of any single hardware provider, establishing the right partnerships for success. And at the same time, CSC and HPE you will have long-term agreements in place to ensure that current customer commitments continue to be met and our relationship will be stronger and our collaboration deeper. 
Now before I hand it back to Meg, I'd just like to take a moment to thank the teams at both companies for their hard work and resilience in driving our respective transformations. Through your efforts, we are in a place where we can bring our 2 great organizations together and includes our team at CSC and also the HPE Enterprise Services team under Mike Nefkens. And I'm pleased that Mike has agreed to stay with the company in a senior position reporting to me, and that he will be playing a crucial role in helping build and grow our new company. And I'm looking forward to working with Meg as a member of the new company's board.
So let me just reiterate my excitement about our 2 organizations coming together to better serve clients around the world and deliver value for our shareholders. We recognize that we're just at the beginning of this process with a lot of work to do. By staying laser focused and working in the same collaborative spirit that has gotten us to this point, we can get to the finish line faster and in a great position to launch the new company. My colleagues at CSC and I look forward to working with everyone at HP Enterprise Services. So now let me hand it back to you, Meg."

So we're actually very excited about what will become a standalone Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Our focus is going to be on next-gen software-defined infrastructure with a world-class portfolio of servers; storage; networking; converged infrastructure; hyperconverged; Helion, our Helion cloud platform; and our software assets. And you probably have guessed by now that I am now a devotee of focus. And this is going to be a laser-like focused company that, as I think you know, is higher growth, higher margin with more robust free cash flow. And it's going to be well capitalized. So we don't necessarily think there is a need for acquisitions, but if we find the right companies, we certainly will move. And let me just recap the kind of acquisitions that have worked well for this company in the past: complementary technologies that we can put through our excellent distribution and support system. So think 3PAR, 3Com, Aruba, all 3 of those acquisitions have been fantastic for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. And so we'll keep our eyes out for those kinds of acquisitions. Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of those around. But to the extent we see them, we won't hesitate to move. And as Tim said, remember, our capital allocation strategy is returns-based. Right now, we really think there's incredible value in our stock price. And Tim announced we're going to be buying back using 100% of our free cash flow in addition to half of the H3C proceeds. And we just got an increase in authorization of share buyback from our board."

I would say on ES, as we talked about, we feel much more comfortable at the 7% range for this year. Again, we have a lot of momentum in that business. A lot of the activities that the team has done through the transformation are starting to see through to the P&L. So 7% to 9% is what we would have. It may be conservative but, again, we need to get some -- continue to execute, and there's more work to do there. So we're prudent at the 7% to 9%. On the EG front, margins were down about 240 basis points. And that's primarily driven by foreign exchange, some Tier 1 mix and, to a lesser degree, the R&D investments we've made. And we are a little bit heavy in Tier 1 right now. If you recall, we launched the Cloudline product line, where we're seeing a lot of momentum. We launched that in the second half of last year, so we are a little bit heavier-weighted in Tier 1. We'd expect that to normalize in the second half. I think margins there will be stable in the near term. And if you look longer term, we may even see some expansion or we'd expect to see some expansion as you think about further growth in Aruba, Converged Storage and those types of areas."

The business has a lot of momentum in terms of profit improvement. I understand the $8.5 billion consideration, but this business is going to earn over $1 billion in net income this year, could be closer to $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion going forward. So you're ascribing a value of 6.5x to 8x to that business when operating profit under your previous plan would have been growing pretty healthily. So I guess the question is why now when you were kind of at the cusp of improvement and, arguably, could have gotten paid for that in your stock price? And how did you determine the value?

So we are actually very pleased with the turnaround that we have executed in Enterprise Services. And I would say the time is ripe now because we believe this industry actually will consolidate and it's better to be on the front end of a consolidation play than the back end of a consolidation play. And while there is more margin expansion here, we actually think the ability to accelerate the turnaround of ES will happen in the combined entity of CSC and ES. And recall that our shareholders will own 50% of this new entity, so they'll be party to that 50% of the synergies, 50% of the operational improvements, 50% of the synergy improvement. So in some ways, the shareholders get the best of both worlds. They get to maintain a position in Hewlett Packard Enterprise and a more focused software-defined data center and Edge strategy, and they get to ride the upside, half the upside that they would have gotten had it stayed with us. And my view is the upside will be bigger with CSC and ES together. And I guess the other reason as to why now if the business is in a good position, 2 years ago, we were struggling in this business, we've diversified the revenue, we've taken cost out, revenue has stabilized, we've developed some new product lines. And I think combined with CSC, it's going to be a powerhouse IT services company."

Now we wanted to make sure that we did a 50-50 merger of equals, tax-free spin merge of Enterprise Services into this new entity. And so obviously, we made some -- we negotiated some adjustments to that. So first of all, the new company, and I'm sort of calling it, for shorthand, CSC-ES, will pay Hewlett Packard Enterprise, the future stand-alone Hewlett Packard Enterprise, $1.5 billion of cash after the deal closes and will assume $2.5 billion of liability, pension liability, as well as old EDS $300 million bond. And then ES or Hewlett Packard Enterprise will actually subsidize some of that pension liability with offshore cash. So Chris, do you want add any more detail to that?"

So the 2 components, the $3.9 billion of upfront considerations plus the $4.6 billion of equity considerations in CSC stock, essentially makes up the $8.5 billion in total valuation. Now the equity considerations that CSC will essentially issue stock at the time of the transaction, and that stock will essentially result in the company being 50-50. And the price or the total value at the time of the close will depend on where CSC is trading at that point in time."

And I guess, part of the point of being a pure services company is that they're fairly agnostic. And so do you lose that over time? So it's not obvious to me that you absolutely maintain what you have and it's just a question of if it gets better. I'm a little worried, obviously, about whether it could get worse. And then, conversely, what does getting rid of the services business or half of it do for you on the HPE side? What can you do now that you weren't able to do previously?"

So actually, we are very -- this was a very important part of the deal because the last thing I wanted to do was combine CSC with ES and then lose the infrastructure pull-through. That would not have been a value to Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. So we've negotiated a deal that I think is very fair. It allows CSC to continue to work with people they've worked with in the past, but we've also got a commitment from them for the next 3 years. Beyond that, I'm very confident that the work we will do in Hewlett Packard Enterprise will earn our way to that commitment. I mean, think about our server lineup, our storage lineup, our networking lineup, our wired-wireless LAN lineup, our converged infrastructure, hyperconverged and Helion cloud platform. But we do have, if you will, a safety net for the next 3 years. But I also -- one of the benefits of a pure-play services company is to be able to work with best-of-breed, and I know Mike wants to continue to do that. So I think we've struck a good thing that protects us in the near term but gives Mike the flexibility he needs to do solutions that are right for his customers. On the other side of it is we do business today with some of ES' competitors, think about Deloitte or Accenture, Capgemini or the Indian players. And we want to continue to grow that. And there -- just like for Mike, there's a benefit to being a pure play that will be benefit for us in terms of being primarily a software-defined infrastructure company and a software company, so we imagine growing the business with those players as well. And by the way, this interestingly happened with the HPE, HP Inc. split. When HP Inc. became a separate company, all of a sudden, a lot of competitors who used to think they were competitors to some degree with our company, all of a sudden were very interested in the HP Inc. offering, so we think that could happen to us as well."

So we -- we're not giving revenue guidance and EPS guidance for the stand-alone company, I'm certain we will closer to March 31. But we expect to go at or above the market rate as we did this quarter. I think it's important to look at our results this quarter for Enterprise Group and Software. I think they are the best indication that we've got a winning company here. We outgrew the market. We outgrew every single competitor, gained share in every single one of our -- against our infrastructure competitors. And I think what you have now is the Enterprise Group and Software on a roll and the investments that we have made in R&D, the investments we've made in a fire-in-the-belly sales force. I mean, we have done a complete transformation of our sales force around not only our channel, but also direct selling. And then if you think about how we've optimized marketing spend over the last couple of years, we're doing better in demand gen, digital marketing that we've ever done, so I think you've got a little powerhouse in software-defined infrastructure and software."

The primary delta versus consensus right now is really driven by the H3C transaction, to your point, that's probably about, I'd say, $0.03 or $0.04. So that implies a ramp in the fourth quarter. And that's really -- think about it in 3 ways. One, it's typical seasonality. So when you look at our ES business and our Software business, those businesses tend to be back end-loaded so that will drive a lot of the improvement. The second component is around the H3C transaction from a stranded cost perspective. So now that the deal is closed, there is some overhead costs that we need to take out of the system. That generally takes a little bit of time, not too dissimilar to the dis-synergy story we had around the separation. And then the third component is driven by the share repurchases. So there's more of an impact in Q4 versus Q3 on the share repurchase front. So those are really the key drivers to the ramp in the fourth quarter. But we've got clear plans. For sure, we need to go out and execute, but we feel good about the total year. And that's why we held our total year guide of $1.85 to $1.95."

So right now, when you look at our total mix from a Tier 1 perspective, it's a little bit heavy. Again, that will tend to normalize. So I would expect the margins in EG to be stable. And I'm not going to give margin guidance here but, again, as we continue to grow Aruba, as we continue to grow Storage, that's going to help the margin front. On the TS front, that business will also stabilize. So we had -- we were down in revenue 1% in constant currency when you adjust for the HPI transaction. But we do expect revenue growth in the latter part of the year. And the way to think about that is, obviously, that's an annuity type business given the contracts. So what we're going to start seeing in the second half is that those negative growth orders that we had in '14, that's replaced by positive growth that we saw in '15. That feeds our 2016 revenue. So we do expect TS revenue to be flat on a year-over-year basis for the total year, and that will also help from a margin perspective as well."

And so different countries sort of go up and down different regions. But overall, I think we feel very comfortable with our position in the traditional IT market and then in our ability to provide solutions in a multi-cloud environment. So I think demand can go up and down, but our objective is in whatever the market's doing, we want to make sure we at least hold or gain share, and we did that in the last quarter. And I don't think there's anything new to add as to why. First of all, I think the R&D investments that we've made over the last 4 years are paying off. So the development cycle in servers, storage, networking, those kinds of things, hyperconverged, these are long-term investments. What you started 3 years ago actually comes to the market now or even next year. So that investment in R&D is paying off. And I will tell you, $1 spent on internal R&D is the best dollar we spend at HPE. It's fantastic. Second is when you retool a sales force, that takes some time as well. And I would say we're much farther along than we have been, and there is more work to do. And then, as I said, marketing, we've retooled our entire demand generation. We've retooled -- and by the way, the launch of Hewlett Packard Enterprise gave us a chance to tell people the story of the enterprise side of this business because, prior to that, if you had asked a man on the street what is HPE, they'd say a printing and PC company. So I think that's actually been beneficial. And then turnarounds take 5 years. I said it when I started, and we're rounding the bend into the end of the fifth year. And so it's gratifying that we saw as-reported growth for the first time in 5 years."

Hewlett-Packard Enterprise completed our second full quarter as an independent company, and I have to say that we've delivered the best performance since I joined.
In Q2, we saw our first quarter of as-reported year-over-year revenue growth since 2011 for the Hewlett-Packard Enterprise businesses. We also saw our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant-currency revenue growth. We delivered revenue of $12.7 billion, up more than 1% as reported and 5% in constant currency, driven by excellent performance in servers, storage, networking and converged infrastructure as well as outstanding performance in Enterprise Services. 
Enterprise Group had a fabulous quarter, delivering 7% revenue growth on an as-reported basis and 10% in constant currency. In fact, we grew on an as-reported basis in every one of EG's hardware business units and in every region. ES grew revenue year-over-year in constant currency for the second consecutive quarter and expanded operating margins more than 3 points over the prior year. That's the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. 
Our Software business also delivered a strong quarter. When adjusted for divestitures and acquisitions, Software delivered its third consecutive quarter of constant-currency growth. And in Financial Services, we saw double-digit volume growth over the prior year.
So with strong performance across every one of our business segments, HPE delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.42, at the high end of our previously provided outlook. 
Free cash flow improved in the second quarter to $511 million due to careful management of our working capital. Tim will walk through the drivers of our cash flow and outlook shortly. And we are seeing the benefits of our increased R&D and more focused product road maps as we take share from our competitors. 
In storage, HPE is the only major vendor to gain share in external disk over the last 2 years, while EMC, NetApp, IBM and Dell lost share year-over-year. Revenue in our 3PAR all-flash business grew nearly triple digits, about 2x faster than the market, and is once again expected to be larger and faster growing than pure [ph]. In networking, we are seeing an acceleration of our business, particularly since our acquisition of Aruba and our game-changing partnership with Unisplendour, a subsidiary of Tsinghua in China. 
And our results are in stark contrast with the result Cisco reported last week. In switching, HPE grew 18% year-over-year versus Cisco that was down 3%. And we are getting credit from the industry for our innovation, capturing the leading position in Gartner's most recent Magic Quadrant for wired-wireless, upsetting Cisco's longstanding run in the top spot. That is in addition to our leading positions in servers, storage and integrated systems. And we're not taking our foot off the pedal. Next month, at Discover Las Vegas, you'll be hearing more about some significant new innovations across our cloud, IoT and Composable Infrastructure product lines as well as an update on the machine. 
Last but certainly not least, earlier today, we made a major announcement that we are planning a tax-free spinoff and merger of our Enterprise Services business with CSC, which is expected to create a pure-play global IT service powerhouse with annual revenue of more than $26 billion. The new company will have more than 5,000 customers in 70 countries and employees in every region around the world. The transaction is expected to deliver approximately $8.5 billion to HPE's shareholders on an after-tax basis. This includes an equity stake in the newly combined company valued at more than $4.5 billion, which represents approximately 50% ownership, a cash dividend of $1.5 billion and the assumption of $2.5 billion of debt and other liabilities. 
We also expect the merger of the 2 businesses to produce first-year synergies of approximately $1 billion post-close with a run rate of $1.5 billion by the end of year 1. There's also an opportunity for additional synergies in subsequent years. As owners of approximately 50% of the merged company, HPE shareholders will share in the value of the synergies as well as future growth in earnings. 
The cost to separate ES from HPE will be offset by lower cost associated with the previously announced fiscal year 2015 restructuring program, so there will be no incremental onetime cash payments beyond what we've already communicated. 
I will serve on the board of the new company, and HPE's Board of Directors will nominate half of the new company's board. Mike Lawrie, the current head of CSC, will become Chairman and CEO of the new company. And Mike Nefkens, the current EVP and General Manager of our Enterprise Services business, will become a key part of the new company's executive team and partner closely with Mike Lawrie on building the new organization. Other executives and directors as well as the name of the company will be announced at a later date. The transaction is currently targeted to be completed by March 31, 2017. 
For the combined CSC and Enterprise Services, this will create a new company that will be a pure-play global IT services leader. For customers, this means global access to world-class offerings in cloud, mobility, application development and modernization, business process services, IT services, big data and analytics, and security. This is combined with deep industry experience in sectors that include financial services, transportation, consumer products, health care and insurance. HPE and this new company will be closely connected moving forward with agreements that will keep the 2 companies aligned for current customers and grow new business opportunities over time. 
For the remaining Hewlett Packard Enterprise, this transaction creates significant incremental value by unlocking a faster-growing, higher-margin and stronger free cash flow business. HPE will now have $33 billion in annual revenue and will focus on secure next-generation, software-defined infrastructure that leverages a world-class portfolio of servers, storage, networking, converged infrastructure as well as our Helion cloud platform and software assets. By bringing together leadership positions in these key data center technologies, we will help customers run their traditional IT better while building a bridge to multi-cloud environments. 
Beyond the data center, HPE is redefining IT at the edge with our next-generation Aruba and computing products for campus, branch and IoT applications. In addition, through our Technology Services division, we can deliver consulting and support to customers, while HPE Financial Services offers financial flexibilities to customers to maximize their investments. Finally, we will continue to leverage our portfolio of operations, security and big data software assets that deliver machine learning and deep analytics capabilities to customers. 
Mike Lawrie has joined our call today and will have much more to say about the deal in a moment. But first, Tim is going to walk us through HPE's financial performance in detail."
273983758,336644881,991446,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 24, 2016",2016-05-24,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thanks, Meg. Overall, we had a great quarter. We grew revenue as reported and in constant currency, generated healthy cash flow and delivered non-GAAP diluted net EPS at the high end of our guided range. Revenue of $12.7 billion was up 1.3% year-over-year",2008,"Thanks, Meg. Overall, we had a great quarter. We grew revenue as reported and in constant currency, generated healthy cash flow and delivered non-GAAP diluted net EPS at the high end of our guided range. Revenue of $12.7 billion was up 1.3% year-over-year and grew 4.9% in constant currency, our fourth consecutive quarter of constant-currency growth. And as Meg mentioned, HPE businesses reported absolute revenue growth for the first time in 5 years. 
We saw revenue growth in constant currency in every region and outright growth in the Americas and APJ. Our Americas performance continues to support cautious optimism for the remainder of the year amongst an uneven macroeconomic environment. In EMEA, we were still significantly impacted by currency. However, we are seeing encouraging momentum in enterprise hardware. And in APJ, China networking drove strong performance. 
The top line currency impact to revenue was 4 points year-over-year primarily due to hedging gains from the prior year. Going forward, we expect the currency impact to significantly moderate throughout the second half of the year. And we continue to anticipate an impact to revenue of approximately 3 points for the full year as rates are now roughly in line with where they were when we originally guided the year.
Margins were largely stable in the quarter with gross margin of 28.7%, up 10 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially. And non-GAAP operating profit margin was 7.9%, down 50 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially. 
Total non-GAAP operating expenses of $2.6 billion were up 4.7% year-over-year primarily due to increased FSC and R&D investments. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.42, at the high end of our guided range. This primarily excludes $201 million for amortization of intangible assets, $161 million for restructuring and $91 million of separation charges. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.18, $0.01 above our previously guided range. 
Now turning to the business results. The Enterprise Group had a strong quarter with excellent top line performance. Our sales motion is hitting its stride aided by the seamless launch of the HPE brand and our marketing efforts. Revenue was up 7% year-over-year or 10% in constant currency and grew in all product groups. For the remainder of the year, revenue growth will likely moderate as we will not have the benefit of H3C and begin to face tougher compares. 
Profitability in the quarter was 11.7%, down 240 basis points year-on-year. This was primarily due to foreign exchange, heavier Tier 1 mix and, to a lesser degree, incremental R&D investments. 
A deal that exemplifies the strength of the Enterprise Group is the recently won project with Woolworths Limited, Australia's largest retail company. Our solution, based on the ConvergedSystem 900 for SAP HANA, provides access to realtime data, enabling critical business decisions to be made immediately. This competitive win against Lenovo, Fujitsu and Dimension Data with Cisco UCS also displaces the current outsourced provider, Wipro, and further secures HPE's relationship with Woolworths.
Servers revenue grew 7% year-on-year or 10% in constant currency, primarily driven by strong Tier 1 sales in the Americas and core servers in APJ. Based on our performance, we believe we took share in servers overall, density-optimized servers and rack. From a regional perspective, we took share in the Americas and EMEA. And this quarter, we started shipping our Hyper Converged HC 380, which enables midsize and remote office enterprises to easily deploy, manage and support virtual machines in a few clicks. We continue to see servers as a growth driver given the strength of our portfolio and anticipate healthy demand for compute through the remainder of the year. 
In storage, we grew revenue 2% year-over-year and 5% in constant currency. Converged Storage continued its strong growth trend, growing 19% year-over-year in constant currency and comprising 54% of the total portfolio. 3PAR all-flash revenue grew near triple digits and continues to drive mid-range share gains. We estimate that we gained market share in the external disk for the 10th consecutive quarter and expect Storage to gain share throughout the remainder of the year on the strength of the 3PAR portfolio and new logo wins as we take advantage of the uncertainty surrounding the Dell-EMC merger. 
Networking revenue grew 57% year-over-year as reported or 62% in constant currency. And when adjusted for Aruba, networking was still up 17% in constant currency. We had strong execution with growth across all regions. While Aruba continues to drive growth in wireless share, we also expect to take share in switching and routing on the strength of H3C and Aruba campus switching pull-through. Leading up to the transaction close with Tsinghua, H3C grew more than 50% year-over-year, validating the strategic moves we made to collaborate with a strong local partner. 
In Technology Services, revenue did decline 6% year-on-year or 2% in constant currency. However, it was only down 1% in constant currency when adjusted for the discontinuation of HP Inc. attach, which remains in the fiscal year '15 results. TS support, the most profitable and largest segment of Technology Services, grew orders in constant currency. Based on this and the order growth we saw last year, we continue to expect TS revenue to return to growth in constant currency towards the end of the year. 
Enterprise Services had another great quarter as we continue to see the benefits of our restructuring cost actions and improving sales motion. A great example of the deals we are winning is our recent selection from 5 other competitors for a 10-year $0.5 billion contract to provide IT services, including infrastructure, mission-critical systems and applications to the U.S. Strategic Command. 
Revenue declined 2% year-over-year but grew 1% in constant currency. When adjusted for the Deutsche Bank win last year, both new business TCV and total TCV grew year-over-year. Strategic Enterprise Services is gaining strength in both overall revenue and mix, delivering mid-double-digit growth year-on-year. ABS continues to improve with a third consecutive quarter of year-on-year constant-currency revenue growth. And ITO also grew in constant currency for the first time since the first quarter of 2012. 
Operating profit improved 310 basis points year-over-year to 6.7% as the team continues to execute productivity improvements in delivery and sales. We're also seeing the benefits from improving location mix as well as increasing sold margins and healthy add-on sales. We continue to track well against our longer-term goal of 60-40 low-cost, high-cost headcount mix and completed the quarter with 47% of our headcount in low-cost centers. The progress made on cost improvements, sales strength and normal quarterly seasonality provides us with confidence that operating profit margins for the full year will now be towards the high end of our original 6% to 7% outlook.
Software declined 13% year-over-year as reported or 10% in constant currency. However, it was up 2% in constant currency when adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. Sales strength in security and big data was partly offset by declines in IT management. On a product level, we had encouraging results in Voltage, Fortify and IDOL. The team continues to focus on disciplined cost controls, decreasing OpEx dollars year-over-year and growing operating profit dollars. Operating profit margin expanded 7 points year-over-year. However, the largest contributor to OpEx and margin improvement was a onetime benefit from the TippingPoint divestiture. 
HPE Financial Services revenue declined 2% year-over-year but grew 1% in constant currency. Operating profit declined 130 basis points year-over-year to 9.3% as the lower residual sales pressured margin rates. Financing volume grew 15% year-over-year or 19% in constant currency primarily due to favorable movement in our cost of funds, which has enabled us to price more competitively. Return on equity was down 230 basis points year-on-year to 12.7%. 
Cash flow was strong in the quarter due to judicious working capital management. Cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion, up 101% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Free cash flow was $511 million, up from negative $106 million last year, again, on an adjusted basis. 
When adjusted for the sale of H3C, the cash conversion cycle was 27 days, down 4 days quarter-over-quarter. The largest contributor to cash conversion cycle improvement was DPO, which increased 5 days sequentially adjusted for H3C as we continue to improve payment terms with our vendors. This was partly offset by DSO, which increased 2 days sequentially, while DOI was flat through the quarter. Given the momentum in our working capital initiatives, we now expect our cash conversion cycle will reach the low 20-day range by the year-end. 
Now let's turn to capital allocation. In the quarter, we returned $109 million of cash to shareholders. Due to the ES-CSC transaction, we were largely prohibited from repurchasing shares and only bought back $15 million of shares. We also paid $94 million as part of our normal dividend. We continue to see our shares as very attractively priced and will be back in the market this month. Along those lines, our Board of Directors recently increased our share repurchase authorization by $3 billion, which now stands at $4.8 billion remaining.
During our Q1 earnings call, we committed approximately $2 billion of the proceeds from the H3C transaction to share repurchases. We now expect to complete roughly half of those this fiscal year with the remainder to be completed in fiscal year '17. As you recall, share repurchases resulting from the H3C transaction are in addition to our commitment to return 100% of our original fiscal year '16 free cash flow outlook to shareholders. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on recent M&A activity. First, we announced the sale of our majority stake in Mphasis to Blackstone as we continue to refine our capital strategy and make improvements to our go-to-market model. We expect this transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In addition, during the quarter, we closed the sale of 51% of H3C to Tsinghua at the beginning of May. Remember that our prior guidance did not include the impact of this transaction. We now think that we can offset the EPS impact with the share repurchases we completed in the first quarter and the incremental share repurchases to be completed later this year. 
Going forward, we will recognize only 49% of H3C earnings and receive a corresponding cash payment. This will reduce cash flow by approximately $200 million in the second half of fiscal year '16. However, roughly half of that will be received as a cash payment in fiscal year '17. 
Finally, I'd like to discuss the cash impact of the ES-CSC transaction to HPE. There will be no incremental onetime uses of cash beyond that we've already communicated. We expect total onetime separation payments of around $900 million with $300 million in fiscal year '16 and the remainder in fiscal year '17. As an offset, we will reduce the $2.6 billion of restructuring payments associated with our 2015 restructuring plan by roughly $1 billion as we are achieving our targeted savings more efficiently and will no longer need to fund ES actions after the transaction closes. We have gained valuable experience in the HPE-HPI separation that gives us confidence in executing this spin quickly and efficiently. In total, the fiscal year '16 free cash flow will be reduced by $300 million due to the H3C divestiture and current year ES separation payments that will be partly offset by working capital improvements.
Let's go to guidance. We expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.42 to $0.46 in Q3 of 2016 and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $1.10 to $1.14 in Q3 of 2016 and now expect full year fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.68 to $1.78, reflecting the new ES separation charges and gain on sale of H3C. And we now expect full year fiscal 2016 free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Meg."

Now I'd like to go into more detail on the deal we announced today with CSC, which I think will be very beneficial to customers, employees and shareholders of both companies. As today's results confirm, Enterprise Services is a stronger and more robust business than it has been in many years. As a result of customer diversification efforts and other improvements, ES delivered stable constant-currency revenue for the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2016, which were the first quarters of year-over-year constant-currency revenue growth since fiscal 2012. Overall, ES is on track to achieve its long-term goal of a market-competitive cost structure and operating margins. 
So by bringing together the best of these 2 organizations, we will create a pure-play services leader ready to compete and win against all the current players. The new company will have greater agility, focus and the ability to drive faster outcomes for our customers. It will also have a top-notch management team, quite literally the best in the business, and that management team will be 100% focused on ensuring a smooth transition with no disruption for ES and CSC customers. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mike Lawrie. Mike and I have gotten to know each other quite well, and I can tell you he is a world-class CEO with incredible talent and unbridled passion for his business. Once the deal closes, I look forward to working with him to build our new company. Mike?"

I'm excited about the great potential this merger brings to our people, to our clients, to our partners and investors, both at CSC and HPE's Enterprise Services division. And let me tell you why.Over the past few years, our 2 organ",721,"Well, thank you, Meg. I'm excited about the great potential this merger brings to our people, to our clients, to our partners and investors, both at CSC and HPE's Enterprise Services division. And let me tell you why.
Over the past few years, our 2 organizations have been embarked on critical turnarounds and broad-based transformations. Not everyone is aware of this, but Meg and I joined our respective companies within about 6 months of each other. And I'm pleased to be able to say that, in recent years, both our organizations have been on upward trajectories with significant improvements in financial performance and in client satisfaction scores. And the progress has been real, and it has been measurable. Both of our companies separated last year, within a month of one another, into more client-focused pure-play entities aimed at specific markets and core industries. 
And today's announcement, the coming together of these 2 organizations is the next logical step, building on their progress to-date and significantly accelerating their transformation. The new company will be a global top 3 leader in IT services, one that's uniquely positioned to lead clients in their digital transformations. Our organizations are highly complementary. HPE Enterprise Services has a proud legacy and brings focus and agility and the ability to drive faster outcomes for clients, along with a first-rate sales organization. CSC brings deep industry expertise, innovation and next-generation technologies and an exceptional partner network, among other strengths. And together as an agile technology independent services pure play, we will be better positioned to innovate and compete and win against both emerging and established players. We will have substantial scale to serve customers more efficiently and effectively worldwide. We will have a highly competitive cost structure to take advantage of our distinct growth opportunities, resulting in the capital capacity to invest and grow both organically and inorganically. 
We will strengthen and grow client relationships that cover more than 3/4 of the Fortune 500 with less than 15% overlap across our top accounts. We will leverage a combined portfolio that will include leading solutions in areas like managed security, cloud IP, enterprise applications, and Big Data and analytics, along with combined DPO leadership in health care and insurance and banking and capital markets. 
But most importantly, this great leap forward in our transformation will enable our people to better innovate, to compete and adapt to an ever-changing marketplace. Employees will become part of a very strong and focused global enterprise that is positioned for success, one that enables them to take advantage of the diverse career development and growth opportunities of a larger global enterprise. And as a pure-play services leader, our new company will be able to operate independent of any single hardware provider, establishing the right partnerships for success. And at the same time, CSC and HPE will have long-term agreements in place to ensure that current customer commitments continue to be met and our relationship will be stronger and our collaboration deeper. 
Now before I hand it back to Meg, I'd just like to take a moment to thank the teams at both companies for their hard work and resilience in driving our respective transformations. Through your efforts, we are in a place where we can bring our 2 great organizations together. That includes our team at CSC and also the HPE Enterprise Services team under Mike Nefkens. And I'm pleased that Mike has agreed to stay with the company in a senior position reporting to me, and that he will be playing a crucial role in helping build and grow our new company. And I'm looking forward to working with Meg as a member of the new company's board.
So let me just reiterate my excitement about our 2 organizations coming together to better serve clients around the world and deliver value for our shareholders. We recognize that we're just at the beginning of this process with a lot of work to do. By staying laser focused and working in the same collaborative spirit that has gotten us to this point, we can get to the finish line faster and in a great position to launch the new company. My colleagues at CSC and I look forward to working with everyone at HP Enterprise Services. So now let me hand it back to you, Meg."

Our focus is going to be on next-gen software-defined infrastructure with a world-class portfolio of servers; storage; networking; converged infrastructure; hyperconverged; Helion, our Helion cloud platform; and our software assets. And you probably have guessed by now that I am now a devotee of focus. And this is going to be a laser-like focused company that, as I think you know, is higher growth, higher margin with more robust free cash flows. And it's going to be well capitalized. So we don't necessarily think there is a need for acquisitions, but if we find the right companies, we certainly will move. And let me just recap the kind of acquisitions that have worked well for this company in the past: complementary technologies that we can put through our excellent distribution and support system. So think 3PAR, 3Com, Aruba. All 3 of those acquisitions have been fantastic for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. And so we'll keep our eyes out for those kinds of acquisitions. Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of those around. But to the extent we see them, we won't hesitate to move. And as Tim said, remember, our capital allocation strategy is returns based. Right now, we really think there's incredible value in our stock price. And Tim announced we're going to be buying back using 100% of our free cash flow in addition to half of the H3C proceeds. And we just got an increase in authorization of share buyback from our board."

I would say on ES, as we talked about, we feel much more comfortable at the 7% range for this year. Again, we have a lot of momentum in that business. A lot of the activities that the team has done through the transformation are starting to see through to the P&L. So 7% to 9% is what we would have. It may be conservative, but again, we need to get some -- continue to execute, and there's more work to do there. So we're prudent at the 7% to 9%. On the EG front, margins were down about 240 basis points. That's primarily driven by foreign exchange, some Tier 1 mix and, to a lesser degree, the R&D investments we've made. We are a little bit heavy in Tier 1 right now. If you recall, we launched the Cloudline product line, where we're seeing a lot of momentum. We launched that in the second half of last year, so we are a little bit heavier weighted in Tier 1. We expect that to normalize in the second half. I think margins there will be stable in the near term. And if you look longer term, we may even see some expansion or we'd expect to see some expansion as you think about further growth in Aruba, Converged Storage and those types of areas."

I understand the $8.5 billion consideration, but this business is going to earn over $1 billion in net income this year, could be closer to $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion going forward. So you're ascribing a value of 6.5x to 8x to that business when operating profit under your previous plan would have been growing pretty healthily. So I guess the question is why now when you were kind of at the cusp of improvement and, arguably, could have gotten paid for that in your stock price? And how did you determine the value?

So we are actually very pleased with the turnaround that we have executed in Enterprise Services. And I would say the time is right now because we believe this industry actually will consolidate, and it's better to be on the front end of a consolidation play than the back end of a consolidation play. And while there is more margin expansion here, we actually think the ability to accelerate the turnaround of ES will happen in the combined entity of CSC and ES. And recall that our shareholders will own 50% of this new entity, so they'll be party to that 50% of the synergies, 50% of the operational improvements, 50% of the synergy improvements. So in some ways, the shareholders get the best of both worlds. They get to maintain a position in Hewlett Packard Enterprise and a more focused software-defined data center and Edge strategy, and they get to ride the upside -- half the upside that they would have gotten had it stayed with us. And my view is the upside will be bigger with CSC and ES together. And I guess the other reason of why now is the business is in a good position. Two years ago, we were struggling in this business. We've diversified the revenue. We've taken cost out. Revenue has stabilized. We've developed some new product lines. And I think combined with CSC, it's going to be a powerhouse IT services company."

Have you thought about pruning even further going forward? Or do you think this is really the asset base and technology base of HP Enterprise required to thrive long-term?"

Now we wanted to make sure that we did a 50-50 merger of equals, tax-free spin merge of Enterprise Services into this new entity. And so obviously, we made some -- we negotiated some adjustments to that. So first of all, the new company, and I'm sort of calling it, for shorthand, CSC-ES, will pay Hewlett Packard Enterprise -- the future stand-alone Hewlett Packard Enterprise $1.5 billion of cash after the deal closes and will assume $2.5 billion of liability, pension liability as well as a old EDS $300 million bond. And then ES or Hewlett Packard Enterprise will actually subsidize some of that pension liability with offshore cash. So Chris, do you want add any more detail to that?"

So the 2 components, the $3.9 billion of upfront considerations plus the $4.6 billion of equity considerations in CSC stock, essentially makes up the $8.5 billion in total valuation. Now the equity considerations that CSC will essentially issue stock at the time of the transaction, and that stock will essentially result in the company being 50-50. And the price or the total value at the time of close will depend on where CSC is trading at that point in time."

And I guess, part of the point of being a pure services company is that they're fairly agnostic. And so do you lose that over time? So it's not obvious to me that you absolutely maintain what you have and it's just a question of if it gets better. I'm a little worried, obviously, about whether it could get worse. And then, conversely, what does getting rid of the services business or half of it do for you on the HPE side? What can you do now that you weren't able to do previously?"

So actually, we're very -- this was a very important part of the deal because the last thing I wanted to do was combine CSC with ES and then lose the infrastructure pull-through. That would not have been of value to Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. So we've negotiated a deal that I think is very fair. It allows CSC to continue to work with people they've worked with in the past, but we've also got a commitment from them for the next 3 years. Beyond that, I'm very confident that the work we will do in Hewlett Packard Enterprise will earn our way to that commitment. I mean, think about our server lineup, our storage lineup, our networking lineup, our wired-wireless LAN lineup, our converged infrastructure, hyperconverged and Helion cloud platform. But we do have, if you will, a safety net for the next 3 years. But I also -- one of the benefits of a pure-play services company is to be able to work with best-of-breed, and I know Mike wants to continue to do that. So I think we've struck a good thing that protects us in the near term but gives Mike the flexibility he needs to do solutions that are right for his customers. On the other side of it is we do business today with some of ES' competitors, think about Deloitte or Accenture, Capgemini or the Indian players. And we want to continue to grow that. And there -- just like for Mike, there's a benefit to being a pure play that will be benefit for us in terms of being primarily a software-defined infrastructure company and software company, so we imagine growing the business with those players as well. And by the way, this interestingly happened with the HPE, HP Inc. split. When HP Inc. became a separate company, all of a sudden, a lot of competitors who used to think they were competitors to some degree with our company, all of a sudden were very interested in the HP Inc. offering, so we think that could happen to us as well."

So we -- we're not giving revenue guidance and EPS guidance for the stand-alone company. I'm certain we will closer to March 31. But we expect to go at or above the market rate as we did this quarter. I think it's important to look at our results this quarter for Enterprise Group and Software. I think they are the best indication that we've got a winning company here. We outgrew the market. We outgrew every single competitor, gained share in every single one of our -- against our infrastructure competitors. And I think what you have now is the Enterprise Group and Software on a roll and the investments that we have made in R&D, the investments we've made in a fire-in-the-belly sales force. I mean, we have done a complete transformation of our sales force around not only our channel but also direct selling.

The primary delta versus consensus right now is really driven by the H3C transaction, to your point. That's probably about, I'd say, $0.03 or $0.04. So that implies a ramp in the fourth quarter. And that's really -- think about it in 3 ways. One, it's typical seasonality. So when you look at our ES business and our Software business, those businesses tend to be back end loaded so that will drive a lot of the improvement. The second component is around the H3C transaction from a stranded cost perspective. So now that the deal is closed, there's some overhead costs that we need to take out of the system. That generally takes a little bit of time, not too dissimilar to the dis-synergy story we had around the separation. And then the third component is driven by the share repurchases. So there's more of an impact in Q4 versus Q3 on the share repurchase front. So those are really the key drivers to the ramp in the fourth quarter. But we've got clear plans. For sure, we need to go out and execute, but we feel good about the total year. And that's why we held our total year guide of $1.85 to $1.95."

So right now, when you look at our total mix from a Tier 1 perspective, it's a little bit heavy. Again, that will tend to normalize. So I would expect the margins in EG to be stable. And I'm not going to give margin guidance here but, again, as we continue to grow Aruba, as we continue to grow Storage, that's going to help the margin front. On the TS front, that business will also stabilize. So we had -- we were down in revenue 1% in constant currency when you adjust for the HPI transaction. But we do expect revenue growth in the latter part of the year. And the way to think about that is, obviously, that's an annuity type business given the contracts. So what we're going to start seeing in the second half is that those negative growth orders that we had in '14, that's replaced by positive growth that we saw in '15. That feeds our 2016 revenue. So we do expect TS revenue to be flat on a year-over-year basis for the total year, and that will also help from a margin perspective as well."

I was talking about sort of our current guide with current separation, current restructuring, what have you. In general, if you strip out ES, I think about, obviously, ES has more CapEx than the other businesses. From a normalized CapEx perspective, I think you could see our CapEx go down by $500 million or $600 million. That's what we typically use for ES. So that's sort of how I think about it from a normalized perspective. Again, we'll give some more color when we do SAM in October, but I think CapEx is a big driver."

And so different countries sort of go up and down different regions. But overall, I think we feel very comfortable with our position in the traditional IT market and then in our ability to provide solutions in a multicloud environment. So I think demand can go up and down, but our objective is in whatever the market's doing, we want to make sure we at least hold or gain share, and we did that in the last quarter. And I don't think there's anything new to add as to why. First of all, I think the R&D investments that we've made over the last 4 years are paying off. So the development cycle in servers, storage, networking, those kinds of things, hyperconverged. These are long-term investments. What you started 3 years ago actually comes to the market now or even next year. So that investment in R&D is paying off. And I will tell you, $1 spent on internal R&D is the best dollar we spend at HP. It's fantastic. Second is when you retool a sales force, that takes some time as well. And I would say we're much farther along than we have been, and there is more work to do. And then, as I said, marketing, we've retooled our entire demand generation. We've retooled -- and by the way, the launch of Hewlett Packard Enterprise gave us a chance to tell people the story of the enterprise side of this business because, prior to that, if you had asked a man on the street what is HP, they'd say a printing and PC company. So I think that's actually been beneficial. And then turnarounds take 5 years. I said it when I started, and we're rounding the bend into the end of the fifth year. And so it's gratifying that we saw as-reported growth for the first time in 5 years."

Hewlett-Packard Enterprise completed our second full quarter as an independent company, and I have to say that we've delivered the best performance since I joined.
In Q2, we saw our first quarter of as-reported year-over-year revenue growth since 2011 for the Hewlett-Packard Enterprise businesses. We also saw our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year constant-currency revenue growth. We delivered revenue of $12.7 billion, up more than 1% as reported and 5% in constant currency, driven by excellent performance in servers, storage, networking and converged infrastructure as well as outstanding performance in Enterprise Services. 
Enterprise Group had a fabulous quarter, delivering 7% revenue growth on an as-reported basis and 10% in constant currency. In fact, we grew on an as-reported basis in every one of EG's hardware business units and in every region. ES grew revenue year-over-year in constant currency for the second consecutive quarter and expanded operating margins more than 3 points over the prior year. That's the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. 
Our Software business also delivered a strong quarter. When adjusted for divestitures and acquisitions, Software delivered its third consecutive quarter of constant-currency growth. And in Financial Services, we saw double-digit volume growth over the prior year.
So with strong performance across every one of our business segments, HPE delivered non-GAAP EPS of $0.42, at the high end of our previously provided outlook. 
Free cash flow improved in the second quarter to $511 million due to careful management of our working capital. Tim will walk through the drivers of our cash flow and outlook shortly. And we are seeing the benefits of our increased R&D and more focused product road maps as we take share from our competitors. 
In storage, HPE is the only major vendor to gain share in external disk over the last 2 years, while EMC, NetApp, IBM and Dell lost share year-over-year. Revenue in our 3PAR all-flash business grew nearly triple digits, about 2x faster than the market, and is once again expected to be larger and faster growing than pure [ph]. In networking, we are seeing an acceleration of our business, particularly since our acquisition of Aruba and our game-changing partnership with Unisplendour, a subsidiary of Tsinghua in China. 
And our results are in stark contrast with the result Cisco reported last week. In switching, HPE grew 18% year-over-year versus Cisco that was down 3%. And we are getting credit from the industry for our innovation, capturing the leading position in Gartner's most recent Magic Quadrant for wired-wireless, upsetting Cisco's longstanding run in the top spot. That is in addition to our leading positions in servers, storage and integrated systems. And we're not taking our foot off the pedal. Next month, at Discover Las Vegas, you'll be hearing more about some significant new innovations across our cloud, IoT and Composable Infrastructure product lines as well as an update on the machine. 
Last but certainly not least, earlier today, we made a major announcement that we are planning a tax-free spinoff and merger of our Enterprise Services business with CSC, which is expected to create a pure-play global IT service powerhouse with annual revenue of more than $26 billion. The new company will have more than 5,000 customers in 70 countries and employees in every region around the world. The transaction is expected to deliver approximately $8.5 billion to HPE's shareholders on an after-tax basis. This includes an equity stake in the newly combined company valued at more than $4.5 billion, which represents approximately 50% ownership, a cash dividend of $1.5 billion and the assumption of $2.5 billion of debt and other liabilities. 
We also expect the merger of the 2 businesses to produce first-year synergies of approximately $1 billion post-close with a run rate of $1.5 billion by the end of year 1. There's also an opportunity for additional synergies in subsequent years. As owners of approximately 50% of the merged company, HPE shareholders will share in the value of the synergies as well as future growth in earnings. 
The cost to separate ES from HPE will be offset by lower cost associated with the previously announced fiscal year 2015 restructuring program, so there will be no incremental onetime cash payments beyond what we've already communicated. 
I will serve on the board of the new company, and HPE's Board of Directors will nominate half of the new company's board. Mike Lawrie, the current head of CSC, will become Chairman and CEO of the new company. And Mike Nefkens, the current EVP and General Manager of our Enterprise Services business, will become a key part of the new company's executive team and partner closely with Mike Lawrie on building the new organization. Other executives and directors as well as the name of the company will be announced at a later date. The transaction is currently targeted to be completed by March 31, 2017. 
For the combined CSC and Enterprise Services, this will create a new company that will be a pure-play global IT services leader. For customers, this means global access to world-class offerings in cloud, mobility, application development and modernization, business process services, IT services, big data and analytics, and security. This is combined with deep industry experience in sectors that include financial services, transportation, consumer products, health care and insurance. HPE and this new company will be closely connected moving forward with agreements that will keep the 2 companies aligned for current customers and grow new business opportunities over time. 
For the remaining Hewlett Packard Enterprise, this transaction creates significant incremental value by unlocking a faster-growing, higher-margin and stronger free cash flow business. HPE will now have $33 billion in annual revenue and will focus on secure next-generation, software-defined infrastructure that leverages a world-class portfolio of servers, storage, networking, converged infrastructure as well as our Helion cloud platform and software assets. By bringing together leadership positions in these key data center technologies, we will help customers run their traditional IT better while building a bridge to multi-cloud environments. 
Beyond the data center, HPE is redefining IT at the edge with our next-generation Aruba and computing products for campus, branch and IoT applications. In addition, through our Technology Services division, we can deliver consulting and support to customers, while HPE Financial Services offers financial flexibilities to customers to maximize their investments. Finally, we will continue to leverage our portfolio of operations, security and big data software assets that deliver machine learning and deep analytics capabilities to customers. 
Mike Lawrie has joined our call today and will have much more to say about the deal in a moment. But first, Tim is going to walk us through HPE's financial performance in detail."
273983758,336644881,993047,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, May 24, 2016",2016-05-24,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thanks, Meg. Overall, we had a great quarter. We grew revenue as reported and in constant currency, generated healthy cash flow and delivered non-GAAP diluted net EPS at the high end of our guided range. Revenue of $12.7 billion was up 1.3% year-over-year",2008,"Thanks, Meg. Overall, we had a great quarter. We grew revenue as reported and in constant currency, generated healthy cash flow and delivered non-GAAP diluted net EPS at the high end of our guided range. Revenue of $12.7 billion was up 1.3% year-over-year and grew 4.9% in constant currency, our fourth consecutive quarter of constant-currency growth. And as Meg mentioned, HPE businesses reported absolute revenue growth for the first time in 5 years. 
We saw revenue growth in constant currency in every region and outright growth in the Americas and APJ. Our Americas performance continues to support cautious optimism for the remainder of the year amongst an uneven macroeconomic environment. In EMEA, we were still significantly impacted by currency. However, we are seeing encouraging momentum in enterprise hardware. And in APJ, China networking drove strong performance. 
The top line currency impact to revenue was 4 points year-over-year primarily due to hedging gains from the prior year. Going forward, we expect the currency impact to significantly moderate throughout the second half of the year. And we continue to anticipate an impact to revenue of approximately 3 points for the full year as rates are now roughly in line with where they were when we originally guided the year.
Margins were largely stable in the quarter with gross margin of 28.7%, up 10 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially. And non-GAAP operating profit margin was 7.9%, down 50 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially. 
Total non-GAAP operating expenses of $2.6 billion were up 4.7% year-over-year primarily due to increased FSC and R&D investments. We delivered non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.42, at the high end of our guided range. This primarily excludes $201 million for amortization of intangible assets, $161 million for restructuring and $91 million of separation charges. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.18, $0.01 above our previously guided range. 
Now turning to the business results. The Enterprise Group had a strong quarter with excellent top line performance. Our sales motion is hitting its stride aided by the seamless launch of the HPE brand and our marketing efforts. Revenue was up 7% year-over-year or 10% in constant currency and grew in all product groups. For the remainder of the year, revenue growth will likely moderate as we will not have the benefit of H3C and begin to face tougher compares. 
Profitability in the quarter was 11.7%, down 240 basis points year-on-year. This was primarily due to foreign exchange, heavier Tier 1 mix and, to a lesser degree, incremental R&D investments. 
A deal that exemplifies the strength of the Enterprise Group is the recently won project with Woolworths Limited, Australia's largest retail company. Our solution, based on the ConvergedSystem 900 for SAP HANA, provides access to realtime data, enabling critical business decisions to be made immediately. This competitive win against Lenovo, Fujitsu and Dimension Data with Cisco UCS also displaces the current outsourced provider, Wipro, and further secures HPE's relationship with Woolworths.
Servers revenue grew 7% year-on-year or 10% in constant currency, primarily driven by strong Tier 1 sales in the Americas and core servers in APJ. Based on our performance, we believe we took share in servers overall, density-optimized servers and rack. From a regional perspective, we took share in the Americas and EMEA. And this quarter, we started shipping our Hyper Converged HC 380, which enables midsize and remote office enterprises to easily deploy, manage and support virtual machines in a few clicks. We continue to see servers as a growth driver given the strength of our portfolio and anticipate healthy demand for compute through the remainder of the year. 
In storage, we grew revenue 2% year-over-year and 5% in constant currency. Converged Storage continued its strong growth trend, growing 19% year-over-year in constant currency and comprising 54% of the total portfolio. 3PAR all-flash revenue grew near triple digits and continues to drive mid-range share gains. We estimate that we gained market share in the external disk for the 10th consecutive quarter and expect Storage to gain share throughout the remainder of the year on the strength of the 3PAR portfolio and new logo wins as we take advantage of the uncertainty surrounding the Dell-EMC merger. 
Networking revenue grew 57% year-over-year as reported or 62% in constant currency. And when adjusted for Aruba, networking was still up 17% in constant currency. We had strong execution with growth across all regions. While Aruba continues to drive growth in wireless share, we also expect to take share in switching and routing on the strength of H3C and Aruba campus switching pull-through. Leading up to the transaction close with Tsinghua, H3C grew more than 50% year-over-year, validating the strategic moves we made to collaborate with a strong local partner. 
In Technology Services, revenue did decline 6% year-on-year or 2% in constant currency. However, it was only down 1% in constant currency when adjusted for the discontinuation of HP Inc. attach, which remains in the fiscal year '15 results. TS support, the most profitable and largest segment of Technology Services, grew orders in constant currency. Based on this and the order growth we saw last year, we continue to expect TS revenue to return to growth in constant currency towards the end of the year. 
Enterprise Services had another great quarter as we continue to see the benefits of our restructuring cost actions and improving sales motion. A great example of the deals we are winning is our recent selection from 5 other competitors for a 10-year $0.5 billion contract to provide IT services, including infrastructure, mission-critical systems and applications to the U.S. Strategic Command. 
Revenue declined 2% year-over-year but grew 1% in constant currency. When adjusted for the Deutsche Bank win last year, both new business TCV and total TCV grew year-over-year. Strategic Enterprise Services is gaining strength in both overall revenue and mix, delivering mid-double-digit growth year-on-year. ABS continues to improve with a third consecutive quarter of year-on-year constant-currency revenue growth. And ITO also grew in constant currency for the first time since the first quarter of 2012. 
Operating profit improved 310 basis points year-over-year to 6.7% as the team continues to execute productivity improvements in delivery and sales. We're also seeing the benefits from improving location mix as well as increasing sold margins and healthy add-on sales. We continue to track well against our longer-term goal of 60-40 low-cost, high-cost headcount mix and completed the quarter with 47% of our headcount in low-cost centers. The progress made on cost improvements, sales strength and normal quarterly seasonality provides us with confidence that operating profit margins for the full year will now be towards the high end of our original 6% to 7% outlook.
Software declined 13% year-over-year as reported or 10% in constant currency. However, it was up 2% in constant currency when adjusted for acquisitions and divestitures. Sales strength in security and big data was partly offset by declines in IT management. On a product level, we had encouraging results in Voltage, Fortify and IDOL. The team continues to focus on disciplined cost controls, decreasing OpEx dollars year-over-year and growing operating profit dollars. Operating profit margin expanded 7 points year-over-year. However, the largest contributor to OpEx and margin improvement was a onetime benefit from the TippingPoint divestiture. 
HPE Financial Services revenue declined 2% year-over-year but grew 1% in constant currency. Operating profit declined 130 basis points year-over-year to 9.3% as the lower residual sales pressured margin rates. Financing volume grew 15% year-over-year or 19% in constant currency primarily due to favorable movement in our cost of funds, which has enabled us to price more competitively. Return on equity was down 230 basis points year-on-year to 12.7%. 
Cash flow was strong in the quarter due to judicious working capital management. Cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion, up 101% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Free cash flow was $511 million, up from negative $106 million last year, again, on an adjusted basis. 
When adjusted for the sale of H3C, the cash conversion cycle was 27 days, down 4 days quarter-over-quarter. The largest contributor to cash conversion cycle improvement was DPO, which increased 5 days sequentially adjusted for H3C as we continue to improve payment terms with our vendors. This was partly offset by DSO, which increased 2 days sequentially, while DOI was flat through the quarter. Given the momentum in our working capital initiatives, we now expect our cash conversion cycle will reach the low 20-day range by the year-end. 
Now let's turn to capital allocation. In the quarter, we returned $109 million of cash to shareholders. Due to the ES-CSC transaction, we were largely prohibited from repurchasing shares and only bought back $15 million of shares. We also paid $94 million as part of our normal dividend. We continue to see our shares as very attractively priced and will be back in the market this month. Along those lines, our Board of Directors recently increased our share repurchase authorization by $3 billion, which now stands at $4.8 billion remaining.
During our Q1 earnings call, we committed approximately $2 billion of the proceeds from the H3C transaction to share repurchases. We now expect to complete roughly half of those this fiscal year with the remainder to be completed in fiscal year '17. As you recall, share repurchases resulting from the H3C transaction are in addition to our commitment to return 100% of our original fiscal year '16 free cash flow outlook to shareholders. 
Now I'd like to provide an update on recent M&A activity. First, we announced the sale of our majority stake in Mphasis to Blackstone as we continue to refine our capital strategy and make improvements to our go-to-market model. We expect this transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year. 
In addition, during the quarter, we closed the sale of 51% of H3C to Tsinghua at the beginning of May. Remember that our prior guidance did not include the impact of this transaction. We now think that we can offset the EPS impact with the share repurchases we completed in the first quarter and the incremental share repurchases to be completed later this year. 
Going forward, we will recognize only 49% of H3C earnings and receive a corresponding cash payment. This will reduce cash flow by approximately $200 million in the second half of fiscal year '16. However, roughly half of that will be received as a cash payment in fiscal year '17. 
Finally, I'd like to discuss the cash impact of the ES-CSC transaction to HPE. There will be no incremental onetime uses of cash beyond that we've already communicated. We expect total onetime separation payments of around $900 million with $300 million in fiscal year '16 and the remainder in fiscal year '17. As an offset, we will reduce the $2.6 billion of restructuring payments associated with our 2015 restructuring plan by roughly $1 billion as we are achieving our targeted savings more efficiently and will no longer need to fund ES actions after the transaction closes. We have gained valuable experience in the HPE-HPI separation that gives us confidence in executing this spin quickly and efficiently. In total, the fiscal year '16 free cash flow will be reduced by $300 million due to the H3C divestiture and current year ES separation payments that will be partly offset by working capital improvements.
Let's go to guidance. We expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.42 to $0.46 in Q3 of 2016 and continue to expect full year fiscal 2016 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.85 to $1.95. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $1.10 to $1.14 in Q3 of 2016 and now expect full year fiscal 2016 GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.68 to $1.78, reflecting the new ES separation charges and gain on sale of H3C. And we now expect full year fiscal 2016 free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. 
With that, I'll turn it back over to Meg."

Now I'd like to go into more detail on the deal we announced today with CSC, which I think will be very beneficial to customers, employees and shareholders of both companies. As today's results confirm, Enterprise Services is a stronger and more robust business than it has been in many years. As a result of customer diversification efforts and other improvements, ES delivered stable constant-currency revenue for the first 2 quarters of fiscal 2016, which were the first quarters of year-over-year constant-currency revenue growth since fiscal 2012. Overall, ES is on track to achieve its long-term goal of a market-competitive cost structure and operating margins. 
So by bringing together the best of these 2 organizations, we will create a pure-play services leader ready to compete and win against all the current players. The new company will have greater agility, focus and the ability to drive faster outcomes for our customers. It will also have a top-notch management team, quite literally the best in the business, and that management team will be 100% focused on ensuring a smooth transition with no disruption for ES and CSC customers. 
With that, let me turn it over to Mike Lawrie. Mike and I have gotten to know each other quite well, and I can tell you he is a world-class CEO with incredible talent and unbridled passion for his business. Once the deal closes, I look forward to working with him to build our new company. Mike?"

I'm excited about the great potential this merger brings to our people, to our clients, to our partners and investors, both at CSC and HPE's Enterprise Services division. And let me tell you why.Over the past few years, our 2 organ",721,"Well, thank you, Meg. I'm excited about the great potential this merger brings to our people, to our clients, to our partners and investors, both at CSC and HPE's Enterprise Services division. And let me tell you why.
Over the past few years, our 2 organizations have been embarked on critical turnarounds and broad-based transformations. Not everyone is aware of this, but Meg and I joined our respective companies within about 6 months of each other. And I'm pleased to be able to say that, in recent years, both our organizations have been on upward trajectories with significant improvements in financial performance and in client satisfaction scores. And the progress has been real, and it has been measurable. Both of our companies separated last year, within a month of one another, into more client-focused pure-play entities aimed at specific markets and core industries. 
And today's announcement, the coming together of these 2 organizations is the next logical step, building on their progress to-date and significantly accelerating their transformation. The new company will be a global top 3 leader in IT services, one that's uniquely positioned to lead clients in their digital transformations. Our organizations are highly complementary. HPE Enterprise Services has a proud legacy and brings focus and agility and the ability to drive faster outcomes for clients, along with a first-rate sales organization. CSC brings deep industry expertise, innovation and next-generation technologies and an exceptional partner network, among other strengths. And together as an agile technology independent services pure play, we will be better positioned to innovate and compete and win against both emerging and established players. We will have substantial scale to serve customers more efficiently and effectively worldwide. We will have a highly competitive cost structure to take advantage of our distinct growth opportunities, resulting in the capital capacity to invest and grow both organically and inorganically. 
We will strengthen and grow client relationships that cover more than 3/4 of the Fortune 500 with less than 15% overlap across our top accounts. We will leverage a combined portfolio that will include leading solutions in areas like managed security, cloud IP, enterprise applications, and Big Data and analytics, along with combined DPO leadership in health care and insurance and banking and capital markets. 
But most importantly, this great leap forward in our transformation will enable our people to better innovate, to compete and adapt to an ever-changing marketplace. Employees will become part of a very strong and focused global enterprise that is positioned for success, one that enables them to take advantage of the diverse career development and growth opportunities of a larger global enterprise. And as a pure-play services leader, our new company will be able to operate independent of any single hardware provider, establishing the right partnerships for success. And at the same time, CSC and HPE will have long-term agreements in place to ensure that current customer commitments continue to be met and our relationship will be stronger and our collaboration deeper. 
Now before I hand it back to Meg, I'd just like to take a moment to thank the teams at both companies for their hard work and resilience in driving our respective transformations. Through your efforts, we are in a place where we can bring our 2 great organizations together. That includes our team at CSC and also the HPE Enterprise Services team under Mike Nefkens. And I'm pleased that Mike has agreed to stay with the company in a senior position reporting to me, and that he will be playing a crucial role in helping build and grow our new company. And I'm looking forward to working with Meg as a member of the new company's board.
So let me just reiterate my excitement about our 2 organizations coming together to better serve clients around the world and deliver value for our shareholders. We recognize that we're just at the beginning of this process with a lot of work to do. By staying laser focused and working in the same collaborative spirit that has gotten us to this point, we can get to the finish line faster and in a great position to launch the new company. My colleagues at CSC and I look forward to working with everyone at HP Enterprise Services. So now let me hand it back to you, Meg."

Our focus is going to be on next-gen software-defined infrastructure with a world-class portfolio of servers; storage; networking; converged infrastructure; hyperconverged; Helion, our Helion cloud platform; and our software assets. And you probably have guessed by now that I am now a devotee of focus. And this is going to be a laser-like focused company that, as I think you know, is higher growth, higher margin with more robust free cash flows. And it's going to be well capitalized. So we don't necessarily think there is a need for acquisitions, but if we find the right companies, we certainly will move. And let me just recap the kind of acquisitions that have worked well for this company in the past: complementary technologies that we can put through our excellent distribution and support system. So think 3PAR, 3Com, Aruba. All 3 of those acquisitions have been fantastic for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. And so we'll keep our eyes out for those kinds of acquisitions. Unfortunately, there aren't a lot of those around. But to the extent we see them, we won't hesitate to move. And as Tim said, remember, our capital allocation strategy is returns based. Right now, we really think there's incredible value in our stock price. And Tim announced we're going to be buying back using 100% of our free cash flow in addition to half of the H3C proceeds. And we just got an increase in authorization of share buyback from our board."

I would say on ES, as we talked about, we feel much more comfortable at the 7% range for this year. Again, we have a lot of momentum in that business. A lot of the activities that the team has done through the transformation are starting to see through to the P&L. So 7% to 9% is what we would have. It may be conservative, but again, we need to get some -- continue to execute, and there's more work to do there. So we're prudent at the 7% to 9%. On the EG front, margins were down about 240 basis points. That's primarily driven by foreign exchange, some Tier 1 mix and, to a lesser degree, the R&D investments we've made. We are a little bit heavy in Tier 1 right now. If you recall, we launched the Cloudline product line, where we're seeing a lot of momentum. We launched that in the second half of last year, so we are a little bit heavier weighted in Tier 1. We expect that to normalize in the second half. I think margins there will be stable in the near term. And if you look longer term, we may even see some expansion or we'd expect to see some expansion as you think about further growth in Aruba, Converged Storage and those types of areas."

The business has a lot of momentum in terms of profit improvement. I understand the $8.5 billion consideration, but this business is going to earn over $1 billion in net income this year, could be closer to $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion going forward. So you're ascribing a value of 6.5x to 8x to that business when operating profit under your previous plan would have been growing pretty healthily. So I guess the question is why now when you were kind of at the cusp of improvement and, arguably, could have gotten paid for that in your stock price? And how did you determine the value?

So we are actually very pleased with the turnaround that we have executed in Enterprise Services. And I would say the time is right now because we believe this industry actually will consolidate, and it's better to be on the front end of a consolidation play than the back end of a consolidation play. And while there is more margin expansion here, we actually think the ability to accelerate the turnaround of ES will happen in the combined entity of CSC and ES. And recall that our shareholders will own 50% of this new entity, so they'll be party to that 50% of the synergies, 50% of the operational improvements, 50% of the synergy improvements. So in some ways, the shareholders get the best of both worlds. They get to maintain a position in Hewlett Packard Enterprise and a more focused software-defined data center and Edge strategy, and they get to ride the upside -- half the upside that they would have gotten had it stayed with us. And my view is the upside will be bigger with CSC and ES together. And I guess the other reason of why now is the business is in a good position. Two years ago, we were struggling in this business. We've diversified the revenue. We've taken cost out. Revenue has stabilized. We've developed some new product lines. And I think combined with CSC, it's going to be a powerhouse IT services company."

The one thing that I would say is that the growth rates will be a little bit more normalized, if you will, in the second half, there will be less FX pressure as an example because, again, if you look at the second quarter, most of that FX pressure was driven by the hedge gains that we received in the second quarter of last year that didn't repeat this year, so that'll tend to normalize.

Now we wanted to make sure that we did a 50-50 merger of equals, tax-free spin merge of Enterprise Services into this new entity. And so obviously, we made some -- we negotiated some adjustments to that. So first of all, the new company, and I'm sort of calling it, for shorthand, CSC-ES, will pay Hewlett Packard Enterprise -- the future stand-alone Hewlett Packard Enterprise $1.5 billion of cash after the deal closes and will assume $2.5 billion of liability, pension liability as well as a old EDS $300 million bond. And then ES or Hewlett Packard Enterprise will actually subsidize some of that pension liability with offshore cash. So Chris, do you want add any more detail to that?"

So the 2 components, the $3.9 billion of upfront considerations plus the $4.6 billion of equity considerations in CSC stock, essentially makes up the $8.5 billion in total valuation. Now the equity considerations that CSC will essentially issue stock at the time of the transaction, and that stock will essentially result in the company being 50-50. And the price or the total value at the time of close will depend on where CSC is trading at that point in time."

And I guess, part of the point of being a pure services company is that they're fairly agnostic. And so do you lose that over time? So it's not obvious to me that you absolutely maintain what you have and it's just a question of if it gets better. I'm a little worried, obviously, about whether it could get worse. And then, conversely, what does getting rid of the services business or half of it do for you on the HPE side? What can you do now that you weren't able to do previously?"

So actually, we're very -- this was a very important part of the deal because the last thing I wanted to do was combine CSC with ES and then lose the infrastructure pull-through. That would not have been of value to Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. So we've negotiated a deal that I think is very fair. It allows CSC to continue to work with people they've worked with in the past, but we've also got a commitment from them for the next 3 years. Beyond that, I'm very confident that the work we will do in Hewlett Packard Enterprise will earn our way to that commitment. I mean, think about our server lineup, our storage lineup, our networking lineup, our wired-wireless LAN lineup, our converged infrastructure, hyperconverged and Helion cloud platform. But we do have, if you will, a safety net for the next 3 years. But I also -- one of the benefits of a pure-play services company is to be able to work with best-of-breed, and I know Mike wants to continue to do that. So I think we've struck a good thing that protects us in the near term but gives Mike the flexibility he needs to do solutions that are right for his customers. On the other side of it is we do business today with some of ES' competitors, think about Deloitte or Accenture, Capgemini or the Indian players. And we want to continue to grow that. And there -- just like for Mike, there's a benefit to being a pure play that will be benefit for us in terms of being primarily a software-defined infrastructure company and software company, so we imagine growing the business with those players as well. And by the way, this interestingly happened with the HPE, HP Inc. split. When HP Inc. became a separate company, all of a sudden, a lot of competitors who used to think they were competitors to some degree with our company, all of a sudden were very interested in the HP Inc. offering, so we think that could happen to us as well."

So listen, I mean, part of the benefit of this transaction is focus on a smaller number of businesses that I think play into a sweet spot in IT spend.

So we -- we're not giving revenue guidance and EPS guidance for the stand-alone company. I'm certain we will closer to March 31. But we expect to go at or above the market rate as we did this quarter. I think it's important to look at our results this quarter for Enterprise Group and Software. I think they are the best indication that we've got a winning company here. We outgrew the market. We outgrew every single competitor, gained share in every single one of our -- against our infrastructure competitors. And I think what you have now is the Enterprise Group and Software on a roll and the investments that we have made in R&D, the investments we've made in a fire-in-the-belly sales force. I mean, we have done a complete transformation of our sales force around not only our channel but also direct selling.

The primary delta versus consensus right now is really driven by the H3C transaction, to your point. That's probably about, I'd say, $0.03 or $0.04. So that implies a ramp in the fourth quarter. And that's really -- think about it in 3 ways. One, it's typical seasonality. So when you look at our ES business and our Software business, those businesses tend to be back end loaded so that will drive a lot of the improvement. The second component is around the H3C transaction from a stranded cost perspective. So now that the deal is closed, there's some overhead costs that we need to take out of the system. That generally takes a little bit of time, not too dissimilar to the dis-synergy story we had around the separation. And then the third component is driven by the share repurchases. So there's more of an impact in Q4 versus Q3 on the share repurchase front. So those are really the key drivers to the ramp in the fourth quarter. But we've got clear plans. For sure, we need to go out and execute, but we feel good about the total year. And that's why we held our total year guide of $1.85 to $1.95."

I would say from a margin perspective, for sure, FX has had a factor -- has been a factor, particularly if you look at the first half of the year.

So right now, when you look at our total mix from a Tier 1 perspective, it's a little bit heavy. Again, that will tend to normalize. So I would expect the margins in EG to be stable. And I'm not going to give margin guidance here but, again, as we continue to grow Aruba, as we continue to grow Storage, that's going to help the margin front. On the TS front, that business will also stabilize. So we had -- we were down in revenue 1% in constant currency when you adjust for the HPI transaction. But we do expect revenue growth in the latter part of the year. And the way to think about that is, obviously, that's an annuity type business given the contracts. So what we're going to start seeing in the second half is that those negative growth orders that we had in '14, that's replaced by positive growth that we saw in '15. That feeds our 2016 revenue. So we do expect TS revenue to be flat on a year-over-year basis for the total year, and that will also help from a margin perspective as well."

Again, $300 million of that will be incurred in '16 and $600 million of that will be incurred -- roughly $600 million will be incurred in '17. Again, there is no incremental onetime cash costs associated with this. We will reduce the 2015 restructuring plan by about $1 billion, and that will offset the costs for here. As far as the stranded cost number, we will work those costs out through the system. I think the good news is what we've learned in the last separation was how to do this and how to do it efficiently. So I would just say on the stranded cost piece, if I look at project planning and what have you, we have that much more clearly defined. We know who owns it, and we know how that's going to come out of the system and when that comes out of the system."

So that's sort of how I think about it from a normalized perspective. Again, we'll give some more color when we do SAM in October, but I think CapEx is a big driver."

And so different countries sort of go up and down different regions. But overall, I think we feel very comfortable with our position in the traditional IT market and then in our ability to provide solutions in a multicloud environment. So I think demand can go up and down, but our objective is in whatever the market's doing, we want to make sure we at least hold or gain share, and we did that in the last quarter. And I don't think there's anything new to add as to why. First of all, I think the R&D investments that we've made over the last 4 years are paying off. So the development cycle in servers, storage, networking, those kinds of things, hyperconverged. These are long-term investments. What you started 3 years ago actually comes to the market now or even next year. So that investment in R&D is paying off. And I will tell you, $1 spent on internal R&D is the best dollar we spend at HP. It's fantastic. Second is when you retool a sales force, that takes some time as well. And I would say we're much farther along than we have been, and there is more work to do. And then, as I said, marketing, we've retooled our entire demand generation. We've retooled -- and by the way, the launch of Hewlett Packard Enterprise gave us a chance to tell people the story of the enterprise side of this business because, prior to that, if you had asked a man on the street what is HP, they'd say a printing and PC company. So I think that's actually been beneficial. And then turnarounds take 5 years. I said it when I started, and we're rounding the bend into the end of the fifth year. And so it's gratifying that we saw as-reported growth for the first time in 5 years."

Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately one year. We posted the press releases and the slide presentations accompanying today's earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations web page at investors.hpe.com.
As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings and transaction materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HPE's SEC reports, including its most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. 
We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2016. Finally, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. 
Throughout this conference call, all revenue growth rates presented, beginning with fiscal year 2015, are adjusted to include the impact of divestitures and currency. We believe this approach helps provide a better representation of HPE's operational performance given the significant divestitures we've recently completed, including the sale of 51% of our H3C business in China and TippingPoint, amongst several others. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our website for details. 
With that, let me turn it over to Meg."
273983758,379420534,1042852,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 07, 2016",2016-09-07,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thanks, Andy. And thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. Let me start by saying I'm pleased with the progress we made in Q3. Overall, we had a strong quarter.

Let me start by saying I'm pleased with the progress we made in Q3. Overall, we had a strong quarter. While revenue was down slightly on an operational basis, we saw several areas of growth in key parts of our portfolio, including networking, all-flash storage, high-performance compute and Technology Services. 
Profitability was very encouraging as we continue to deliver margin improvements in Enterprise Services and focus on profitable deals in the Enterprise Group. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.49, which even before the impact of a favorable tax rate, was at the high-end of our previously guided range. Free cash flow also improved to $1 billion through diligent working capital management and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders primarily through share repurchases. 
Tim will provide further color on the quarter, but I would like to take the bulk of my time to discuss today's spin merge announcement, and put it in the context of the strategy we've been executing against for the past several years. Last November, we launched the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise with the vision to becoming industry's leading provider of hybrid IT with the secure next-generation software-defined infrastructure that will run our customers data centers today, reach them to multi-cloud environments tomorrow and enable the emerging intelligent edge that will power campus, branch and IoT applications for decades to come. 
We believe this is what our customers are looking for and what we are best qualified to do. And most importantly, achieving this vision will create a faster growing, higher-margin, stronger free cash flow company for our shareholders. To realize our vision, we looked at our portfolio and our product roadmaps to determine gaps that we needed to fill and then evaluate how best to do so. Some we feel to increase R&D like the investment in our recently launched HC 380 Hyper Converged product. In other areas, we pursue innovative partnerships like the ones recently announced with Docker and [indiscernible]. And in some cases, acquisitions make sense like Aruba and SGI. 
Next, we identified areas of the business that were not aligned with our go-forward strategy. There we have looked at how to best maximize shareholder value with these assets. We've already made a number of decisions, including the sale of TippingPoint, the H3C deal in China, and of course, the spin merge of our Enterprise Services business with CSC. And today, we announced plans for a spin-off and merger of our noncore software assets with Micro Focus. These assets include our application delivery management, Big Data, enterprise security, information management and governance and IT operation management businesses. 
This transaction is valued at about $8.8 billion, including a 50.1% ownership of the new combined company by HPE shareholders, which is currently valued at $6.3 billion and a $2.5 billion cash payment to HPE. The combined company will be led by Kevin Loosemore, current Micro Focus Executive Chairman and Mike Phillips will service as Chief Financial Officer. After the transaction closes, Micro Focu's Board of Directors will include HPE senior executive and HPE independent directors on the board. The new combined company is expected to have annual revenues of approximately $4.5 billion with strong recurring revenue streams. The company will be well-diversified across product lines and geographies. 
We will also have a stronger go-to-market capability with nearly 4,000 sales people worldwide and deep R&D resources to deliver best-in-class solutions to customers and partners. Micro Focus' approach to managing both growing and mature software assets will ensure higher levels of investment in growth areas like Big Data analytics and security, while maintaining a stable platform for mission-critical software products that customers rely on. 
For employees, Micro Focus' approach will mean each product line will have a clear and important role in the overall company performance, and employees will have a high level of clarity on the strategy for their organization. It also means employees will get to work on long-term customer-focused projects and the software technology that they love. We believe the software assets that will be a part of the spin-merge will bring better value to our customer, employees and shareholders as part of a more focused software company, committed to growing these businesses on a stand-alone basis. 
With this announcement, Robert Young Jones, the current head of our Software business will assume the role of Executive Vice President, Strategic Business Development reporting to me. In this new role, Robert will partner with other members of the leadership team to drive strategic customer and partner initiatives focused on key parts of the business. With Robert taking on this new role, Chris Schuch, our Chief Operating Officer will lead the Software business, effective immediately in addition to his current responsibilities. 
Chris' track record of driving strong performance and understanding market dynamics at HPE and throughout his career, make him a great fit for this role. To be clear, both software and services are still key enablers of HPE's go-forward strategy. Our newly created software-defined and cloud business will build upon key software assets like OneView and the Helion cloud platform to deliver software-defined, hybrid IT solutions like synergies, HPE's compulsively infrastructure offering that enables customers to operate their workloads with unprecedented in the facility. And in services. We continue to have a world-class capability in our Technology Services group, which will represent about 25% of HPE's revenue following the 2 spins that we've announced. 
CSC's 22,000 service professionals build solutions from the ground up with the consulting and support our customers need to transform their environment and take advantage of opportunities in emerging areas like campus, branch and IoT. Once the ES-CSC and the software Micro Focus transactions are complete, HPE will be an even stronger company, well positioned for the future. With approximately $28 billion in annual revenue, the future HPE will have significant scale, a diversified world-class portfolio and a global footprint to meet the evolving needs of our customers and partners. We will be a market leader both in the data center and on the edge with our world-class portfolio of software-defined servers, storage, networking and converged infrastructure. 
We will also have strong recurring revenue streams that account for approximately 60% of our operating profit and will have an improved free cash flow profile. Given our experience with divestitures, we are confident in our ability to execute. And more importantly, that we are making the right choices to set both HPE and our customers up for the long-term while delivering maximum shareholder value. The market is already recognizing what we're doing. With these strategic moves and our continued strong operational performance, HPE's market cap has increased by over $10 billion or 40% from the separation of HPI on November 1, 2015. 
In addition to the portfolio changes, we also made important leadership and organizational changes this quarter that will make our business stronger and more efficient. For example, we've started the process of rightsizing our corporate functions for a more focused, stand-alone HPE. In addition, the Enterprise Group businesses have been simplified and streamlined to better address market opportunities, improved cost structure, accelerate innovation and strengthen our competitiveness. 
Furthermore, all business unit and corporate marketing efforts will be consolidated under our global marketing function and all sales will be under a single global leader. Finally, we announced that Hewlett-Packard Labs will move into the Enterprise Group, which will better align our research and go-to-market efforts. While there is more work to do, we are already seeing that our strategy is working. As a more focused organization, we've been better able to allocate resources more effectively, and introduced truly best-in-class solutions. 
For example, as I mentioned earlier, we announced plans to acquire SGI. High-performance compute and big data analytics are exciting areas for us as customers are increasingly looking for ways to gain deeper, more contextual insights from ever expanding volumes of the data. Industries like financial services, semiconductors and energy are all increasing their HPC investments. In Q3, we won several significant automotive deals for high-performance compute is used for electronic prototype designs, improving fuel economy and improving crashworthiness. 
The SGI acquisition will further strengthen our position in the $11 billion HPC segment as well as the high-growth data analytics segment. In storage. We extended our leadership in the all-flash data center with enhancements to HPE 3PAR and also introduced next-generation software-defined storage to enable a composable data fabric. We also brought enterprise capabilities to the entry storage market with the introduction of StoreVirtual 3200 and MSA 240. 
We announced HPE OneView 3.0 to provide software-defined intelligence across HPE's family of infrastructure solutions. To date, we sold over 500,000 HPE OneView licenses across a variety of key verticals such as health care, industrial and financial services and we have a growing partner ecosystem including Docker, Chef, Turbonomic and Sole Stack. We unveiled the industry's first converged systems for the Internet of Things, the HPE Echelon 1000 and 4000, which will enable real-time decision-making and deliver heavy-duty analytics at the edge by integrating data capture, compute and storage. 
We also announced updates to the HPE Helion cloud portfolio, including HPE Helion Cloud Suite, a new software suite enabling customers to manage their full spectrum of applications across infrastructure environment. And HPE Helion Cloud System 10 in hardware and software solutions to build and deploy an enterprise-grade private cloud environment. But most of all, we are winning with our customers and partners. Aruba continues to win customers and drive growth with its industry-leading technology. For example, we helped import handle the massive surge of travelers passing through for the Olympics this summer and Home Depot and Best Buy are currently implementing Aruba wireless solutions to provide a better in-store experience for customers and employees. 
Keep in mind, deals like this have great TS pullthrough as well. At Discover in June, we announced a new partnership with GE digital that will enable industrial analytics from the edge to the cloud. HPE will be a preferred storage and server infrastructure provider for GE's pre-dex cloud technologies and the pre-dex platform will be a preferred software solution for HPE's industrial-related use cases and opportunities. HPE was also instrumental in helping Dropbox transform to a hybrid infrastructure to help it meet the growing demand on its users. Dropbox moved majority of its cloud storage business away from AWS to an on premise data center, using HPE ProLiant and cloud line servers all financed by HPE Financial Services. 
We also announced a groundbreaking strategic alliance with Docker to help customers transform and modernize their data centers to benefit from the more agile development environment. At the heart of this alliance is HPE's Docker-ready server program, unique to the server industry, which ensures HPE servers are bundled with the Docker engine and support. And today, we announced plans for a commercial partnership with Micro Focus that will remain [indiscernible] as HPE's preferred Linux partner and will bring together HPE's Helion OpenStack and Staccato solutions with, open stack expertise to provide best-in-class, enterprise-grade, hybrid cloud offerings for HPE customers. 
So in summary, I'm pleased with the progress we've made this quarter. And I'm just as pleased with the execution of our strategies since we separated with HPI. I'm also excited about the opportunities we've created for shareholders and the spin mergers of ES and CSC, and our software assets with Micro Focus. We are setting up HPE for long-term success, while unlocking the kind of value we believe our shareholders appreciate.
On that note, I will hand the call over to Tim."

Overall, we performed well in the quarter. While revenue of $12.2 billion, down less than 1%, was not quite as strong as last quarter, margins were up as we focus on profitable market share.

While revenue of $12.2 billion, down less than 1%, was not quite as strong as last quarter, margins were up as we focus on profitable market share. We also executed well considering we faced difficult compares across the portfolio and an uneven global demand environment. 
As we indicated last quarter, compares became more challenging as we're no longer benefiting from the large Deutsche Bank deal we signed in ES last year, and in EG, we are lapping the compares from Aruba and the ramp of cloud line servers. From a macro perspective, we did see weakness in Europe, particularly in ES from a slowing, in the U.K. public sector business and also in Japan, in the Enterprise Group. The Q3 currency impact to revenue was a headwind of 210 basis points year-over-year that we expect to moderate further. 
We did have several areas of accelerated growth across the portfolio, including networking, up 12%; all-flash arrays, up 70%; high-performance compute, up 12%; and our highest margin business, Technology Services, returned to growth for the first time since the second quarter of 2012. To improve growth in the overall portfolio, we're continuing to make investments in our higher growth businesses around software-defined, converged and hyper converged while we continue to enhance our go-to-market efforts that we expect will improve growth going forward. Overall, we are still on track to deliver what we said we would do at the beginning of the year by growing total fiscal year '16 revenue adjusted for divestitures and currency. 
Gross margin of 29.3% was up 60 basis points both year-over-year and sequentially. This was principally due to continued improvements in Enterprise Services and Enterprise Group to a lesser extent. Non-GAAP operating profit of 8.8% was up 30 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points, sequentially. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.49 was above our outlook of $0.42 to $0.46 that was primarily the result of tax benefits realized in the recent divestitures equating to approximately $0.04 per share. 
Non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pretax amount for the gain of divestiture of H3C of $2.2 billion, restructuring charges of $369 million, amortization of intangible assets of $210 million, and separation charges of $135 million. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.32, above our previously provided outlook range of $1.10 to $1.14 primarily due to a higher-than-expected gain on the H3C divestiture, lower separation costs and the previously mentioned, tax benefit. 
Now turning to the result by business. In Enterprise Group, revenue was flat as we focused on profitability and delivered encouraging improvements in operating margins, which while flat year-over-year, were up 90 basis points sequentially to 12.6%. The sequential improvement was primarily due to lower discounting, better server option attach, favorable mix and operational costs improvement as we rightsize the organization ahead of its separation from Enterprise Services and Software. 
Server revenue declined 2% as solid growth in Tier 1 and high-performance compute was offset by pressures and core servers. Within the core, we did have some market coverage issues that we're addressing some recent sales leadership and go-to-market changes with an emphasis on SMB. We also doubled down on the fast-growing high-performance compute market with the acquisition of SGI. We continue to invest in workload optimized solutions like SAP HANA. From a margin standpoint, the team did a nice job prioritizing profitability over share for share's sake, expanding margins year-over-year. 
We also anticipate we held server share in the second calendar quarter overall and gained share in the Americas and to be optimize in Tier 1. Storage revenue declined 5% with continued declines in the legacy portfolio, more than offsetting growth in Converged Storage of 1%, that was impacted by softer-than-expected market. Margins increased year-over-year, driven by favorable converge mix and improved pricing in all-flash. 3PAR plus XT plus EVA was up 5% in all-flash 3PAR revenue continues to drive the portfolio, growing 70% at record revenue levels. Despite a challenging market, we estimate we gained share at the second calendar quarter, our 11th consecutive quarter of share gains. And we continue to expect storage to gain share through the remainder of the year. 
Networking revenue grew 12% and encouragingly, Aruba growth has accelerated, growing 20% and is exceeding our internal plan. We again, saw growth across all regions as we continue to see the benefits of the combined Aruba, HPE portfolio. Margins improved year-over-year, driven by both a better mix and higher margin rates of Aruba. TS returned to growth for the first time since the second quarter of 2012. Revenue was up 1% as the strong order growth from fiscal year '15 becomes a larger portion of the portfolio and revenue grew in both Support and Consulting. 
And while orders were flat, we saw encouraging performance in non-attach and proactive services that are growing at double-digit rates and becoming a larger mix of the total portfolio. We continue to improve service intensity, our attach dollars per unit, which is helping to offset increased Tier 1 mix and higher server ASPs. Enterprise Services revenue declined 3% as growth in the Americas and APJ was more than offset by weakness in EMEA, resulting from a pause in U.K. public sector spending and a tough compare with the Deutsche Bank deal in the prior deal. Operating profit improved 260 basis points year-over-year to 8.3%, the highest since the second quarter of 2011 as the team continues to execute on productivity improvement in delivery and sales. 
We also benefited from improving location mix and new deal profitability. Progress made on cost improvements, sales strength and normal quarterly seasonality provides us with continued confidence that operating margins for the full year will be approximately 7%, at the high end of our original outlook. Revenue is still expected to be down 2% to flat in constant currency even with the emphasis divestiture. We continue to track against our longer team goal of 60% headcount in low-cost locations and completed the quarter with 49% of our headcount in low-cost centers, a 6-point improvement since the beginning of the fiscal year. 
Software revenue declined 3% as strength in security and Big Data was offset by decline in IT management. SaaS had a record quarter with 17% revenues growth. The team continues to focus on disciplined cost controls, decreasing OpEx 16% year-over-year however, revenue declines ultimately outpaced operating improvements causing a 270 basis point decline in operating margins to 17.8%. 
HPE Financial Services revenue grew 2% and delivered the first quarter of as-reported revenue growth since the first quarter of 2013. Operating profit declined 90 basis points year-over-year to 9.9% as lower residual sales from weaker volumes in prior years pressured margin rates. Financing volume declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency. On a tough compare that saw Deutsche Bank sale leaseback volume in the third quarter of 2015. Return on equity was down 190 basis points year-over-year to 13.3% and was similarly pressured by lower residual sales resulting from lower volumes in fiscal year '13 and fiscal year '14. 
Cash flow generation was strong in the quarter as we continue to optimize working capital management. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion, up 10% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Free cash flow was $971 million, up 15% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. When adjusted for the sales of emphasis, the cash conversion cycle was 19 days, down 5 days, sequentially. Receivables were the largest contributor to working capital improvement due to favorable payment term mix and reductions to age receivables. Going forward, we expect the cash conversion cycle to be in the mid-teens with fiscal year '16 free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. 
Turning to capital allocation. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.5 billion of stock from an accelerated share repurchase program, and we paid $91 million as part of our normal dividend. Year-to-date, we have returned $2.9 billion of capital to shareholders, primarily through a $2.7 billion of share repurchases. With our free cash flow generation and the recent divestitures, we are on pace to return more than $3 billion of cash to shareholders in the year, which as a reminder, is approximately 3x our original commitment at the start of the year. 
Finally, I would like to discuss the financial impacts of the HPE Software, Micro Focus transactions. As Meg mentioned, the transaction is expected to deliver approximately $8.8 billion of enterprise value to HPE. This includes 50.1% [ph] of the equity in the newly formed company that will go to HPE shareholders, valued at approximately $6.3 billion based on Micro Focus' current stock price and received a $2.5 billion payment of onshore cash to HPE. 
HPE Micro Focus also expect to improve the margins on HPE software assets by approximately 20 points by the end of the third year, following the deal close, while investing in key growth areas like Big Data and security. As owners of 50.1% of the equity in the new merged company, HPE shareholders will share in the value of these operational improvements as well as future growth of earnings. We expect this transaction to close by the end of the second half of HPE's fiscal year 2017. 
To recognize this $8.8 billion of enterprise value and unlock a more attractive financial profile for HPE going forward, we will incur onetime separation cash payments of approximately $700 million with the vast majority occurring in fiscal year '17. Following the separation from ES and software, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a faster growing, higher-margin, stronger cash flow company for our shareholders. Just looking at fiscal year '16, revenue growth would be about 3 points greater. Operating margins would be about 1 point higher at just over 10% and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue will be roughly 50% higher. 
It's also worth noting that we have roughly 30% of revenue recurring. But most importantly, more than 60% of profitability will be recurring that comes from TS and Financial Services. HPE will also have a very healthy balance sheet that currently sits at $5.3 billion in operating net cash. On top of that, we just closed the emphasis deal, receiving approximately $825 million of before tax cash proceeds. We continue to see share repurchase as an excellent use of capital and similar to the H3C transaction, plan to buy back shares with the vast majority of the emphasis proceeds. 
In fiscal year '17, our net cash position will also be further enhanced by over $1 billion from the cash and debt transfers with CSC and a $2.5 billion cash dividend from Micro Focus. We will continue to deliver shareholder value with these proceeds just as we've done this year by following our returns based capital allocation approach. This approach is currently biased towards share repurchases and we will provide more details in our fiscal year '17 capital return plans to shareholders at our upcoming Analyst Day. 
With all that in mind, we expect to finish fiscal year 2016 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.90 to $1.95 at the high end of our original outlook for the year. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $2.09 to $2.14. 
Before we open it up to questions, a quick reminder that we are holding our Annual Securities Analyst Meeting on October 18 in San Francisco, where we will provide additional P&L and cash flow details on the company as it stands today as well as a go forward Hewlett Packard Enterprise, excluding ES and Software. 
Now let's open it up for questions."

So listen, we were -- we saw a softer market. But we've introduced our new StoreVirtual 2200, the MSA 2040 that brings the enterprise capabilities at a fantastic price to the entry market and that has been a drag for us. We haven't had a great competitive offering in the entry market. And what you know about the storage market, is moving from high-end to entry very, very fast. So looking forward I mean, listen we think the market is going to continue to be soft. But -- and that will keep overall market, our growth muted. But we can continue to gain share and we are very pleased with our HPE 3PAR all-flash performance that grew 70% year-over-year. So some work to do there, but we feel good about where we are.

So Aruba and SGI are perfect examples, complimentary technology that we can put through our distribution center that really -- our distribution mechanism that really enhances value for customers. So I think those are 2 perfect example on the kind of deals you can see us do going moving forward. Unfortunately, there aren't that many deals like that, but when they come along, we'll do it.

And at that time, you talked about cash balance being an asset and net acquisitions would be an integral part of the strategy. You also talked about HPE being a solutions company and a growth company. Less than a year later, it feels like a different story. Cash return has been the absolute priority. Acquisitions have been extremely minimal. Arguably, divesting software and services, which are essential ingredients to many solutions seems different. And so, I applaud the flexibility because the stock price has done extremely well. And it's certainly in in the vein of value creation. But I was wondering if you could comment on what appeared to precipitate this change in thinking from I think an impression that seemed different to most from the roadshow a year ago. And is there a different end state for Hewlett Packard Enterprise going forward? I mean, is this really a viable ongoing hardware-centric company going forward? Or should we expect more portfolio rationalization? And believe it or not, I have a follow-up."

So Toni, let me take you all the way back to November 1 of 2015 where we separated HP Inc. from Hewlett Packard Enterprise. And we very much laid out the strategy of being a leading provider in hybrid IT, both in the traditional data center, which by the way is still a robust market. It's 85% of the spend in IT today. And we are the leader there and we need to continue to gain share. And then we wanted to focus on software-defined infrastructure, which is really the next generation of infrastructure that our customers need. And then finally, build out our cloud platform and compute storage and networking at the edge. And that's exactly what we've done. And as we've laid out that strategy, we looked at our portfolio. What do we need to add to the portfolio? Either an acquisition or partnership. What do we need to divest because those assets are noncore to the strategy. It doesn't mean they're bad assets, it's just that they're not core to what we're doing. So if you take the ES transaction. Listen, we're still going to be in the Services business. In fact, 25% of the revenue of HPE will be services, it's just a different kind of services business than IT outsourcing, business process outsourcing and apps maintenance. If you think about software, we're still going to be in the software business. It's just not an application software like iTop, it is systems software like OneView and the software that powers synergy. So it is a portfolio matching to the strategy that we see our competitive advantage in. As far as -- I think you asked about further divestitures. So Enterprise Group has currently configured, the need to say together. And I'll tell you why. But my view of the market is everything is moving to converged, and we have a differentiated position because we have networking, storage and compute. And that is, our 2 major competitors are missing a key component of that offering. So that, we think is important to keep together. And then as you think about Technology Services. Technology Services is a key differentiator for our company. We can help customers support, maintain, advise and consult across the globe, and it would be uneconomic to simply support storage only or networking only. So TS is absolutely integral. And then finally, obviously, campus, branch and edge is a new growth area for the company. There's no reason that we should not own compute at the edge. There's no reason that we shouldn't own analytics at the edge, in addition to obviously, Aruba. So I think it's to some degree, the strategy has evolved. But really, quite consistent with what we laid out and a big part of what we did this past year was portfolio optimization for the strategy. So on a go-forward basis, I think as Tim said well, I think you can look for more ROI-based smart acquisition by Aruba, like SGI, and I think it's entirely consistent with the strategy that we laid out a year ago."

Anytime you divest or acquire particularly in this case, you say well, ""could I have done what others are going to do on my own?"" So what I mean by that is, I can't help thinking that HPE software business is going to be like 75% of Micro Focus going forward. You're far, far, far bigger than they are from a revenue perspective. And they believe as a much smaller player that they can improve operating margins, 2,000 basis points. 2,000 basis points on your revenue basis, $750 million a year in operating profit, which add up a 10 multiple, $7.5 billion, if you haven't given up the business. So I guess the question is, is the margin improvement opportunities are so huge even for a relatively small player, why do you not even extract a better price or why you did not believe that you could have extracted those and created even more value to shareholders."

They are a pure play software company who is expert at managing mature software assets. And as Micro Focus will tell you, most people who work in software business in Silicon Valley want to grow assets. And actually some of these assets should actually be maintained on a stable platform that extends the value for customers. And it's actually not what we do, it is what they do. But then you come to the question of, why did we do a spin merge as opposed to sell the whole business. And the reason is, is because our shareholders will be able to ride the upside of what Micro Focus does. Remember our shareholders will own 50% of the new company. And by the way, I will be a shareholder of that new company, given my vested options and my vested RSUs in HPE and I can tell you, I will be holding those shares because I think they're going to do very, very well. And so this was a much better alternative than selling the company today on a key multiple operating income because you get cash. But you pay taxes. And then our shareholders would get unless they went out and took new money to buy those shares. So we thought that was absolutely the right thing to do. And I have to tell you, Toni, in today's world where technology is changing at lightning speed, I've got to tell you the value of focus. I'm seeing it every single day. And so while may be back in the day, it was great to be a technology supermarket like the financial supermarkets of yesterday. What I'm pretty sure is the next 4 or 5 years is going to be all about speed, agility and focus and innovation and something that is more a narrow focus."

But we still remain in the software business. It's just a different kind of software business. As I said, system software. The software-defined infrastructure is all powered by software, but it's not applications software, if you will, like iTom or ADM. It is actually systems software that powers the infrastructure of our customers. Now you say, all right, so how do we capitalize on the Big Data and analytics? Well, first of all, we will be the leader in high-performance compute with the acquisition of SGI. So companies need to process and compute huge amounts, ever escalating amounts of data. So really, the high-performance compute market, which is an $11 billion business, growing at 68%, will really be between HPE now with SGI and Cre, but many of the other competitors like Dell, Lenovo, they're not in that high-performance business. So as people need financial services, energy as they need to compute to process all this Big Data, if you will. We will be the leading player there. If you think about campus branch and edge, I think this is the next big growth area. If you think about autonomous driving vehicles, jet engines, health care sensors and health care beds and devices. This is an area where huge amounts of data needs to be processed real-time, at the edge and close during the latency of coming back to a major data center. So we're going to be able to capitalize on the IoT trend by big data -- by analytics at the edge and be able to compute in store at the edge. So that's the way we'll play in those trends. It will be different than like Vertica, which will go to Micro Focus, which is a big common database, it process huge amounts of data on the database side, but we will pick up the ability to process on compute storage and networking at the edge."

So let me just give you a sense of, I think we're in a great position to compete with both Cisco and Dell. So for example. Actually, the HPE go-forward strategy will be about a $28 billion company, that's only slightly smaller than Dell's Dell's Enterprise business and it is more focused with better innovation. I think we should just contrast our strategy with Dell. Okay, so we are getting smaller while they're getting bigger. And this is important because I believe speed and agility is critical in innovation and go-to-market. The second is they are levering up and we are delevering. We have $5.3 billion of net cash on the operating company and we're going to have a lot more by the time we're done with these transactions and that gives us dry powder, it also gives us the ability to return cash to shareholders. And I think it's difficult to be levered as much as Dell is, in this environment. And then secondly, we're leaning in to new technology either through our own innovation, acquisitions or partnerships. And we've got major focus on our side. What they're doing is doubling down in all technology on the cost take out play, and listen, I think it might be quite successful for the leadership team there, from a financial perspective, I'm not so sure it's good for customers."

And as this converges, I think as the environment converges and we look at hyper converge and on synergy, we're innovating really nicely now for the traditional data center as well as the software-defined data center, and I got to tell you, Aruba at the edge is killing it. A 20% growth rate above our internal plans and we're just winning deals hand over first there, so we feel really good about our ability to deal with Cisco. Okay. So back to servers. So listen, what's happening in servers is there is sort of core server growth, then there is Tier 1 servers, which is the big server providers, and then is obviously, high performance compute. And the reason we did the SGI acquisition is to really stake out a great position in an $11 billion business I said before, that's growing 68%, that's very profitable for the compute itself, but also there's very high TS attached to high performance compute. Core server around the globe are under some pressure right now. But you saw what we did in terms of increase in the margin. And we are doubling down on SMB, which actually is still -- there's pockets of growth in that area. And we're also doing workload, specialization. Okay, we have the best compute in the world to run SAP HANA. It's not even close with anyone else. So we're specializing around workloads. And then obviously, there was a tough compare because of cloudline, a year ago. I mean we have just ramped that business into a multibillion dollar business. And so it's hard to compete with those compares, but we expect to continue to gain share in that market profitably. We're not in it for share for share's sake. We don't want to take unprofitable deals, but as we continue to work on our supply chain and the rationalization become ever more competitive there. And we're very mindful that ultimately there is Chinese competitors there as well. And whether that's Huawei or Lenovo, its not just Dell. So we're very aware of the cost structure we have to compete."

If you look at the absolute free cash flow, it will be relatively neutral, driven by the fact that software does generate some free cash flow but that's offset by the pressure in ES.

Let's take a pause and decide what we want to do here. And we saw it in a very market way. What I will say in the last couple of weeks, we've actually seen orders pick up again it was almost like they took a pause and basically, had to sort of take stock of what was happening and then basically, the orders have started to flow again. I mean, we continue to also monitor the pricing -- competitive pricing environment that we see and we adjust as necessary, particularly in the channel.

TS while is and was a very profitable business, that was largely attached to Business Critical Systems, very profitable, very high attach rate. I mean you didn't really sell business group of systems with a TS attached. And when business critical systems both from a market perspective as well as the Oracle situation, by all rights, TS should be down 25%. If you remember Shannon, over the last 4 or 5 years, BCS was down 25% like clockwork, every single quarter for 4 years. It's growing a little bit now. But by all of rights, TS should have shrunk with BCS and it did not, and the reason it did not was very impressive, new product offering, Proactive Care, other areas where we help customers maintain their data center estate. And so the fact that it is actually only been done a few percentage points over the last 12 months is a testament to the leadership team in that business. And now what you're seeing is the new product offerings are starting to get real traction. Orders have been positive for the last 3 or 4 quarters. And those are orders translated into growth this quarter. Not a significant amount of growth, but 1% will take it all day long because it is a very, very profitable business. So we have more work to do on Technology Services. I will tell you what is the benefit of now being a smaller, more focused company. Antonio, Mary and I, are going to spend a whole lot of time now on what is the next generation of Technology Services and whether that's Flexible Capacity Services that allows consumption-based model, where there is proactive care and data center care, we're going to spend a lot of time there because it is a key strategic enabler of RemainCo HPE."

So we're getting closer to those benchmarks. We're not quite there yet, but we are close and we are there in some of the functions. And so as we have done these divestitures or as we're doing these divestitures, we obviously incorporate that into what the new cost structure needs to look like. And obviously, we need to be very aggressive around what we call stranded costs. So I think the good news is when you look at the HPE, HPI separation, we did have some dyssynergies we call them. We have worked those through the system, with the H3C divestiture, we've gotten much better with identifying. The stranded cost would be much more proactive in managing them out. We're starting to see those come out, so we're confident that we can continue to do that, to get to the benchmarks we need to get to, when these transactions are done."

Whether that is how we are organized internally with all R&D under one R&D leader, whether it's putting our software-defined infrastructure and our cloud offering under one leader. Whether it's putting all of our go-to-market under one leader where we have consistent go-to-market strategy, discounting across the board. Frankly, we were much better at minimizing discounting in APJ and EMEA than we were in the United States, we now have that disciplined across the company. And then finally, corporate overhead, we've got to have a corporate overhead, but it's designed for a $28 billion company. And when we started, we had a corporate overhead designed for a $110 billion company and then a $50 billion company, and now a $28 billion company. And I have to say, I'm really pleased with our ability to sort of rightsize the corporate overhead, and be lean and mean. And that includes everything from HR, finance, legal, IT, things like real estate, systems. So we've made a lot of progress, but you'll see more of that benefit, I think in '17 and '18."

Again, we feel like the value that, that transaction is driving is phenomenal for HPE as well as its shareholders. However, to realize that value, we need to make investments and allocate resources to do the separation. So to your point, software, although the activities are similar in nature to the transaction and yes, they are discrete. And they're not necessarily driven by revenue base or headcount level. So when you look at software, it's a global complex business. It has multiple legal entities that have been accumulated over time through a series of transactions. And because of that, when you look at the tax, the finance, the legal and the operating structure, it is still very, very complicated. So in order to separate that, there are some large expense items in there. For example, separating 650 IT systems, doing the carve-out financial, translating GAAP to IFRS, splitting 150 legal entities in 60 countries, trying to figure out what we want to do with 200 real estate sites across the globe. So there's certainly a lot of work that needs to be done there. The good news is that we have done this before, so we know how to do it. The team has been very proactive and we're all over it.

Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the press releases and the slide presentations accompanying today's earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations web page at investors.hpe.com.
As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings and transaction materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HPE's SEC reports, including its most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. 
We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2016. Finally, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. 
Throughout this conference call, all revenue growth rates presented, beginning with fiscal year 2015, are adjusted to exclude the impact of divestitures and currency. We believe this approach helps provide a better representation of HPE's operational performance given the significant divestitures we've recently completed, including the sale of 51% of our H3C business in China and TippingPoint, amongst several others. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our website for details. 
With that, let me turn it over to Meg."

Let me start by saying I'm pleased with the progress we made in Q3. Overall, we had a strong quarter. While revenue was down slightly on an operational basis, we saw several areas of growth in key parts of our portfolio, including networking, all-flash storage, high-performance compute and Technology Services. 
Profitability was very encouraging as we continue to deliver margin improvements in Enterprise Services and focus on profitable deals in the Enterprise Group. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.49, which even before the impact of a favorable tax rate, was at the high end of our previously guided range. Free cash flow also improved to $1 billion through diligent working capital management, and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders primarily through share repurchases. 
Tim will provide further color on the quarter, but I would like to take the bulk of my time to discuss today's spin merge announcement and put it in the context of the strategy we've been executing against for the past several years. 
Last November, we launched the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise with the vision to become the industry's leading provider of hybrid IT with the secured next-generation software-defined infrastructure that will run our customers' data centers today, bridge them to multi-cloud environments tomorrow and enable the emerging intelligent edge that will power campus, branch and IoT applications for decades to come. 
We believe this is what our customers are looking for and what we are best qualified to do. And most importantly, achieving this vision will create a faster-growing, higher-margin, stronger free cash flow company for our shareholders. To realize our vision, we looked at our portfolio and our product roadmaps to determine gaps that we needed to fill and then evaluated how best to do so. Some we fill through increased R&D like the investment in our recently launched HC 380 Hyper Converged product. In other areas, we pursue innovative partnerships like the ones recently announced with Docker and Mesosphere. And in some cases, acquisitions make sense like Aruba and SGI. 
Next, we identified areas of the business that were not aligned with our go-forward strategy. Here, we have looked at how to best maximize shareholder value with these assets. We've already made a number of decisions, including the sale of TippingPoint, the H3C deal in China, and of course, the spin merge of our Enterprise Services business with CSC. 
And today, we announced plans for a spin-off and merger of our noncore software assets with Micro Focus. These assets include our application delivery management, big data, enterprise security, information management and governance, and IT operations management businesses. This transaction is valued at about $8.8 billion, including a 50.1% ownership of the new combined company by HPE shareholders, which is currently valued at $6.3 billion and a $2.5 billion cash payment to HPE. 
The combined company will be led by Kevin Loosemore, current Micro Focus Executive Chairman; and Mike Phillips will serve as Chief Financial Officer. After the transaction closes, Micro Focus's Board of Directors will include an HPE senior executive and HPE independent directors on the board. 
The new combined company is expected to have annual revenues of approximately $4.5 billion with strong recurring revenue streams. The company will be well diversified across product lines and geographies. It will also have a stronger go-to-market capability with nearly 4,000 sales people worldwide and deep R&D resources to deliver best-in-class solutions to customers and partners. Micro Focus's approach to managing both growing and mature software assets will ensure higher levels of investment in growth areas like big data analytics and security, while maintaining a stable platform for mission-critical software products that customers rely on. 
For employees, Micro Focus's approach will mean each product line will have a clear and important role in the overall company performance, and employees will have a high level of clarity on the strategy for their organization. It also means employees will get to work on long-term customer-focused projects and the software technology that they love. We believe the software assets that will be a part of the spin-merge will bring better value to our customers, employees and shareholders as part of a more focused software company, committed to growing these businesses on a stand-alone basis. 
With this announcement, Robert Youngjohns, the current head of our Software business, will assume the role of Executive Vice President, Strategic Business Development reporting to me. In this new role, Robert will partner with other members of the leadership team to drive strategic customer and partner initiatives focused on growing key parts of the business. With Robert taking on this new role, Chris Hsu, our Chief Operating Officer, will lead the Software business, effective immediately in addition to his current responsibilities. Chris's track record of driving strong performance and understanding market dynamics at HPE and throughout his career make him a great fit for this role. 
To be clear, both software and services are still key enablers of HPE's go-forward strategy. Our newly created software-defined and cloud business will build upon key software assets like OneView and the Helion cloud platform to deliver software-defined, hybrid IT solutions like Synergy, HPE's composable infrastructure offering that enables customers to operate their workloads with unprecedented speed and agility. And in Services, we continue to have a world-class capability in our Technology Services group, which will represent about 25% of HPE's revenue following the 2 spins that we've announced. 
ES's 22,000 service professionals build solutions from the ground up with the consulting and support our customers need to transform their environment and take advantage of opportunities in emerging areas like campus, branch and IoT. Once the ES, CSC and the software Micro Focus transactions are complete, HPE will be an even stronger company, well positioned for the future. 
With approximately $28 billion in annual revenue, the future HPE will have significant scale, a diversified world-class portfolio and a global footprint to meet the evolving needs of our customers and partners. We will be a market leader both in the data center and on the edge with our world-class portfolio of software-defined servers, storage, networking and converged infrastructure. 
We will also have strong recurring revenue streams that account for approximately 60% of our operating profit and will have an improved free cash flow profile. Given our experience with divestitures, we are confident in our ability to execute. And more importantly, that we are making the right choices to set both HPE and our customers up for the long term while delivering maximum shareholder value. 
The market is already recognizing what we are doing. With these strategic moves and our continued strong operational performance, HPE's market cap has increased by over $10 billion or 40% since the separation from HPI on November 1, 2015. 
In addition to the portfolio changes, we also made important leadership and organizational changes this quarter that will make our business stronger and more efficient. For example, we've started the process of rightsizing our corporate functions for the more focused, stand-alone HPE. In addition, the Enterprise Group businesses have been simplified and streamlined to better address market opportunities, improve cost structure, accelerate innovation and strengthen our competitiveness. 
Furthermore, all business unit and corporate marketing efforts will be consolidated under our global marketing function, and all sales will be under a single global leader. Finally, we announced that Hewlett Packard Labs would move into the Enterprise Group, which will better align our research and go-to-market efforts. 
While there is more work to do, we are already seeing that our strategy is working. As a more focused organization, we've been better able to allocate resources more effectively and introduced truly best-in-class solutions. 
For example, as I mentioned earlier, we announced plans to acquire SGI. High-performance compute and big data analytics are exciting areas for us as customers are increasingly looking for ways to gain deeper, more contextual insights from the ever-expanding volumes of the data. Industries like financial services, semiconductors and energy are all increasing their HPC investments. In Q3, we won several significant automotive deals where high-performance compute is used for electronic prototype designs, improving fuel economy and improving crashworthiness. The SGI acquisition will further strengthen our position in the $11 billion HPC segment as well as the high-growth data analytics segment. 
In storage, we extended our leadership in the all-flash data center with enhancements to HPE 3PAR and also introduced next-generation software-defined storage to enable a composable data fabric. We also brought enterprise capabilities to the entry storage market with the introduction of StoreVirtual 3200 and MSA 240. 
We announced HPE OneView 3.0 to provide software-defined intelligence across HPE's family of infrastructure solutions. To date, we've sold over 500,000 HPE OneView licenses across a variety of key verticals such as health care, industrial and financial services; and we have a growing partner ecosystem including Docker, Chef, Turbonomic and SaltStack. We unveiled the industry's first converged systems for the Internet of Things, the HPE Edgeline 1000 and 4000, which will enable real-time decision-making and deliver heavy-duty analytics at the edge by integrating data capture, control, compute and storage. 
We also announced updates to the HPE Helion cloud portfolio, including HPE Helion Cloud Suite, a new software suite enabling customers to manage their full spectrum of applications across infrastructure environment. And HPE Helion CloudSystem 10, a hardware and software solution to build and deploy an enterprise-grade private cloud environment. But most of all, we are winning with our customers and partners. 
Aruba continues to win customers and drive growth with its industry-leading technology. For example, we helped Rio's airport handle the massive surge of travelers passing through for the Olympics this summer, and Home Depot and Best Buy are currently implementing Aruba wireless solutions to provide a better in-store experience for customers and employees. 
Keep in mind, deals like this have great TS pull-through as well. At Discover in June, we announced a new partnership with GE Digital that will enable industrial analytics from the edge to the cloud. HPE will be a preferred storage and server infrastructure provider for GE's Predix cloud technologies, and the Predix platform will be a preferred software solution for HPE's industrial-related use cases and opportunities. HPE was also instrumental in helping Dropbox transform to a hybrid infrastructure to help it meet the growing demands of its users. Dropbox moved majority of its cloud storage business away from AWS to an on-premise data center, using HPE ProLiant and Cloudline servers all financed by HPE Financial Services. 
We also announced a groundbreaking strategic alliance with Docker to help customers transform and modernize their data centers to benefit from a more agile development environment. At the heart of this alliance is HPE's Docker-ready server program, unique to the server industry, which ensures HPE servers are bundled with the Docker engine and support. And today, we announced plans for a commercial partnership with Micro Focus that will name SUSE as HPE's preferred Linux partner and will bring together HPE's Helion OpenStack and Stackato solutions with SUSE's OpenStack expertise to provide best-in-class, enterprise-grade, hybrid cloud offerings for HPE customers. 
So in summary, I'm pleased with the progress we've made this quarter. And I'm just as pleased with the execution of our strategies since we separated from HPI. I'm also excited about the opportunities we've created for shareholders in the spin-mergers of ES and CSC, and our software assets with Micro Focus. We are setting up HPE for long-term success, while unlocking the kind of value we believe our shareholders appreciate.
On that note, I will hand the call over to Tim."
273983758,379420534,1042991,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 07, 2016",2016-09-07,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thanks, Meg. Overall, we performed well in the quarter. While revenue of $12.2 billion, down less than 1%, was not quite as strong as last quarter, margins were up as we focus on profitable market share. We also executed well considering we faced difficul",1928,"Thanks, Meg. Overall, we performed well in the quarter. While revenue of $12.2 billion, down less than 1%, was not quite as strong as last quarter, margins were up as we focus on profitable market share. We also executed well considering we faced difficult compares across the portfolio and an uneven global demand environment. 
As we indicated last quarter, compares became more challenging as we're no longer benefiting from the large Deutsche Bank deal we signed in ES last year; and in EG, we are lapping the compares from Aruba and the ramp of Cloudline servers. From a macro perspective, we did see weakness in Europe, particularly in ES from a slowing in the U.K. public sector business and also in Japan, in the Enterprise Group. The Q3 currency impact to revenue was a headwind of 210 basis points year-over-year that we expect to moderate further. 
We did have several areas of solid growth across the portfolio, including networking, up 12%; all-flash arrays, up 70%; high-performance compute, up 12%; and our highest margin business, Technology Services, returned to growth for the first time since the second quarter of 2012. 
To improve growth in the overall portfolio, we're continuing to make investments in our higher growth businesses around software-defined, converged and hyper converged while we continue to enhance our go-to-market efforts that we expect will improve growth going forward. Overall, we are still on track to deliver what we said we would do at the beginning of the year by growing total fiscal year '16 revenue adjusted for divestitures and currency. 
Gross margin of 29.3% was up 60 basis points, both year-over-year and sequentially. This was principally due to continued improvements in Enterprise Services and Enterprise Group to a lesser extent. Non-GAAP operating profit of 8.8% was up 30 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points, sequentially. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.49 was above our outlook of $0.42 to $0.46 that was primarily the result of tax benefits realized in the recent divestitures equating to approximately $0.04 per share. 
Non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pretax amounts for the gain on divestiture of H3C of $2.2 billion, restructuring charges of $369 million, amortization of intangible assets of $210 million, and separation charges of $135 million. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.32, above our previously provided outlook range of $1.10 to $1.14, primarily due to a higher-than-expected gain on the H3C divestiture, lower separation costs and the previously mentioned, tax benefit. 
Now turning to the results by business. In Enterprise Group, revenue was flat as we focused on profitability and delivered encouraging improvements in operating margins, which while flat year-over-year, were up 90 basis points sequentially to 12.6%. The sequential improvement was primarily due to lower discounting, better server option attach, favorable mix and operational cost improvements as we rightsized the organization ahead of the separation from Enterprise Services and Software. 
Server revenue declined 2% as solid growth in Tier 1 and high-performance compute was offset by pressures and core servers. Within the core, we did have some market coverage issues that we're addressing through recent sales leadership and go-to-market changes with an emphasis on SMB. We also doubled down in the fast-growing, high-performance compute market with the acquisition of SGI and continue to invest in workload optimized solutions like SAP HANA. 
From a margin standpoint, the team did a nice job prioritizing profitability over share for share's sake, expanding margins year-over-year. We also anticipate we held server share in the second calendar quarter overall and gained share in the Americas, density optimized and Tier 1. 
Storage revenue declined 5% with continued declines in the legacy portfolio, more than offsetting growth in Converged Storage at 1%, that was impacted by softer-than-expected market. Margins increased year-over-year, driven by favorable converged mix and improved pricing in all-flash. 3PAR plus XT plus EVA was up 5%, and all-flash 3PAR revenue continues to drive the portfolio, growing 70% at record revenue levels. Despite a challenging market, we estimate we gained share in the second calendar quarter, our 11th consecutive quarter of share gains. And we continue to expect storage to gain share through the remainder of the year. 
Networking revenue grew 12% and encouragingly, Aruba growth has accelerated, growing 20% and is exceeding our internal plan. We again saw a growth across all regions as we continue to see the benefits of the combined Aruba, HPE portfolio. Margins improved year-over-year, driven by both a better mix and higher margin rates of Aruba. 
TS returned to growth for the first time since the second quarter of 2012. Revenue was up 1% as the strong order growth from fiscal year '15 becomes a larger portion of the portfolio and revenue grew in both Support and Consulting. And while orders were flat, we saw encouraging performance in non-attach and proactive services that are growing at double-digit rates and becoming a larger mix of the total portfolio. 
We continue to improve service intensity, our attach dollars per unit, which is helping to offset increased Tier 1 mix and higher server ASPs. Enterprise Services revenue declined 3% as growth in the Americas and APJ was more than offset by weakness in EMEA, resulting from a pause in U.K. public sector spending and a tough compare with the Deutsche Bank deal in the prior year. 
Operating profit improved 260 basis points year-over-year to 8.3%, the highest since the second quarter of 2011 as the team continues to execute on productivity improvements in delivery and sales. We also benefited from improving location mix and new deal profitability. 
Progress made on cost improvements, sales strength and normal quarterly seasonality provides us with continued confidence that operating margins for the full year will be approximately 7%, at the high end of our original outlook. Revenue is still expected to be down 2% to flat in constant currency even with the emphasis divestiture. We continue to track against our longer-team goal of 60% headcount in low-cost locations and completed the quarter with 49% of our headcount in low-cost centers, a 6-point improvement since the beginning of the fiscal year. 
Software revenue declined 3% as strength in security and big data was offset by declines in IT management. SaaS had a record quarter with 17% revenue growth. The team continues to focus on disciplined cost controls, decreasing OpEx 16% year-over-year. However, revenue declines ultimately outpaced operating improvements causing a 270 basis point decline in operating margins to 17.8%. 
HPE Financial Services revenue grew 2% and delivered the first quarter of as-reported revenue growth since the first quarter of 2013. Operating profit declined 90 basis points year-over-year to 9.9% as lower residual sales from weaker volume in prior years pressured margin rates. 
Financing volume declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency. On a tough compare, that saw Deutsche Bank sale leaseback volume in the third quarter of 2015. 
Return on equity was down 190 basis points year-over-year to 13.3% and was similarly pressured by lower residual sales resulting from lower volumes in fiscal year '13 and fiscal year '14. 
Cash flow generation was strong in the quarter as we continue to optimize working capital management. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion, up 10% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Free cash flow was $971 million, up 15% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. When adjusted for the sale of Mphasis, the cash conversion cycle was 19 days, down 5 days, sequentially. Receivables were the largest contributor to working capital improvement due to favorable payment term mix and reductions to aged receivables. Going forward, we expect the cash conversion cycle to be in the mid-teens with fiscal year '16 free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. 
Turning to capital allocation. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.5 billion of stock through an accelerated share repurchase program, and we paid $91 million as part of our normal dividend. Year-to-date, we have returned $2.9 billion of capital to shareholders, primarily through a $2.7 billion of share repurchases. With our free cash flow generation and the recent divestitures, we are on pace to return more than $3 billion of cash to shareholders in the year, which, as a reminder, is approximately 3x our original commitment at the start of the year. 
Finally, I would like to discuss the financial impacts of the HPE Software, Micro Focus transaction. As Meg mentioned, the transaction is expected to deliver approximately $8.8 billion of enterprise value to HPE. This includes 50.1% of the equity in the newly formed company that will go to HPE shareholders, valued at approximately $6.3 billion based on Micro Focus's current stock price and receipt of a $2.5 billion payment of onshore cash to HPE. 
HPE Micro Focus also expect to improve the margins on HPE Software assets by approximately 20 points by the end of the third year, following the deal close, while investing in key growth areas like big data and security. As owners of 50.1% of the equity in the new merged company, HPE shareholders will share in the value of these operational improvements as well as future growth of earnings. We expect this transaction to close by the end of the second half of HPE's fiscal year 2017. 
To recognize this $8.8 billion of enterprise value and unlock a more attractive financial profile for HPE going forward, we will incur onetime separation cash payments of approximately $700 million with the vast majority occurring in fiscal year '17. Following that separation from ES and Software, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a faster-growing, higher-margin, stronger cash flow company for our shareholders. Just looking at fiscal year '16, revenue growth would be about 3 points greater; operating margins would be about 1 point higher at just over 10%; and free cash flow, as a percentage of revenue will be roughly 50% higher. 
It's also worth noting that we have roughly 30% of revenue recurring. But most importantly, more than 60% of profitability will be recurring that comes from TS and Financial Services. HPE will also have a very healthy balance sheet that currently sits at $5.3 billion in operating net cash. On top of that, we just closed the Mphasis deal, receiving approximately $825 million of before tax cash proceeds. We continue to see share repurchase as an excellent use of capital and similar to the H3C transaction, plan to buy back shares with the vast majority of the Mphasis proceeds. 
In fiscal year '17, our net cash position will also be further enhanced by over $1 billion from the cash and debt transfers with CSC and a $2.5 billion cash dividend from Micro Focus. We will continue to deliver shareholder value with these proceeds just as we've done this year by following our returns-based capital allocation approach. This approach is currently biased towards share repurchases, and we will provide more details on our fiscal year '17 capital return plans to shareholders at our upcoming Analyst Day. 
With all that in mind, we expect to finish fiscal year 2016 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.90 to $1.95, at the high end of our original outlook for the year. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $2.09 to $2.14. 
Before we open it up to questions, a quick reminder that we are holding our Annual Securities Analyst Meeting on October 18 in San Francisco, where we will provide additional P&L and cash flow details on the company as it stands today as well as a go-forward Hewlett Packard Enterprise, excluding ES and Software. 
Now let's open it up for questions."

So listen, we were -- we saw a softer market. But we've introduced our new StoreVirtual 3200, the MSA 2040 that brings the enterprise capabilities at a fantastic price to the entry market, and that has been a drag for us. We haven't had a great competitive offering in the entry market. And what you know about the storage market, it's moving from high end to entry very, very fast. So looking forward, I mean, listen, we think the market is going to continue to be soft. But -- and that will keep overall market, our growth muted.

And at that time, you talked about cash balance being an asset, and net acquisitions would be an integral part of the strategy. You also talked about HPE being a solutions company and a growth company. Less than a year later, it feels like a different story. Cash return has been the absolute priority. Acquisitions have been extremely minimal. Arguably, divesting software and services, which are essential ingredients to many solutions, seems different. And so I applaud the flexibility because the stock price has done extremely well and it's certainly been in the vein of value creation. But I was wondering if you could comment on what appeared to precipitate this change in thinking from I think an impression that seemed different to most from the roadshow a year ago. And is there a different end state for Hewlett Packard Enterprise going forward? I mean, is this really a viable ongoing hardware-centric company going forward? Or should we expect more portfolio rationalization? And believe it or not, I have a follow-up."

So Toni, let me take you all the way back to November 1 of 2015 where we separated HP Inc. from Hewlett Packard Enterprise. And we very much laid out the strategy of being a leading provider and a hybrid IT, both in the traditional data center, which by the way is still a robust market. It's 85% of the spend in IT today. And we are the leader there and we need to continue to gain share. And then we wanted to focus on software-defined infrastructure, which is really the next generation of infrastructure that our customers need. And then finally, build out our cloud platform and compute storage and networking at the edge. And that's exactly what we've done. And as we laid out that strategy, we looked at our portfolio. What do we need to add to the portfolio, either in acquisitions or partnerships. What do we need to divest because those assets are noncore to the strategy. It doesn't mean they're bad assets, it's just not -- they're not core to what we are doing. So if you take the ES transaction, listen, we are still going to be in the services business. In fact, 25% of the revenue of HPE will be services. It's just a different kind of services business than IT outsourcing, business process outsourcing and apps maintenance. If you think about software, we're still going to be in the software business. It's just not an application software like ITOM, it is systems software like OneView and the software that powers Synergy. So it is a portfolio matching to the strategy that we see our competitive advantage in. As far as -- I think you asked about further divestitures. So Enterprise Group, as currently configured, needs to stay together. And I'll tell you why. The -- my view of the market is everything is moving to converged, and we have a differentiated position because we have networking, storage and compute. And that is not -- our 2 major competitors are missing a key component of that offering. So that, we think, is important to keep together. And then as you think about Technology Services. Technology Services is a key differentiator for our company. We can help customers support, maintain, advise and consult across the globe, and it would be uneconomic to simply support storage only or networking only. So TS is absolutely integral. And then finally, obviously, campus, branch and edge is a new growth area for the company. There's no reason that we should not own compute at the edge. There's no reason that we shouldn't own analytics at the edge, in addition to, obviously, Aruba. So I think it's -- to some degree, the strategy has evolved but really, quite consistent with what we laid out. And a big part of what we did this past year was portfolio optimization for the strategy. So on a go-forward basis, I think -- as Tim said well, I think you can look for more ROI-based smart acquisitions like Aruba, like SGI. And so, I think it's entirely consistent with the strategy that we laid out a year ago."

Anytime you divest or acquire, particularly in this case, you say, ""Well, could I have done what others are going to do on my own?"" So what I mean by that is, I can't help thinking that HP Software business is going to be like 75% of Micro Focus going forward. You're far, far, far bigger than they are from a revenue perspective. And they believe, as a much smaller player, that they can improve operating margins 2,000 basis points. 2,000 basis points on your revenue basis, $750 million a year in operating profit, which add up a 10 multiple, $7.5 billion, if you haven't given up the business. So I guess the question is, if the margin improvement opportunities are so huge even for a relatively small player, why did you either not extract a better price or why you did you not believe that you could have extracted those and created even more value for shareholders?"
273983758,379420534,1042991,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 07, 2016",2016-09-07,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","So I think the first answer is, this is what Micro Focus does.

They are a pure play software company who is expert at managing mature software assets. And as Micro Focus will tell you, most people who work in the software business in Silicon Valley want to grow assets. And actually, some of these assets should actually be maintained on a stable platform that extends the value for customers. And it's actually not what we do, it is what they do. But then you come to the question of, why did we do a spin merge as opposed to sell the whole business. And the reason is, is because our shareholders will be able to ride the upside of what Micro Focus does. Remember our shareholders will own 50% of the new company. And by the way, I will be a shareholder of that new company, given my vested options and my vested RSUs in HPE, and I can tell you, I will be holding those shares because I think they're going to do very, very well. And so this was a much better alternative than selling the company today on a P/E multiple of operating income because you'd get cash, but you'd pay taxes, and then our shareholders wouldn't get to ride the upside unless they went out and took new money to buy those shares. So we thought that was absolutely the right thing to do. And I have to tell you, Toni, in today's world where technology is changing at lightning speed, I've got to tell you the value of focus, I'm seeing it every single day. And so while maybe back in the day, it was great to be a technology supermarket like the financial supermarkets of yesterday. What I'm pretty sure of is the next 4 or 5 years is going to be all about speed, agility and focus and innovation in something that is a more narrow focus."

But we still remain in the software business, it's just a different kind of software business. As I said, systems software. The software-defined infrastructure is all powered by software. But it's not applications software, if you will, like ITOM or ADM. It is actually systems software that powers the infrastructure of our customers. Now you say, all right, so how do we capitalize on the big data and analytics? Well, first of all, we will be the leader in high-performance compute with the acquisition of SGI. So companies need to process and compute huge amounts -- ever escalating amounts of data. So really, the high-performance compute market, which is an $11 billion business, growing at 68%, will really be between HPE, now with SGI, and Cray, but many of the other competitors like Dell, Lenovo, they are not in that high-performance compute business. So as people need financial services, energy, as they need to compute to process all this big data, if you will, we will be the leading player there. If you think about campus, branch and edge, I think this is the next big growth area. If you think about autonomous driving vehicles, jet engines, health care -- sensors in health care beds and in devices, this is an area where huge amounts of data needs to be processed real time, at the edge as opposed to enduring the latency of coming back to a major data center. So we're going to be able to capitalize on the IoT trend by big data -- by analytics at the edge and be able to compute and store at the edge. So that's the way we'll play in those trends. It will be different than like Vertica, which will go to Micro Focus, which is a big columnar database, that processes huge amounts of data on a database side, but we will pick up the ability to process on compute, storage and networking at the edge."

I give you a lot of credit because you're basically creating these very focused companies, whatever, Computer Sciences, it's called, and now Micro Focus, which I think does create a lot of shareholder value. But again, when all is said and done, you're becoming more and more a hardware company. And I would think your competitors ultimately are going to be primarily Cisco and Dell, and obviously, they'll use their large size against you and claim they've got AI capabilities and so forth. How do you see matching up against them when all is said and done? And are you going to have a relationship with Micro Focus that's kind of a favored nation like you appear to have with Computer Sciences go forward?"

And actually, beyond that, you saw what we announced today with SUSE where they'll be our preferred partner for Linux as well as the OpenStack distro. And listen, a lot of the software products that are going in the spin merge will be important to us going forward. So there will be a relationship there. So let me just give you a sense of, I think we're in a great position to compete with both Cisco and Dell. So for example, actually, the HPE go-forward strategy will be about a $28 billion company, that's only slightly smaller than Dell's Enterprise business and it is more focused with better innovation. I think we should just contrast our strategy with Dell. Okay, so we are getting smaller while they're getting bigger. And this is important because I believe speed and agility is critical in innovation and go-to-market. The second is they are levering up and we are delevering. We have $5.3 billion of net cash on the operating company and we're going to have a lot more by the time we're done with these transactions, and that gives us dry powder, it also gives us the ability to return cash to shareholders. And I think it's difficult to be levered as much as Dell is in this environment. And then secondly, we're leaning into new technology, either through our own innovation, acquisitions or partnerships, and we've got major focus on our side. What they're doing is doubling down on old technology in a cost take-out play. And listen, I think it might be quite successful for the leadership team there from a financial perspective, I'm not so sure it's good for customers."

So listen, Cisco is a good competitor, but they are missing a key element, which is storage. And as the -- as this converges, I think as the environment converges and we look at hyper-converged and on Synergy, we're innovating really nicely now for the traditional data center as well as the software-defined data center. And I got to tell you, Aruba at the edge is killing it, and a 20% growth rate above our internal plan, and we're just winning deals hand over fist there. So we feel really good about our ability to compete with Cisco. Okay, so back to servers. So listen, what's happening in servers is there is sort of core server growth; then there is Tier 1 servers, which is to the big service providers; and then is obviously, high-performance compute. And the reason we did the SGI acquisition is to really stake out a great position in an $11 billion business, as I said before, that's growing 68%, that's very profitable for the compute itself, but also, there's very high TS attached to high-performance compute. Core servers around the globe are under some pressure right now. But you saw what we did in terms of increasing the margin. And we are doubling down on SMB, which actually is still -- there's pockets of growth in that area. And we're also doing workload specialization. Okay, we have the best compute in the world to run SAP HANA. It's not even close with anyone else. So we're specializing around workloads. And then obviously, there was a tough compare because of Cloudline a year ago. I mean, we have just ramped that business into a multibillion dollar business. And so it's hard to compete with those compares, but we expect to continue to gain share in that market profitably. We're not in it for share -- for share's sake. We don't want to take unprofitable deals. But as we continue to work on our supply chain and the rationalization, we become evermore competitive there. And we're very mindful that ultimately there is Chinese competitors there as well. And whether that's Huawei or Lenovo, it's not just Dell. So we're very aware of the cost structure we have to have to continue to compete."

And when Business Critical Systems, both from a market perspective as well as the Oracle Itanium situation, by all rights, TS should be down 25%. If you remember Shannon, over the last 4 or 5 years, BCS was down 25% like clockwork, every single quarter for 4 years. It's growing a little bit now. But by all of rights, TS should have shrunk with BCS, and it did not. And the reason it did not was very impressive new product offering, Proactive Care, other areas where we help customers maintain their data center estate. And so the fact that it has actually only been done a few percentage points over the last 12 months is a testament to the leadership team in that business. And now what you're seeing is those new product offerings are starting to get real traction. Orders have been positive for the last 3 or 4 quarters, and those orders translated into growth this quarter. Not a significant amount of growth, but 1%, we'll take it all day long, because it is a very, very profitable business. So we have more work to do on Technology Services.

And obviously, we need to be very aggressive around what we call stranded cost. So I think the good news is when you look at the HPE/HPI separation, we did have some dissynergies, we call them. We have worked those through the system. With the H3C divestiture, we've gotten much better with identifying the stranded cost, we're being much more proactive in managing them out.

Now we are starting to do things differently, because you can only take out so much cost. There's only so much low-hanging fruit, you have to do things differently. And whether that is supply chain and logistics. Whether that is how we are organized internally with all R&D under one R&D leader, whether it is putting our software-defined infrastructure and our cloud offering under one leader, whether it is putting all of our go-to-market under one leader where we have consistent go-to-market strategy, discounting across the board. Frankly, we were much better at minimizing discounting in APJ and EMEA than we were in the United States, we now have that discipline across the company. And then finally, corporate overhead, we've got to have a corporate overhead that is designed for a $28 billion company. And when we started, we had a corporate overhead designed for a $110 billion company, and then a $50 billion company, and now a $28 billion company. And I have to say, I'm really pleased with our ability to sort of rightsize the corporate overhead and be lean and mean. And that includes everything from HR, finance, legal, IT, things like real estate, systems. So we've made a lot of progress, but you'll see more of that benefit, I think, in '17 and '18."

If I remember from the press release, I think it was about $700 million. Is that correct? And how should we think about the timing of that? And is that kind of all-in cost? And I kind of also take it relative to say the divestiture of the services, which was $900 million. And while $900 million is $200 million more than $700 million, it seems like to me that the services was a much bigger, heavier-lifting divestiture. So -- and I almost wonder, is $700 million kind of -- why is it so much and not much lower? Or is it just so much integrated in Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, that's why it costs so much to break out?"

Again, we feel like the value that, that transaction is driving is phenomenal for HPE as well as its shareholders. However, to realize that value, we need to make investments and allocate resources to do the separation. So to your point, software, although the activities are similar in nature to the transaction in ES, they are discrete. And they're not necessarily driven by revenue base or headcount level. So when you look at software, it's a global complex business. It has multiple legal entities that had been accumulated over time through a series of transactions. And because of that, when you look at the tax, the finance, the legal and the operating structure, it is still very, very complicated. So in order to separate that, there are some large expense items in there. For example, separating 650 IT systems, doing the carve-out financials, translating GAAP to IFRS, splitting 150 legal entities in 60 countries, trying to figure out what we want to do with 200 real estate sites across the globe. So there's certainly a lot of work that needs to be done there. The good news is we have done this before, so we know how to do it. The team has been very proactive and we're all over it. We have the work streams identified. So we're confident we'll get there when we go forward."

Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the press releases and the slide presentations accompanying today's earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations web page at investors.hpe.com.
As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings and transaction materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HPE's SEC reports, including its most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. 
We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2016. Finally, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. 
Throughout this conference call, all revenue growth rates presented, beginning with fiscal year 2015, are adjusted to exclude the impact of divestitures and currency. We believe this approach helps provide a better representation of HPE's operational performance given the significant divestitures we've recently completed, including the sale of 51% of our H3C business in China and TippingPoint, amongst several others. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our website for details. 
With that, let me turn it over to Meg."
273983758,379420534,1043011,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 07, 2016",2016-09-07,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thanks, Andy. And thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. Let me start by saying I'm pleased with the progress we made in Q3. Overall, we had a strong quarter.

Let me start by saying I'm pleased with the progress we made in Q3. Overall, we had a strong quarter. While revenue was down slightly on an operational basis, we saw several areas of growth in key parts of our portfolio, including networking, all-flash storage, high-performance compute and Technology Services. 
Profitability was very encouraging as we continue to deliver margin improvements in Enterprise Services and focus on profitable deals in the Enterprise Group. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.49, which even before the impact of a favorable tax rate, was at the high end of our previously guided range. Free cash flow also improved to $1 billion through diligent working capital management, and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders primarily through share repurchases. 
Tim will provide further color on the quarter, but I would like to take the bulk of my time to discuss today's spin merge announcement and put it in the context of the strategy we've been executing against for the past several years. 
Last November, we launched the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise with the vision to become the industry's leading provider of hybrid IT with the secure next-generation software-defined infrastructure that will run our customers' data centers today, bridge them to multi-cloud environments tomorrow and enable the emerging intelligent edge that will power campus, branch and IoT applications for decades to come. 
We believe this is what our customers are looking for and what we are best qualified to do. And most importantly, achieving this vision will create a faster-growing, higher-margin, stronger free cash flow company for our shareholders. To realize our vision, we looked at our portfolio and our product roadmaps to determine gaps that we needed to fill and then evaluated how best to do so. Some we fill through increased R&D like the investment in our recently launched HC 380 Hyper Converged product. In other areas, we pursue innovative partnerships like the ones recently announced with Docker and Mesosphere. And in some cases, acquisitions make sense like Aruba and SGI. 
Next, we identified areas of the business that were not aligned with our go-forward strategy. Here, we have looked at how to best maximize shareholder value with these assets. We've already made a number of decisions, including the sale of TippingPoint, the H3C deal in China, and of course, the spin merge of our Enterprise Services business with CSC. 
And today, we announced plans for a spin-off and merger of our noncore software assets with Micro Focus. These assets include our application delivery management, Big Data, enterprise security, information management and governance, and IT operations management businesses. This transaction is valued at about $8.8 billion, including a 50.1% ownership of the new combined company by HPE shareholders, which is currently valued at $6.3 billion, and a $2.5 billion cash payment to HPE. 
The combined company will be led by Kevin Loosemore, current Micro Focus Executive Chairman; and Mike Phillips will serve as Chief Financial Officer. After the transaction closes, Micro Focus's Board of Directors will include an HPE senior executive and HPE independent directors on the board. 
The new combined company is expected to have annual revenues of approximately $4.5 billion with strong recurring revenue streams. The company will be well diversified across product lines and geographies. It will also have a stronger go-to-market capability with nearly 4,000 sales people worldwide and deep R&D resources to deliver best-in-class solutions to customers and partners. Micro Focus's approach to managing both growing and mature software assets will ensure higher levels of investment in growth areas like Big Data analytics and security, while maintaining a stable platform for mission-critical software products that customers rely on. 
For employees, Micro Focus's approach will mean each product line will have a clear and important role in the overall company performance, and employees will have a high level of clarity on the strategy for their organization. It also means employees will get to work on long-term customer-focused projects and the software technology that they love. We believe the software assets that will be a part of the spin-merge will bring better value to our customers, employees and shareholders as part of a more focused software company, committed to growing these businesses on a stand-alone basis. 
With this announcement, Robert Youngjohns, the current head of our Software business, will assume the role of Executive Vice President, Strategic Business Development, reporting to me. In this new role, Robert will partner with other members of the leadership team to drive strategic customer and partner initiatives focused on growing key parts of the business. With Robert taking on this new role, Chris Hsu, our Chief Operating Officer, will lead the Software business, effective immediately in addition to his current responsibilities. Chris's track record of driving strong performance and understanding market dynamics at HPE and throughout his career make him a great fit for this role. 
To be clear, both software and services are still key enablers of HPE's go-forward strategy. Our newly created software-defined and cloud business will build upon key software assets like OneView and the Helion cloud platform to deliver software-defined, hybrid IT solutions like Synergy, HPE's composable infrastructure offering that enables customers to operate their workloads with unprecedented speed and agility. And in Services, we continue to have a world-class capability in our Technology Services group, which will represent about 25% of HPE's revenue following the 2 spins that we've announced. 
ES's 22,000 service professionals build solutions from the ground up with the consulting and support our customers need to transform their environments and take advantage of opportunities in emerging areas like campus, branch and IoT. Once the ES, CSC and the software Micro Focus transactions are complete, HPE will be an even stronger company, well positioned for the future. 
With approximately $28 billion in annual revenue, the future HPE will have significant scale, a diversified world-class portfolio and a global footprint to meet the evolving needs of our customers and partners. We will be a market leader both in the data center and on the edge with our world-class portfolio of software-defined servers, storage, networking and converged infrastructure. 
We will also have strong recurring revenue streams that account for approximately 60% of our operating profit and will have an improved free cash flow profile. Given our experience with divestitures, we are confident in our ability to execute. And more importantly, that we are making the right choices to set both HPE and our customers up for the long term while delivering maximum shareholder value. 
The market is already recognizing what we are doing. With these strategic moves and our continued strong operational performance, HPE's market cap has increased by over $10 billion or 40% since the separation from HPI on November 1, 2015. 
In addition to the portfolio changes, we also made important leadership and organizational changes this quarter that will make our business stronger and more efficient. For example, we've started the process of rightsizing our corporate functions for the more focused, stand-alone HPE. In addition, the Enterprise Group businesses have been simplified and streamlined to better address market opportunities, improve cost structure, accelerate innovation and strengthen our competitiveness. 
Furthermore, all business unit and corporate marketing efforts will be consolidated under our global marketing function, and all sales will be under a single global leader. Finally, we announced that Hewlett Packard Labs would move into the Enterprise Group, which will better align our research and go-to-market efforts. 
While there is more work to do, we are already seeing that our strategy is working. As a more focused organization, we've been better able to allocate resources more effectively and introduce truly best-in-class solutions. 
For example, as I mentioned earlier, we announced plans to acquire SGI. High-performance compute and Big Data analytics are exciting areas for us as customers are increasingly looking for ways to gain deeper, more contextural insights from the ever-expanding volumes of data. Industries like financial services, semiconductors and energy are all increasing their HPC investments. In Q3, we won several significant automotive deals where high-performance compute is used for electronic prototype designs, improving fuel economy and improving crashworthiness. The SGI acquisition will further strengthen our position in the $11 billion HPC segment as well as the high-growth data analytics segment. 
In storage, we extended our leadership in the all-flash data center with enhancements to HPE 3PAR and also introduced next-generation software-defined storage to enable a composable data fabric. We also brought enterprise capabilities to the entry storage market with the introduction of StoreVirtual 3200 and MSA 240. 
We announced HPE OneView 3.0 to provide software-defined intelligence across HPE's family of infrastructure solutions. To date, we've sold over 500,000 HPE OneView licenses across a variety of key verticals such as health care, industrial and financial services; and we have a growing partner ecosystem including Docker, Chef, Turbonomic and SaltStack. We unveiled the industry's first converged systems for the Internet of Things, the HPE Edgeline 1000 and 4000, which will enable real-time decision-making and deliver heavy-duty analytics at the edge by integrating data capture, control, compute and storage. 
We also announced updates to the HPE Helion cloud portfolio, including HPE Helion Cloud Suite, a new software suite enabling customers to manage their full spectrum of applications across infrastructure environments. And HPE Helion CloudSystem 10, a hardware and software solution to build and deploy an enterprise-grade private cloud environment. But most of all, we are winning with our customers and partners. 
Aruba continues to win customers and drive growth with its industry-leading technology. For example, we helped Rio's airport handle the massive surge of travelers passing through for the Olympics this summer, and Home Depot and Best Buy are currently implementing Aruba wireless solutions to provide a better in-store experience for customers and employees. 
Keep in mind, deals like this have great TS pull-through as well. At Discover in June, we announced a new partnership with GE Digital that will enable industrial analytics from the edge to the cloud. HPE will be a preferred storage and server infrastructure provider for GE's Predix cloud technologies, and the Predix platform will be a preferred software solution for HPE's industrial-related use cases and opportunities. HPE was also instrumental in helping Dropbox transform to a hybrid infrastructure to help it meet the growing demands of its users. Dropbox moved the majority of its cloud storage business away from AWS to an on-premise data center, using HPE ProLiant and Cloudline servers all financed by HPE Financial Services. 
We also announced a groundbreaking strategic alliance with Docker to help customers transform and modernize their data centers to benefit from a more agile development environment. At the heart of this alliance is HPE's Docker-ready server program, unique to the server industry, which ensures HPE servers are bundled with the Docker engine and support. And today, we announced plans for a commercial partnership with Micro Focus that will name SUSE as HPE's preferred Linux partner and will bring together HPE's Helion OpenStack and Stackato solutions with SUSE's OpenStack expertise to provide best-in-class, enterprise-grade, hybrid cloud offerings for HPE customers. 
So in summary, I'm pleased with the progress we've made this quarter. And I'm just as pleased with the execution of our strategies since we separated from HPI. I'm also excited about the opportunities we've created for shareholders in the spin-mergers of ES and CSC, and our software assets with Micro Focus. We are setting up HPE for long-term success, while unlocking the kind of value we believe our shareholders appreciate.
On that note, I will hand the call over to Tim."
273983758,379420534,1043011,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 07, 2016",2016-09-07,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thanks, Meg. Overall, we performed well in the quarter. While revenue of $12.2 billion, down less than 1%, was not quite as strong as last quarter, margins were up as we focus on profitable market share. We also executed well considering we faced difficul",1927,"Thanks, Meg. Overall, we performed well in the quarter. While revenue of $12.2 billion, down less than 1%, was not quite as strong as last quarter, margins were up as we focus on profitable market share. We also executed well considering we faced difficult compares across the portfolio and an uneven global demand environment. 
As we indicated last quarter, compares became more challenging as we're no longer benefiting from the large Deutsche Bank deal we signed in ES last year; and in EG, we are lapping the compares from Aruba and the ramp of Cloudline servers. From a macro perspective, we did see weakness in Europe, particularly in ES from a slowing in the U.K. public sector business and also in Japan, in the Enterprise Group. The Q3 currency impact to revenue was a headwind of 210 basis points year-over-year that we expect to moderate further. 
We did have several areas of solid growth across the portfolio, including networking, up 12%; all-flash arrays, up 70%; high-performance compute, up 12%; and our highest margin business, Technology Services, returned to growth for the first time since the second quarter of 2012. 
To improve growth in the overall portfolio, we're continuing to make investments in our higher growth businesses around software-defined, converged and hyper converged while we continue to enhance our go-to-market efforts that we expect will improve growth going forward. Overall, we are still on track to deliver what we said we would do at the beginning of the year by growing total fiscal year '16 revenue adjusted for divestitures and currency. 
Gross margin of 29.3% was up 60 basis points, both year-over-year and sequentially. This was principally due to continued improvements in Enterprise Services and Enterprise Group to a lesser extent. Non-GAAP operating profit of 8.8% was up 30 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.49 was above our outlook of $0.42 to $0.46 that was primarily the result of tax benefits realized in the recent divestitures equating to approximately $0.04 per share. 
Non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pretax amounts for the gain on divestiture of H3C of $2.2 billion, restructuring charges of $369 million, amortization of intangible assets of $210 million, and separation charges of $135 million. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.32, above our previously provided outlook range of $1.10 to $1.14, primarily due to a higher-than-expected gain on the H3C divestiture, lower separation costs and the previously mentioned tax benefit. 
Now turning to the results by business. In Enterprise Group, revenue was flat as we focused on profitability and delivered encouraging improvements in operating margins, which while flat year-over-year, were up 90 basis points sequentially to 12.6%. The sequential improvement was primarily due to lower discounting, better server option attach, favorable mix and operational cost improvements as we rightsized the organization ahead of the separation from Enterprise Services and Software. 
Server revenue declined 2% as solid growth in Tier 1 and high-performance compute was offset by pressures in core servers. Within the core, we did have some market coverage issues that we're addressing through recent sales leadership and go-to-market changes with an emphasis on SMB. We also doubled down in the fast-growing, high-performance compute market with the acquisition of SGI and continue to invest in workload optimized solutions like SAP HANA. 
From a margin standpoint, the team did a nice job prioritizing profitability over share for share's sake, expanding margins year-over-year. We also anticipate we held server share in the second calendar quarter overall and gained share in the Americas, density optimized and Tier 1. 
Storage revenue declined 5% with continued declines in the legacy portfolio, more than offsetting growth in Converged Storage at 1%, that was impacted by a softer-than-expected market. Margins increased year-over-year, driven by favorable converged mix and improved pricing in all-flash. 3PAR plus XT plus EVA was up 5%, and all-flash 3PAR revenue continues to drive the portfolio, growing 70% at record revenue levels. Despite a challenging market, we estimate we gained share in the second calendar quarter, our 11th consecutive quarter of share gains. And we continue to expect storage to gain share through the remainder of the year. 
Networking revenue grew 12% and encouragingly, Aruba growth has accelerated, growing 20% and is exceeding our internal plan. We again saw a growth across all regions as we continue to see the benefits of the combined Aruba, HPE portfolio. Margins improved year-over-year, driven by both a better mix and higher margin rates of Aruba. 
TS returned to growth for the first time since the second quarter of 2012. Revenue was up 1% as the strong order growth from fiscal year '15 becomes a larger portion of the portfolio and revenue grew in both Support and Consulting. And while orders were flat, we saw encouraging performance in non-attach and proactive services that are growing at double-digit rates and becoming a larger mix of the total portfolio. 
We continue to improve service intensity, our attach dollars per unit, which is helping to offset increased Tier 1 mix and higher server ASPs. Enterprise Services revenue declined 3% as growth in the Americas and APJ was more than offset by weakness in EMEA, resulting from a pause in U.K. public sector spending and a tough compare with the Deutsche Bank deal in the prior year. 
Operating profit improved 260 basis points year-over-year to 8.3%, the highest since the second quarter of 2011 as the team continues to execute on productivity improvements in delivery and sales. We also benefited from improving location mix and new deal profitability. 
Progress made on cost improvements, sales strength and normal quarterly seasonality provides us with continued confidence that operating margins for the full year will be approximately 7%, at the high end of our original outlook. Revenue is still expected to be down 2% to flat in constant currency even with the Mphasis divestiture. We continue to track against our longer-team goal of 60% headcount in low-cost locations and completed the quarter with 49% of our headcount in low-cost centers, a 6-point improvement since the beginning of the fiscal year. 
Software revenue declined 3% as strength in security and Big Data was offset by declines in IT management. SaaS had a record quarter with 17% revenue growth. The team continues to focus on disciplined cost controls, decreasing OpEx 16% year-over-year. However, revenue declines ultimately outpaced operating improvements causing a 270-basis-point decline in operating margins to 17.8%. 
HPE Financial Services revenue grew 2% and delivered the first quarter of as-reported revenue growth since the first quarter of 2013. Operating profit declined 90 basis points year-over-year to 9.9% as lower residual sales from weaker volume in prior years pressured margin rates. 
Financing volume declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency on a tough compare that saw Deutsche Bank sale leaseback volume in the third quarter of 2015. 
Return on equity was down 190 basis points year-over-year to 13.3% and was similarly pressured by lower residual sales resulting from lower volumes in fiscal year '13 and fiscal year '14. 
Cash flow generation was strong in the quarter as we continue to optimize working capital management. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion, up 10% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Free cash flow was $971 million, up 15% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. When adjusted for the sale of Mphasis, the cash conversion cycle was 19 days, down 5 days, sequentially. Receivables were the largest contributor to working capital improvement due to favorable payment term mix and reductions to aged receivables. Going forward, we expect the cash conversion cycle to be in the mid-teens with fiscal year '16 free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. 
Turning to capital allocation. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.5 billion of stock through an accelerated share repurchase program, and we paid $91 million as part of our normal dividend. Year-to-date, we have returned $2.9 billion of capital to shareholders, primarily through $2.7 billion of share repurchases. With our free cash flow generation and the recent divestitures, we are on pace to return more than $3 billion of cash to shareholders in the year, which, as a reminder, is approximately 3x our original commitment at the start of the year. 
Finally, I would like to discuss the financial impacts of the HPE Software, Micro Focus transaction. As Meg mentioned, the transaction is expected to deliver approximately $8.8 billion of enterprise value to HPE. This includes 50.1% of the equity in the newly formed company that will go to HPE shareholders, valued at approximately $6.3 billion based on Micro Focus's current stock price and receipt of a $2.5 billion payment of onshore cash to HPE. 
HPE and Micro Focus also expect to improve the margins on HPE Software assets by approximately 20 points by the end of the third year following the deal close, while investing in key growth areas like Big Data and security. As owners of 50.1% of the equity in the new merged company, HPE shareholders will share in the value of these operational improvements as well as future growth of earnings. We expect this transaction to close by the end of the second half of HPE's fiscal year 2017. 
To recognize this $8.8 billion of enterprise value and unlock a more attractive financial profile for HPE going forward, we will incur onetime separation cash payments of approximately $700 million with the vast majority occurring in fiscal year '17. Following that separation from ES and Software, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a faster-growing, higher-margin, stronger cash flow company for our shareholders. Just looking at fiscal year '16, revenue growth would be about 3 points greater; operating margins would be about 1 point higher at just over 10%; and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue would be roughly 50% higher. 
It's also worth noting that we have roughly 30% of revenue recurring. But most importantly, more than 60% of profitability will be recurring that comes from TS and Financial Services. HPE will also have a very healthy balance sheet that currently sits at $5.3 billion in operating net cash. On top of that, we just closed the Mphasis deal, receiving approximately $825 million of before tax cash proceeds. We continue to see share repurchase as an excellent use of capital and similar to the H3C transaction, plan to buy back shares with the vast majority of the Mphasis proceeds. 
In fiscal year '17, our net cash position will also be further enhanced by over $1 billion from the cash and debt transfers with CSC and a $2.5 billion cash dividend from Micro Focus. We will continue to deliver shareholder value with these proceeds just as we've done this year by following our returns-based capital allocation approach. This approach is currently biased towards share repurchases, and we will provide more details on our fiscal year '17 capital return plans to shareholders at our upcoming Analyst Day. 
With all that in mind, we expect to finish fiscal year 2016 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.90 to $1.95, at the high end of our original outlook for the year. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $2.09 to $2.14. 
Before we open it up to questions, a quick reminder that we are holding our Annual Securities Analyst Meeting on October 18 in San Francisco, where we will provide additional P&L and cash flow details on the company as it stands today as well as a go-forward Hewlett Packard Enterprise, excluding ES and Software. 
Now let's open it up for questions."

So listen, we were -- we saw a softer market. But we've introduced our new StoreVirtual 3200, the MSA 2040 that brings the enterprise capabilities at a fantastic price to the entry market, and that has been a drag for us. We haven't had a great competitive offering in the entry market. And what you know about the storage market, it's moving from high end to entry very, very fast. So looking forward, I mean, listen, we think the market is going to continue to be soft. But -- and that will keep overall market, our growth muted. But we can continue to gain share, and we are very pleased with our HPE 3PAR all-flash performance that grew 70% year-over-year. So some work to do there, but we feel good about where we are.

Unfortunately, there aren't that many deals like that, but when they come along, we'll do them."

And at that time, you talked about cash balance being an asset, and net acquisitions would be an integral part of the strategy. You also talked about HPE being a solutions company and a growth company. Less than a year later, it feels like a different story. Cash return has been the absolute priority. Acquisitions have been extremely minimal. Arguably, divesting software and services, which are essential ingredients to many solutions, seems different. And so I applaud the flexibility because the stock price has done extremely well and it's certainly been in the vein of value creation. But I was wondering if you could comment on what appeared to precipitate this change in thinking from I think an impression that seemed different to most from the roadshow a year ago. And is there a different end state for Hewlett Packard Enterprise going forward? I mean, is this really a viable ongoing hardware-centric company going forward? Or should we expect more portfolio rationalization? And believe it or not, I have a follow-up."

So Toni, let me take you all the way back to November 1, 2015 where we separated HP Inc. from Hewlett Packard Enterprise. And we very much laid out the strategy of being a leading provider and a hybrid IT, both in the traditional data center, which by the way is still a robust market. It's 85% of the spend in IT today. And we are the leader there and we need to continue to gain share. And then we wanted to focus on software-defined infrastructure, which is really the next generation of infrastructure that our customers need. And then finally, build out our cloud platform and compute storage and networking at the edge. And that's exactly what we've done. And as we laid out that strategy, we looked at our portfolio. What do we need to add to the portfolio, either in acquisitions or partnerships? What do we need to divest because those assets are noncore to the strategy? It doesn't mean they're bad assets, it's just not -- they're not core to what we are doing. So if you take the ES transaction, listen, we are still going to be in the services business. In fact, 25% of the revenue of HPE will be services. It's just a different kind of services business than IT outsourcing, business process outsourcing and apps maintenance. If you think about software, we're still going to be in the software business. It's just not in application software like ITOM, it is systems software like OneView and the software that powers Synergy. So it is a portfolio matching to the strategy that we see our competitive advantage in. As far as -- I think you asked about further divestitures. So Enterprise Group, as currently configured, needs to stay together. And I'll tell you why. The -- my view of the market is everything is moving to converged, and we have a differentiated position because we have networking, storage and compute. And that is not -- our 2 major competitors are missing a key component of that offering. So that, we think, is important to keep together. And then as you think about Technology Services. Technology Services is a key differentiator for our company. We can help customers support, maintain, advise and consult across the globe, and it would be uneconomic to simply support storage only or networking only. So TS is absolutely integral. And then finally, obviously, campus, branch and edge is a new growth area for the company. There's no reason that we should not own compute at the edge. There's no reason that we shouldn't own analytics at the edge, in addition to, obviously, Aruba. So I think it's -- to some degree, the strategy has evolved but really, quite consistent with what we laid out. And a big part of what we did this past year was portfolio optimization for the strategy. So on a go-forward basis, I think -- as Tim said well, I think you can look for more ROI-based smart acquisitions like Aruba, like SGI. And so, I think it's entirely consistent with the strategy that we laid out a year ago."

Anytime you divest or acquire, particularly in this case, you say, ""Well, could I have done what others are going to do on my own?"" So what I mean by that is, I can't help thinking that HP Software business is going to be like 75% of Micro Focus going forward. You're far, far, far bigger than they are from a revenue perspective. And they believe, as a much smaller player, that they can improve operating margins 2,000 basis points. 2,000 basis points on your revenue basis is $750 million a year in operating profit, which add up a 10-multiple, $7.5 billion, even if you haven't given up the business. So I guess the question is, if the margin improvement opportunities are so huge even for a relatively small player, why did you either not extract a better price or why did you not believe that you could have extracted those and created even more value for shareholders?"

They are a pure play software company who is expert at managing mature software assets. And as Micro Focus will tell you, most people who work in the software business in Silicon Valley want to grow assets. And actually, some of these assets should actually be maintained on a stable platform that extends the value for customers. And it's actually not what we do, it is what they do. But then you come to the question of, why did we do a spin merge as opposed to sell the whole business. And the reason is, is because our shareholders will be able to ride the upside of what Micro Focus does. Remember our shareholders will own 50% of the new company. And by the way, I will be a shareholder of that new company, given my vested options and my vested RSUs in HPE, and I can tell you, I will be holding those shares because I think they're going to do very, very well. And so this was a much better alternative than selling the company today on a P/E multiple of operating income because you'd get cash, but you'd pay taxes, and then our shareholders wouldn't get to ride the upside unless they went out and took new money to buy those shares. So we thought that was absolutely the right thing to do. And I have to tell you, Toni, in today's world where technology is changing at lightning speed, I've got to tell you the value of focus, I'm seeing it every single day. And so while maybe back in the day, it was great to be a technology supermarket like the financial supermarkets of yesterday. What I'm pretty sure of is the next 4 or 5 years is going to be all about speed, agility and focus and innovation in something that is a more narrow focus."

But we still remain in the software business, it's just a different kind of software business. As I said, systems software. The software-defined infrastructure is all powered by software. But it's not applications software, if you will, like ITOM or ADM. It is actually systems software that powers the infrastructure of our customers. Now you say, all right, so how do we capitalize on the Big Data and analytics? Well, first of all, we will be the leader in high-performance compute with the acquisition of SGI. So companies need to process and compute huge amounts -- ever escalating amounts of data. So really, the high-performance compute market, which is an $11 billion business, growing at 68%, will really be between HPE, now with SGI, and Cray, but many of the other competitors like Dell, Lenovo, they are not in that high-performance compute business. So as people need financial services, energy, as they need to compute to process all this Big Data, if you will, we will be the leading player there. If you think about campus, branch and edge, I think this is the next big growth area. If you think about autonomous driving vehicles, jet engines, health care -- sensors in health care beds and in devices, this is an area where huge amounts of data needs to be processed real time, at the edge as opposed to enduring the latency of coming back to a major data center. So we're going to be able to capitalize on the IoT trend by Big Data -- by analytics at the edge and be able to compute and store at the edge. So that's the way we'll play in those trends. It will be different than like Vertica, which will go to Micro Focus, which is a big columnar database that processes huge amounts of data on a database side, but we will pick up the ability to process on compute, storage and networking at the edge."

And actually, beyond that, you saw what we announced today with SUSE where they'll be our preferred partner for Linux as well as the OpenStack distro. And listen, a lot of the software products that are going in the spin merge will be important to us going forward. So there will be a relationship there. So let me just give you a sense of, I think we're in a great position to compete with both Cisco and Dell. So for example, actually, the HPE go-forward strategy will be about a $28 billion company that's only slightly smaller than Dell's Enterprise business and it is more focused with better innovation. I think we should just contrast our strategy with Dell. Okay, so we are getting smaller while they're getting bigger. And this is important because I believe speed and agility is critical in innovation and go-to-market. The second is they are levering up and we are delevering. We have $5.3 billion of net cash on the operating company and we're going to have a lot more by the time we're done with these transactions, and that gives us dry powder, it also gives us the ability to return cash to shareholders. And I think it's difficult to be levered as much as Dell is in this environment. And then secondly, we're leaning into new technology, either through our own innovation, acquisitions or partnerships, and we've got major focus on our side. What they're doing is doubling down on old technology in a cost take-out play. And listen, I think it might be quite successful for the leadership team there from a financial perspective. I'm not so sure it's good for customers."

So listen, Cisco is a good competitor, but they are missing a key element, which is storage. And as the -- as this converges, I think as the environment converges and we look at hyper-converged and on Synergy, we're innovating really nicely now for the traditional data center as well as the software-defined data center. And I got to tell you, Aruba at the edge is killing it, and a 20% growth rate above our internal plan, and we're just winning deals hand over fist there. So we feel really good about our ability to compete with Cisco. Okay, so back to servers. So listen, what's happening in servers is there is sort of core server growth; then there is Tier 1 servers, which is to the big service providers; and then is obviously, high-performance compute. And the reason we did the SGI acquisition is to really stake out a great position in an $11 billion business, as I said before, that's growing 68%, that's very profitable for the compute itself, but also, there's very high TS attached to high-performance compute. Core servers around the globe are under some pressure right now. But you saw what we did in terms of increasing the margin. And we are doubling down on SMB, which actually is still -- there's pockets of growth in that area. And we're also doing workload specialization. Okay, we have the best compute in the world to run SAP HANA. It's not even close with anyone else. So we're specializing around workloads. And then obviously, there was a tough compare because of Cloudline a year ago. I mean, we have just ramped that business into a multibillion-dollar business. And so it's hard to compete with those compares, but we expect to continue to gain share in that market profitably. We're not in it for share -- for share's sake. We don't want to take unprofitable deals. But as we continue to work on our supply chain and the rationalization, we become ever more competitive there. And we're very mindful that ultimately there is Chinese competitors there as well. And whether that's Huawei or Lenovo, it's not just Dell. So we're very aware of the cost structure we have to have to continue to compete."

When you -- when we separate the Software business and you look at the remaining piece of HPE, we're going to be -- if you were to extract ES in Software from our 2016 financials, to Meg's earlier comments, revenue growth would be an incremental 300 basis points, margins would be up an incremental 100 basis points just north of 10% and free cash flow as a percent of revenue would be up 50%. If you look at the absolute free cash flow, it would be relatively neutral, driven by the fact that software does generate some free cash flow, but that's offset by the pressure in ES.

It was almost like they took a pause and basically, had to sort of take stock of what was happening and then basically the orders have started to flow again. I mean, we continue to also monitor the pricing -- competitive pricing environment that we see and we adjust as necessary, particularly in the channel.

TS is and was a very profitable business that was largely attached to Business Critical Systems, very profitable, very high attach -- I mean, you didn't really sell Business Critical Systems without a TS attach. And when Business Critical Systems, both from a market perspective as well as the Oracle Itanium situation, by all rights, TS should be down 25%. Do you remember, Shannon, over the last 4 or 5 years, BCS was down 25% like clockwork, every single quarter for 4 years. It's growing a little bit now. But by all rights, TS should have shrunk with BCS, and it did not. And the reason it did not was very impressive new product offering, Proactive Care, other areas where we help customers maintain their data center estate. And so the fact that it has actually only been down a few percentage points over the last 12 months is a testament to the leadership team in that business. And now what you're seeing is those new product offerings are starting to get real traction. Orders have been positive for the last 3 or 4 quarters, and those orders translated into growth this quarter. Not a significant amount of growth, but 1%, we'll take it all day long, because it is a very, very profitable business. So we have more work to do on Technology Services. I will tell you, it is the benefit of now being a smaller, more focused company. Antonio Neri and I are going to spend a whole lot of time now on what is the next generation of Technology Services and whether that's Flexible Capacity services that allows consumption-based model, where there is proactive care, data center care, we're going to spend a lot of time there because it is a key strategic enabler of RemainCo HPE."

So we're getting closer to those benchmarks. We're not quite there yet, but we are close and we are there in some of the functions. So as we have done these divestitures or as we're doing these divestitures, we obviously incorporate that into what the new cost structure needs to look like. And obviously, we need to be very aggressive around what we call stranded cost. So I think the good news is when you look at the HPE/HPI separation, we did have some dissynergies, we called them. We have worked those through the system. With the H3C divestiture, we've gotten much better with identifying the stranded cost, we're being much more proactive in managing them out. We're starting to see those come out. So we're confident that we can continue to do that to get to the benchmarks we need to get to when these transactions are done."

And whether that is supply chain and logistics. Whether that is how we are organized internally with all R&D under one R&D leader, whether it is putting our software-defined infrastructure and our cloud offering under one leader, whether it is putting all of our go-to-market under one leader where we have consistent go-to-market strategy, discounting across the board. Frankly, we were much better at minimizing discounting in APJ and EMEA than we were in the United States; we now have that discipline across the company. And then finally, corporate overhead, we've got to have a corporate overhead that is designed for a $28 billion company. And when we started, we had a corporate overhead designed for a $110 billion company, and then a $50 billion company, and now a $28 billion company. And I have to say, I'm really pleased with our ability to sort of right-size the corporate overhead and be lean and mean.

So -- and I almost wonder, is $700 million kind of -- why is it so much and not much lower? Or is it just so much integrated in Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, that's why it costs so much to break out?"

Again, we feel like the value that, that transaction is driving is phenomenal for HPE as well as its shareholders. However, to realize that value, we need to make investments and allocate resources to do the separation. So to your point, software, although the activities are similar in nature to the transaction in ES, they are discrete. And they're not necessarily driven by revenue base or headcount level. So when you look at software, it's a global complex business. It has multiple legal entities that had been accumulated over time through a series of transactions. And because of that, when you look at the tax, the finance, the legal and the operating structure, it is still very, very complicated. So in order to separate that, there are some large expense items in there. For example, separating 650 IT systems, doing the carve-out financials, translating GAAP to IFRS, splitting 150 legal entities in 60 countries, trying to figure out what we want to do with 200 real estate sites across the globe. So there's certainly a lot of work that needs to be done there. The good news is we have done this before, so we know how to do it. The team has been very proactive and we're all over it.

Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the press releases and the slide presentations accompanying today's earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations web page at investors.hpe.com.
As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings and transaction materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HPE's SEC reports, including its most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. 
We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2016. Finally, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. 
Throughout this conference call, all revenue growth rates presented, beginning with fiscal year 2015, are adjusted to exclude the impact of divestitures and currency. We believe this approach helps provide a better representation of HPE's operational performance given the significant divestitures we've recently completed, including the sale of 51% of our H3C business in China and TippingPoint, amongst several others. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our website for details. 
With that, let me turn it over to Meg."

And thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. Let me start by saying I'm pleased with the progress we made in Q3. Overall, we had a strong quarter.

Let me start by saying I'm pleased with the progress we made in Q3. Overall, we had a strong quarter. While revenue was down slightly on an operational basis, we saw several areas of growth in key parts of our portfolio, including networking, all-flash storage, high-performance compute and Technology Services. 
Profitability was very encouraging as we continue to deliver margin improvements in Enterprise Services and focus on profitable deals in the Enterprise Group. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.49, which even before the impact of a favorable tax rate, was at the high end of our previously guided range. Free cash flow also improved to $1 billion through diligent working capital management, and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders primarily through share repurchases. 
Tim will provide further color on the quarter, but I would like to take the bulk of my time to discuss today's spin merge announcement and put it in the context of the strategy we've been executing against for the past several years. 
Last November, we launched the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise with the vision to become the industry's leading provider of hybrid IT with the secure next-generation software-defined infrastructure that will run our customers' data centers today, bridge them to multi-cloud environments tomorrow and enable the emerging intelligent edge that will power campus, branch and IoT applications for decades to come. 
We believe this is what our customers are looking for and what we are best qualified to do. And most importantly, achieving this vision will create a faster-growing, higher-margin, stronger free cash flow company for our shareholders. To realize our vision, we looked at our portfolio and our product roadmaps to determine gaps that we needed to fill and then evaluated how best to do so. Some we fill through increased R&D like the investment in our recently launched HC 380 Hyper Converged product. In other areas, we pursue innovative partnerships like the ones recently announced with Docker and Mesosphere. And in some cases, acquisitions make sense like Aruba and SGI. 
Next, we identified areas of the business that were not aligned with our go-forward strategy. Here, we have looked at how to best maximize shareholder value with these assets. We've already made a number of decisions, including the sale of TippingPoint, the H3C deal in China, and of course, the spin merge of our Enterprise Services business with CSC. 
And today, we announced plans for a spin-off and merger of our noncore software assets with Micro Focus. These assets include our application delivery management, big data, enterprise security, information management and governance, and IT operations management businesses. This transaction is valued at about $8.8 billion, including a 50.1% ownership of the new combined company by HPE shareholders, which is currently valued at $6.3 billion, and a $2.5 billion cash payment to HPE. 
The combined company will be led by Kevin Loosemore, current Micro Focus Executive Chairman; and Mike Phillips will serve as Chief Financial Officer. After the transaction closes, Micro Focus's Board of Directors will include an HPE senior executive and HPE independent directors on the board. 
The new combined company is expected to have annual revenues of approximately $4.5 billion with strong recurring revenue streams. The company will be well diversified across product lines and geographies. It will also have a stronger go-to-market capability with nearly 4,000 sales people worldwide and deep R&D resources to deliver best-in-class solutions to customers and partners. Micro Focus's approach to managing both growing and mature software assets will ensure higher levels of investment in growth areas like big data analytics and security, while maintaining a stable platform for mission-critical software products that customers rely on. 
For employees, Micro Focus's approach will mean each product line will have a clear and important role in the overall company performance, and employees will have a high level of clarity on the strategy for their organization. It also means employees will get to work on long-term customer-focused projects and the software technology that they love. We believe the software assets that will be a part of the spin-merge will bring better value to our customers, employees and shareholders as part of a more focused software company, committed to growing these businesses on a stand-alone basis. 
With this announcement, Robert Youngjohns, the current head of our Software business, will assume the role of Executive Vice President, Strategic Business Development, reporting to me. In this new role, Robert will partner with other members of the leadership team to drive strategic customer and partner initiatives focused on growing key parts of the business. With Robert taking on this new role, Chris Hsu, our Chief Operating Officer, will lead the Software business, effective immediately in addition to his current responsibilities. Chris's track record of driving strong performance and understanding market dynamics at HPE and throughout his career make him a great fit for this role. 
To be clear, both software and services are still key enablers of HPE's go-forward strategy. Our newly created software-defined and cloud business will build upon key software assets like OneView and the Helion cloud platform to deliver software-defined, hybrid IT solutions like Synergy, HPE's composable infrastructure offering that enables customers to operate their workloads with unprecedented speed and agility. And in Services, we continue to have a world-class capability in our Technology Services group, which will represent about 25% of HPE's revenue following the 2 spins that we've announced. 
ES's 22,000 service professionals build solutions from the ground up with the consulting and support our customers need to transform their environments and take advantage of opportunities in emerging areas like campus, branch and IoT. Once the ES, CSC and the software Micro Focus transactions are complete, HPE will be an even stronger company, well positioned for the future. 
With approximately $28 billion in annual revenue, the future HPE will have significant scale, a diversified world-class portfolio and a global footprint to meet the evolving needs of our customers and partners. We will be a market leader both in the data center and on the edge with our world-class portfolio of software-defined servers, storage, networking and converged infrastructure. 
We will also have strong recurring revenue streams that account for approximately 60% of our operating profit and will have an improved free cash flow profile. Given our experience with divestitures, we are confident in our ability to execute. And more importantly, that we are making the right choices to set both HPE and our customers up for the long term while delivering maximum shareholder value. 
The market is already recognizing what we are doing. With these strategic moves and our continued strong operational performance, HPE's market cap has increased by over $10 billion or 40% since the separation from HPI on November 1, 2015. 
In addition to the portfolio changes, we also made important leadership and organizational changes this quarter that will make our business stronger and more efficient. For example, we've started the process of rightsizing our corporate functions for the more focused, stand-alone HPE. In addition, the Enterprise Group businesses have been simplified and streamlined to better address market opportunities, improve cost structure, accelerate innovation and strengthen our competitiveness. 
Furthermore, all business unit and corporate marketing efforts will be consolidated under our global marketing function, and all sales will be under a single global leader. Finally, we announced that Hewlett Packard Labs would move into the Enterprise Group, which will better align our research and go-to-market efforts. 
While there is more work to do, we are already seeing that our strategy is working. As a more focused organization, we've been better able to allocate resources more effectively and introduce truly best-in-class solutions. 
For example, as I mentioned earlier, we announced plans to acquire SGI. High-performance compute and big data analytics are exciting areas for us as customers are increasingly looking for ways to gain deeper, more contextural insights from the ever-expanding volumes of data. Industries like financial services, semiconductors and energy are all increasing their HPC investments. In Q3, we won several significant automotive deals where high-performance compute is used for electronic prototype designs, improving fuel economy and improving crashworthiness. The SGI acquisition will further strengthen our position in the $11 billion HPC segment as well as the high-growth data analytics segment. 
In storage, we extended our leadership in the all-flash data center with enhancements to HPE 3PAR and also introduced next-generation software-defined storage to enable a composable data fabric. We also brought enterprise capabilities to the entry storage market with the introduction of StoreVirtual 3200 and MSA 240. 
We announced HPE OneView 3.0 to provide software-defined intelligence across HPE's family of infrastructure solutions. To date, we've sold over 500,000 HPE OneView licenses across a variety of key verticals such as health care, industrial and financial services; and we have a growing partner ecosystem including Docker, Chef, Turbonomic and SaltStack. We unveiled the industry's first converged systems for the Internet of Things, the HPE Edgeline 1000 and 4000, which will enable real-time decision-making and deliver heavy-duty analytics at the edge by integrating data capture, control, compute and storage. 
We also announced updates to the HPE Helion cloud portfolio, including HPE Helion Cloud Suite, a new software suite enabling customers to manage their full spectrum of applications across infrastructure environments. And HPE Helion CloudSystem 10, a hardware and software solution to build and deploy an enterprise-grade private cloud environment. But most of all, we are winning with our customers and partners. 
Aruba continues to win customers and drive growth with its industry-leading technology. For example, we helped Rio's airport handle the massive surge of travelers passing through for the Olympics this summer, and Home Depot and Best Buy are currently implementing Aruba wireless solutions to provide a better in-store experience for customers and employees. 
Keep in mind, deals like this have great TS pull-through as well. At Discover in June, we announced a new partnership with GE Digital that will enable industrial analytics from the edge to the cloud. HPE will be a preferred storage and server infrastructure provider for GE's Predix cloud technologies, and the Predix platform will be a preferred software solution for HPE's industrial-related use cases and opportunities. HPE was also instrumental in helping Dropbox transform to a hybrid infrastructure to help it meet the growing demands of its users. Dropbox moved the majority of its cloud storage business away from AWS to an on-premise data center, using HPE ProLiant and Cloudline servers all financed by HPE Financial Services. 
We also announced a groundbreaking strategic alliance with Docker to help customers transform and modernize their data centers to benefit from a more agile development environment. At the heart of this alliance is HPE's Docker-ready server program, unique to the server industry, which ensures HPE servers are bundled with the Docker engine and support. And today, we announced plans for a commercial partnership with Micro Focus that will name SUSE as HPE's preferred Linux partner and will bring together HPE's Helion OpenStack and Stackato solutions with SUSE's OpenStack expertise to provide best-in-class, enterprise-grade, hybrid cloud offerings for HPE customers. 
So in summary, I'm pleased with the progress we've made this quarter. And I'm just as pleased with the execution of our strategies since we separated from HPI. I'm also excited about the opportunities we've created for shareholders in the spin-mergers of ES and CSC, and our software assets with Micro Focus. We are setting up HPE for long-term success, while unlocking the kind of value we believe our shareholders appreciate.
On that note, I will hand the call over to Tim."

Overall, we performed well in the quarter. While revenue of $12.2 billion, down less than 1%, was not quite as strong as last quarter, margins were up as we focus on profitable market share. We also executed well considering we faced difficul",1927,"Thanks, Meg. Overall, we performed well in the quarter. While revenue of $12.2 billion, down less than 1%, was not quite as strong as last quarter, margins were up as we focus on profitable market share. We also executed well considering we faced difficult compares across the portfolio and an uneven global demand environment. 
As we indicated last quarter, compares became more challenging as we're no longer benefiting from the large Deutsche Bank deal we signed in ES last year; and in EG, we are lapping the compares from Aruba and the ramp of Cloudline servers. From a macro perspective, we did see weakness in Europe, particularly in ES from a slowing in the U.K. public sector business and also in Japan, in the Enterprise Group. The Q3 currency impact to revenue was a headwind of 210 basis points year-over-year that we expect to moderate further. 
We did have several areas of solid growth across the portfolio, including networking, up 12%; all-flash arrays, up 70%; high-performance compute, up 12%; and our highest margin business, Technology Services, returned to growth for the first time since the second quarter of 2012. 
To improve growth in the overall portfolio, we're continuing to make investments in our higher growth businesses around software-defined, converged and hyper converged while we continue to enhance our go-to-market efforts that we expect will improve growth going forward. Overall, we are still on track to deliver what we said we would do at the beginning of the year by growing total fiscal year '16 revenue adjusted for divestitures and currency. 
Gross margin of 29.3% was up 60 basis points, both year-over-year and sequentially. This was principally due to continued improvements in Enterprise Services and Enterprise Group to a lesser extent. Non-GAAP operating profit of 8.8% was up 30 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.49 was above our outlook of $0.42 to $0.46 that was primarily the result of tax benefits realized in the recent divestitures equating to approximately $0.04 per share. 
Non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pretax amounts for the gain on divestiture of H3C of $2.2 billion, restructuring charges of $369 million, amortization of intangible assets of $210 million, and separation charges of $135 million. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.32, above our previously provided outlook range of $1.10 to $1.14, primarily due to a higher-than-expected gain on the H3C divestiture, lower separation costs and the previously mentioned tax benefit. 
Now turning to the results by business. In Enterprise Group, revenue was flat as we focused on profitability and delivered encouraging improvements in operating margins, which while flat year-over-year, were up 90 basis points sequentially to 12.6%. The sequential improvement was primarily due to lower discounting, better server option attach, favorable mix and operational cost improvements as we rightsized the organization ahead of the separation from Enterprise Services and Software. 
Server revenue declined 2% as solid growth in Tier 1 and high-performance compute was offset by pressures in core servers. Within the core, we did have some market coverage issues that we're addressing through recent sales leadership and go-to-market changes with an emphasis on SMB. We also doubled down in the fast-growing, high-performance compute market with the acquisition of SGI and continue to invest in workload optimized solutions like SAP HANA. 
From a margin standpoint, the team did a nice job prioritizing profitability over share for share's sake, expanding margins year-over-year. We also anticipate we held server share in the second calendar quarter overall and gained share in the Americas, density optimized and Tier 1. 
Storage revenue declined 5% with continued declines in the legacy portfolio, more than offsetting growth in Converged Storage at 1%, that was impacted by a softer-than-expected market. Margins increased year-over-year, driven by favorable converged mix and improved pricing in all-flash. 3PAR plus XT plus EVA was up 5%, and all-flash 3PAR revenue continues to drive the portfolio, growing 70% at record revenue levels. Despite a challenging market, we estimate we gained share in the second calendar quarter, our 11th consecutive quarter of share gains. And we continue to expect storage to gain share through the remainder of the year. 
Networking revenue grew 12% and encouragingly, Aruba growth has accelerated, growing 20% and is exceeding our internal plan. We again saw a growth across all regions as we continue to see the benefits of the combined Aruba, HPE portfolio. Margins improved year-over-year, driven by both a better mix and higher margin rates of Aruba. 
TS returned to growth for the first time since the second quarter of 2012. Revenue was up 1% as the strong order growth from fiscal year '15 becomes a larger portion of the portfolio and revenue grew in both Support and Consulting. And while orders were flat, we saw encouraging performance in non-attach and proactive services that are growing at double-digit rates and becoming a larger mix of the total portfolio. 
We continue to improve service intensity, our attach dollars per unit, which is helping to offset increased Tier 1 mix and higher server ASPs. Enterprise Services revenue declined 3% as growth in the Americas and APJ was more than offset by weakness in EMEA, resulting from a pause in U.K. public sector spending and a tough compare with the Deutsche Bank deal in the prior year. 
Operating profit improved 260 basis points year-over-year to 8.3%, the highest since the second quarter of 2011 as the team continues to execute on productivity improvements in delivery and sales. We also benefited from improving location mix and new deal profitability. 
Progress made on cost improvements, sales strength and normal quarterly seasonality provides us with continued confidence that operating margins for the full year will be approximately 7%, at the high end of our original outlook. Revenue is still expected to be down 2% to flat in constant currency even with the Mphasis divestiture. We continue to track against our longer-team goal of 60% headcount in low-cost locations and completed the quarter with 49% of our headcount in low-cost centers, a 6-point improvement since the beginning of the fiscal year. 
Software revenue declined 3% as strength in security and Big Data was offset by declines in IT management. SaaS had a record quarter with 17% revenue growth. The team continues to focus on disciplined cost controls, decreasing OpEx 16% year-over-year. However, revenue declines ultimately outpaced operating improvements causing a 270-basis-point decline in operating margins to 17.8%. 
HPE Financial Services revenue grew 2% and delivered the first quarter of as-reported revenue growth since the first quarter of 2013. Operating profit declined 90 basis points year-over-year to 9.9% as lower residual sales from weaker volume in prior years pressured margin rates. 
Financing volume declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency on a tough compare that saw Deutsche Bank sale leaseback volume in the third quarter of 2015. 
Return on equity was down 190 basis points year-over-year to 13.3% and was similarly pressured by lower residual sales resulting from lower volumes in fiscal year '13 and fiscal year '14. 
Cash flow generation was strong in the quarter as we continue to optimize working capital management. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion, up 10% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Free cash flow was $971 million, up 15% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. When adjusted for the sale of Mphasis, the cash conversion cycle was 19 days, down 5 days, sequentially. Receivables were the largest contributor to working capital improvement due to favorable payment term mix and reductions to aged receivables. Going forward, we expect the cash conversion cycle to be in the mid-teens with fiscal year '16 free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. 
Turning to capital allocation. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.5 billion of stock through an accelerated share repurchase program, and we paid $91 million as part of our normal dividend. Year-to-date, we have returned $2.9 billion of capital to shareholders, primarily through $2.7 billion of share repurchases. With our free cash flow generation and the recent divestitures, we are on pace to return more than $3 billion of cash to shareholders in the year, which, as a reminder, is approximately 3x our original commitment at the start of the year. 
Finally, I would like to discuss the financial impacts of the HPE Software, Micro Focus transaction. As Meg mentioned, the transaction is expected to deliver approximately $8.8 billion of enterprise value to HPE. This includes 50.1% of the equity in the newly formed company that will go to HPE shareholders, valued at approximately $6.3 billion based on Micro Focus's current stock price and receipt of a $2.5 billion payment of onshore cash to HPE. 
HPE and Micro Focus also expect to improve the margins on HPE Software assets by approximately 20 points by the end of the third year following the deal close, while investing in key growth areas like Big Data and security. As owners of 50.1% of the equity in the new merged company, HPE shareholders will share in the value of these operational improvements as well as future growth of earnings. We expect this transaction to close by the end of the second half of HPE's fiscal year 2017. 
To recognize this $8.8 billion of enterprise value and unlock a more attractive financial profile for HPE going forward, we will incur onetime separation cash payments of approximately $700 million with the vast majority occurring in fiscal year '17. Following that separation from ES and Software, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a faster-growing, higher-margin, stronger cash flow company for our shareholders. Just looking at fiscal year '16, revenue growth would be about 3 points greater; operating margins would be about 1 point higher at just over 10%; and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue would be roughly 50% higher. 
It's also worth noting that we have roughly 30% of revenue recurring. But most importantly, more than 60% of profitability will be recurring that comes from TS and Financial Services. HPE will also have a very healthy balance sheet that currently sits at $5.3 billion in operating net cash. On top of that, we just closed the Mphasis deal, receiving approximately $825 million of before tax cash proceeds. We continue to see share repurchase as an excellent use of capital and similar to the H3C transaction, plan to buy back shares with the vast majority of the Mphasis proceeds. 
In fiscal year '17, our net cash position will also be further enhanced by over $1 billion from the cash and debt transfers with CSC and a $2.5 billion cash dividend from Micro Focus. We will continue to deliver shareholder value with these proceeds just as we've done this year by following our returns-based capital allocation approach. This approach is currently biased towards share repurchases, and we will provide more details on our fiscal year '17 capital return plans to shareholders at our upcoming Analyst Day. 
With all that in mind, we expect to finish fiscal year 2016 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.90 to $1.95, at the high end of our original outlook for the year. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $2.09 to $2.14. 
Before we open it up to questions, a quick reminder that we are holding our Annual Securities Analyst Meeting on October 18 in San Francisco, where we will provide additional P&L and cash flow details on the company as it stands today as well as a go-forward Hewlett Packard Enterprise, excluding ES and Software. 
Now let's open it up for questions."

So listen, we were -- we saw a softer market. But we've introduced our new StoreVirtual 3200, the MSA 2040 that brings the enterprise capabilities at a fantastic price to the entry market, and that has been a drag for us.

And at that time, you talked about cash balance being an asset, and net acquisitions would be an integral part of the strategy. You also talked about HPE being a solutions company and a growth company. Less than a year later, it feels like a different story. Cash return has been the absolute priority. Acquisitions have been extremely minimal. Arguably, divesting software and services, which are essential ingredients to many solutions, seems different. And so I applaud the flexibility because the stock price has done extremely well and it's certainly been in the vein of value creation. But I was wondering if you could comment on what appeared to precipitate this change in thinking from I think an impression that seemed different to most from the roadshow a year ago. And is there a different end state for Hewlett Packard Enterprise going forward? I mean, is this really a viable ongoing hardware-centric company going forward? Or should we expect more portfolio rationalization? And believe it or not, I have a follow-up."

So Toni, let me take you all the way back to November 1, 2015 where we separated HP Inc. from Hewlett Packard Enterprise. And we very much laid out the strategy of being a leading provider and a hybrid IT, both in the traditional data center, which by the way is still a robust market. It's 85% of the spend in IT today. And we are the leader there and we need to continue to gain share. And then we wanted to focus on software-defined infrastructure, which is really the next generation of infrastructure that our customers need. And then finally, build out our cloud platform and compute storage and networking at the edge. And that's exactly what we've done. And as we laid out that strategy, we looked at our portfolio. What do we need to add to the portfolio, either in acquisitions or partnerships? What do we need to divest because those assets are noncore to the strategy? It doesn't mean they're bad assets, it's just not -- they're not core to what we are doing. So if you take the ES transaction, listen, we are still going to be in the services business. In fact, 25% of the revenue of HPE will be services. It's just a different kind of services business than IT outsourcing, business process outsourcing and apps maintenance. If you think about software, we're still going to be in the software business. It's just not in application software like ITOM, it is systems software like OneView and the software that powers Synergy. So it is a portfolio matching to the strategy that we see our competitive advantage in. As far as -- I think you asked about further divestitures. So Enterprise Group, as currently configured, needs to stay together. And I'll tell you why. The -- my view of the market is everything is moving to converged, and we have a differentiated position because we have networking, storage and compute. And that is not -- our 2 major competitors are missing a key component of that offering. So that, we think, is important to keep together. And then as you think about Technology Services. Technology Services is a key differentiator for our company. We can help customers support, maintain, advise and consult across the globe, and it would be uneconomic to simply support storage only or networking only. So TS is absolutely integral. And then finally, obviously, campus, branch and edge is a new growth area for the company. There's no reason that we should not own compute at the edge. There's no reason that we shouldn't own analytics at the edge, in addition to, obviously, Aruba. So I think it's -- to some degree, the strategy has evolved but really, quite consistent with what we laid out. And a big part of what we did this past year was portfolio optimization for the strategy. So on a go-forward basis, I think -- as Tim said well, I think you can look for more ROI-based smart acquisitions like Aruba, like SGI. And so, I think it's entirely consistent with the strategy that we laid out a year ago."

So what I mean by that is, I can't help thinking that HP Software business is going to be like 75% of Micro Focus going forward. You're far, far, far bigger than they are from a revenue perspective. And they believe, as a much smaller player, that they can improve operating margins 2,000 basis points. 2,000 basis points on your revenue basis is $750 million a year in operating profit, which add up a 10-multiple, $7.5 billion, even if you haven't given up the business. So I guess the question is, if the margin improvement opportunities are so huge even for a relatively small player, why did you either not extract a better price or why did you not believe that you could have extracted those and created even more value for shareholders?"

They are a pure play software company who is expert at managing mature software assets. And as Micro Focus will tell you, most people who work in the software business in Silicon Valley want to grow assets. And actually, some of these assets should actually be maintained on a stable platform that extends the value for customers. And it's actually not what we do, it is what they do. But then you come to the question of, why did we do a spin merge as opposed to sell the whole business. And the reason is, is because our shareholders will be able to ride the upside of what Micro Focus does. Remember our shareholders will own 50% of the new company. And by the way, I will be a shareholder of that new company, given my vested options and my vested RSUs in HPE, and I can tell you, I will be holding those shares because I think they're going to do very, very well. And so this was a much better alternative than selling the company today on a P/E multiple of operating income because you'd get cash, but you'd pay taxes, and then our shareholders wouldn't get to ride the upside unless they went out and took new money to buy those shares. So we thought that was absolutely the right thing to do. And I have to tell you, Toni, in today's world where technology is changing at lightning speed, I've got to tell you the value of focus, I'm seeing it every single day. And so while maybe back in the day, it was great to be a technology supermarket like the financial supermarkets of yesterday. What I'm pretty sure of is the next 4 or 5 years is going to be all about speed, agility and focus and innovation in something that is a more narrow focus."

But we still remain in the software business, it's just a different kind of software business. As I said, systems software. The software-defined infrastructure is all powered by software. But it's not applications software, if you will, like ITOM or ADM. It is actually systems software that powers the infrastructure of our customers. Now you say, all right, so how do we capitalize on the Big Data and analytics? Well, first of all, we will be the leader in high-performance compute with the acquisition of SGI. So companies need to process and compute huge amounts -- ever escalating amounts of data. So really, the high-performance compute market, which is an $11 billion business, growing at 68%, will really be between HPE, now with SGI, and Cray, but many of the other competitors like Dell, Lenovo, they are not in that high-performance compute business. So as people need financial services, energy, as they need to compute to process all this Big Data, if you will, we will be the leading player there. If you think about campus, branch and edge, I think this is the next big growth area. If you think about autonomous driving vehicles, jet engines, health care -- sensors in health care beds and in devices, this is an area where huge amounts of data needs to be processed real time, at the edge as opposed to enduring the latency of coming back to a major data center. So we're going to be able to capitalize on the IoT trend by Big Data -- by analytics at the edge and be able to compute and store at the edge. So that's the way we'll play in those trends. It will be different than like Vertica, which will go to Micro Focus, which is a big columnar database that processes huge amounts of data on a database side, but we will pick up the ability to process on compute, storage and networking at the edge."

I give you a lot of credit because you're basically creating these very focused companies, whatever, Computer Sciences is called, and now Micro Focus, which I think does create a lot of shareholder value. But again, when all is said and done, you're becoming more and more a hardware company. And I would think your competitors ultimately are going to be primarily Cisco and Dell, and obviously, they'll use their large size against you and claim they've got AI capabilities and so forth. How do you see matching up against them when all is said and done? And are you going to have a relationship with Micro Focus that's kind of a favored nation like you appear to have with Computer Sciences go forward?"

And actually, beyond that, you saw what we announced today with SUSE where they'll be our preferred partner for Linux as well as the OpenStack distro. And listen, a lot of the software products that are going in the spin merge will be important to us going forward. So there will be a relationship there. So let me just give you a sense of, I think we're in a great position to compete with both Cisco and Dell. So for example, actually, the HPE go-forward strategy will be about a $28 billion company that's only slightly smaller than Dell's Enterprise business and it is more focused with better innovation. I think we should just contrast our strategy with Dell. Okay, so we are getting smaller while they're getting bigger. And this is important because I believe speed and agility is critical in innovation and go-to-market. The second is they are levering up and we are delevering. We have $5.3 billion of net cash on the operating company and we're going to have a lot more by the time we're done with these transactions, and that gives us dry powder, it also gives us the ability to return cash to shareholders. And I think it's difficult to be levered as much as Dell is in this environment. And then secondly, we're leaning into new technology, either through our own innovation, acquisitions or partnerships, and we've got major focus on our side. What they're doing is doubling down on old technology in a cost take-out play. And listen, I think it might be quite successful for the leadership team there from a financial perspective. I'm not so sure it's good for customers."

So listen, Cisco is a good competitor, but they are missing a key element, which is storage. And as the -- as this converges, I think as the environment converges and we look at hyper-converged and on Synergy, we're innovating really nicely now for the traditional data center as well as the software-defined data center. And I got to tell you, Aruba at the edge is killing it, and a 20% growth rate above our internal plan, and we're just winning deals hand over fist there. So we feel really good about our ability to compete with Cisco. Okay, so back to servers. So listen, what's happening in servers is there is sort of core server growth; then there is Tier 1 servers, which is to the big service providers; and then is obviously, high-performance compute. And the reason we did the SGI acquisition is to really stake out a great position in an $11 billion business, as I said before, that's growing 68%, that's very profitable for the compute itself, but also, there's very high TS attached to high-performance compute. Core servers around the globe are under some pressure right now. But you saw what we did in terms of increasing the margin. And we are doubling down on SMB, which actually is still -- there's pockets of growth in that area. And we're also doing workload specialization. Okay, we have the best compute in the world to run SAP HANA. It's not even close with anyone else. So we're specializing around workloads. And then obviously, there was a tough compare because of Cloudline a year ago. I mean, we have just ramped that business into a multibillion-dollar business. And so it's hard to compete with those compares, but we expect to continue to gain share in that market profitably. We're not in it for share -- for share's sake. We don't want to take unprofitable deals. But as we continue to work on our supply chain and the rationalization, we become ever more competitive there. And we're very mindful that ultimately there is Chinese competitors there as well. And whether that's Huawei or Lenovo, it's not just Dell. So we're very aware of the cost structure we have to have to continue to compete."

Let's take a pause and decide what we want to do here."" And -- but we saw it in a very market way. What I will say, in the last couple of weeks, we've actually seen orders pick up again. It was almost like they took a pause and basically, had to sort of take stock of what was happening and then basically the orders have started to flow again. I mean, we continue to also monitor the pricing -- competitive pricing environment that we see and we adjust as necessary, particularly in the channel.

TS is and was a very profitable business that was largely attached to Business Critical Systems, very profitable, very high attach -- I mean, you didn't really sell Business Critical Systems without a TS attach. And when Business Critical Systems, both from a market perspective as well as the Oracle Itanium situation, by all rights, TS should be down 25%. Do you remember, Shannon, over the last 4 or 5 years, BCS was down 25% like clockwork, every single quarter for 4 years. It's growing a little bit now. But by all rights, TS should have shrunk with BCS, and it did not. And the reason it did not was very impressive new product offering, Proactive Care, other areas where we help customers maintain their data center estate. And so the fact that it has actually only been down a few percentage points over the last 12 months is a testament to the leadership team in that business. And now what you're seeing is those new product offerings are starting to get real traction. Orders have been positive for the last 3 or 4 quarters, and those orders translated into growth this quarter. Not a significant amount of growth, but 1%, we'll take it all day long, because it is a very, very profitable business. So we have more work to do on Technology Services. I will tell you, it is the benefit of now being a smaller, more focused company. Antonio Neri and I are going to spend a whole lot of time now on what is the next generation of Technology Services and whether that's Flexible Capacity services that allows consumption-based model, where there is proactive care, data center care, we're going to spend a lot of time there because it is a key strategic enabler of RemainCo HPE."

So as we have done these divestitures or as we're doing these divestitures, we obviously incorporate that into what the new cost structure needs to look like. And obviously, we need to be very aggressive around what we call stranded cost. So I think the good news is when you look at the HPE/HPI separation, we did have some dissynergies, we called them. We have worked those through the system. With the H3C divestiture, we've gotten much better with identifying the stranded cost, we're being much more proactive in managing them out.

Whether that is how we are organized internally with all R&D under one R&D leader, whether it is putting our software-defined infrastructure and our cloud offering under one leader, whether it is putting all of our go-to-market under one leader where we have consistent go-to-market strategy, discounting across the board. Frankly, we were much better at minimizing discounting in APJ and EMEA than we were in the United States; we now have that discipline across the company. And then finally, corporate overhead, we've got to have a corporate overhead that is designed for a $28 billion company. And when we started, we had a corporate overhead designed for a $110 billion company, and then a $50 billion company, and now a $28 billion company.

So -- and I almost wonder, is $700 million kind of -- why is it so much and not much lower? Or is it just so much integrated in Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, that's why it costs so much to break out?"

Again, we feel like the value that, that transaction is driving is phenomenal for HPE as well as its shareholders. However, to realize that value, we need to make investments and allocate resources to do the separation. So to your point, software, although the activities are similar in nature to the transaction in ES, they are discrete. And they're not necessarily driven by revenue base or headcount level. So when you look at software, it's a global complex business. It has multiple legal entities that had been accumulated over time through a series of transactions. And because of that, when you look at the tax, the finance, the legal and the operating structure, it is still very, very complicated. So in order to separate that, there are some large expense items in there. For example, separating 650 IT systems, doing the carve-out financials, translating GAAP to IFRS, splitting 150 legal entities in 60 countries, trying to figure out what we want to do with 200 real estate sites across the globe. So there's certainly a lot of work that needs to be done there. The good news is we have done this before, so we know how to do it. The team has been very proactive and we're all over it. We have the work streams identified. So we're confident we'll get there when we go forward."

Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the press releases and the slide presentations accompanying today's earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations web page at investors.hpe.com.
As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings and transaction materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HPE's SEC reports, including its most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements. 
We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2016. Finally, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website. 
Throughout this conference call, all revenue growth rates presented, beginning with fiscal year 2015, are adjusted to exclude the impact of divestitures and currency. We believe this approach helps provide a better representation of HPE's operational performance given the significant divestitures we've recently completed, including the sale of 51% of our H3C business in China and TippingPoint, amongst several others. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our website for details. 
With that, let me turn it over to Meg."
273983758,379420534,1043983,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 07, 2016",2016-09-07,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thanks, Andy. And thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. Let me start by saying I'm pleased with the progress we made in Q3. Overall, we had a strong quarter.

Let me start by saying I'm pleased with the progress we made in Q3. Overall, we had a strong quarter. While revenue was down slightly on an operational basis, we saw several areas of growth in key parts of our portfolio, including networking, all-flash storage, high-performance compute and Technology Services. 
Profitability was very encouraging as we continue to deliver margin improvements in Enterprise Services and focus on profitable deals in the Enterprise Group. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.49, which even before the impact of a favorable tax rate, was at the high end of our previously guided range. Free cash flow also improved to $1 billion through diligent working capital management, and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders primarily through share repurchases. 
Tim will provide further color on the quarter, but I would like to take the bulk of my time to discuss today's spin merge announcement and put it in the context of the strategy we've been executing against for the past several years. 
Last November, we launched the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise with the vision to become the industry's leading provider of hybrid IT with the secure next-generation software-defined infrastructure that will run our customers' data centers today, bridge them to multi-cloud environments tomorrow and enable the emerging intelligent edge that will power campus, branch and IoT applications for decades to come. 
We believe this is what our customers are looking for and what we are best qualified to do. And most importantly, achieving this vision will create a faster-growing, higher-margin, stronger free cash flow company for our shareholders. To realize our vision, we looked at our portfolio and our product roadmaps to determine gaps that we needed to fill and then evaluated how best to do so. Some we fill through increased R&D like the investment in our recently launched HC 380 Hyper Converged product. In other areas, we pursue innovative partnerships like the ones recently announced with Docker and Mesosphere. And in some cases, acquisitions make sense like Aruba and SGI. 
Next, we identified areas of the business that were not aligned with our go-forward strategy. Here, we have looked at how to best maximize shareholder value with these assets. We've already made a number of decisions, including the sale of TippingPoint, the H3C deal in China, and of course, the spin merge of our Enterprise Services business with CSC. 
And today, we announced plans for a spin-off and merger of our noncore software assets with Micro Focus. These assets include our application delivery management, big data, enterprise security, information management and governance, and IT operations management businesses. This transaction is valued at about $8.8 billion, including a 50.1% ownership of the new combined company by HPE shareholders, which is currently valued at $6.3 billion, and a $2.5 billion cash payment to HPE. 
The combined company will be led by Kevin Loosemore, current Micro Focus Executive Chairman; and Mike Phillips will serve as Chief Financial Officer. After the transaction closes, Micro Focus's Board of Directors will include an HPE senior executive and HPE independent directors on the board. 
The new combined company is expected to have annual revenues of approximately $4.5 billion with strong recurring revenue streams. The company will be well diversified across product lines and geographies. It will also have a stronger go-to-market capability with nearly 4,000 sales people worldwide and deep R&D resources to deliver best-in-class solutions to customers and partners. Micro Focus's approach to managing both growing and mature software assets will ensure higher levels of investment in growth areas like big data analytics and security, while maintaining a stable platform for mission-critical software products that customers rely on. 
For employees, Micro Focus's approach will mean each product line will have a clear and important role in the overall company performance, and employees will have a high level of clarity on the strategy for their organization. It also means employees will get to work on long-term customer-focused projects and the software technology that they love. We believe the software assets that will be a part of the spin-merge will bring better value to our customers, employees and shareholders as part of a more focused software company, committed to growing these businesses on a stand-alone basis. 
With this announcement, Robert Youngjohns, the current head of our Software business, will assume the role of Executive Vice President, Strategic Business Development, reporting to me. In this new role, Robert will partner with other members of the leadership team to drive strategic customer and partner initiatives focused on growing key parts of the business. With Robert taking on this new role, Chris Hsu, our Chief Operating Officer, will lead the Software business, effective immediately in addition to his current responsibilities. Chris's track record of driving strong performance and understanding market dynamics at HPE and throughout his career make him a great fit for this role. 
To be clear, both software and services are still key enablers of HPE's go-forward strategy. Our newly created software-defined and cloud business will build upon key software assets like OneView and the Helion cloud platform to deliver software-defined, hybrid IT solutions like Synergy, HPE's composable infrastructure offering that enables customers to operate their workloads with unprecedented speed and agility. And in Services, we continue to have a world-class capability in our Technology Services group, which will represent about 25% of HPE's revenue following the 2 spins that we've announced. 
ES's 22,000 service professionals build solutions from the ground up with the consulting and support our customers need to transform their environments and take advantage of opportunities in emerging areas like campus, branch and IoT. Once the ES, CSC and the software Micro Focus transactions are complete, HPE will be an even stronger company, well positioned for the future. 
With approximately $28 billion in annual revenue, the future HPE will have significant scale, a diversified world-class portfolio and a global footprint to meet the evolving needs of our customers and partners. We will be a market leader both in the data center and on the edge with our world-class portfolio of software-defined servers, storage, networking and converged infrastructure. 
We will also have strong recurring revenue streams that account for approximately 60% of our operating profit and will have an improved free cash flow profile. Given our experience with divestitures, we are confident in our ability to execute. And more importantly, that we are making the right choices to set both HPE and our customers up for the long term while delivering maximum shareholder value. 
The market is already recognizing what we are doing. With these strategic moves and our continued strong operational performance, HPE's market cap has increased by over $10 billion or 40% since the separation from HPI on November 1, 2015. 
In addition to the portfolio changes, we also made important leadership and organizational changes this quarter that will make our business stronger and more efficient. For example, we've started the process of rightsizing our corporate functions for the more focused, stand-alone HPE. In addition, the Enterprise Group businesses have been simplified and streamlined to better address market opportunities, improve cost structure, accelerate innovation and strengthen our competitiveness. 
Furthermore, all business unit and corporate marketing efforts will be consolidated under our global marketing function, and all sales will be under a single global leader. Finally, we announced that Hewlett Packard Labs would move into the Enterprise Group, which will better align our research and go-to-market efforts. 
While there is more work to do, we are already seeing that our strategy is working. As a more focused organization, we've been better able to allocate resources more effectively and introduce truly best-in-class solutions. 
For example, as I mentioned earlier, we announced plans to acquire SGI. High-performance compute and big data analytics are exciting areas for us as customers are increasingly looking for ways to gain deeper, more contextual insights from the ever-expanding volumes of data. Industries like financial services, semiconductors and energy are all increasing their HPC investments. In Q3, we won several significant automotive deals where high-performance compute is used for electronic prototype designs, improving fuel economy and improving crashworthiness. The SGI acquisition will further strengthen our position in the $11 billion HPC segment as well as the high-growth data analytics segment. 
In storage, we extended our leadership in the all-flash data center with enhancements to HPE 3PAR and also introduced next-generation software-defined storage to enable a composable data fabric. We also brought enterprise capabilities to the entry storage market with the introduction of StoreVirtual 3200 and MSA 240. 
We announced HPE OneView 3.0 to provide software-defined intelligence across HPE's family of infrastructure solutions. To date, we've sold over 500,000 HPE OneView licenses across a variety of key verticals such as health care, industrial and financial services; and we have a growing partner ecosystem including Docker, Chef, Turbonomic and SaltStack. We unveiled the industry's first converged systems for the Internet of Things, the HPE Edgeline 1000 and 4000, which will enable real-time decision-making and deliver heavy-duty analytics at the edge by integrating data capture, control, compute and storage. 
We also announced updates to the HPE Helion cloud portfolio, including HPE Helion Cloud Suite, a new software suite enabling customers to manage their full spectrum of applications across infrastructure environments. And HPE Helion CloudSystem 10, a hardware and software solution to build and deploy an enterprise-grade private cloud environment. But most of all, we are winning with our customers and partners. 
Aruba continues to win customers and drive growth with its industry-leading technology. For example, we helped Rio's airport handle the massive surge of travelers passing through for the Olympics this summer, and Home Depot and Best Buy are currently implementing Aruba wireless solutions to provide a better in-store experience for customers and employees. 
Keep in mind, deals like this have great TS pull-through as well. At Discover in June, we announced a new partnership with GE Digital that will enable industrial analytics from the edge to the cloud. HPE will be a preferred storage and server infrastructure provider for GE's Predix cloud technologies, and the Predix platform will be a preferred software solution for HPE's industrial-related use cases and opportunities. HPE was also instrumental in helping Dropbox transform to a hybrid infrastructure to help it meet the growing demands of its users. Dropbox moved the majority of its cloud storage business away from AWS to an on-premise data center, using HPE ProLiant and Cloudline servers all financed by HPE Financial Services. 
We also announced a groundbreaking strategic alliance with Docker to help customers transform and modernize their data centers to benefit from a more agile development environment. At the heart of this alliance is HPE's Docker-ready server program, unique to the server industry, which ensures HPE servers are bundled with the Docker engine and support. And today, we announced plans for a commercial partnership with Micro Focus that will name SUSE as HPE's preferred Linux partner and will bring together HPE's Helion OpenStack and Stackato solutions with SUSE's OpenStack expertise to provide best-in-class, enterprise-grade, hybrid cloud offerings for HPE customers. 
So in summary, I'm pleased with the progress we've made this quarter. And I'm just as pleased with the execution of our strategies since we separated from HPI. I'm also excited about the opportunities we've created for shareholders in the spin-mergers of ES and CSC, and our software assets with Micro Focus. We are setting up HPE for long-term success, while unlocking the kind of value we believe our shareholders appreciate.
On that note, I will hand the call over to Tim."
273983758,379420534,1043983,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Sep 07, 2016",2016-09-07,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thanks, Meg. Overall, we performed well in the quarter. While revenue of $12.2 billion, down less than 1%, was not quite as strong as last quarter, margins were up as we focus on profitable market share. We also executed well considering we faced difficul",1927,"Thanks, Meg. Overall, we performed well in the quarter. While revenue of $12.2 billion, down less than 1%, was not quite as strong as last quarter, margins were up as we focus on profitable market share. We also executed well considering we faced difficult compares across the portfolio and an uneven global demand environment. 
As we indicated last quarter, compares became more challenging as we're no longer benefiting from the large Deutsche Bank deal we signed in ES last year; and in EG, we are lapping the compares from Aruba and the ramp of Cloudline servers. From a macro perspective, we did see weakness in Europe, particularly in ES from a slowing in the U.K. public sector business and also in Japan, in the Enterprise Group. The Q3 currency impact to revenue was a headwind of 210 basis points year-over-year that we expect to moderate further. 
We did have several areas of solid growth across the portfolio, including networking, up 12%; all-flash arrays, up 70%; high-performance compute, up 12%; and our highest margin business, Technology Services, returned to growth for the first time since the second quarter of 2012. 
To improve growth in the overall portfolio, we're continuing to make investments in our higher growth businesses around software-defined, converged and hyper converged while we continue to enhance our go-to-market efforts that we expect will improve growth going forward. Overall, we are still on track to deliver what we said we would do at the beginning of the year by growing total fiscal year '16 revenue adjusted for divestitures and currency. 
Gross margin of 29.3% was up 60 basis points, both year-over-year and sequentially. This was principally due to continued improvements in Enterprise Services and Enterprise Group to a lesser extent. Non-GAAP operating profit of 8.8% was up 30 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.49 was above our outlook of $0.42 to $0.46 that was primarily the result of tax benefits realized in the recent divestitures equating to approximately $0.04 per share. 
Non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes pretax amounts for the gain on divestiture of H3C of $2.2 billion, restructuring charges of $369 million, amortization of intangible assets of $210 million, and separation charges of $135 million. We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.32, above our previously provided outlook range of $1.10 to $1.14, primarily due to a higher-than-expected gain on the H3C divestiture, lower separation costs and the previously mentioned tax benefit. 
Now turning to the results by business. In Enterprise Group, revenue was flat as we focused on profitability and delivered encouraging improvements in operating margins, which while flat year-over-year, were up 90 basis points sequentially to 12.6%. The sequential improvement was primarily due to lower discounting, better server option attach, favorable mix and operational cost improvements as we rightsized the organization ahead of the separation from Enterprise Services and Software. 
Server revenue declined 2% as solid growth in Tier 1 and high-performance compute was offset by pressures in core servers. Within the core, we did have some market coverage issues that we're addressing through recent sales leadership and go-to-market changes with an emphasis on SMB. We also doubled down in the fast-growing, high-performance compute market with the acquisition of SGI and continue to invest in workload optimized solutions like SAP HANA. 
From a margin standpoint, the team did a nice job prioritizing profitability over share for share's sake, expanding margins year-over-year. We also anticipate we held server share in the second calendar quarter overall and gained share in the Americas, density optimized and Tier 1. 
Storage revenue declined 5% with continued declines in the legacy portfolio, more than offsetting growth in Converged Storage at 1%, that was impacted by a softer-than-expected market. Margins increased year-over-year, driven by favorable converged mix and improved pricing in all-flash. 3PAR plus XT plus EVA was up 5%, and all-flash 3PAR revenue continues to drive the portfolio, growing 70% at record revenue levels. Despite a challenging market, we estimate we gained share in the second calendar quarter, our 11th consecutive quarter of share gains. And we continue to expect storage to gain share through the remainder of the year. 
Networking revenue grew 12% and encouragingly, Aruba growth has accelerated, growing 20% and is exceeding our internal plan. We again saw a growth across all regions as we continue to see the benefits of the combined Aruba, HPE portfolio. Margins improved year-over-year, driven by both a better mix and higher margin rates of Aruba. 
TS returned to growth for the first time since the second quarter of 2012. Revenue was up 1% as the strong order growth from fiscal year '15 becomes a larger portion of the portfolio and revenue grew in both Support and Consulting. And while orders were flat, we saw encouraging performance in non-attach and proactive services that are growing at double-digit rates and becoming a larger mix of the total portfolio. 
We continue to improve service intensity, our attach dollars per unit, which is helping to offset increased Tier 1 mix and higher server ASPs. Enterprise Services revenue declined 3% as growth in the Americas and APJ was more than offset by weakness in EMEA, resulting from a pause in U.K. public sector spending and a tough compare with the Deutsche Bank deal in the prior year. 
Operating profit improved 260 basis points year-over-year to 8.3%, the highest since the second quarter of 2011 as the team continues to execute on productivity improvements in delivery and sales. We also benefited from improving location mix and new deal profitability. 
Progress made on cost improvements, sales strength and normal quarterly seasonality provides us with continued confidence that operating margins for the full year will be approximately 7%, at the high end of our original outlook. Revenue is still expected to be down 2% to flat in constant currency even with the Mphasis divestiture. We continue to track against our longer-team goal of 60% headcount in low-cost locations and completed the quarter with 49% of our headcount in low-cost centers, a 6-point improvement since the beginning of the fiscal year. 
Software revenue declined 3% as strength in security and big data was offset by declines in IT management. SaaS had a record quarter with 17% revenue growth. The team continues to focus on disciplined cost controls, decreasing OpEx 16% year-over-year. However, revenue declines ultimately outpaced operating improvements causing a 270-basis-point decline in operating margins to 17.8%. 
HPE Financial Services revenue grew 2% and delivered the first quarter of as-reported revenue growth since the first quarter of 2013. Operating profit declined 90 basis points year-over-year to 9.9% as lower residual sales from weaker volume in prior years pressured margin rates. 
Financing volume declined 4% year-over-year in constant currency on a tough compare that saw Deutsche Bank sale leaseback volume in the third quarter of 2015. 
Return on equity was down 190 basis points year-over-year to 13.3% and was similarly pressured by lower residual sales resulting from lower volumes in fiscal year '13 and fiscal year '14. 
Cash flow generation was strong in the quarter as we continue to optimize working capital management. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion, up 10% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Free cash flow was $971 million, up 15% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. When adjusted for the sale of Mphasis, the cash conversion cycle was 19 days, down 5 days, sequentially. Receivables were the largest contributor to working capital improvement due to favorable payment term mix and reductions to aged receivables. Going forward, we expect the cash conversion cycle to be in the mid-teens with fiscal year '16 free cash flow of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. 
Turning to capital allocation. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.5 billion of stock through an accelerated share repurchase program, and we paid $91 million as part of our normal dividend. Year-to-date, we have returned $2.9 billion of capital to shareholders, primarily through $2.7 billion of share repurchases. With our free cash flow generation and the recent divestitures, we are on pace to return more than $3 billion of cash to shareholders in the year, which, as a reminder, is approximately 3x our original commitment at the start of the year. 
Finally, I would like to discuss the financial impacts of the HPE Software, Micro Focus transaction. As Meg mentioned, the transaction is expected to deliver approximately $8.8 billion of enterprise value to HPE. This includes 50.1% of the equity in the newly formed company that will go to HPE shareholders, valued at approximately $6.3 billion based on Micro Focus's current stock price and receipt of a $2.5 billion payment of onshore cash to HPE. 
HPE and Micro Focus also expect to improve the margins on HPE Software assets by approximately 20 points by the end of the third year following the deal close, while investing in key growth areas like big data and security. As owners of 50.1% of the equity in the new merged company, HPE shareholders will share in the value of these operational improvements as well as future growth of earnings. We expect this transaction to close by the end of the second half of HPE's fiscal year 2017. 
To recognize this $8.8 billion of enterprise value and unlock a more attractive financial profile for HPE going forward, we will incur onetime separation cash payments of approximately $700 million with the vast majority occurring in fiscal year '17. Following that separation from ES and Software, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a faster-growing, higher-margin, stronger cash flow company for our shareholders. Just looking at fiscal year '16, revenue growth would be about 3 points greater; operating margins would be about 1 point higher at just over 10%; and free cash flow as a percentage of revenue would be roughly 50% higher. 
It's also worth noting that we have roughly 30% of revenue recurring. But most importantly, more than 60% of profitability will be recurring that comes from TS and Financial Services. HPE will also have a very healthy balance sheet that currently sits at $5.3 billion in operating net cash. On top of that, we just closed the Mphasis deal, receiving approximately $825 million of before tax cash proceeds. We continue to see share repurchase as an excellent use of capital and similar to the H3C transaction, plan to buy back shares with the vast majority of the Mphasis proceeds. 
In fiscal year '17, our net cash position will also be further enhanced by over $1 billion from the cash and debt transfers with CSC and a $2.5 billion cash dividend from Micro Focus. We will continue to deliver shareholder value with these proceeds just as we've done this year by following our returns-based capital allocation approach. This approach is currently biased towards share repurchases, and we will provide more details on our fiscal year '17 capital return plans to shareholders at our upcoming Analyst Day. 
With all that in mind, we expect to finish fiscal year 2016 with non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $1.90 to $1.95, at the high end of our original outlook for the year. We expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $2.09 to $2.14. 
Before we open it up to questions, a quick reminder that we are holding our Annual Securities Analyst Meeting on October 18 in San Francisco, where we will provide additional P&L and cash flow details on the company as it stands today as well as a go-forward Hewlett Packard Enterprise, excluding ES and Software. 
Now let's open it up for questions."

We haven't had a great competitive offering in the entry market. And what you know about the storage market, it's moving from high end to entry very, very fast. So looking forward, I mean, listen, we think the market is going to continue to be soft. But -- and that will keep overall market, our growth muted. But we can continue to gain share, and we are very pleased with our HPE 3PAR all-flash performance that grew 70% year-over-year. So some work to do there, but we feel good about where we are. And on a go-forward basis, I think you'll see us return to growth, little bit more robust growth."

Unfortunately, there aren't that many deals like that, but when they come along, we'll do them."

And at that time, you talked about cash balance being an asset, and net acquisitions would be an integral part of the strategy. You also talked about HPE being a solutions company and a growth company. Less than a year later, it feels like a different story. Cash return has been the absolute priority. Acquisitions have been extremely minimal. Arguably, divesting software and services, which are essential ingredients to many solutions, seems different. And so I applaud the flexibility because the stock price has done extremely well and it's certainly been in the vein of value creation. But I was wondering if you could comment on what appeared to precipitate this change in thinking from I think an impression that seemed different to most from the roadshow a year ago. And is there a different end state for Hewlett Packard Enterprise going forward? I mean, is this really a viable ongoing hardware-centric company going forward? Or should we expect more portfolio rationalization? And believe it or not, I have a follow-up."

So Toni, let me take you all the way back to November 1, 2015 where we separated HP Inc. from Hewlett Packard Enterprise. And we very much laid out the strategy of being a leading provider and a hybrid IT, both in the traditional data center, which by the way is still a robust market. It's 85% of the spend in IT today. And we are the leader there and we need to continue to gain share. And then we wanted to focus on software-defined infrastructure, which is really the next generation of infrastructure that our customers need. And then finally, build out our cloud platform and compute storage and networking at the edge. And that's exactly what we've done. And as we laid out that strategy, we looked at our portfolio. What do we need to add to the portfolio, either in acquisitions or partnerships? What do we need to divest because those assets are noncore to the strategy? It doesn't mean they're bad assets, it's just not -- they're not core to what we are doing. So if you take the ES transaction, listen, we are still going to be in the services business. In fact, 25% of the revenue of HPE will be services. It's just a different kind of services business than IT outsourcing, business process outsourcing and apps maintenance. If you think about software, we're still going to be in the software business. It's just not in application software like ITOM, it is systems software like OneView and the software that powers Synergy. So it is a portfolio matching to the strategy that we see our competitive advantage in. As far as -- I think you asked about further divestitures. So Enterprise Group, as currently configured, needs to stay together. And I'll tell you why. The -- my view of the market is everything is moving to converged, and we have a differentiated position because we have networking, storage and compute. And that is not -- our 2 major competitors are missing a key component of that offering. So that, we think, is important to keep together. And then as you think about Technology Services. Technology Services is a key differentiator for our company. We can help customers support, maintain, advise and consult across the globe, and it would be uneconomic to simply support storage only or networking only. So TS is absolutely integral. And then finally, obviously, campus, branch and edge is a new growth area for the company. There's no reason that we should not own compute at the edge. There's no reason that we shouldn't own analytics at the edge, in addition to, obviously, Aruba. So I think it's -- to some degree, the strategy has evolved but really, quite consistent with what we laid out. And a big part of what we did this past year was portfolio optimization for the strategy. So on a go-forward basis, I think -- as Tim said well, I think you can look for more ROI-based smart acquisitions like Aruba, like SGI. And so, I think it's entirely consistent with the strategy that we laid out a year ago."

So what I mean by that is, I can't help thinking that HP Software business is going to be like 75% of Micro Focus going forward. You're far, far, far bigger than they are from a revenue perspective. And they believe, as a much smaller player, that they can improve operating margins 2,000 basis points. 2,000 basis points on your revenue basis is $750 million a year in operating profit, which add up a 10-multiple, $7.5 billion, even if you haven't given up the business. So I guess the question is, if the margin improvement opportunities are so huge even for a relatively small player, why did you either not extract a better price or why did you not believe that you could have extracted those and created even more value for shareholders?"

They are a pure play software company who is expert at managing mature software assets. And as Micro Focus will tell you, most people who work in the software business in Silicon Valley want to grow assets. And actually, some of these assets should actually be maintained on a stable platform that extends the value for customers. And it's actually not what we do, it is what they do. But then you come to the question of, why did we do a spin merge as opposed to sell the whole business. And the reason is, is because our shareholders will be able to ride the upside of what Micro Focus does. Remember our shareholders will own 50% of the new company. And by the way, I will be a shareholder of that new company, given my vested options and my vested RSUs in HPE, and I can tell you, I will be holding those shares because I think they're going to do very, very well. And so this was a much better alternative than selling the company today on a P/E multiple of operating income because you'd get cash, but you'd pay taxes, and then our shareholders wouldn't get to ride the upside unless they went out and took new money to buy those shares. So we thought that was absolutely the right thing to do. And I have to tell you, Toni, in today's world where technology is changing at lightning speed, I've got to tell you the value of focus, I'm seeing it every single day. And so while maybe back in the day, it was great to be a technology supermarket like the financial supermarkets of yesterday. What I'm pretty sure of is the next 4 or 5 years is going to be all about speed, agility and focus and innovation in something that is a more narrow focus."

But we still remain in the software business, it's just a different kind of software business. As I said, systems software. The software-defined infrastructure is all powered by software. But it's not applications software, if you will, like ITOM or ADM. It is actually systems software that powers the infrastructure of our customers. Now you say, all right, so how do we capitalize on the big data and analytics? Well, first of all, we will be the leader in high-performance compute with the acquisition of SGI. So companies need to process and compute huge amounts -- ever escalating amounts of data. So really, the high-performance compute market, which is an $11 billion business, growing at 68%, will really be between HPE, now with SGI, and Cray, but many of the other competitors like Dell, Lenovo, they are not in that high-performance compute business. So as people need financial services, energy, as they need to compute to process all this big data, if you will, we will be the leading player there. If you think about campus, branch and edge, I think this is the next big growth area. If you think about autonomous driving vehicles, jet engines, health care -- sensors in health care beds and in devices, this is an area where huge amounts of data needs to be processed real time, at the edge as opposed to enduring the latency of coming back to a major data center. So we're going to be able to capitalize on the IoT trend by big data -- by analytics at the edge and be able to compute and store at the edge. So that's the way we'll play in those trends. It will be different than like Vertica, which will go to Micro Focus, which is a big columnar database that processes huge amounts of data on a database side, but we will pick up the ability to process on compute, storage and networking at the edge."

And actually, beyond that, you saw what we announced today with SUSE where they'll be our preferred partner for Linux as well as the OpenStack distro. And listen, a lot of the software products that are going in the spin merge will be important to us going forward. So there will be a relationship there. So let me just give you a sense of, I think we're in a great position to compete with both Cisco and Dell. So for example, actually, the HPE go-forward strategy will be about a $28 billion company that's only slightly smaller than Dell's Enterprise business and it is more focused with better innovation. I think we should just contrast our strategy with Dell. Okay, so we are getting smaller while they're getting bigger. And this is important because I believe speed and agility is critical in innovation and go-to-market. The second is they are levering up and we are delevering. We have $5.3 billion of net cash on the operating company and we're going to have a lot more by the time we're done with these transactions, and that gives us dry powder, it also gives us the ability to return cash to shareholders. And I think it's difficult to be levered as much as Dell is in this environment. And then secondly, we're leaning into new technology, either through our own innovation, acquisitions or partnerships, and we've got major focus on our side. What they're doing is doubling down on old technology in a cost take-out play. And listen, I think it might be quite successful for the leadership team there from a financial perspective. I'm not so sure it's good for customers."

So listen, Cisco is a good competitor, but they are missing a key element, which is storage. And as the -- as this converges, I think as the environment converges and we look at hyper-converged and on Synergy, we're innovating really nicely now for the traditional data center as well as the software-defined data center. And I got to tell you, Aruba at the edge is killing it, and a 20% growth rate above our internal plan, and we're just winning deals hand over fist there. So we feel really good about our ability to compete with Cisco. Okay, so back to servers. So listen, what's happening in servers is there is sort of core server growth; then there is Tier 1 servers, which is to the big service providers; and then is obviously, high-performance compute. And the reason we did the SGI acquisition is to really stake out a great position in an $11 billion business, as I said before, that's growing 68%, that's very profitable for the compute itself, but also, there's very high TS attached to high-performance compute. Core servers around the globe are under some pressure right now. But you saw what we did in terms of increasing the margin. And we are doubling down on SMB, which actually is still -- there's pockets of growth in that area. And we're also doing workload specialization. Okay, we have the best compute in the world to run SAP HANA. It's not even close with anyone else. So we're specializing around workloads. And then obviously, there was a tough compare because of Cloudline a year ago. I mean, we have just ramped that business into a multibillion-dollar business. And so it's hard to compete with those compares, but we expect to continue to gain share in that market profitably. We're not in it for share -- for share's sake. We don't want to take unprofitable deals. But as we continue to work on our supply chain and the rationalization, we become ever more competitive there. And we're very mindful that ultimately there is Chinese competitors there as well. And whether that's Huawei or Lenovo, it's not just Dell. So we're very aware of the cost structure we have to have to continue to compete."

We were not able to hedge in the quarter for the pound degradation. But what we saw was actually a pause in purchasing in the U.K. Certainly, the U.K. public sector, but also the U.K. and then more broadly, Europe, which was, ""Hmm, this was unexpected. A big change. Let's take a pause and decide what we want to do here."" And -- but we saw it in a very market way. What I will say, in the last couple of weeks, we've actually seen orders pick up again. It was almost like they took a pause and basically, had to sort of take stock of what was happening and then basically the orders have started to flow again. I mean, we continue to also monitor the pricing -- competitive pricing environment that we see and we adjust as necessary, particularly in the channel. So the channel is where we serve SMB and that's where our ability to sort of move the pricing in response to competition. We look at that actually every single week, sometimes multiple times a week."

Is there an opportunity, given weakness in certain quarters, that it may dip? Just how should we look at it, because it's obviously very important, from a margin perspective."

TS is and was a very profitable business that was largely attached to Business Critical Systems, very profitable, very high attach -- I mean, you didn't really sell Business Critical Systems without a TS attach. And when Business Critical Systems, both from a market perspective as well as the Oracle Itanium situation, by all rights, TS should be down 25%. Do you remember, Shannon, over the last 4 or 5 years, BCS was down 25% like clockwork, every single quarter for 4 years. It's growing a little bit now. But by all rights, TS should have shrunk with BCS, and it did not. And the reason it did not was very impressive new product offering, Proactive Care, other areas where we help customers maintain their data center estate. And so the fact that it has actually only been down a few percentage points over the last 12 months is a testament to the leadership team in that business. And now what you're seeing is those new product offerings are starting to get real traction. Orders have been positive for the last 3 or 4 quarters, and those orders translated into growth this quarter. Not a significant amount of growth, but 1%, we'll take it all day long, because it is a very, very profitable business. So we have more work to do on Technology Services. I will tell you, it is the benefit of now being a smaller, more focused company. Antonio Neri and I are going to spend a whole lot of time now on what is the next generation of Technology Services and whether that's Flexible Capacity services that allows consumption-based model, where there is proactive care, data center care, we're going to spend a lot of time there because it is a key strategic enabler of RemainCo HPE."

So we're getting closer to those benchmarks. We're not quite there yet, but we are close and we are there in some of the functions. So as we have done these divestitures or as we're doing these divestitures, we obviously incorporate that into what the new cost structure needs to look like. And obviously, we need to be very aggressive around what we call stranded cost. So I think the good news is when you look at the HPE/HPI separation, we did have some dissynergies, we called them. We have worked those through the system. With the H3C divestiture, we've gotten much better with identifying the stranded cost, we're being much more proactive in managing them out. We're starting to see those come out. So we're confident that we can continue to do that to get to the benchmarks we need to get to when these transactions are done."

And whether that is supply chain and logistics. Whether that is how we are organized internally with all R&D under one R&D leader, whether it is putting our software-defined infrastructure and our cloud offering under one leader, whether it is putting all of our go-to-market under one leader where we have consistent go-to-market strategy, discounting across the board. Frankly, we were much better at minimizing discounting in APJ and EMEA than we were in the United States; we now have that discipline across the company. And then finally, corporate overhead, we've got to have a corporate overhead that is designed for a $28 billion company. And when we started, we had a corporate overhead designed for a $110 billion company, and then a $50 billion company, and now a $28 billion company. And I have to say, I'm really pleased with our ability to sort of right-size the corporate overhead and be lean and mean. And that includes everything from HR, finance, legal, IT, things like real estate, systems. So we've made a lot of progress, but you'll see more of that benefit, I think, in '17 and '18."

And while $900 million is $200 million more than $700 million, it seems like to me that the services was a much bigger, heavier-lifting divestiture. So -- and I almost wonder, is $700 million kind of -- why is it so much and not much lower? Or is it just so much integrated in Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, that's why it costs so much to break out?"

Again, we feel like the value that, that transaction is driving is phenomenal for HPE as well as its shareholders. However, to realize that value, we need to make investments and allocate resources to do the separation. So to your point, software, although the activities are similar in nature to the transaction in ES, they are discrete. And they're not necessarily driven by revenue base or headcount level. So when you look at software, it's a global complex business. It has multiple legal entities that had been accumulated over time through a series of transactions. And because of that, when you look at the tax, the finance, the legal and the operating structure, it is still very, very complicated. So in order to separate that, there are some large expense items in there. For example, separating 650 IT systems, doing the carve-out financials, translating GAAP to IFRS, splitting 150 legal entities in 60 countries, trying to figure out what we want to do with 200 real estate sites across the globe. So there's certainly a lot of work that needs to be done there. The good news is we have done this before, so we know how to do it. The team has been very proactive and we're all over it. We have the work streams identified. So we're confident we'll get there when we go forward."

Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the press releases and the slide presentations accompanying today's earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations web page at investors.hpe.com.
As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HPE's filings with the SEC, including its most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements.
We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. 
Finally, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website.
Throughout this conference call, all revenue growth rates presented beginning with fiscal year 2015 are adjusted to exclude the impacts of divestitures and currency. We believe this approach helps provide a better representation of HPE's operational performance given the significant divestitures we've recently completed, including the sale of Mphasis, 51% of our H3C business in China and TippingPoint amongst several others. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our website for details.

FY '16 was a historic year for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. During our first year as a stand-alone company, HPE delivered the business performance we promised, fulfilled our commitment",1600,"Thanks, Andy, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. FY '16 was a historic year for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. During our first year as a stand-alone company, HPE delivered the business performance we promised, fulfilled our commitment to introduce groundbreaking innovation and began to transform the company through strategic changes designed to enable even better focus, flexibility and financial performance.
Our success in FY '16 is proof that we're on the right course. HPE today has the ability to better respond to the constantly evolving marketplace while generating long-term value for shareholders. The leadership team can dive more deeply into products, have more time to spend with customers and partners and can confidently develop our strategy.
From an innovation perspective, we can be much more targeted in the investments we make. The results of all this focus are reflected in our performance. For the year, we delivered revenue of $50.1 billion, up 2% year-over-year when adjusted for divestitures and currency and in line with the outlook we provided at our analyst meeting in 2015. While there is always more work to do, our go-to-market motion is strong and our increased confidence is really paying off.
We saw growth this year in key areas of the portfolio including high-performance compute, Cloudline servers, all-flash storage, converged systems, mission-critical systems and networking with Aruba. Technology Services returned to growth in the last 2 quarters of the year, and we expect that momentum to continue into FY '17.
Strategic Enterprise Services revenue grew over 30%, driven by Helion managed cloud, which grew over 50% and virtual private cloud, which grew over 100%. And in Software, we saw solid SaaS and security growth, with particular strength in Vertica and Voltage solutions. In terms of profitability, we grew our non-GAAP operating profit as a percentage of revenue due in large part to the tremendous progress the Enterprise Services team has made. ES ended the year with a non-GAAP operating profit of 7.7%, above our outlook range of 6% to 7% and in line with our long-term target of 7% to 9%. 
In the Enterprise Group, we continue to hone the balance between revenue growth and profitability. During the past 2 quarters, we've seen steady margin improvement and feel confident that the ongoing cost actions we're taking and the greater mix of converged and software-defined solutions as well as networking and storage will offset the pressure in core servers going forward. And in Software, the team maintained a disciplined focus on cost controls, driving margin improvement in the year.
Overall, we delivered FY '16 non-GAAP EPS of $1.92, at the high end of our original outlook for the year.
Turning to cash flow. We delivered free cash flow of $2.1 billion, above our most recent guided range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. This is particularly strong, given that we were able to offset the lower cash flow resulting from the divestiture of 51% of our H3C business through careful working capital management.
Given the strong cash flow and the proceeds from recent divestitures, we were able to return over $3 billion of cash to shareholders throughout the year and still end the year with an operating company net cash position of $7.6 billion, the highest since I've been with the company.
In FY '16, we also announced strategic changes to the company that will help strengthen our performance over the long term. We completed the divestiture of our stake in Mphasis and our sale of 51% of our H3C business in China. In May, we announced the spin-merge of our Enterprise Services business with CSC. And in September, we announced the spin-merge of our software business with Micro Focus. Together, these transactions are valued at over $20 billion. They will enable us to be more nimble, provide cutting-edge solutions, play in higher-growth markets and have an enhanced financial profile. The success of the separation of HPE and HP Inc. and the progress we've made as an independent company have been recognized by investors. HPE's stock is up more than 50% since we launched the company on November 2, 2015.
Looking forward, the HPE that emerges after the 2 spin-mergers will have a clear vision, the right assets and direct line of sight to significant market opportunities. Our goal is to be the industry's leading provider of hybrid IT, built on the secure, next-generation, software-defined infrastructure that runs our customers' data centers today, bridges them to multi-cloud environments tomorrow and powers the emerging intelligent edge that will run campus, branch and industrial IoT applications for decades to come, all delivered through a world-class services capability.
Let me spend a minute on each element of our vision. First, we believe the world is going to be hybrid, and our mission is to make hybrid IT simple. To do this, we offer market-leading technology across the traditional data center, software-defined infrastructure and private cloud. We're focused on winning in key growth areas in the traditional data center, like big data analytics, high-performance compute, all-flash storage and networking. To that end, this year, we announced game-changing new products with new versions of our Gen9 Servers and 3PAR StoreServ systems. We also acquired SGI, cementing our leadership position in high-performance computing and strengthening our capability in data analytics.
In fact, it was just announced that we now have 140 high-performance computing systems on the Top 500 supercomputing list, more than anyone else in the industry.
In software-defined infrastructure, we launched new categories with offerings like Synergy, the industry's first Composable Infrastructure; and our Hyper Converged 380 solution, which was just named the #1 data center infrastructure product in CRN's annual Tech Innovator Awards, beating out solutions from Dell-EMC and Cisco. And we are establishing an ecosystem of partners to bring together and integrate the industry's best technologies from companies like Arista, Mesosphere, Docker, Chef and Microsoft Azure to allow customers to seamlessly manage across an increasingly complex set of environments.
Second, we will power the emerging intelligent edge. As data volumes increase in business environments outside of the data center, like factories and retail stores, customers need a new set of tools to gather, process and analyze the critical information that will allow them to make decisions in real time. This means that they need compute, storage and connectivity at the edge integrated into their operational environments and seamlessly connected to their hybrid IT environments. Through our Aruba offerings in security, analytics and connectivity and our Edgeline Converged IoT Systems, we're building an ecosystem of partners and bringing unique solutions to this fast-growing market. I like to say we are going to be the IT in IoT.
Third, Services is going to be more critical than ever. As customers look to deploy both hybrid IT and the intelligent edge programs, they need a partner who can help them manage through change and complexity. Our Technology Services organization delivers world-class advisory, support and consumption models as well as building customer solutions from the ground up. In addition to our TS group that provides these advisory, transformation and support capabilities, our Financial Services organization brings the financial flexibility and consumption models that our customers are increasingly looking for.
With this portfolio, we estimate we have a total addressable market of over $250 billion that's grown [ph] at 2% to 3% a year. And within that, there are areas of very high growth like high-performance compute, private cloud, software-defined networking and industrial IoT. We are already well positioned to lead in these areas, and you will see us continue to invest in a targeted way.
What is most exciting is that our approach is resonating with our customers, partners and the industry. In the fourth quarter, we continued to win customers looking for hybrid IT and intelligent edge solutions and services. For example, in hybrid IT, we recently replaced a 19-year EMC relationship with a major global health care company, where we will provide services and technology to deliver simplicity, operating efficiencies and automation as the company modernizes and realigns their core storage and compute platforms.
In the intelligent edge market, Nordstrom recently named Aruba as their preferred provider for their WiFi services strategy in all their stores, distribution centers and corporate sites. And we announced a significant new wireless network rollout at Penske Truck Leasing to enable greater workforce productivity and connectivity at its truck facilities.
Finally, our Technology Services business continues to deliver significant value to customers and win deals. For example, in Q4, TS won a major 5-year deal with its flexible capacity service for a large European auto manufacturer. It also won a 5-year agreement with a large global bank based in Europe, which chose our Datacenter Care service to operate its data centers around the world.
Looking ahead, next week, we kick off Discover London, where we will bring together nearly 10,000 customers and partners to demo our latest products and services. During the week, you will see exciting product announcements across hybrid IT and the intelligent edge and hear from some of our customers about how we are helping them achieve their business outcomes.
So overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we made in FY '16. We delivered the financial performance we promised, fulfilled our commitment to groundbreaking innovation and began to transform the company in ways we believe will deliver an exciting future for customers, partners, employees and investors. I'm excited about the path we see ahead and very much look forward to the journey.
And now I will hand the call over to Tim, who will provide details on the quarter."

I agree that fiscal year '16 was a strong first year across a number of fronts. We successfully delivered the financial outlook we laid out at the beginning of the year while making several strategic portfolio changes.
Now I'll spend some time providing more detail on our fourth quarter results. Overall, I'd say that we performed well in a tough market and continued to make progress improving our cost structure and strengthening our go-to-market approach. Fourth quarter revenue of $12.5 billion was down approximately 2% when adjusted for divestitures and currency as we continued to focus on profitable market share and executed well in an uneven global demand environment. From a macro perspective, we saw a continued revenue softness in Europe, particularly in ES, due to a persistent slowing in the U.K. public sector business. On an as-reported basis, performance in the Americas was encouraging, with low single-digit growth in the Enterprise Group and Services. APJ performance was mixed, with improved EG and ES results in both China and Japan but weakness in the rest of Asia.
Currency fluctuations were a headwind to revenue by 110 basis points year-over-year, driven by depreciation in the British pound and somewhat offset by appreciation in the Japanese yen.
Turning to profitability. Gross margin of 30.4% was up 80 basis points year-over-year due to continued improvements to deal profitability in Enterprise Services. Sequentially, gross margin was up 110 basis points, principally due to normal seasonal uplift in both ES and Software. We continued to drive cost productivity and reduced non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue by 120 basis points sequentially and 70 basis points year-over-year, with significant improvements in ES delivery costs. Also, EG continued to execute on the cost plan we discussed at SAM in order to further align costs with revenue. Given those actions, non-GAAP operating profit at 11.1% was up 150 basis points year-over-year and 230 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.61 was in line with our outlook of $0.58 to $0.63. For the full year, non-GAAP net diluted earnings per share was $1.92, in the center of our outlook of $1.90 to $1.95.
Fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes tax obligation settlements of $647 million and pretax amounts for restructuring charges of $395 million, separation charges of $293 million and amortization of intangible assets of $126 million, offset by tax indemnification adjustments of $311 million and the gain from the Mphasis divestiture of $253 million.
We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.18, below our previously provided outlook range of $0.44 to $0.49, primarily due to the previously mentioned settlements of outstanding Hewlett-Packard Company tax obligations that we shared with HP Inc. through our separation agreement.
Now turning to results by business. In the Enterprise Group, we continue to work on improving operating margins by focusing on profitable deals, reducing discretionary spend and delayering as we rightsize the organization ahead of the separation from ES and Software. Operating margins, while down slightly year-over-year, were up 60 basis points sequentially to 13.2%.
Revenue declined 3% in Q4. However, we had several areas of encouraging growth across the portfolio. Aruba was up 13%; all-flash arrays were up more than 100%; high-performance compute was up more than 30%, and we had our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in mission-critical systems. And our highest-margin business, Technology Services, grew for the second consecutive quarter. These results are a reflection of the continued investments we've made in our higher-growth businesses like our software-defined, converged and hyper converged offerings as well as our go-to-market efforts.
Server revenue declined 6% as growth in high-performance and mission-critical compute was offset by pressure on the core servers and service provider vertical. In the core, we saw some incremental competitive pressure, particularly in blades. However, our recently launched Synergy line will allow us to better compete in the blade segment, and we anticipate taking back share as this product line ramps.
As we've previously discussed, we are prioritizing profit over market share and, as a result, saw some sales contraction in Tier 1. While this has put some pressure on revenue, we see opportunities to grow in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 spaces, which are growing faster and have better economics, including greater TS attach. Encouragingly, the growth in high-performance compute and mission-critical systems was independent of our acquisition of SGI, which we completed just after the end of the quarter and should help drive further profitable growth.
Storage revenue declined 3% with continued contraction in the legacy portfolio. However, the higher-margin converged storage portfolio was up 1% and is now 56% of the total storage mix. Traditional storage declined by 11%, particularly challenged by weakness in entry storage. However, our recently introduced MSA entry offerings should drive improvement going forward. 3PAR plus XP plus EVA was up 2%, while all-flash 3PAR revenue grew nearly 100% and now makes up approximately 50% of total 3PAR revenue. Keep in mind, all-flash only makes up 10% of data center storage today, so we see a significant growth opportunity going forward. We also anticipate some uplift from our recently announced compression offerings, which fill a gap in our portfolio.
Networking revenue was flat, but encouragingly, Aruba continued to take share and grew 13%. We should see this growth in Aruba accelerate next quarter, as we had some installations in the quarter pushed out into Q1. Also, we did see a slowdown on E-rate government infrastructure spending for education, which impacted both wireless and switching in campus. And keep in mind that we've [ph] just launched our new Arista partnership, which enables us to offer a highly differentiated data center networking solutions, which we expect will grow in future quarters.
Technology Services grew for the second consecutive quarter, with revenue up 2%. Orders have also returned to growth in the quarter and grew for the full year. We saw encouraging performance in nonattach and proactive services and continue to improve service intensity or attach dollars per unit, both of which are helping to offset increased Tier 1 mix and lower server units [ph].
Enterprise Services revenue declined 2%, as growth in the Americas and APJ was more than offset by softness in EMEA. For the full year, revenue declined 1.1%, in line with the outlook we provided at the 2015 Analyst Day. Operating profit improved 250 basis points year-over-year to 10.7%, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2009, as the team continues to execute on productivity improvements in delivery and sales. For the full year, we delivered operating margins of 7.7%, well above our original guidance of 6% to 7%.
We continue to track against our longer-term goal of 60% headcount in low-cost locations and completed the quarter with 51% of our headcount in low-cost locations. This is an 8-point improvement since the beginning of the fiscal year. It's also worth highlighting that our customer satisfaction has increased following these cost structure improvements and the spin-merge announcement. 
Software revenue was flat, as strength in security was offset by declines in IT management and big data. We have stabilized license revenue, which was only down 1% as compared to down 18% in Q3. Also encouragingly, the renewal rate for high-margin support contracts improved 3 points year-over-year to over 90%. SaaS had another record quarter with 11% revenue growth. The team also continue to focus on disciplined cost controls. And as a result, the operating margin improved 220 basis points to 32.1%.
HPE Financial Services revenue grew 2% and delivered its second consecutive quarter of year-over-year as-reported revenue growth. Operating profit declined 70 basis points year-over-year to 10.2% from higher operating expenses and lower residual maturities. Financing volume declined 3% in constant currency from a tough compare. Return on equity was down 200 basis points year-over-year to 14.1% and was pressured by lower residual sales resulting from lower volumes in fiscal year '13 and fiscal year '14.
Cash flow generation was strong in the quarter as we continue to improve working capital management. Cash flow from operations was $2.2 billion, up 44% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. And free cash flow was $1.5 billion, up 84% year-over-year on an adjusted basis.
For the full year, we generated free cash flow of $2.1 billion, above our most recent outlook of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. And despite the H3C divestiture, delivered cash flow in line with our original guidance for the year. The cash conversion cycle was 6 days, down 12 days sequentially. Payables were the largest contributor to working capital improvement as we continue to make progress with the vendor terms.
Turning to capital allocation. During the quarter, we paid $92 million as part of our normal dividend. We also continued to reduce share count in the fourth quarter through our accelerated share repurchase program, which require all cash be paid when the program started in Q3. For the full year, we returned over $3 billion of capital to shareholders primarily through $2.7 billion of share repurchases. This is approximately 3x our original commitment at the start of the year. 
Lastly, as part of our continued efforts to return capital to shareholders, we increased our dividend payment by 18% to $0.065 per share, effective for the January 4, 2017 payment.
Now moving to the announced spin-merge transactions. Both the ES, CSC and software Micro Focus transactions are on schedule and on budget. We filed the initial Form-10 and S-4 for the ES CSC spin-merge earlier this month. We anticipate filing the final registration statements in late February, and we're on track to complete the transaction by April 1. The software Micro Focus transaction is also progressing as planned, and we continue to anticipate transaction closing at approximately August 31.
We recently gave detailed fiscal year '17 guidance at our Securities Analyst Day, and I encourage you to review our financial overview presentation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook. However, I think it's worth reiterating a few points. We continue to expect fiscal year '17 non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $2 to $2.10 for the combined HPE as it stands today; $1.25 to $1.35 for the future HPE; and reported EPS of $1.45 to $1.55.
Normalized free cash flow for the combined HPE should be $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, while future HPE will generate $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion in fiscal year '17. And we expect reported free cash flow of negative $1.8 billion as cash will be significantly impacted by restructuring and separation payments, the ES pension funding and the midyear impact of the spin-merge transactions on cash generation.
As we discussed at FAM, please keep in mind that Q1 will use a significant amount of cash, and cash flow will be even more back-end loaded in fiscal year '17 as compared to normal seasonality. The key drivers include the fact that our first quarter is typically the weakest cash-generating quarter due to the seasonality of ES and software earnings. We also make our annual bonus payment in Q1, and we expect to fund the majority of the ES pension payment in the first quarter. And finally, we expect Q1 '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.42 to $0.46, and we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.03 to $0.07.

And something to link that, there was a period of time where your storage business was gaining share on top of that, your networking business is benefiting, not only with Aruba, but also because Aruba was driving revenue synergy with switching. Has that now fully played out? Or should that growth there return at some point?"
273983758,408982995,1090779,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 22, 2016",2016-11-22,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Yes. Let me talk about the decline in the growth rates in the last 2 quarters, and particularly, Q4. But I would say when you look at the full year, the company grew 2% and Enterprise Group, obviously which is going to be the anchor of the go-forward Hewl",643,"Yes. Let me talk about the decline in the growth rates in the last 2 quarters, and particularly, Q4. But I would say when you look at the full year, the company grew 2% and Enterprise Group, obviously which is going to be the anchor of the go-forward Hewlett Packard Enterprise grew 3% for the year. But I think as FY '16 demonstrated that there are challenges, balancing revenue and margins in EG. And now we are going to be focused on growing overall operating profit dollars. So as you know in the first half, we delivered great growth. And then the second half, well, we delivered great growth, but the margins were lower than we would have liked. In the second half, we pivoted back more towards margins, focusing on the profitable builds in the cost structure that result in a quarter-over-quarter margin improvement of 90 basis points in Q3 and another 60 basis points in Q4, but revenue slowed to flat in Q3 and was down 3% in Q4. So we really have -- we spent some time tight trading, if you will, the balance between revenue growth and profitability.
And so now as I look at 2017, I think we can grow revenue and operating margins at the same time going forward. And let me tell you why I think that. First is we need to shore up core ISS rack with improvements in the channel, improvements in the quote to cash and more focus on the distributors and the bars for the volume-related ISS rack business. Second, we've got to continue to invest in the higher-growth businesses, which are doing pretty well. High-performance compute with SGI, 3PAR all-flash, Aruba, Synergy, the HC 380. And those offerings are actually growing nicely and are accretive to the overall Enterprise Group margin. Third, and this is  one of those unintended great consequences of the separation of ES from the Hewlett Packard remaining company is that alliances with former ES competitors like Accenture, PWC, the Indian outsourcers, they no longer view us as a competitor, and we are being integrated into a lot of their offerings that we were never integrated in before. And it's been fascinating to me how much more traction I think we're going to get with those alliance partners. And then fourth, we're enhancing our go-to-market with a new focus on Tier 2 and Tier 3 that offer better growth at a higher margin. And then finally, as you noted in the quarter, TS has returned to growth, and this is important because of the margins in TS. Everyone knows how margin-rich TS is, so even a slight return to growth in TS actually helps mitigate margin pressure in ISS rack. And then lastly, we're continuing to optimize our cost structure, a flatter and leaner organization with lower G&A spend, tighter alignment of R&D spend to the market opportunities and then a further improvement in our go-to-market model. So we said we sort of titrated a bit during the year, first half was faster growth lower margin. Second half of the year was lower growth higher margin. And now, we've got a drive down the middle of the highway for next year. And as I outlined, I think there's real good reasons to think that's going to be the case. With regard to networking, Aruba actually is doing really well. It was a little slower growth this quarter because a big implementation moved into Q4. It is still driving campus switching. And then, of course, now we are a reseller of Aruba -- I mean, of Arista and so those revenues will fall in our P&L, and the margin that we make selling Arista will actually be margin accretive to the overall EG group. So that's why I'm optimistic about revenue growth and operating margin in EG in 2017."

And your comps became more difficult in the second half, and you were unable to grow in the bad news is the comps are even tougher for the next couple of quarters for EG. And I can't help noting that your characterization of the server market is much more cautious than it was a couple of quarters ago. I think you characterized it as seeing ongoing pressure in core servers and talking about hyper converged being lower margins and lower support attach. And so it feels as though the markets are getting tougher if you adjust for comps I'm not sure for the performance in for TS. I'm not sure the performance was much better in the second half. So I was wondering if you could characterize what you think the status of the server market is going forward and what you think is a realistic market growth rate on a go-forward basis and whether my characteristic of you're having a different opinion of that now versus 6 months ago is fair."

I would say when you look at the market -- and we did say better way we thought it was going to be tougher in the second half. The main pressure we're seeing is in ISS rack, a little bit in blades, but frankly, we're going to recovery in blades because of Synergy. But I ISS rack is where the most ongoing pressure. Hyper converged is actually growing and is higher margin than our core ISS product as is Synergy, as is high-performance compute, as is mission-critical systems and of course, as is TS. So the main area that we've got to work on is shoring up that ISS rack, and that's all volume based and it's all through the channel so VARs, things like our newly redone value-added reseller program and our ability to do quote to cash fast and our ability to fulfill faster than our competitors. So I would say that if we can shore up ISS rack that I'm confident in the growth rate of these other businesses that we're in our gaining real traction in. So there's weakness in ISS rack. I think we are not executing as well as we could, and we aim to fix that."

It was primarily driven through working capital improvements. And to your point about sustainability, we do think it's sustainable because when you look at the improvements we've made in '16, in general, it's really around 3 areas. So if you look at AP, for example, we went out in 2016 and we hit up all of our suppliers and extended our payment terms. So those terms should hold through 2017. And they came in, in the fourth quarter a little bit better, the improvement came in our bit better than we had anticipated. If you look at the AR, we really spent a lot of time this year improving our processes, improving our line of sight around past dues as an example. So we've cut our past dues from, call it, 10% down to 5%. And again those are sustainable as you think about going into 2017 assuming we execute. And then even in inventory, inventory levels were lower than we had anticipated in Q4. Again, similar to AR, we put in some tighter reporting, improved accountability, particularly around buffer stocking and our key commodities. So we have plans in place and more important, I think we have better visibility and accountability to execute, so we would anticipate those to hold in 2017. The only thing I would say about 2017 is we don't guide cash flow on a quarterly basis. But just keep in mind, if you are looking at CCC, there tends to be a seasonal uplift from Q4 to Q1, and that's primarily driven by purchasing linearity. But overall, we feel comfortable with our guidance in '17."

And the M&A that's worked for us is 3com, 3PAR, Aruba, SGI. What do they have in common? Reasonable and understandable valuations. Enhancing the current portfolio, leveraging our distribution capabilities and driving profitable growth. But we are very focused on our returns-based look at this. And as Tim said, we still think that the stock price that's embedded in Hewlett Packard Enterprise today around the main Keio if you could sort of pull everything software is worth, what you think ES is worth, we still think there's tremendous value in the remaining company that's still embedded in overall HPE. So stock repurchase -- and as I said stock repurchase, share buyback is that's where we lean towards."

And so we really want to make sure that we make money on these deals, and profitable deals in CloudLine is more important than market share. That said, CloudLine particularly relevant, not only in Tier 1 but Tier 2 and Tier 3. The profit margins are better in Tier 2 and Tier 3. So I think CloudLine has a bright future in 2017, especially as we do a better job of penetrating Tier 2 and Tier 3, which is the sales force is all focused on. But frankly, there's not a big sales force component to those deals. The sales force gets the leads and then it's turned over to an engineering sale, so it has lower FSC associated with it. But CloudLine has been absolutely the right thing for us to do. We just need to continue to lever into profitable deals."

Having said that, it's very early in the year and we do have some hedging programs in place. So we didn't feel it was prudent at this stage to adjust our guide. And then in addition to that, the teams are being very proactive and very aggressive around the cost structure.

We like our strategy of getting smaller and more focused, while they're still integrating a very large acquisition. And Lenovo, we intercepted a huge amount of server volume in the move from IBM to Lenovo, and we haven't seen them pop bought back yet. I don't ever count Lenovo out so they may just get ready to get off the map here, but we'll see in the next 6 to 18 months. And then we're actually seeing some Huawei pressure in Latin America and a little bit in Europe, not in the United States, little bit in Europe, quite a bit in Latin America.

One is our execution in the channel and pricing and things like that. And the second is the move to public cloud. I mean, we're definitely seeing some impact there, offset by growth in other areas. From a 1% to 2% range, my view is, from our perspective that's a revenue number and longer term. Our revenues are holding up better than the units because of our high attach and then also the features and functionality that we add on to those servers, whether that storage or whatever happens to be. So again we look at -- when we look at units share, but it revenue share and we also look at share profits and we are gaining share of profits in this business which is actually really important. So that's kind of the way we think about it. So I think actually 1% to 2% feels pretty reasonable to me.

FY '16 was a historic year for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. During our first year as a stand-alone company, HPE delivered the business performance we promised, fulfilled our commitment",1600,"Thanks, Andy, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. FY '16 was a historic year for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. During our first year as a stand-alone company, HPE delivered the business performance we promised, fulfilled our commitment to introduce groundbreaking innovation and began to transform the company through strategic changes designed to enable even better focus, flexibility and financial performance.
Our success in FY '16 is proof that we're on the right course. HPE today has the ability to better respond to the constantly evolving marketplace while generating long-term value for shareholders. The leadership team can dive more deeply into products, have more time to spend with customers and partners and can confidently develop our strategy.
From an innovation perspective, we can be much more targeted in the investments we make. The results of all this focus are reflected in our performance. For the year, we delivered revenue of $50.1 billion, up 2% year-over-year when adjusted for divestitures and currency and in line with the outlook we provided at our analyst meeting in 2015. While there is always more work to do, our go-to-market motion is strong and our increased confidence is really paying off.
We saw growth this year in key areas of the portfolio including high-performance compute, Cloudline servers, all-flash storage, converged systems, mission-critical systems and networking with Aruba. Technology Services returned to growth in the last 2 quarters of the year, and we expect that momentum to continue into FY '17.
Strategic Enterprise Services revenue grew over 30%, driven by Helion managed cloud, which grew over 50% and virtual private cloud, which grew over 100%. And in Software, we saw solid SaaS and security growth, with particular strength in Vertica and Voltage solutions. In terms of profitability, we grew our non-GAAP operating profit as a percentage of revenue due in large part to the tremendous progress the Enterprise Services team has made. ES ended the year with a non-GAAP operating profit of 7.7%, above our outlook range of 6% to 7% and in line with our long-term target of 7% to 9%. 
In the Enterprise Group, we continue to hone the balance between revenue growth and profitability. During the past 2 quarters, we've seen steady margin improvement and feel confident that the ongoing cost actions we're taking and the greater mix of converged and software-defined solutions as well as networking and storage will offset the pressure in core servers going forward. And in Software, the team maintained a disciplined focus on cost controls, driving margin improvement in the year.
Overall, we delivered FY '16 non-GAAP EPS of $1.92, at the high end of our original outlook for the year.
Turning to cash flow. We delivered free cash flow of $2.1 billion, above our most recent guided range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. This is particularly strong, given that we were able to offset the lower cash flow resulting from the divestiture of 51% of our H3C business through careful working capital management.
Given the strong cash flow and the proceeds from recent divestitures, we were able to return over $3 billion of cash to shareholders throughout the year and still end the year with an operating company net cash position of $7.6 billion, the highest since I've been with the company.
In FY '16, we also announced strategic changes to the company that will help strengthen our performance over the long term. We completed the divestiture of our stake in Mphasis and our sale of 51% of our H3C business in China. In May, we announced the spin-merge of our Enterprise Services business with CSC. And in September, we announced the spin-merge of our software business with Micro Focus. Together, these transactions are valued at over $20 billion. They will enable us to be more nimble, provide cutting-edge solutions, play in higher-growth markets and have an enhanced financial profile. The success of the separation of HPE and HP Inc. and the progress we've made as an independent company have been recognized by investors. HPE's stock is up more than 50% since we launched the company on November 2, 2015.
Looking forward, the HPE that emerges after the 2 spin-mergers will have a clear vision, the right assets and direct line of sight to significant market opportunities. Our goal is to be the industry's leading provider of hybrid IT, built on the secure, next-generation, software-defined infrastructure that runs our customers' data centers today, bridges them to multi-cloud environments tomorrow and powers the emerging intelligent edge that will run campus, branch and industrial IoT applications for decades to come, all delivered through a world-class services capability.
Let me spend a minute on each element of our vision. First, we believe the world is going to be hybrid, and our mission is to make hybrid IT simple. To do this, we offer market-leading technology across the traditional data center, software-defined infrastructure and private cloud. We're focused on winning in key growth areas in the traditional data center, like big data analytics, high-performance compute, all-flash storage and networking. To that end, this year, we announced game-changing new products with new versions of our Gen9 Servers and 3PAR StoreServ systems. We also acquired SGI, cementing our leadership position in high-performance computing and strengthening our capability in data analytics.
In fact, it was just announced that we now have 140 high-performance computing systems on the Top 500 supercomputing list, more than anyone else in the industry.
In software-defined infrastructure, we launched new categories with offerings like Synergy, the industry's first Composable Infrastructure; and our Hyper Converged 380 solution, which was just named the #1 data center infrastructure product in CRN's annual Tech Innovator Awards, beating out solutions from Dell-EMC and Cisco. And we are establishing an ecosystem of partners to bring together and integrate the industry's best technologies from companies like Arista, Mesosphere, Docker, Chef and Microsoft Azure to allow customers to seamlessly manage across an increasingly complex set of environments.
Second, we will power the emerging intelligent edge. As data volumes increase in business environments outside of the data center, like factories and retail stores, customers need a new set of tools to gather, process and analyze the critical information that will allow them to make decisions in real time. This means that they need compute, storage and connectivity at the edge integrated into their operational environments and seamlessly connected to their hybrid IT environments. Through our Aruba offerings in security, analytics and connectivity and our Edgeline Converged IoT Systems, we're building an ecosystem of partners and bringing unique solutions to this fast-growing market. I like to say we are going to be the IT in IoT.
Third, Services is going to be more critical than ever. As customers look to deploy both hybrid IT and the intelligent edge programs, they need a partner who can help them manage through change and complexity. Our Technology Services organization delivers world-class advisory, support and consumption models as well as building customer solutions from the ground up. In addition to our TS group that provides these advisory, transformation and support capabilities, our Financial Services organization brings the financial flexibility and consumption models that our customers are increasingly looking for.
With this portfolio, we estimate we have a total addressable market of over $250 billion that's growing [ph] at 2% to 3% a year. And within that, there are areas of very high growth like high-performance compute, private cloud, software-defined networking and industrial IoT. We are already well positioned to lead in these areas, and you will see us continue to invest in a targeted way.
What is most exciting is that our approach is resonating with our customers, partners and the industry. In the fourth quarter, we continued to win customers looking for hybrid IT and intelligent edge solutions and services. For example, in hybrid IT, we recently replaced a 19-year EMC relationship with a major global health care company, where we will provide services and technology to deliver simplicity, operating efficiencies and automation as the company modernizes and realigns their core storage and compute platforms.
In the intelligent edge market, Nordstrom recently named Aruba as their preferred provider for their WiFi services strategy in all their stores, distribution centers and corporate sites. And we announced a significant new wireless network rollout at Penske Truck Leasing to enable greater workforce productivity and connectivity at its truck facilities.
Finally, our Technology Services business continues to deliver significant value to customers and win deals. For example, in Q4, TS won a major 5-year deal with its flexible capacity service for a large European auto manufacturer. It also won a 5-year agreement with a large global bank based in Europe, which chose our Datacenter Care service to operate its data centers around the world.
Looking ahead, next week, we kick off Discover London, where we will bring together nearly 10,000 customers and partners to demo our latest products and services. During the week, you will see exciting product announcements across hybrid IT and the intelligent edge and hear from some of our customers about how we are helping them achieve their business outcomes.
So overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we made in FY '16. We delivered the financial performance we promised, fulfilled our commitment to groundbreaking innovation and began to transform the company in ways we believe will deliver an exciting future for customers, partners, employees and investors. I'm excited about the path we see ahead and very much look forward to the journey.
And now I will hand the call over to Tim, who will provide details on the quarter."

I agree that fiscal year '16 was a strong first year across a number of fronts. We successfully delivered the financial outlook we laid out at the beginning of the year while making several strategic portfolio changes.
Now I'll spend some time providing more detail on our fourth quarter results. Overall, I'd say that we performed well in a tough market and continued to make progress improving our cost structure and strengthening our go-to-market approach. Fourth quarter revenue of $12.5 billion was down approximately 2% when adjusted for divestitures and currency as we continued to focus on profitable market share and executed well in an uneven global demand environment. From a macro perspective, we saw a continued revenue softness in Europe, particularly in ES, due to a persistent slowing in the U.K. public sector business. On an as-reported basis, performance in the Americas was encouraging, with low single-digit growth in the Enterprise Group and Services. APJ performance was mixed, with improved EG and ES results in both China and Japan but weakness in the rest of Asia.
Currency fluctuations were a headwind to revenue by 110 basis points year-over-year, driven by depreciation in the British pound and somewhat offset by appreciation in the Japanese yen.
Turning to profitability. Gross margin of 30.4% was up 80 basis points year-over-year due to continued improvements to deal profitability in Enterprise Services. Sequentially, gross margin was up 110 basis points, principally due to normal seasonal uplift in both ES and Software. We continued to drive cost productivity and reduced non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue by 120 basis points sequentially and 70 basis points year-over-year, with significant improvements in ES delivery costs. Also, EG continued to execute on the cost plan we discussed at SAM in order to further align costs with revenue. Given those actions, non-GAAP operating profit at 11.1% was up 150 basis points year-over-year and 230 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.61 was in line with our outlook of $0.58 to $0.63. For the full year, non-GAAP net diluted earnings per share was $1.92, in the center of our outlook of $1.90 to $1.95.
Fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes tax obligation settlements of $647 million and pretax amounts for restructuring charges of $395 million, separation charges of $293 million and amortization of intangible assets of $126 million, offset by tax indemnification adjustments of $311 million and the gain from the Mphasis divestiture of $253 million.
We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.18, below our previously provided outlook range of $0.44 to $0.49, primarily due to the previously mentioned settlements of outstanding Hewlett-Packard Company tax obligations that we shared with HP Inc. through our separation agreement.
Now turning to results by business. In the Enterprise Group, we continue to work on improving operating margins by focusing on profitable deals, reducing discretionary spend and delayering as we rightsize the organization ahead of the separation from ES and Software. Operating margins, while down slightly year-over-year, were up 60 basis points sequentially to 13.2%.
Revenue declined 3% in Q4. However, we had several areas of encouraging growth across the portfolio. Aruba was up 13%; all-flash arrays were up more than 100%; high-performance compute was up more than 30%, and we had our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in mission-critical systems. And our highest-margin business, Technology Services, grew for the second consecutive quarter. These results are a reflection of the continued investments we've made in our higher-growth businesses like our software-defined, converged and hyper converged offerings as well as our go-to-market efforts.
Server revenue declined 6% as growth in high-performance and mission-critical compute was offset by pressure on the core servers and service provider vertical. In the core, we saw some incremental competitive pressure, particularly in blades. However, our recently launched Synergy line will allow us to better compete in the blade segment, and we anticipate taking back share as this product line ramps.
As we've previously discussed, we are prioritizing profit over market share and, as a result, saw some sales contraction in Tier 1. While this has put some pressure on revenue, we see opportunities to grow in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 spaces, which are growing faster and have better economics, including greater TS attach. Encouragingly, the growth in high-performance compute and mission-critical systems was independent of our acquisition of SGI, which we completed just after the end of the quarter and should help drive further profitable growth.
Storage revenue declined 3% with continued contraction in the legacy portfolio. However, the higher-margin converged storage portfolio was up 1% and is now 56% of the total storage mix. Traditional storage declined by 11%, particularly challenged by weakness in entry storage. However, our recently introduced MSA entry offerings should drive improvement going forward. 3PAR plus XP plus EVA was up 2%, while all-flash 3PAR revenue grew nearly 100% and now makes up approximately 50% of total 3PAR revenue. Keep in mind, all-flash only makes up 10% of data center storage today, so we see a significant growth opportunity going forward. We also anticipate some uplift from our recently announced compression offerings, which fill a gap in our portfolio.
Networking revenue was flat, but encouragingly, Aruba continued to take share and grew 13%. We should see this growth in Aruba accelerate next quarter, as we had some installations in the quarter pushed out into Q1. Also, we did see a slowdown on E-rate government infrastructure spending for education, which impacted both wireless and switching in campus. And keep in mind that we'd just launched our new Arista partnership, which enables us to offer a highly differentiated data center networking solutions, which we expect will grow in future quarters.
Technology Services grew for the second consecutive quarter, with revenue up 2%. Orders have also returned to growth in the quarter and grew for the full year. We saw encouraging performance in nonattach and proactive services and continue to improve service intensity or attach dollars per unit, both of which are helping to offset increased Tier 1 mix and lower server units.
Enterprise Services revenue declined 2%, as growth in the Americas and APJ was more than offset by softness in EMEA. For the full year, revenue declined 1.1%, in line with the outlook we provided at the 2015 Analyst Day. Operating profit improved 250 basis points year-over-year to 10.7%, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2009, as the team continues to execute on productivity improvements in delivery and sales. For the full year, we delivered operating margins of 7.7%, well above our original guidance of 6% to 7%.
We continue to track against our longer-term goal of 60% headcount in low-cost locations and completed the quarter with 51% of our headcount in low-cost locations. This is an 8-point improvement since the beginning of the fiscal year. It's also worth highlighting that our customer satisfaction has increased following these cost structure improvements and the spin-merge announcement. 
Software revenue was flat, as strength in security was offset by declines in IT management and big data. We have stabilized license revenue, which was only down 1% as compared to down 18% in Q3. Also encouragingly, the renewal rate for high-margin support contracts improved 3 points year-over-year to over 90%. SaaS had another record quarter with 11% revenue growth. The team also continued to focus on disciplined cost controls, and as a result, the operating margin improved 220 basis points to 32.1%.
HPE Financial Services revenue grew 2% and delivered its second consecutive quarter of year-over-year as-reported revenue growth. Operating profit declined 70 basis points year-over-year to 10.2% from higher operating expenses and lower residual maturities. Financing volume declined 3% in constant currency from a tough compare. Return on equity was down 200 basis points year-over-year to 14.1% and was pressured by lower residual sales resulting from lower volumes in fiscal year '13 and fiscal year '14.
Cash flow generation was strong in the quarter as we continue to improve working capital management. Cash flow from operations was $2.2 billion, up 44% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. And free cash flow was $1.5 billion, up 84% year-over-year on an adjusted basis.
For the full year, we generated free cash flow of $2.1 billion, above our most recent outlook of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, and despite the H3C divestiture, delivered cash flow in line with our original guidance for the year. The cash conversion cycle was 6 days, down 12 days sequentially. Payables were the largest contributor to working capital improvement as we continue to make progress with vendor terms.
Turning to capital allocation. During the quarter, we paid $92 million as part of our normal dividend. We also continued to reduce share count in the fourth quarter through our accelerated share repurchase program, which required all cash be paid when the program started in Q3. For the full year, we returned over $3 billion of capital to shareholders, primarily through $2.7 billion of share repurchases. This is approximately 3x our original commitment at the start of the year. 
Lastly, as part of our continued efforts to return capital to shareholders, we increased our dividend payment by 18% to $0.065 per share, effective for the January 4, 2017, payment.
Now moving to the announced spin-merge transactions. Both the ES, CSC and Software Micro Focus transactions are on schedule and on budget. We filed the initial Form-10 and S-4 for the ES-CSC spin-merge earlier this month. We anticipate filing the final registration statements in late February, and we're on track to complete the transaction by April 1. The Software-Micro Focus transaction is also progressing as planned, and we continue to anticipate the transaction closing on approximately August 31.
We recently gave detailed fiscal year '17 guidance at our Securities Analyst Day, and I encourage you to review our financial overview presentation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook. However, I think it's worth reiterating a few points. We continue to expect fiscal year '17 non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $2 to $2.10 for the combined HPE as it stands today; $1.25 to $1.35 for the future HPE; and reported EPS of $1.45 to $1.55.
Normalized free cash flow for the combined HPE should be $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, while future HPE will generate $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion in fiscal year '17. And we expect reported free cash flow of negative $1.8 billion, as cash will be significantly impacted by restructuring and separation payments, the ES pension funding and the midyear impact of the spin-merge transactions on cash generation.
As we discussed at SAM, please keep in mind that Q1 will use a significant amount of cash, and cash flow will be even more back-end-loaded in fiscal year '17 as compared to normal seasonality. The key drivers include the fact that our first quarter is typically the weakest cash-generating quarter due to the seasonality of ES and Software earnings. We also make our annual bonus payment in Q1, and we expect to fund the majority of the ES pension payment in the first quarter. 
And finally, we expect Q1 '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.42 to $0.46, and we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.03 to $0.07.
Now let's open it up for questions."

So as you know, in the first half, we delivered great growth. And then the second half, well, we delivered great growth, but the margins were lower than we would have liked. In the second half, we pivoted back more towards margins, focusing on the profitable deals and improving our cost structure that resulted in a quarter-over-quarter margin improvement of 90 basis points in Q3 and another 60 basis points in Q4, but revenue slowed to flat in Q3 and was down 3% in Q4. So we really have -- we've spent some time titrating, if you will, the balance between revenue growth and profitability.
And so now as I look at 2017, I think we can grow revenue and operating margins at the same time going forward, and let me tell you why I think that. First is we need to shore up core ISS rack with improvements in the channel, improvements in quote-to-cash and focus -- more focus on the distributors and VARs for the volume-related ISS rack business. Second, we've got to continue to invest in the higher-growth businesses, which are doing pretty well. High-performance compute with SGI, 3PAR all-flash, Aruba, Synergy, the HC 380. And those offerings are actually growing nicely and are accretive to the overall Enterprise Group margin. Third, and this is one of those unintended great consequences of the separation of ES from the Hewlett Packard remaining company, is that alliances with former ES competitors like Accenture, PwC, the Indian outsourcers, they no longer view us as a competitor, and we are being integrated into a lot of their offerings that we were never integrated in before. And it's been fascinating to me how much more traction, I think, we're going to get with those alliance partners. And then, fourth, we're enhancing our go-to-market with a new focus on Tier 2 and Tier 3 that offer better growth at a higher margin. And then, finally, as you noted in the quarter, TS has returned to growth, and this is important because of the margins in TS. Everyone knows how margin-rich TS is, so even a slight return to growth in TS actually helps mitigate margin pressure in ISS rack. And then, lastly, we're continuing to optimize our cost structure, a flatter and leaner organization with lower G&A spend, tighter alignment of R&D spend to the market opportunities, and then a further improvement in our go-to-market model. So listen, we sort of titrated a bit during the year. First half was faster growth, lower margin; second half of the year was lower growth, higher margin. And now, we've got to drive down the middle of a highway for next year, and as I outlined, I think there's real good reasons to think that's going to be the case. With regard to networking, Aruba actually is doing really well. It was a little slower growth this quarter because a big implementation moved into Q4. It is still driving campus switching. And then, of course, now we are a reseller of Aruba -- I mean, of Arista, and so those revenues will fall in our P&L, and the margin that we make selling Arista will actually be margin-accretive to the overall EG group. So that's why I'm optimistic about revenue growth and operating margin in EG in 2017."

I suppose a cynic could say your comps were pretty easy in the first half of '16, and so you were able to grow EG. And your comps became more difficult in the second half, and you weren't able to grow, and the bad news is the comps are even tougher for the next couple of quarters for EG. And I can't help noting that your characterization of the server market is much more cautious than it was a couple of quarters ago. I think you characterized it as seeing ongoing pressure in core servers and talking about hyper converged being lower margins and lower support attach. And so it feels as though, perhaps, the market is getting tougher when you adjust for comps. I'm not sure the performance was -- and for TS, I'm not really sure the performance was much better in the second half. So I was wondering if you could characterize what you think the status of the server market is going forward and what you think is a realistic market growth rate on a go-forward basis, and whether my characteristic of your having a different opinion of that now versus 6 months ago is fair."

I would say, when you look at the market, I -- and we did say, by the way, we thought it was going to get tougher in the second half. The main pressure we're seeing is in ISS rack. A little bit in blades, but frankly, we're going to recover in blades because of Synergy. But ISS rack is where the most ongoing pressure is. Hyper converged is actually growing in as higher margin than our core ISS product, as is Synergy, as is high-performance compute, as is mission-critical systems and, of course, as is TS. So the main area that we've got to work on is shoring up that ISS rack, and that's all volume-based, and it's all through the channel. So distris, VARs, that things like our newly redone value-added reseller program and our ability to do quote-to-cash fast and our ability to fulfill faster than our competitors. So I would say that if we can shore up ISS rack, then I'm confident in the growth rates of these other businesses that we're now gaining real traction in. So there's weakness in ISS rack. I think we are not executing as well as we could, and we aim to fix that."

It was primarily driven through working capital improvements. And to your point about sustainability, we do think it's sustainable, because when you look at the improvements we've made in '16, in general, it's really around 3 areas. So if you look at AP, for example, we went out in 2016 and we hit up all of our suppliers and extended our payment terms. So those terms should hold through 2017. And they came in, in the fourth quarter a little bit better, the improvement came in a little bit better than we had anticipated. If you look at AR, we've really spent a lot of time this year improving our processes, improving our line of sight around past dues, as an example. So we've cut our past dues from, call it, 10% down to 5%. And again, those are sustainable as you think about going into 2017, assuming we execute. And then even in inventory, inventory levels were lower than we had anticipated in Q4. Again, similar to AR, we put in some tighter reporting, improved accountability, particularly around buffer stocking and our key commodities. So we have plans in place, and more important, I think we have better visibility and accountability to execute. So we would anticipate those to hold in 2017. The only thing I would say about 2017 is we don't guide cash flow on a quarterly basis. But just keep in mind, if you are looking at CCC, there tends to be a seasonal uplift from Q4 to Q1, and that's primarily driven by purchasing linearity. But overall, we feel comfortable with our guide in '17."

And the introduction, we're introducing new deduplication technology. That should provide some further uplift in all-flash arrays, because that's been a gap in our portfolio.

And I basically said to the team, listen, we do not want to be doing negative deals here, for the most part. What's the point in selling things at a loss? And so we really want to make sure that we make money on these deals, and profitable deals in Cloudline is more important than market share. That said, Cloudline, particularly relevant, not only in Tier 1 but Tier 2 and Tier 3. The profit margins are better in Tier 2 and Tier 3. So I think Cloudline has a bright future in 2017, especially as we do a better job of penetrating Tier 2 and Tier 3, which is -- the sales force is all focused on. But frankly, there's not a big sales force component to those deals. The sales force gets the leads, and then it's turned over to an engineering sale, so it has lower FSC [ph] associated with it.

But to your point, as you look -- I mean, the currency environment has definitely been volatile in the last few weeks, and to your point, when you look at sort of where the rates are today versus where we guided, call it, mid-October, some of the rates are unfavorable. For example, if you look at the euro, the euro was at $1.10, and now it's probably at $1.06, $1.07, something like that. So given our global footprint, that does put some pressure on the operations now. Having said that, it's very early in the year, and we do have some hedging programs in place. So we didn't feel it was prudent at this stage to adjust our guide. And then, in addition to that, the teams are being very proactive and very aggressive around the cost structure.

Because one of the things I think we've come to realize is the overhead structure that was required to knit together the old HP and then Hewlett Packard Enterprise is with a pretty high overhead structure.

Dell-EMC, it's hard for us to tell how well Dell-EMC is doing because, of course, they're not a public company anymore. But we like our win rate. We like the -- we like our strategy of getting smaller and more focused, while they're still integrating a very large acquisition. And Lenovo, we intercepted a huge amount of server volume in the move from IBM to Lenovo, and we haven't seen them pop back yet. I don't ever count Lenovo out, okay? So they may be just about ready to get up off the mat here, but we'll see in the next 6 to 18 months. And then, we're actually seeing some Huawei pressure in Latin America and a little bit in Europe. Not in the United States, a little bit in Europe, quite a bit in Latin America, and we're trying to basically make sure that -- I mean, in my view, it's easier to hold share than to gain it back, and so we're making some investments in areas that they're trying to make inroads into so that they don't create a profit pool, from which they can leap to another country. I think one of the advantages, Shannon, of the separation is -- people used to ask me who is my list of competitors, and there would be 20 people on that list. This is a much smaller group of competitors, including the public cloud competitors to some degree, and we can be much were laser-like focused, and in the volume business we act very quickly from a pricing perspective, from a VAR perspective, probably much more quickly than we could have before, and that actually helps us as we think about pricing in a particular region or a particular product line."

So listen, as I said before, what we're seeing is, in the core ISS business, there's some deterioration, what I would characterize as core ISS rack for us. Other parts of the server business are doing really well. And I think that core ISS rack deterioration has a number of different things. One is, in part, our execution in the channel and pricing and things like that, and the second is the move to the public cloud. I mean, we're definitely seeing some impact there, offset by growth in other areas. From a 1% to 2% range, my view is, from our perspective, that's a revenue number and longer term. And remember, our revenues are holding up better than the units because of our high attach and then also the features and functionality that we add on to those servers, whether that's storage or whatever it happens to be. So again, we look at -- when we look at unit share, we look at revenue share and we also look at share of profits. And we are gaining share of profits in this business, which is actually really important. So that's kind of the way we think about it. So I think, actually, 1% to 2% feels pretty reasonable to me. We've got some work to shore up that ISS rack, but I think well offset by some of the other things that are really going well from an innovation perspective."

Before handing the call over to Meg, let me remind you that this call is being webcast. A replay of the webcast will be made available shortly after the call for approximately 1 year. We posted the press releases and the slide presentations accompanying today's earnings release on our HPE Investor Relations web page at investors.hpe.com.
As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. For more detailed information, please see the disclaimers on the earnings materials relating to forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. For a discussion of some of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, please refer to HPE's filings with the SEC, including its most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. HPE assumes no obligation and does not intend to update any such forward-looking statements.
We also note that the financial information discussed on this call reflects estimates based on information available at this time and could differ materially from the amounts ultimately reported in HPE's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016. 
Finally, for financial information that has been expressed on a non-GAAP basis, we have provided reconciliations to the comparable GAAP information on our website.
Throughout this conference call, all revenue growth rates presented beginning with fiscal year 2015 are adjusted to exclude the impacts of divestitures and currency. We believe this approach helps provide a better representation of HPE's operational performance given the significant divestitures we've recently completed, including the sale of Mphasis, 51% of our H3C business in China and TippingPoint amongst several others. Please refer to the tables and slide presentation accompanying today's earnings release on our website for details.
With that, let me turn it over to Meg."

FY '16 was a historic year for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. During our first year as a stand-alone company, HPE delivered the business performance we promised, fulfilled our commitment",1599,"Thanks, Andy, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. FY '16 was a historic year for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. During our first year as a stand-alone company, HPE delivered the business performance we promised, fulfilled our commitment to introduce groundbreaking innovation and began to transform the company through strategic changes designed to enable even better focus, flexibility and financial performance.
Our success in FY '16 is proof that we're on the right course. HPE today has the ability to better respond to the constantly evolving marketplace while generating long-term value for shareholders. The leadership team can dive more deeply into products, have more time to spend with customers and partners and can confidently develop our strategy.
From an innovation perspective, we can be much more targeted in the investments we make. The results of all this focus are reflected in our performance. For the year, we delivered revenue of $50.1 billion, up 2% year-over-year when adjusted for divestitures and currency and in line with the outlook we provided at our analyst meeting in 2015. While there is always more work to do, our go-to-market motion is strong and our increased confidence is really paying off.
We saw growth this year in key areas of the portfolio including high-performance compute, Cloudline servers, all-flash storage, converged systems, mission-critical systems and networking with Aruba. Technology Services returned to growth in the last 2 quarters of the year, and we expect that momentum to continue into FY '17.
Strategic Enterprise Services revenue grew over 30%, driven by Helion managed cloud, which grew over 50% and virtual private cloud, which grew over 100%. And in Software, we saw solid SaaS and security growth, with particular strength in Vertica and Voltage solutions. In terms of profitability, we grew our non-GAAP operating profit as a percentage of revenue due in large part to the tremendous progress the Enterprise Services team has made. ES ended the year with a non-GAAP operating profit of 7.7%, above our outlook range of 6% to 7% and in line with our long-term target of 7% to 9%. 
In the Enterprise Group, we continued to hone the balance between revenue growth and profitability. During the past 2 quarters, we've seen steady margin improvement and feel confident that the ongoing cost actions we're taking and the greater mix of converged and software-defined solutions as well as networking and storage will offset the pressure in core servers going forward. And in Software, the team maintained a disciplined focus on cost controls, driving margin improvement in the year.
Overall, we delivered FY '16 non-GAAP EPS of $1.92, at the high end of our original outlook for the year.
Turning to cash flow. We delivered free cash flow of $2.1 billion, above our most recent guided range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. This is particularly strong, given that we were able to offset the lower cash flow resulting from the divestiture of 51% of our H3C business through careful working capital management.
Given the strong cash flow and the proceeds from recent divestitures, we were able to return over $3 billion of cash to shareholders throughout the year and still end the year with an operating company net cash position of $7.6 billion, the highest since I've been with the company.
In FY '16, we also announced strategic changes to the company that will help strengthen our performance over the long term. We completed the divestiture of our stake in Mphasis and our sale of 51% of our H3C business in China. In May, we announced the spin-merge of our Enterprise Services business with CSC. And in September, we announced the spin-merge of our software business with Micro Focus. Together, these transactions are valued at over $20 billion. They will enable us to be more nimble, provide cutting-edge solutions, play in higher-growth markets and have an enhanced financial profile. The success of the separation of HPE and HP Inc. and the progress we've made as an independent company have been recognized by investors. HPE's stock is up more than 50% since we launched the company on November 2, 2015.
Looking forward, the HPE that emerges after the 2 spin-mergers will have a clear vision, the right assets and direct line of sight to significant market opportunities. Our goal is to be the industry's leading provider of hybrid IT, built on the secure, next-generation, software-defined infrastructure that runs our customers' data centers today, bridges them to multi-cloud environments tomorrow and powers the emerging intelligent edge that will run campus, branch and industrial IoT applications for decades to come, all delivered through a world-class services capability.
Let me spend a minute on each element of our vision. First, we believe the world is going to be hybrid, and our mission is to make hybrid IT simple. To do this, we offer market-leading technology across the traditional data center, software-defined infrastructure and private cloud. We're focused on winning in key growth areas in the traditional data center, like big data analytics, high-performance compute, all-flash storage and networking. To that end, this year, we announced game-changing new products with new versions of our Gen9 Servers and 3PAR StoreServ systems. We also acquired SGI, cementing our leadership position in high-performance computing and strengthening our capability in data analytics.
In fact, it was just announced that we now have 140 high-performance computing systems on the Top 500 supercomputing list, more than anyone else in the industry.
In software-defined infrastructure, we launched new categories with offerings like Synergy, the industry's first Composable Infrastructure; and our Hyper Converged 380 solution, which was just named the #1 data center infrastructure product in CRN's annual Tech Innovator Awards, beating out solutions from Dell-EMC and Cisco. And we are establishing an ecosystem of partners to bring together and integrate the industry's best technologies from companies like Arista, Mesosphere, Docker, Chef and Microsoft Azure to allow customers to seamlessly manage across an increasingly complex set of environments.
Second, we will power the emerging intelligent edge. As data volumes increase in business environments outside of the data center, like factories and retail stores, customers need a new set of tools to gather, process and analyze the critical information that will allow them to make decisions in real time. This means that they need compute, storage and connectivity at the edge integrated into their operational environments and seamlessly connected to their hybrid IT environments. Through our Aruba offerings in security, analytics and connectivity and our Edgeline Converged IoT Systems, we're building an ecosystem of partners and bringing unique solutions to this fast-growing market. I like to say we are going to be the IT in IoT.
Third, Services is going to be more critical than ever. As customers look to deploy both hybrid IT and the intelligent edge programs, they need a partner who can help them manage through change and complexity. Our Technology Services organization delivers world-class advisory, support and consumption models as well as building customer solutions from the ground up. In addition to our TS group that provides these advisory, transformation and support capabilities, our Financial Services organization brings the financial flexibility and consumption models that our customers are increasingly looking for.
With this portfolio, we estimate we have a total addressable market of over $250 billion that's growing at 2% to 3% a year. And within that, there are areas of very high growth like high-performance compute, private cloud, software-defined networking and industrial IoT. We are already well positioned to lead in these areas, and you will see us continue to invest in a targeted way.
What is most exciting is that our approach is resonating with our customers, partners and the industry. In the fourth quarter, we continued to win customers looking for hybrid IT and intelligent edge solutions and services. For example, in hybrid IT, we recently replaced a 19-year EMC relationship with a major global health care company, where we will provide services and technology to deliver simplicity, operating efficiencies and automation as the company modernizes and realigns their core storage and compute platforms.
In the intelligent edge market, Nordstrom recently named Aruba as their preferred provider for their WiFi services strategy in all their stores, distribution centers and corporate sites. And we announced a significant new wireless network rollout at Penske Truck Leasing to enable greater workforce productivity and connectivity at its truck facilities.
Finally, our Technology Services business continues to deliver significant value to customers and win deals. For example, in Q4, TS won a major 5-year deal with its flexible capacity service for a large European auto manufacturer. It also won a 5-year agreement with a large global bank based in Europe, which chose our Datacenter Care service to operate its data centers around the world.
Looking ahead, next week, we kick off Discover London, where we will bring together nearly 10,000 customers and partners to demo our latest products and services. During the week, you will see exciting product announcements across hybrid IT and the intelligent edge and hear from some of our customers about how we are helping them achieve their business outcomes.
So overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we made in FY '16. We delivered the financial performance we promised, fulfilled our commitment to groundbreaking innovation and began to transform the company in ways we believe will deliver an exciting future for customers, partners, employees and investors. I'm excited about the path we see ahead and very much look forward to the journey.
And now I will hand the call over to Tim, who will provide details on the quarter."

Fourth quarter revenue of $12.5 billion was down approximately 2% when adjusted for divestitures and currency as we continued to focus on profitable market share and executed well in an uneven global demand environment. From a macro perspective, we saw a continued revenue softness in Europe, particularly in ES, due to a persistent slowing in the U.K. public sector business. On an as-reported basis, performance in the Americas was encouraging, with low single-digit growth in the Enterprise Group and Services. APJ performance was mixed, with improved EG and ES results in both China and Japan but weakness in the rest of Asia.
Currency fluctuations were a headwind to revenue by 110 basis points year-over-year, driven by depreciation in the British pound and somewhat offset by appreciation in the Japanese yen.
Turning to profitability. Gross margin of 30.4% was up 80 basis points year-over-year due to continued improvements to deal profitability in Enterprise Services. Sequentially, gross margin was up 110 basis points, principally due to normal seasonal uplift in both ES and Software. We continued to drive cost productivity and reduced non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue by 120 basis points sequentially and 70 basis points year-over-year, with significant improvements in ES delivery costs. Also, EG continued to execute on the cost plan we discussed at SAM in order to further align costs with revenue. Given those actions, non-GAAP operating profit of 11.1% was up 150 basis points year-over-year and 230 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.61 was in line with our outlook of $0.58 to $0.63. For the full year, non-GAAP net diluted earnings per share was $1.92, in the center of our outlook of $1.90 to $1.95.
Fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes tax obligation settlements of $647 million and pretax amounts for restructuring charges of $395 million, separation charges of $293 million and amortization of intangible assets of $126 million, offset by tax indemnification adjustments of $311 million and the gain from the Mphasis divestiture of $253 million.
We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.18, below our previously provided outlook range of $0.44 to $0.49, primarily due to the previously mentioned settlements of outstanding Hewlett-Packard Company tax obligations that we shared with HP Inc. through our separation agreement.
Now turning to the results by business. In the Enterprise Group, we continue to work on improving operating margins by focusing on profitable deals, reducing discretionary spend and delayering as we rightsize the organization ahead of the separation from ES and Software. Operating margins, while down slightly year-over-year, were up 60 basis points sequentially to 13.2%.
Revenue declined 3% in Q4. However, we had several areas of encouraging growth across the portfolio. Aruba was up 13%; all-flash arrays were up more than 100%; high-performance compute was up more than 30%, and we had our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in mission-critical systems. And our highest-margin business, Technology Services, grew for the second consecutive quarter. These results are a reflection of the continued investments we've made in our higher-growth businesses like our software-defined, converged and hyper-converged offerings as well as our go-to-market efforts.
Server revenue declined 6% as growth in high-performance and mission-critical compute was offset by pressure in the core servers and service provider vertical. In the core, we saw some incremental competitive pressure, particularly in blades. However, our recently launched Synergy line will allow us to better compete in the blade segment, and we anticipate taking back share as this product line ramps.
As we've previously discussed, we are prioritizing profit over market share and, as a result, saw some sales contraction in Tier 1. While this has put some pressure on revenue, we see opportunities to grow in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 spaces, which are growing faster and have better economics, including greater TS attach. Encouragingly, the growth in high-performance compute and mission-critical systems was independent of our acquisition of SGI, which we completed just after the end of the quarter and should help drive further profitable growth.
Storage revenue declined 3% with continued contraction in the legacy portfolio. However, the higher-margin converged storage portfolio was up 1% and is now 56% of the total storage mix. Traditional storage declined by 11%, particularly challenged by weakness in entry storage. However, our recently introduced MSA entry offerings should drive improvement going forward. 3PAR plus XP plus EVA was up 2%, while all-flash 3PAR revenue grew nearly 100% and now makes up approximately 50% of total 3PAR revenue. Keep in mind, all-flash only makes up 10% of data center storage today, so we see a significant growth opportunity going forward. We also anticipate some uplift from our recently announced compression offerings, which fill a gap in our portfolio.
Networking revenue was flat, but encouragingly, Aruba continued to take share and grew 13%. We should see this growth in Aruba accelerate next quarter, as we had some installations in the quarter pushed out into Q1. Also, we did see a slowdown on E-rate government infrastructure spending for education, which impacted both wireless and switching in campus. And keep in mind that we'd just launched our new Arista partnership, which enables us to offer a highly differentiated data center networking solutions, which we expect will grow in future quarters.
Technology Services grew for the second consecutive quarter, with revenue up 2%. Orders are [ph] also returned to growth in the quarter and grew for the full year. We saw encouraging performance in non-attach and proactive services and continue to improve service intensity or attach dollars per unit, both of which are helping to offset increased Tier 1 mix and lower server units.
Enterprise Services revenue declined 2%, as growth in the Americas and APJ was more than offset by softness in EMEA. For the full year, revenue declined 1.1%, in line with the outlook we provided at the 2015 Analyst Day. Operating profit improved 250 basis points year-over-year to 10.7%, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2009, as the team continues to execute on productivity improvements and delivery and sales. For the full year, we delivered operating margins of 7.7%, well above our original guidance of 6% to 7%.
We continue to track against our longer-term goal of 60% headcount in low-cost locations and completed the quarter with 51% of our headcount in low-cost locations. This is an 8-point improvement since the beginning of the fiscal year. It's also worth highlighting that our customer satisfaction has increased following these cost structure improvements and the spin-merge announcement. 
Software revenue was flat, as strength in security was offset by declines in IT management and big data. We have stabilized license revenue, which was only down 1% as compared to down 18% in Q3. Also encouragingly, the renewal rate for high-margin support contracts improved 3 points year-over-year to over 90%. SaaS had another record quarter with 11% revenue growth. The team also continued to focus on disciplined cost controls, and as a result, the operating margin improved 220 basis points to 32.1%.
HPE Financial Services revenue grew 2% and delivered its second consecutive quarter of year-over-year as-reported revenue growth. Operating profit declined 70 basis points year-over-year to 10.2% from higher operating expenses and lower residual maturities. Financing volume declined 3% in constant currency from a tough compare. Return on equity was down 200 basis points year-over-year to 14.1% and was pressured by lower residual sales resulting from lower volumes in fiscal year '13 and fiscal year '14.
Cash flow generation was strong in the quarter as we continue to improve working capital management. Cash flow from operations was $2.2 billion, up 44% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. And free cash flow was $1.5 billion, up 84% year-over-year on an adjusted basis.
For the full year, we generated free cash flow of $2.1 billion, above our most recent outlook of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, and despite the H3C divestiture, delivered cash flow in line with our original guidance for the year. The cash conversion cycle was 6 days, down 12 days sequentially. Payables were the largest contributor to working capital improvement as we continue to make progress with vendor terms.
Turning to capital allocation. During the quarter, we paid $92 million as part of our normal dividend. We also continued to reduce share count in the fourth quarter through our accelerated share repurchase program, which required all cash be paid when the program started in Q3. For the full year, we returned over $3 billion of capital to shareholders, primarily through $2.7 billion of share repurchases. This is approximately 3x our original commitment at the start of the year. 
Lastly, as part of our continued efforts to return capital to shareholders, we increased our dividend payment by 18% to $0.065 per share, effective for the January 4, 2017, payment.
Now moving to the announced spin-merge transactions. Both the ES, CSC and Software Micro Focus transactions are on schedule and on budget. We filed the initial Form-10 and S-4 for the ES-CSC spin-merge earlier this month. We anticipate filing the final registration statements in late February, and we're on track to complete the transaction by April 1. The Software-Micro Focus transaction is also progressing as planned, and we continue to anticipate the transaction closing on approximately August 31.
We recently gave detailed fiscal year '17 guidance at our Securities Analyst Day, and I encourage you to review our financial overview presentation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook. However, I think it's worth reiterating a few points. We continue to expect fiscal year '17 non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $2 to $2.10 for the combined HPE as it stands today; $1.25 to $1.35 for the future HPE; and reported EPS of $1.45 to $1.55.
Normalized free cash flow for the combined HPE should be $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, while future HPE would generate $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion in fiscal year '17. And we expect reported free cash flow of negative $1.8 billion, as cash will be significantly impacted by restructuring and separation payments, the ES pension funding and the midyear impact of the spin-merge transactions on cash generation.
As we discussed at SAM, please keep in mind that Q1 will use a significant amount of cash, and cash flow will be even more back-end-loaded in fiscal year '17 as compared to normal seasonality. The key drivers include the fact that our first quarter is typically the weakest cash-generating quarter due to the seasonality of ES and Software earnings. We also make our annual bonus payment in Q1, and we expect to fund the majority of the ES pension payment in the first quarter. 
And finally, we expect Q1 '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.42 to $0.46, and we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.03 to $0.07.
Now let's open it up for questions."

Could you speak about how visibility has changed as we've gone through 2016, whether there has been any major change? And then just one thing that's linked to that. There was a period of time when your storage business was gaining share, and on top of that, your networking business was benefiting, not only with Aruba but also because Aruba was driving revenue synergy with switching. Has that now fully played out? Or should that growth there return at some point?"
273983758,408982995,1090867,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 22, 2016",2016-11-22,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Yes. Let me talk about the decline in the growth rates in the last 2 quarters, and particularly, Q4. But I would say, when you look at the full year, the company grew 2%; and Enterprise Group, obviously, which is going to be the anchor of the go-forward H",640,"Yes. Let me talk about the decline in the growth rates in the last 2 quarters, and particularly, Q4. But I would say, when you look at the full year, the company grew 2%; and Enterprise Group, obviously, which is going to be the anchor of the go-forward Hewlett Packard Enterprise, grew 3% for the year. But I think, as FY '16 demonstrated, that there are challenges balancing revenue and margins in EG. And now we are going to be focused on growing overall operating profit dollars. So as you know, in the first half, we delivered great growth. And then the second half -- well, we delivered great growth, but the margins were lower than we would have liked. In the second half, we pivoted back more towards margins, focusing on the profitable deals and improving our cost structure that resulted in a quarter-over-quarter margin improvement of 90 basis points in Q3 and another 60 basis points in Q4, but revenue slowed to flat in Q3 and was down 3% in Q4. So we really have -- we've spent some time titrating, if you will, the balance between revenue growth and profitability.
And so now as I look at 2017, I think we can grow revenue and operating margins at the same time going forward, and let me tell you why I think that. First is we need to shore up core ISS rack with improvements in the channel, improvements in quote-to-cash and focus -- more focus on the distributors and VARs for the volume-related ISS rack business. Second, we've got to continue to invest in the higher-growth businesses, which are doing pretty well. High-performance compute with SGI, 3PAR all-flash, Aruba, Synergy, the HC 380. And those offerings are actually growing nicely and are accretive to the overall Enterprise Group margin. Third, and this is one of those unintended great consequences of the separation of ES from the Hewlett Packard remaining company, is that alliances with former ES competitors like Accenture, PwC, the Indian outsourcers, they no longer view us as a competitor, and we are being integrated into a lot of their offerings that we were never integrated in before. And it's been fascinating to me how much more traction, I think, we're going to get with those alliance partners. And then, fourth, we're enhancing our go-to-market with a new focus on Tier 2 and Tier 3 that offer better growth at a higher margin. And then, finally, as you noted in the quarter, TS has returned to growth, and this is important because of the margins in TS. Everyone knows how margin-rich TS is, so even a slight return to growth in TS actually helps mitigate margin pressure in ISS rack. And then, lastly, we're continuing to optimize our cost structure, a flatter and leaner organization with lower G&A spend, tighter alignment of R&D spend to the market opportunities, and then a further improvement in our go-to-market model. So listen, we sort of titrated a bit during the year. First half was faster growth, lower margin; second half of the year was lower growth, higher margin. And now, we've got to drive down the middle of the highway for next year, and as I outlined, I think there's real good reasons to think that's going to be the case. With regard to networking, Aruba actually is doing really well. It was a little slower growth this quarter because a big implementation moved into Q4. It is still driving campus switching. And then, of course, now we are a reseller of Aruba -- I mean, of Arista, and so those revenues will fall in our P&L, and the margin that we make selling Arista will actually be margin-accretive to the overall EG group. So that's why I'm optimistic about revenue growth and operating margin in EG in 2017."

I suppose a cynic could say your comps were pretty easy in the first half of '16, and so you were able to grow EG. And your comps became more difficult in the second half, and you weren't able to grow, and the bad news is the comps are even tougher for the next couple of quarters for EG. And I can't help noting that your characterization of the server market is much more cautious than it was a couple of quarters ago. I think you characterized it as seeing ongoing pressure in core servers and talking about hyper converged being lower margins and lower support attach. And so it feels as though, perhaps, the market is getting tougher when you adjust for comps. I'm not sure the performance was -- and for TS, I'm not really sure the performance was much better in the second half. So I was wondering if you could characterize what you think the status of the server market is going forward and what you think is a realistic market growth rate on a go-forward basis, and whether my characteristic of your having a different opinion of that now versus 6 months ago is fair."

I would say, when you look at the market, I -- and we did say, by the way, we thought it was going to get tougher in the second half. The main pressure we're seeing is in ISS rack. A little bit in blades, but frankly, we're going to recover in blades because of Synergy. But ISS rack is where the most ongoing pressure is. Hyper converged is actually growing and is higher margin than our core ISS product, as is Synergy, as is high-performance compute, as is mission-critical systems and, of course, as is TS. So the main area that we've got to work on is shoring up that ISS rack, and that's all volume-based, and it's all through the channel. So disties [ph], VARs, that's things like our newly redone value-added reseller program and our ability to do quote-to-cash fast and our ability to fulfill faster than our competitors. So I would say that if we can shore up ISS rack, then I'm confident in the growth rates of these other businesses that we're now gaining real traction in. So there's weakness in ISS rack. I think we are not executing as well as we could, and we aim to fix that."

It was primarily driven through working capital improvements. And to your point about sustainability, we do think it's sustainable, because when you look at the improvements we've made in '16, in general, it's really around 3 areas. So if you look at AP, for example, we went out in 2016 and we hit up all of our suppliers and extended our payment terms. So those terms should hold through 2017. And they came in, in the fourth quarter a little bit better -- the improvement came in a little bit better than we had anticipated. If you look at AR, we really spent a lot of time this year improving our processes, improving our line of sight around past dues, as an example. So we've cut our past dues from, call it, 10% down to 5%. And again, those are sustainable as you think about going into 2017, assuming we execute. And then even in inventory, inventory levels were lower than we had anticipated in Q4. Again, similar to AR, we put in some tighter reporting, improved accountability, particularly around buffer stocking and our key commodities. So we have plans in place, and more important, I think we have better visibility and accountability to execute. So we would anticipate those to hold in 2017. The only thing I would say about 2017 is we don't guide cash flow on a quarterly basis. But just keep in mind, if you are looking at CCC, there tends to be a seasonal uplift from Q4 to Q1, and that's primarily driven by purchasing linearity. But overall, we feel comfortable with our guide in '17."

And all-flash now makes up 50% of our 3PAR portfolio and, interestingly, still only comprises 10% of the data center. So we see more running room in our all-flash business. And the introduction, we're introducing new deduplication technology that should provide some further uplift in all-flash arrays, because that's been a gap in our portfolio. Traditional storage this quarter declined 11%, and that was particularly challenged in entry storage. And I think you know, we introduced a new MSA offering to address the entry market that, I think, should benefit us going forward. So I think you'll see storage continue to be a strong point for us. We're -- we've got that old -- you've got traditional storage declining and the new stuff growing, but feeling pretty good about the 2017 outlook given the strength of the portfolio and the momentum we have in all-flash."

And then the ones that, obviously, Chef, Docker, Mesosphere, things like that. And then, M&A. So it's -- I mean, Tim said it well, it's the return-based M&A strategy. And the M&A that's worked for us is 3Com, 3PAR, Aruba, SGI. What do they have in common? Reasonable and understandable valuations, enhancing the current portfolio, leveraging our distribution capabilities and driving profitable growth. But we are very focused on a returns-based look at this. And as Tim said, we still think that the stock price that's embedded in Hewlett Packard Enterprise today around remain co, if you could sort of pull out what you think Software's worth, what you think ES is worth, we still think there's tremendous value in the remaining company that's still embedded in overall HPE. So stock repurchase and -- as I said stock repurchase, share buyback is -- that's where we lean towards."

So Cloudline, listen, Cloudline is a pretty big business for us, and when done correctly, we actually make money on Cloudline. But we just have to be sure. Every deal has to be looked at on a one-off basis, which is, what's the forward pricing going to look like? Can we imagine making money at a forward pricing? And I've basically said to the team, listen, we do not want to be doing negative deals here, for the most part. What's the point in selling things at a loss? And so we really want to make sure that we make money on these deals, and profitable deals in Cloudline is more important than market share. That said, Cloudline, particularly relevant, not only in Tier 1 but Tier 2 and Tier 3. The profit margins are better in Tier 2 and Tier 3. So I think Cloudline has a bright future in 2017, especially as we do a better job of penetrating Tier 2 and Tier 3, which is -- the sales force is all focused on. But frankly, there's not a big sales force component to those deals. The sales force gets the leads, and then it's turned over to an engineering sale, so it has lower FSC associated with it. But Cloudline has been absolutely the right thing for us to do. We just need to continue to lever it into profitable deals."

But to your point, as you look -- I mean, the currency environment has definitely been volatile in the last few weeks, and to your point, when you look at sort of where the rates are today versus where we guided, call it, mid-October, some of the rates are unfavorable. For example, if you look at the euro, the euro was at $1.10, and now it's probably at $1.06, $1.07, something like that. So given our global footprint, that does put some pressure on the operations now. Having said that, it's very early in the year, and we do have some hedging programs in place. So we didn't feel it was prudent at this stage to adjust our guide. And then, in addition to that, the teams are being very proactive and very aggressive around the cost structure. There also, to your point, in EMEA, we're looking at opportunities to improve pricing to help offset some of that pressure. So I would just say this, to wrap it up, is we're keeping a close eye on the currencies. And at the same time, we're also implementing operational actions to help mitigate any pressure."

I mean, we basically, by the end of this fiscal year, will have no stranded costs at all relative to these 2 big divestitures, which, for a company our size and scale, is a pretty big achievement. Because one of the things I think we've come to realize is the overhead structure that was required to knit together the old HP and then Hewlett Packard Enterprise is -- was a pretty high overhead structure because of the diversity of the businesses.

So listen, as I said before, what we're seeing is, in the core ISS business, there's some deterioration, what I would characterize as core ISS rack for us. Other parts of the server business are doing really well. And I think that core ISS rack deterioration has a number of different things. One is, in part, our execution in the channel and pricing and things like that, and the second is the move to the public cloud. I mean, we're definitely seeing some impact there, offset by growth in other areas. From a 1% to 2% range, my view is, from our perspective, that's a revenue number and longer term. And remember, our revenues are holding up better than the units because of our high attach and then also the features and functionality that we add on to those servers, whether that's storage or whatever it happens to be. So again, we look at -- when we look at unit share, we look at revenue share and we also look at share of profits. And we are gaining share of profits in this business, which is actually really important. So that's kind of the way we think about it. So I think, actually, 1% to 2% feels pretty reasonable to me. We've got some work to shore up that ISS rack, but I think well offset by some of the other things that are really going well from an innovation perspective."

273983758,408982995,1091245,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 22, 2016",2016-11-22,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Thanks, Andy, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. FY '16 was a historic year for Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

FY '16 was a historic year for Hewlett Packard Enterprise. During our first year as a stand-alone company, HPE delivered the business performance we promised, fulfilled our commitment to introduce groundbreaking innovation and began to transform the company through strategic changes designed to enable even better focus, flexibility and financial performance.
Our success in FY '16 is proof that we're on the right course. HPE today has the ability to better respond to the constantly evolving marketplace while generating long-term value for shareholders. The leadership team can dive more deeply into products, have more time to spend with customers and partners and can confidently develop our strategy.
From an innovation perspective, we can be much more targeted in the investments we make. The results of all this focus are reflected in our performance. For the year, we delivered revenue of $50.1 billion, up 2% year-over-year when adjusted for divestitures and currency and in line with the outlook we provided at our analyst meeting in 2015. While there is always more work to do, our go-to-market motion is strong and our increased confidence is really paying off.
We saw growth this year in key areas of the portfolio including high-performance compute, Cloudline servers, all-flash storage, converged systems, mission-critical systems and networking with Aruba. Technology Services returned to growth in the last 2 quarters of the year, and we expect that momentum to continue into FY '17.
Strategic Enterprise Services revenue grew over 30%, driven by Helion managed cloud, which grew over 50% and virtual private cloud, which grew over 100%. And in Software, we saw solid SaaS and security growth, with particular strength in Vertica and Voltage solutions. In terms of profitability, we grew our non-GAAP operating profit as a percentage of revenue due in large part to the tremendous progress the Enterprise Services team has made. ES ended the year with a non-GAAP operating profit of 7.7%, above our outlook range of 6% to 7% and in line with our long-term target of 7% to 9%. 
In the Enterprise Group, we continued to hone the balance between revenue growth and profitability. During the past 2 quarters, we've seen steady margin improvement and feel confident that the ongoing cost actions we're taking and the greater mix of converged and software-defined solutions as well as networking and storage will offset the pressure in core servers going forward. And in Software, the team maintained a disciplined focus on cost controls, driving margin improvement in the year.
Overall, we delivered FY '16 non-GAAP EPS of $1.92, at the high end of our original outlook for the year.
Turning to cash flow. We delivered free cash flow of $2.1 billion, above our most recent guided range of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. This is particularly strong, given that we were able to offset the lower cash flow resulting from the divestiture of 51% of our H3C business through careful working capital management.
Given the strong cash flow and the proceeds from recent divestitures, we were able to return over $3 billion of cash to shareholders throughout the year and still end the year with an operating company net cash position of $7.6 billion, the highest since I've been with the company.
In FY '16, we also announced strategic changes to the company that will help strengthen our performance over the long term. We completed the divestiture of our stake in Mphasis and our sale of 51% of our H3C business in China. In May, we announced the spin-merge of our Enterprise Services business with CSC. And in September, we announced the spin-merge of our software business with Micro Focus. Together, these transactions are valued at over $20 billion. They will enable us to be more nimble, provide cutting-edge solutions, play in higher-growth markets and have an enhanced financial profile. The success of the separation of HPE and HP Inc. and the progress we've made as an independent company have been recognized by investors. HPE's stock is up more than 50% since we launched the company on November 2, 2015.
Looking forward, the HPE that emerges after the 2 spin-mergers will have a clear vision, the right assets and direct line of sight to significant market opportunities. Our goal is to be the industry's leading provider of hybrid IT, built on the secure, next-generation, software-defined infrastructure that runs our customers' data centers today, bridges them to multi-cloud environments tomorrow and powers the emerging intelligent edge that will run campus, branch and industrial IoT applications for decades to come, all delivered through a world-class services capability.
Let me spend a minute on each element of our vision. First, we believe the world is going to be hybrid, and our mission is to make hybrid IT simple. To do this, we offer market-leading technology across the traditional data center, software-defined infrastructure and private cloud. We're focused on winning in key growth areas in the traditional data center, like big data analytics, high-performance compute, all-flash storage and networking. To that end, this year, we announced game-changing new products with new versions of our Gen9 Servers and 3PAR StoreServ systems. We also acquired SGI, cementing our leadership position in high-performance computing and strengthening our capability in data analytics.
In fact, it was just announced that we now have 140 high-performance computing systems on the Top 500 supercomputing list, more than anyone else in the industry.
In software-defined infrastructure, we launched new categories with offerings like Synergy, the industry's first Composable Infrastructure; and our Hyper Converged 380 solution, which was just named the #1 data center infrastructure product in CRN's annual Tech Innovator Awards, beating out solutions from Dell-EMC and Cisco. And we are establishing an ecosystem of partners to bring together and integrate the industry's best technologies from companies like Arista, Mesosphere, Docker, Chef and Microsoft Azure to allow customers to seamlessly manage across an increasingly complex set of environments.
Second, we will power the emerging intelligent edge. As data volumes increase in business environments outside of the data center, like factories and retail stores, customers need a new set of tools to gather, process and analyze the critical information that will allow them to make decisions in real time. This means that they need compute, storage and connectivity at the edge integrated into their operational environments and seamlessly connected to their hybrid IT environments. Through our Aruba offerings in security, analytics and connectivity and our Edgeline Converged IoT Systems, we're building an ecosystem of partners and bringing unique solutions to this fast-growing market. I like to say we are going to be the IT in IoT.
Third, Services is going to be more critical than ever. As customers look to deploy both hybrid IT and the intelligent edge programs, they need a partner who can help them manage through change and complexity. Our Technology Services organization delivers world-class advisory, support and consumption models as well as building customer solutions from the ground up. In addition to our TS group that provides these advisory, transformation and support capabilities, our Financial Services organization brings the financial flexibility and consumption models that our customers are increasingly looking for.
With this portfolio, we estimate we have a total addressable market of over $250 billion that's growing at 2% to 3% a year. And within that, there are areas of very high growth like high-performance compute, private cloud, software-defined networking and industrial IoT. We are already well positioned to lead in these areas, and you will see us continue to invest in a targeted way.
What is most exciting is that our approach is resonating with our customers, partners and the industry. In the fourth quarter, we continued to win customers looking for hybrid IT and intelligent edge solutions and services. For example, in hybrid IT, we recently replaced a 19-year EMC relationship with a major global health care company, where we will provide services and technology to deliver simplicity, operating efficiencies and automation as the company modernizes and realigns their core storage and compute platforms.
In the intelligent edge market, Nordstrom recently named Aruba as their preferred provider for their WiFi services strategy in all their stores, distribution centers and corporate sites. And we announced a significant new wireless network rollout at Penske Truck Leasing to enable greater workforce productivity and connectivity at its truck facilities.
Finally, our Technology Services business continues to deliver significant value to customers and win deals. For example, in Q4, TS won a major 5-year deal with its flexible capacity service for a large European auto manufacturer. It also won a 5-year agreement with a large global bank based in Europe, which chose our Datacenter Care service to operate its data centers around the world.
Looking ahead, next week, we kick off Discover London, where we will bring together nearly 10,000 customers and partners to demo our latest products and services. During the week, you will see exciting product announcements across hybrid IT and the intelligent edge and hear from some of our customers about how we are helping them achieve their business outcomes.
So overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we made in FY '16. We delivered the financial performance we promised, fulfilled our commitment to groundbreaking innovation and began to transform the company in ways we believe will deliver an exciting future for customers, partners, employees and investors. I'm excited about the path we see ahead and very much look forward to the journey.
And now I will hand the call over to Tim, who will provide details on the quarter."

I agree that fiscal year '16 was a strong first year across a number of fronts. We successfully delivered the financial outlook we laid out at the beginning of the year while making several strategic portfolio changes.
Now I'll spend some time providing more detail on our fourth quarter results. Overall, I'd say that we performed well in a tough market and continued to make progress improving our cost structure and strengthening our go-to-market approach. Fourth quarter revenue of $12.5 billion was down approximately 2% when adjusted for divestitures and currency as we continued to focus on profitable market share and executed well in an uneven global demand environment. From a macro perspective, we saw a continued revenue softness in Europe, particularly in ES, due to a persistent slowing in the U.K. public sector business. On an as-reported basis, performance in the Americas was encouraging, with low single-digit growth in the Enterprise Group and Services. APJ performance was mixed, with improved EG and ES results in both China and Japan but weakness in the rest of Asia.
Currency fluctuations were a headwind to revenue by 110 basis points year-over-year, driven by depreciation in the British pound and somewhat offset by appreciation in the Japanese yen.
Turning to profitability. Gross margin of 30.4% was up 80 basis points year-over-year due to continued improvements to deal profitability in Enterprise Services. Sequentially, gross margin was up 110 basis points, principally due to normal seasonal uplift in both ES and Software. We continued to drive cost productivity and reduced non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenue by 120 basis points sequentially and 70 basis points year-over-year, with significant improvements in ES delivery costs. Also, EG continued to execute on the cost plan we discussed at SAM in order to further align costs with revenue. Given those actions, non-GAAP operating profit of 11.1% was up 150 basis points year-over-year and 230 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.61 was in line with our outlook of $0.58 to $0.63. For the full year, non-GAAP net diluted earnings per share was $1.92, in the center of our outlook of $1.90 to $1.95.
Fourth quarter non-GAAP EPS primarily excludes tax obligation settlements of $647 million and pretax amounts for restructuring charges of $395 million, separation charges of $293 million and amortization of intangible assets of $126 million, offset by tax indemnification adjustments of $311 million and the gain from the Mphasis divestiture of $253 million.
We delivered GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.18, below our previously provided outlook range of $0.44 to $0.49, primarily due to the previously mentioned settlements of outstanding Hewlett-Packard Company tax obligations that we shared with HP Inc. through our separation agreement.
Now turning to the results by business. In the Enterprise Group, we continue to work on improving operating margins by focusing on profitable deals, reducing discretionary spend and delayering as we rightsize the organization ahead of the separation from ES and Software. Operating margins, while down slightly year-over-year, were up 60 basis points sequentially to 13.2%.
Revenue declined 3% in Q4. However, we had several areas of encouraging growth across the portfolio. Aruba was up 13%; all-flash arrays were up more than 100%; high-performance compute was up more than 30%, and we had our third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in mission-critical systems. And our highest-margin business, Technology Services, grew for the second consecutive quarter. These results are a reflection of the continued investments we've made in our higher-growth businesses like our software-defined, converged and hyper-converged offerings as well as our go-to-market efforts.
Server revenue declined 6% as growth in high-performance and mission-critical compute was offset by pressure in the core servers and service provider vertical. In the core, we saw some incremental competitive pressure, particularly in blades. However, our recently launched Synergy line will allow us to better compete in the blade segment, and we anticipate taking back share as this product line ramps.
As we've previously discussed, we are prioritizing profit over market share and, as a result, saw some sales contraction in Tier 1. While this has put some pressure on revenue, we see opportunities to grow in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 spaces, which are growing faster and have better economics, including greater TS attach. Encouragingly, the growth in high-performance compute and mission-critical systems was independent of our acquisition of SGI, which we completed just after the end of the quarter and should help drive further profitable growth.
Storage revenue declined 3% with continued contraction in the legacy portfolio. However, the higher-margin converged storage portfolio was up 1% and is now 56% of the total storage mix. Traditional storage declined by 11%, particularly challenged by weakness in entry storage. However, our recently introduced MSA entry offerings should drive improvement going forward. 3PAR plus XP plus EVA was up 2%, while all-flash 3PAR revenue grew nearly 100% and now makes up approximately 50% of total 3PAR revenue. Keep in mind, all-flash only makes up 10% of data center storage today, so we see a significant growth opportunity going forward. We also anticipate some uplift from our recently announced compression offerings, which fill a gap in our portfolio.
Networking revenue was flat, but encouragingly, Aruba continued to take share and grew 13%. We should see this growth in Aruba accelerate next quarter, as we had some installations in the quarter pushed out into Q1. Also, we did see a slowdown on E-rate government infrastructure spending for education, which impacted both wireless and switching in campus. And keep in mind that we'd just launched our new Arista partnership, which enables us to offer a highly differentiated data center networking solutions, which we expect will grow in future quarters.
Technology Services grew for the second consecutive quarter, with revenue up 2%. Orders are [ph] also returned to growth in the quarter and grew for the full year. We saw encouraging performance in non-attach and proactive services and continue to improve service intensity or attach dollars per unit, both of which are helping to offset increased Tier 1 mix and lower server units.
Enterprise Services revenue declined 2%, as growth in the Americas and APJ was more than offset by softness in EMEA. For the full year, revenue declined 1.1%, in line with the outlook we provided at the 2015 Analyst Day. Operating profit improved 250 basis points year-over-year to 10.7%, the highest since the fourth quarter of 2009, as the team continues to execute on productivity improvements and delivery and sales. For the full year, we delivered operating margins of 7.7%, well above our original guidance of 6% to 7%.
We continue to track against our longer-term goal of 60% headcount in low-cost locations and completed the quarter with 51% of our headcount in low-cost locations. This is an 8-point improvement since the beginning of the fiscal year. It's also worth highlighting that our customer satisfaction has increased following these cost structure improvements and the spin-merge announcement. 
Software revenue was flat, as strength in security was offset by declines in IT management and big data. We have stabilized license revenue, which was only down 1% as compared to down 18% in Q3. Also encouragingly, the renewal rate for high-margin support contracts improved 3 points year-over-year to over 90%. SaaS had another record quarter with 11% revenue growth. The team also continued to focus on disciplined cost controls, and as a result, the operating margin improved 220 basis points to 32.1%.
HPE Financial Services revenue grew 2% and delivered its second consecutive quarter of year-over-year as-reported revenue growth. Operating profit declined 70 basis points year-over-year to 10.2% from higher operating expenses and lower residual maturities. Financing volume declined 3% in constant currency from a tough compare. Return on equity was down 200 basis points year-over-year to 14.1% and was pressured by lower residual sales resulting from lower volumes in fiscal year '13 and fiscal year '14.
Cash flow generation was strong in the quarter as we continue to improve working capital management. Cash flow from operations was $2.2 billion, up 44% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. And free cash flow was $1.5 billion, up 84% year-over-year on an adjusted basis.
For the full year, we generated free cash flow of $2.1 billion, above our most recent outlook of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion, and despite the H3C divestiture, delivered cash flow in line with our original guidance for the year. The cash conversion cycle was 6 days, down 12 days sequentially. Payables were the largest contributor to working capital improvement as we continue to make progress with vendor terms.
Turning to capital allocation. During the quarter, we paid $92 million as part of our normal dividend. We also continued to reduce share count in the fourth quarter through our accelerated share repurchase program, which required all cash be paid when the program started in Q3. For the full year, we returned over $3 billion of capital to shareholders, primarily through $2.7 billion of share repurchases. This is approximately 3x our original commitment at the start of the year. 
Lastly, as part of our continued efforts to return capital to shareholders, we increased our dividend payment by 18% to $0.065 per share, effective for the January 4, 2017, payment.
Now moving to the announced spin-merge transactions. Both the ES, CSC and Software Micro Focus transactions are on schedule and on budget. We filed the initial Form-10 and S-4 for the ES-CSC spin-merge earlier this month. We anticipate filing the final registration statements in late February, and we're on track to complete the transaction by April 1. The Software-Micro Focus transaction is also progressing as planned, and we continue to anticipate the transaction closing on approximately August 31.
We recently gave detailed fiscal year '17 guidance at our Securities Analyst Day, and I encourage you to review our financial overview presentation for a more detailed discussion of that outlook. However, I think it's worth reiterating a few points. We continue to expect fiscal year '17 non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $2 to $2.10 for the combined HPE as it stands today; $1.25 to $1.35 for the future HPE; and reported EPS of $1.45 to $1.55.
Normalized free cash flow for the combined HPE should be $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, while future HPE would generate $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion in fiscal year '17. And we expect reported free cash flow of negative $1.8 billion, as cash will be significantly impacted by restructuring and separation payments, the ES pension funding and the midyear impact of the spin-merge transactions on cash generation.
As we discussed at SAM, please keep in mind that Q1 will use a significant amount of cash, and cash flow will be even more back-end-loaded in fiscal year '17 as compared to normal seasonality. The key drivers include the fact that our first quarter is typically the weakest cash-generating quarter due to the seasonality of ES and Software earnings. We also make our annual bonus payment in Q1, and we expect to fund the majority of the ES pension payment in the first quarter. 
And finally, we expect Q1 '17 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.42 to $0.46, and we expect GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be $0.03 to $0.07.
Now let's open it up for questions."

For '17, obviously, we're biased towards share repurchases. And '17, we've committed another $3 billion. So I think we'll continue to work the disciplined ROI-based approach. It's working well for us so far, and we'll continue to operate within that framework in '17."

Could you speak about how visibility has changed as we've gone through 2016, whether there has been any major change? And then just one thing that's linked to that. There was a period of time when your storage business was gaining share, and on top of that, your networking business was benefiting, not only with Aruba but also because Aruba was driving revenue synergy with switching. Has that now fully played out? Or should that growth there return at some point?"
273983758,408982995,1091245,"Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 22, 2016",2016-11-22,"Earnings Calls","Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company","Executives","Yes. Let me talk about the decline in the growth rates in the last 2 quarters, and particularly, Q4. But I would say, when you look at the full year, the company grew 2%; and Enterprise Group, obviously, which is going to be the anchor of the go-forward H",640,"Yes. Let me talk about the decline in the growth rates in the last 2 quarters, and particularly, Q4. But I would say, when you look at the full year, the company grew 2%; and Enterprise Group, obviously, which is going to be the anchor of the go-forward Hewlett Packard Enterprise, grew 3% for the year. But I think, as FY '16 demonstrated, that there are challenges balancing revenue and margins in EG. And now we are going to be focused on growing overall operating profit dollars. So as you know, in the first half, we delivered great growth. And then the second half -- well, we delivered great growth, but the margins were lower than we would have liked. In the second half, we pivoted back more towards margins, focusing on the profitable deals and improving our cost structure that resulted in a quarter-over-quarter margin improvement of 90 basis points in Q3 and another 60 basis points in Q4, but revenue slowed to flat in Q3 and was down 3% in Q4. So we really have -- we've spent some time titrating, if you will, the balance between revenue growth and profitability.
And so now as I look at 2017, I think we can grow revenue and operating margins at the same time going forward, and let me tell you why I think that. First is we need to shore up core ISS rack with improvements in the channel, improvements in quote-to-cash and focus -- more focus on the distributors and VARs for the volume-related ISS rack business. Second, we've got to continue to invest in the higher-growth businesses, which are doing pretty well. High-performance compute with SGI, 3PAR all-flash, Aruba, Synergy, the HC 380. And those offerings are actually growing nicely and are accretive to the overall Enterprise Group margin. Third, and this is one of those unintended great consequences of the separation of ES from the Hewlett Packard remaining company, is that alliances with former ES competitors like Accenture, PwC, the Indian outsourcers, they no longer view us as a competitor, and we are being integrated into a lot of their offerings that we were never integrated in before. And it's been fascinating to me how much more traction, I think, we're going to get with those alliance partners. And then, fourth, we're enhancing our go-to-market with a new focus on Tier 2 and Tier 3 that offer better growth at a higher margin. And then, finally, as you noted in the quarter, TS has returned to growth, and this is important because of the margins in TS. Everyone knows how margin-rich TS is, so even a slight return to growth in TS actually helps mitigate margin pressure in ISS rack. And then, lastly, we're continuing to optimize our cost structure, a flatter and leaner organization with lower G&A spend, tighter alignment of R&D spend to the market opportunities, and then a further improvement in our go-to-market model. So listen, we sort of titrated a bit during the year. First half was faster growth, lower margin; second half of the year was lower growth, higher margin. And now, we've got to drive down the middle of the highway for next year, and as I outlined, I think there's real good reasons to think that's going to be the case. With regard to networking, Aruba actually is doing really well. It was a little slower growth this quarter because a big implementation moved into Q4. It is still driving campus switching. And then, of course, now we are a reseller of Aruba -- I mean, of Arista, and so those revenues will fall in our P&L, and the margin that we make selling Arista will actually be margin-accretive to the overall EG group. So that's why I'm optimistic about revenue growth and operating margin in EG in 2017."

I suppose a cynic could say your comps were pretty easy in the first half of '16, and so you were able to grow EG. And your comps became more difficult in the second half, and you weren't able to grow, and the bad news is the comps are even tougher for the next couple of quarters for EG. And I can't help noting that your characterization of the server market is much more cautious than it was a couple of quarters ago. I think you characterized it as seeing ongoing pressure in core servers and talking about hyper converged being lower margins and lower support attach. And so it feels as though, perhaps, the market is getting tougher when you adjust for comps. I'm not sure the performance was -- and for TS, I'm not really sure the performance was much better in the second half. So I was wondering if you could characterize what you think the status of the server market is going forward and what you think is a realistic market growth rate on a go-forward basis, and whether my characteristic of your having a different opinion of that now versus 6 months ago is fair."

I would say, when you look at the market, I -- and we did say, by the way, we thought it was going to get tougher in the second half. The main pressure we're seeing is in ISS rack. A little bit in blades, but frankly, we're going to recover in blades because of Synergy. But ISS rack is where the most ongoing pressure is. Hyper converged is actually growing and is higher margin than our core ISS product, as is Synergy, as is high-performance compute, as is mission-critical systems and, of course, as is TS. So the main area that we've got to work on is shoring up that ISS rack, and that's all volume-based, and it's all through the channel. So disties [ph], VARs, that's things like our newly redone value-added reseller program and our ability to do quote-to-cash fast and our ability to fulfill faster than our competitors. So I would say that if we can shore up ISS rack, then I'm confident in the growth rates of these other businesses that we're now gaining real traction in. So there's weakness in ISS rack. I think we are not executing as well as we could, and we aim to fix that."

It was primarily driven through working capital improvements. And to your point about sustainability, we do think it's sustainable, because when you look at the improvements we've made in '16, in general, it's really around 3 areas. So if you look at AP, for example, we went out in 2016 and we hit up all of our suppliers and extended our payment terms. So those terms should hold through 2017. And they came in, in the fourth quarter a little bit better -- the improvement came in a little bit better than we had anticipated. If you look at AR, we really spent a lot of time this year improving our processes, improving our line of sight around past dues, as an example. So we've cut our past dues from, call it, 10% down to 5%. And again, those are sustainable as you think about going into 2017, assuming we execute. And then even in inventory, inventory levels were lower than we had anticipated in Q4. Again, similar to AR, we put in some tighter reporting, improved accountability, particularly around buffer stocking and our key commodities. So we have plans in place, and more important, I think we have better visibility and accountability to execute. So we would anticipate those to hold in 2017. The only thing I would say about 2017 is we don't guide cash flow on a quarterly basis. But just keep in mind, if you are looking at CCC, there tends to be a seasonal uplift from Q4 to Q1, and that's primarily driven by purchasing linearity. But overall, we feel comfortable with our guide in '17."

And the introduction, we're introducing new deduplication technology that should provide some further uplift in all-flash arrays, because that's been a gap in our portfolio.

And I've basically said to the team, listen, we do not want to be doing negative deals here, for the most part. What's the point in selling things at a loss? And so we really want to make sure that we make money on these deals, and profitable deals in Cloudline is more important than market share. That said, Cloudline, particularly relevant, not only in Tier 1 but Tier 2 and Tier 3. The profit margins are better in Tier 2 and Tier 3. So I think Cloudline has a bright future in 2017, especially as we do a better job of penetrating Tier 2 and Tier 3, which is -- the sales force is all focused on. But frankly, there's not a big sales force component to those deals. The sales force gets the leads, and then it's turned over to an engineering sale, so it has lower FSC associated with it.

But to your point, as you look -- I mean, the currency environment has definitely been volatile in the last few weeks, and to your point, when you look at sort of where the rates are today versus where we guided, call it, mid-October, some of the rates are unfavorable. For example, if you look at the euro, the euro was at $1.10, and now it's probably at $1.06, $1.07, something like that. So given our global footprint, that does put some pressure on the operations now. Having said that, it's very early in the year, and we do have some hedging programs in place. So we didn't feel it was prudent at this stage to adjust our guide. And then, in addition to that, the teams are being very proactive and very aggressive around the cost structure.

And that was after 10 years where currency was the wind that most businesses back. And 3 or 4 years ago, that changed, and it changed hard. So we have completely internalized that we have to have a cost structure that allows us to win in a challenging foreign exchange environment. And so that's why we've taken the cost out of the company that we have. That is why we're making sure that there are virtually no stranded costs left at Hewlett Packard Enterprise after Software goes and ES goes. I mean, we basically, by the end of this fiscal year, will have no stranded costs at all relative to these 2 big divestitures, which, for a company our size and scale, is a pretty big achievement. Because one of the things I think we've come to realize is the overhead structure that was required to knit together the old HP and then Hewlett Packard Enterprise is -- was a pretty high overhead structure because of the diversity of the businesses. We ought to be able to run much leaner and meaner and we anticipate exiting the year at a much lower overhead as a percentage of revenue than we have in the past."

We like the -- we like our strategy of getting smaller and more focused, while they're still integrating a very large acquisition. And Lenovo, we intercepted a huge amount of server volume in the move from IBM to Lenovo, and we haven't seen them pop back yet. I don't ever count Lenovo out, okay? So they may be just about ready to get up off the mat here, but we'll see in the next 6 to 18 months. And then, we're actually seeing some Huawei pressure in Latin America and a little bit in Europe, not in the United States, a little bit in Europe, quite a bit in Latin America, and we're trying to basically make sure that -- my view is it's easier to hold share than to gain it back, and so we're making some investments in areas that they're trying to make inroads into so that they don't create a profit pool from which they can leap to another country. I think one of the advantages, Shannon, of the separation is -- people used to ask me who is my list of competitors, and there would be 20 people on that list. This is a much smaller group of competitors, including the public cloud competitors to some degree, and we can be much were laser-like focused, and in the volume business react very quickly from a pricing perspective, from a VAR perspective, probably much more quickly than we could have before, and that actually helps us as we think about pricing in a particular region or a particular product line."

So listen, as I said before, what we're seeing is, in the core ISS business, there's some deterioration, what I would characterize as core ISS rack for us. Other parts of the server business are doing really well. And I think that core ISS rack deterioration has a number of different things. One is, in part, our execution in the channel and pricing and things like that, and the second is the move to the public cloud. I mean, we're definitely seeing some impact there, offset by growth in other areas. From a 1% to 2% range, my view is, from our perspective, that's a revenue number and longer term. And remember, our revenues are holding up better than the units because of our high attach and then also the features and functionality that we add on to those servers, whether that's storage or whatever it happens to be. So again, we look at -- when we look at unit share, we look at revenue share and we also look at share of profits. And we are gaining share of profits in this business, which is actually really important. So that's kind of the way we think about it. So I think, actually, 1% to 2% feels pretty reasonable to me. We've got some work to shore up that ISS rack, but I think well offset by some of the other things that are really going well from an innovation perspective."
